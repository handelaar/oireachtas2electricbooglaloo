      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the names of the medical practitioners on the general panel from which persons are selected by the Local Appointments Commissioners to act on selection boards; and also the number of occasions upon which, and the number of appointments in respect of which, each of them has acted on a selection board during the year ended 31st December, 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question by the Deputy on the 6th March, membership of an interview board is honorary and it is not desirable to furnish the names of those who have given their services for this purpose on the explicit understanding that all dealings between them and the commissioners shall be strictly confidential. The Deputy will appreciate that, for the same reason, it would be undesirable to publish the names of the medical practitioners on the general panel from which persons are selected to act on interview boards. I cannot, therefore, give the Deputy the names.  I have here, however, some information, in statistical form, which may meet his requirements. The information is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 150 medical men on the panel.  During the period referred to by the Deputy 51 of these acted on boards; 16 others were invited, on at least one occasion, to act, but were unable to do so.  Of the 51 who acted, 36 acted on one occasion only, 14 acted on two occasions only and one acted on four occasions.  On <Col N="1750" /> these occasions the number of appointments dealt with by the board varied from one to eight.  Of the total number of appointments dealt with during the period, the number of medical appointments was 52.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of referring to a point raised by Deputy Dillon in supplementary questions following my reply to Deputy Mulcahy on the 6th March.  Deputy Dillon, apparently, had in mind the practice whereby the Local Appointments Commissioners on some occasions ask one interview board to deal with a number of posts.  This arises particularly in the case of dispensary medical officerships.  I have made inquiries in this matter and I find that the position is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In ordinary circumstances, a separate board would be set up for each post to be filled.  It happens fairly often, however, that there is a number of vacancies to be filled at the same time and that an appreciable number of candidates have applied for more than one of the vacant posts.  In such a case it is the practice of the commissioners to constitute one board to deal with all of the vacancies, because if the positions were dealt with separately many of the candidates would be involved in the expense and inconvenience of a corresponding number of journeys to Dublin or elsewhere for interview. Moreover, the difficulties of finding suitable persons who are able and willing to act on boards&mdash;difficulties which are already considerable&mdash;would be greatly increased.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that there is no difference, so far as the principles or methods of selection are concerned, between the case in which one position only is being dealt with by a board and that in which a number of positions is being dealt with at the same time.  In the latter case, the commissioners take each position in turn and decide, on the markings and placings arrived at by the board, which of the candidates who have applied for that position is to be considered for recommendation to the local authority concerned in accordance with the prescribed regulations, and they make their recommendation for each post accordingly. If, in the final order of merit determined <Col N="1751" /> in accordance with the regulations, the same candidate is placed first for more than one post, he is normally given his choice.  There is no essential difference between this procedure and that of setting up a separate board to deal with each vacancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was very interesting, but the Taoiseach will understand that my question asked for the names of the medical practitioners on the general board from which selections are made.  Does he not understand that, if we go into the theory of the matter, the theory is that the general medical profession in the country, by reason of the fact that representatives of theirs are on the selection board, can have a chance of seeing that only the highest standard of qualification will secure a public appointment to a medical officership? Will the Taoiseach say what good reason there can be why the 150 medical practitioners in the country who give their services in this way would refuse to allow their names to be made known to the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that in the past they have been very anxious that all dealings, names, and so on, would not be communicated.  For instance, if there is a post advertised, any person on the panel may be a possible member of the selection board; and it is possible that people would be coming along trying to canvass them, and bringing pressure of one kind or another and subjecting them to a certain amount of annoyance. That is the only reason I can see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that this question is not asking for the names and addresses of special boards, but for the names and addresses of those who in a public-spirited way are prepared to give this service gratis?  Why should they be, as it were, a dark brotherhood?  In the interests of the public service and of public confidence, should not the names of those doctors be known?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to express an opinion on that.  I can <Col N="1752" /> see what the Deputy would like to have and, if it were possible, it might be better to arrange it in that way; but there have been these difficulties which the commissioners have communicated to me.  I could ask the commissioners whether they would consider if it would be possible to have a panel which would be published. At the moment, however, anything done with these panels has been on a confidential basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us feel that, in the public interest, we have to poke at this question until the public do know who the people are in the different professions who are acting in that public-spirited way by advising in regard to the different appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give very careful consideration to that aspect of the question to which he has referred when he says that, even if the panel consisted of so large a number as 150, were the names of these voluntary persons to be published they might be exposed so much to the annoyance of canvassing that the most desirable types of professional men, who are at present prepared to serve anonymously, would decline to serve rather than expose themselves to the perennial approach of interested persons who would seek to secure their favour on the chance that they might be included in a particular panel for a particular appointment, because there will be surgeons, physicians, pathologists and so forth?  One may, therefore, forecast with reasonable probability a limited number of the total of 150 who would be probably called to a particular board owing to the peculiar qualifications which the position to be awarded called for and that would make it possible for canvassing to take place and a great many men in these circumstances would not undertake this extremely onerous task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether, in view of the proceedings of the Food Conference held in London on 3rd April, 1946, he desires to add anything to his statement on food production, made in the Dáil on the 6th March, 1946.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing further which I have to say except to add my exhortations to those of the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that every nerve should be strained to grow this year as much food as possible, particularly cereals and potatoes, and to avoid waste, because we want to conserve what we have and get as much more as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that this particular problem facing us is not merely one concerning our own welfare but is also one of our obligations as part of the community of nations and, to that extent, we should transform this appeal from an official one to being a national appeal, which would secure greater support from our people. Would he not consider the feasibility of convening a conference, representative of all Parties, with the object of enlisting the broadest possible support behind the Government's efforts?  Not only should we direct an appeal to the farmers, but to every citizen, particularly in relation to the prevention of waste, which is on such a large scale at the moment.  In addition, there is the position of personal gifts to be considered.  I urge the Taoiseach to consider the advisability of calling such a conference which, in my opinion, would add immeasurably to the official appeal made by him, by the Minister for Agriculture and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider the desirability of availing of an opportunity in Dáil Éireann to make such a statement as he deems prudent in all the circumstances, so as to enable Deputies to discuss with the Government, in public, the most effective measures this country can take to <Col N="1754" /> relieve the distress in Europe, or wherever else it may be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be the more natural and immediate thing to do.  Certain aspects of the matter will have to be considered at a very early meeting of the Government and, when that is done, we may avail of an opportunity to make a statement here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Liam Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the Turf Development Board recently advertised five vacancies for engineers on their staff; that at least two of those appointed had no Army service; that an applicant with Army service was passed over, though his qualifications were otherwise satisfactory; and if he will instruct the Turf Development Board to give priority to ex-Army personnel.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Turf Development Board advertised certain vacancies for engineers, but I have no details as regards the persons interviewed or those appointed.  I am satisfied, however, that the Turf Development Board at all times gives a high measure of preference to candidates who have had service with the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inquire from the Turf Development Board if the statement in question is correct, and, if so, will he instruct them in the future to give preference, in case of an appointment, to Army personnel where the qualifications are equal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Turf Development Board give that preference.  I think the Deputy is misinterpreting the meaning of preference.  Preference does not mean that persons with Army service alone will be considered.  It means that they are given preference over other candidates, but they must have the qualifications required by the board for the proper discharge of their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, and I have no reason to doubt the accuracy <Col N="1755" /> of the information, that in recent appointments one particular person who had similar qualifications to those who were appointed, and who had the additional qualification of being in the Army, was not given any appointment. If that is accurate, then this matter of Army personnel receiving preference is not strictly in accordance with what the Minister has stated.</P>

      <P>The reduced number of coupons has been fixed for the conductor because it is regarded as essential that the conductor, whose duties bring him into immediate contact with the public, should be readily identifiable.</P>
      <P>As uniform suits are issued at intervals of one and a half years and overcoats at intervals of three years, the acquisition of these garments involves an annual surrender of 42 coupons by bus drivers and 11 coupons by bus conductors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to two separate schemes, namely the footwear scheme and the fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>As regards the footwear scheme, a decision regarding extra work undertaken by assistance officers in connection with the scheme was conveyed on the 9th October last to public assistance authorities other than the Dublin Board of Assistance.  The Commissioners for the Dublin Board of Assistance submitted to my department proposals for the payment to assistance officers in Dublin of additional remuneration for the extra work entailed by the operation of the scheme.  The proposals have been examined and have been sanctioned.</P>
      <P>The only public assistance authority which operates a fuel scheme is the Dublin Board of Assistance.  The fuel scheme imposes the duty on the officers of issuing fuel vouchers at 1/- each in the summer period to such of the home assistance recipients as are prepared to purchase the vouchers and such extra work as is involved relates to the collection and accounting of these payments. The operation of the scheme imposes very little work on the officers concerned and, in fact, in the winter their normal work is simplified by the issue of vouchers instead of cash.  In the winter time home assistance includes the fuel voucher for which no charge is made and there is no extra work involved for the issuing officer. Formerly these officers were required to pay a cash allowance for fuel to the home assistance recipients in the winter months.</P>

      <P>The aggregate quantity of wheat purchased from growers by holders of seed (wheat) assemblers' permits during the 1945-46 season was 488,000 barrels.  This was made up of 55,000 barrels of winter varieties and 433,000 barrels of spring varieties.</P>
      <P>Approximately 4,000 barrels of winter varieties and 26,000 barrels of spring varieties were found to be unsuitable for seed following tests for germination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister account for the very substantial quantity that was unsuitable because of low germination?  Is he satisfied that the loss, damage, and deterioration resulted from delay in transport, as well as lack of transport in some districts, and also from delay in conditioning the wheat while it was in a green state in the stores?  Will he say what is proposed to be done, so that better precautions against such loss will be taken during the coming season?</P>

I think the Minister should be prepared to give a full and frank explanation concerning it.  I should like if the Minister could tell us whether quantities of this seed, which were sold at 96/- a barrel, were recalled as being unsuitable for sowing because of low germination.

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in reference to his Department's advertisements in the daily papers of the 30th March, 1946, regarding wheat varieties suitable for sowing, he will state the reasons why &ldquo;Atle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kolben&rdquo; were omitted from the list, in view of the satisfactory <Col N="1762" /> results obtained in the past from sowings made up to mid-April of both varieties; and whether sufficient of the varieties mentioned in the advertisement were available for the considerable area unsown on the 30th March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is a risk that in certain areas wheat of the varieties &ldquo;Atle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kolben&rdquo; would not ripen satisfactorily when sown in April the sowing of these varieties in such areas in that month might result in serious loss to growers and could not, therefore, be generally recommended by my Department.</P>
      <P>There are, however, districts where wheat growers have obtained satisfactory results from sowing &ldquo;Atle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kolben&rdquo; wheat early in April and no doubt farmers in those areas will follow the same practice again this year.  Having regard to this consideration there should be sufficient seed of the later spring varieties to meet requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should an advertisement of that kind be issued by the Department, suggesting to people all over the country that it was not wise to sow &ldquo;Atle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kolben&rdquo; at that date?  I think the general experience of the agricultural community is that they could be sown without any risk whatever, up to the middle of April, and in some cases up to the end of April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise the burden imposed upon merchants, who are seeking to distribute seed and to facilitate the wheat-growing policy, by publishing advertisements of that character in the first week of April?  Is he aware that one firm which had 30,000 barrels of &ldquo;Atle&rdquo; wheat invested in it at 72/6 a barrel, for which they got 60/- when they returned it to the suppliers, who used it as millable wheat?  Does not the Minister think, if it is the intention to publish advertisements of that kind in April, that he ought, at least, to advise distributors that certain varieties would be recommended about the 1st March, and that after the 1st April only certain other varieties would be recommended, so that persons endeavouring <Col N="1763" /> to do their best in the general plan would not be mulcted in the huge sums of money that some merchants were this year?  Will the Minister look into the matter?</P>

I should like to have more information from the Minister, if it is at all possible.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that, because of the discontent amongst agricultural workers at the low rate of wages they receive, there is danger that the work of food production will be adversely affected during the year, especially at harvest time, unless a substantial increase is made in the existing minimum wage rate; and whether he will, therefore, convey to the members of the Agricultural Wages Board the opinion he expressed in Dáil Éireann last week regarding the remuneration and working conditions of these workers so that an improvement may be made immediately in their lot, and thus facilitate the increased production of food, especially having regard to the conditions in Europe at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the responsibility for fixing minimum rates of agricultural wages was, under the Agricultural Wages Acts, entrusted to the Agricultural Wages Board, which will doubtless have regard to all relevant considerations when reviewing the minimum rates at present in force.  Whilst I feel that agricultural <Col N="1765" /> workers should enjoy the best conditions that the agricultural industry can afford I think, as I recently stated in this House, it would be inadvisable for me to interfere with the operation of the wages board which is in touch through its area committees with the views of agricultural workers throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I desire to express my regret and the Commissioner's regret that this incident should have occurred.</P>
      <P>In fairness to everybody concerned I should add that the officer states that the Gárdaí never formed or expressed the opinion that ex-members of the Army were responsible for the robberies under investigation and that they had, in fact, no grounds to justify such a suspicion.  They first interrogated a very large number of local people, and then came to the conclusion&mdash;I think reasonably enough&mdash;that the culprits were probably persons who had only recently taken up residence in, or returned to, the neighbourhood. The ex-Army men were approached as new arrivals in the district, not as ex-Army men.  No question of legal powers arose: the men were asked if they were willing to co-operate and they agreed to do so.</P>

      <P>I have seen the newspaper referred to by the Deputy.  It is impracticable for the Post Office to lay down and enforce definite regulations as to the wages and conditions, etc., of sub-post office assistants, seeing that they are the servants of the subpostmaster, are engaged and paid by him, and are frequently not wholly employed on post office work.  So far as it is possible to do so, however, the conditions of service of sub-post office assistants are enquired into from time to time with the object of ensuring that such conditions are not less favourable than those of shop assistants of about the same standing in the service of good employers in the district.</P>

In this particular case which was reported in the newspapers the other day, it turned out that the girl in question did not receive any monetary compensation for the first period of her employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to deal with the conditions, because the relationship between ourselves and a sub-postmaster is a contractual one. He is entitled to give what he likes to his assistant.  We always try to insist that they pay their assistants on the basis I have stated.  We may not be always able to enforce that or to know beforehand that it is not carried out. The whole position with regard to many post offices in the country has changed considerably.  A great many post offices formerly did a good deal of trade in the way of shopping.  Owing to the change in methods of communications the trade in these shops has practically ceased.  We have to watch the situation constantly in order to readjust the amount that is to be paid. Each case is considered on its merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was expressing regret that, in sub-section <Col N="1778" /> (2) of this section, the Parliamentary Secretary was continuing his policy of directing rather than requesting or advising local authorities.  I regret it particularly in relation to this section because it is the section which appeals most to me.  I think we are likely to get far better results from a well-directed, intelligent educational campaign than we are from any of the drastic sections contained in the Bill, and it appeals to me particularly because it is more directed to the prevention of disease than many of the other sections we have discussed.</P>
      <P>I was saying last night that I should like to see a very intensive educational campaign initiated in the schools, and particularly in the girls' schools.  I believe that if short lectures were given in the schools and if we had a well-directed newspaper campaign, prepared under the guidance of experts in advertising and publicity, not merely for a week or two or for a month or two but continuously, if we had, as we might have, short films demonstrating the necessity of taking ordinary precautions and if children and adults were urged to call in the doctor earlier than is usually the case, we would be going much further to meet this problem than we are by most of the steps we are taking already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school medical inspection scheme, so far as it goes and so far as I know, is an excellent scheme and has certainly good results.  My only objection to it is that it does not meet the situation.  The scheme deals merely with physical defects which are found already existing, and, so far as I know, it is no part of the scheme and no part of the duty of any of the officials operating it to give instruction or lectures to the children on how best to safeguard and preserve their health. It is in the schools that this public health campaign should start, and, unless it starts in the schools and unless the children are taught at an early age how essential it is to take precautions regarding their health from every point of view, and particularly from the point of view of personal cleanliness, hygiene, sanitation and so on, I do not think that any number of Bills of the type of that now before us <Col N="1779" /> will solve the problem.  Further, working along these lines, we are likely, and, I think, almost certain, to get more full and more close co-operation from all the people than we are likely to get by dragooning them.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider favourably acceptance of this amendment. As I said last night, from my knowledge and personal experience as a member of the local authority, any such campaign as I suggest, and as apparently the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind under sub-section (1), would get the fullest and closest co-operation from every local authority. No local authority would jib at any expenditure considered necessary for a well-directed publicity campaign.  I know that one of the difficulties in connection with the schools is that there is already what has been described as an over-loaded programme, but may I suggest that there are very few, if any, items in the school programme at the moment which are as important as the health of the children and of the nation, and I suggest it ought to be made part of the school programme that a teacher or somebody else would give lessons or lectures to the children on matters of public health and so on. So far as I know&mdash;I speak subject to correction in this matter&mdash;nothing of that sort is now being done, or has been done up to this.  Again, I want to make myself perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>So far as I know its operations, I have nothing but praise for the present school medical inspection scheme.  I know that many children have had physical defects attended to and dealt with as a result of that scheme, which otherwise would perhaps never have come under a doctor's care and which might have been allowed to develop to such a point that it might not have been so easy, if it would not have been impossible, to cure them.  What the Parliamentary Secretary wants to make this scheme of his fully effective is the fullest and freest co-operation of the local authorities, and he is more likely to get that if they are allowed to give it voluntarily rather than by direction.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary will not only get the same <Col N="1780" /> results but better results if that co-operation is given by the local authorities at the request or on the advice of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>We appear to be in general agreement that it is desirable to provide for an educational campaign in relation to matters of health and to incorporate in our legislation the necessary statutory powers. The only difference of opinion between us in the matter is as to how these powers ought to be operated.  Deputy Mulcahy complains that the local authority is not allowed to carry out its functions under the section.  I do not think that is an altogether accurate interpretation of the section.  Under sub-section (1), a health authority may disseminate information and advice on matters relating to health by advertisements, notices, pamphlets, lectures, radio, cinema exhibitions or any other means.  Now, that is pretty wide. Sub-section (2) empowers the Minister to direct the health authority as to the manner and extent to which these powers should be exercised.  I submit to the House that, in this matter, direction and guidance is not only useful but is very often necessary.  Deputy Morrissey suggests that we should confine it to advising and, presumably, if our advice is not acted upon, we are to let the matter rest at that.  In general, that may work out all right; the vast majority of our local authorities will act on advice, but there are some who will not and who require a little bit of pressure in the form of direction behind the advice, if the advice is to be made effective.  It is desirable that we should have some uniformity in the educational campaigns we try to inaugurate.  If any substantial number of local authorities declines to carry out these educational campaigns, it makes it ever so much more difficult and it operates to lessen the effectiveness of the campaign of local authorities who do try to act in a spirit of co-operation and good citizenship.  In fact, direction will arise only where advice has not been carried out.  If we can secure <Col N="1781" /> the desired results by advisory methods alone, there will be no need and no disposition to embark on the process of direction.  I fully agree with Deputy Morrissey as to the desirability of having health education&mdash;at any rate elementary hygiene and many minor matters relating to health&mdash;carried out in the schools.  We are looking into that matter to see what can be done about it, but it is undoubtedly a very important matter and one which has not got much attention in the past.</P>
      <P>The only powers that local authorities have at the moment in relation to health education are under the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act, 1908, Section 14.  We are repealing that Act, of course, as we are repealing all the tuberculosis legislation and bringing tuberculosis, as I have said on a number of occasions, into the category of an infectious disease.  Consequently, it has been necessary to replace the power we had in relation to education so far as tuberculosis is concerned. Section 14 of the 1908 Act, sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A sanitary authority may, with the approval of and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the Local Government Board, provide and pay for the delivery of public lectures within their district and for the distribution of pamphlets, notices, and leaflets on subjects relating to tuberculosis, and may, with the like approval and subject to the like conditions, provide any drugs or appliances which would tend to prevent or check the spread of the disease.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All we are doing is expanding that to cover all other infectious diseases as well as tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary puts us into great difficulty.  I object here to the Minister being able to order a local authority to go in for a particular service and a particular type of expenditure.  I object <Col N="1783" /> to it on a number of grounds.  One is that it spoils the sense of responsibility and initiative, that it spoils the particular type of approach by a local authority to a problem that is different in different areas.  The incidence of tuberculosis varies in different areas and, consequently, the approach of mind will be different.  The same applies to some other diseases.  I object generally to Ministerial dictation to public representatives in important matters.  Then, when it is dictation that may be without any financial burden on the State, but the whole of it falling on local authorities, it makes it extremely difficult.  In view of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement on that matter and as a kind of encouragement to us to hope that the incidence of the cost will fall in that way, I withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 79 to 82, inclusive, not moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to suggest a couple of ways in which the information and advice on health matters might be disseminated.  The Parliamentary Secretary might take up with the Minister for Education the possibility of having classes on hygiene for the dissemination of this information through the vocational schools.  You have senior boys and girls there of a certain age and it is quite possible that they would be in a better position to learn than smaller children attending secondary or other schools.  In addition to that, will you not make provision there so that the health authority, whoever they might be, could disseminate this information through some voluntary organisation such as the Red Cross?  They are doing a lot of that at the moment and they might possibly be the best medium for carrying on that propaganda on behalf of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Morrissey, I recommend the Minister to take out the words in Section 2 &ldquo;by Order direct&rdquo;.  You would possibly get from local authorities <Col N="1784" /> more co-operation by carrying them with you than by directing them at every step.  This Bill is putting grave financial burdens on them and, if the Minister would direct them in every step they take, you would probably get their backs up.  It will be admitted that over the past ten or 20 years local authorities were often more keen, and often led the Department in many directions, in the matter of public health.  They were more keen and advanced in their views than the Department were on many matters.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will admit that.  For that reason, nothing should be done to kill initiative.  The successful working of this Bill will depend on the goodwill of the local authorities and the energy that they throw into the administration of it. No matter what the Department may do, if you have not the goodwill and co-operation and drive of the local authorities behind this measure, it will fall very flat.  You can have county medical officers, dispensary doctors and nurses, but they are part of the machine, and if you do not get the drive and initiative behind the machine, and what members of local authorities and nobody else can provide, you will not succeed.  Any Orders that are not necessary should not be made portion of the Bill.</P>

      <P>As this section deals with the dissemination of information and advice on health matters, there seems to be one peculiar omission.  There is no provision for the Department of Health directly disseminating information and advice.  There would seem to be a good deal of propaganda and advertisement in work of that kind which could be done directly by the Department.  In connection with the dissemination of education on this question through the schools, it would seem to me that the Department should take the lead and, by selecting and approving of textbooks on the subject of health and hygiene, they could direct the schools as to the information which should be given to children.  As this is a purely propaganda and information section, it should be not only on a local but also on a national basis.  I am <Col N="1785" /> quite in agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says there should be uniformity.  A lack of uniformity in regard to advice and instruction would be fatal.  I cannot see why there is an omission here on the part of the Department to take direct action, where that is appropriate.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal in the last point, particularly in relation to the dissemination of information by means of the radio.  It would seem anomalous, to my mind, that a local authority should be asked to avail of the radio for the dissemination of advice on health matters that would more properly be within the province of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I also suggest that, in the matter of advertisements, the Department might avail of the advertising space allowed to cinemas under the Cinematograph Act. There is a certain percentage of each programme allotted to advertising and I think the Department would be the appropriate authority to avail of such a facility.  It would have the best results.</P>

I agree with previous speakers who have said that it seems to be a matter for the Department of Public Health.  I think the diffusion of information through the schools is the surest method in the long run, although perhaps it is the slowest method.  I suggest there should be some machinery in this section, or perhaps in another section, for consultation with the Minister for Education concerning lectures for schools.  I think that is the surest method of ensuring what we all would like to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 83:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 85 to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A county authority may, with the consent of the Minister, make arrangements for attendance to the health of expectant mothers and nursing mothers and for the education of such mothers in matters relating to health.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may by Order direct every county authority, every county authority of a particular class or a particular county authority as to the manner in which and the extent to which they are to exercise their powers under this section and a county authority to whom any such direction relates shall comply therewith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that the House will expect a fairly detailed review of the purpose of the new section which it is proposed to insert.  If this new section is adopted, it is proposed to establish a service for expectant and nursing mothers and for children up to 16 years of age.  The existing statutory power in relation to mother and child service will be found in Section 3 (2), paragraph (b) of the Notification of Births (Extension) Act, 1915, and Section 4 of the Child Welfare Act, 1918.  These powers are being repealed.  Under the Act of 1915, which gave statutory authority for the provision of that particular service for mother and child, it was confined to children under five <Col N="1787" /> years of age.  While it was open to local authorities throughout the State to adopt that service, both in urban and rural areas, in actual practice it was only operated in a very limited way, outside the county boroughs, in a few urban areas and in no rural areas. The proposal is that this service will operate throughout the entire State in county boroughs, urban districts and rural districts.  While removing the age limit of five years, and substituting the upper age limit of 16 years, it is proposed that the doctor operating the service will maintain contact with the child, in fact, from the pre-natal period and through the school age period, until 16 years of age, and that he will look after the mother pre-natal, attend at child birth, and during the nursing period.</P>
    <P>In connection with the maternity part of the scheme, it is proposed to engage a whole-time maternity nurse in each district.  Under the scheme, if it comes to be adopted, the expectant mother will be entitled to the free services of a doctor and a nurse.  We have the maternity nursing personnel already in a part-time capacity.  The proposal is that these maternity nurses should become whole-time nurses. Under these proposals, as Deputies realise, the mother and child scheme will merge in the school medical service scheme.  As I mentioned earlier, when this Bill was under discussion, there are some serious defects in the school medical service scheme.  Deputies on the opposite benches have from time to time referred to these defects.  We are all agreed that very good results have accrued from the operation of the school medical scheme, but I think we will also agree, because of the defects in it, that the best results cannot be secured.  The question, therefore, arises and, in fact, arose before these proposals were submitted to the House, as to how best these defects could be remedied.  Within the school medical scheme, as it operates, and as we understand it, it did not seem possible to make the necessary changes to bring about the organised uniform service we have in mind.  Consequently, another method was decided on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> Under the school medical service scheme in operation, notwithstanding the fact that our officers have worked very hard, by reason of the numbers of children to be examined, and the fewness of the school medical officers of health employed, inspections have only been possible at intervals of up to three years.  Clearly we could not have a satisfactory service under these circumstances.  Within three years many changes can occur in the life of a child.  Many children will have passed out of school altogether, and many will have been for some years at school before they come under the supervision of the school medical officer.  In that way, while we have got good results, as I stated more than once already, the experience of our school medical officers is that the defects and the ailments that are discovered at school medical inspections are very often deep rooted and far advanced before they come under medical supervision at all.  Another serious defect in our school medical service arises out of the fact that we have no organised follow-up service. The school medical inspector, at the long interval inspections of children, finds that of the children presenting themselves on that particular date, a very big number requires skilled attention of one kind or another, whether it be dental, family doctor, opthalmic or specialist.  He communicates with the parents and draws their attention to the defects he has found, but again there is continuity in the scheme, and no follow-up to encourage parents to take the necessary steps that are available to them, to have defects that have been brought to light dealt with.</P>
    <P>Apart from the more serious defects, there is another aspect of the school medical service that is unsatisfactory, that is, that quite a number of children suffer from minor defects, the doctor is not brought in at all, and the parents look upon these minor defects as being insignificant.  Very often they are significant but the parents are not always aware of that.  There is no machinery to deal with that under the existing scheme.  Coming around and inspecting every two or three years <Col N="1789" /> does not solve it.  Coming around even every six months does not solve it if there is no direct contact between the school medical inspector and the parents and if there is no service available for the domiciliary treatment of the minor ailments that can be successfully treated at home without having to send the child to hospital.</P>
    <P>These are the main defects of the school medical service scheme.  I have already referred to the defects that exist in the maternity and child welfare scheme or, at least, the statutory limitations on its operation.  It is therefore proposed, as I have said, to merge these two services.  It does not follow, and it is not intended, that the school medical service as such should disappear. The school medical service as we know it&mdash;school medical inspection &mdash;will continue but it will be of a more specialised kind.  The district medical officer who is to be the dispensary doctor will follow up the children and carry out school medical inspections at regular and frequent intervals, if possible spaced about three months apart. He will have a whole-time trained general nurse at his disposal and the defects that can be treated domiciliarily will be treated by the local doctor with the assistance of the nurse who will be the immediate line of communication between the parent and the doctor.  I need not give any lecture on the types of diseases but many of these minor things at any rate can be successfully treated at home under the supervision of the nurse and if the case is not clearing up satisfactorily or quickly the nurse will report to the doctor that he had better come and see the case again and, if more active treatment or more specialised treatment should become necessary, provision will be made to supply it.  This scheme will cost money.  Deputies are not surprised at that.  It is estimated that this scheme will cost in the neighbourhood of £550,000 per year.</P>

The cost of the scheme will be borne as to 50 per cent. by the local authority and 50 per cent. by the State.  The estimate that I have mentioned, in addition to the domiciliary service, includes the cost of dental treatment, ophthalmic treatment, hospital treatment and specialised services, in so far as it is possible to estimate these matters in advance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>They are both on a 50-50 basis, anyhow, but the school medical service will continue.  The school medical service will be more of a specialised service, for this reason, that, having a regular inspection, and having the district medical officer in close touch with the children from birth up to the school-going age, it will not be necessary for the school medical officer to trouble so much about the minor ailments in the future.  In fact, he ought to act, and it is hoped that he will act, more as a specialist to inspect and to advise on selected cases&mdash;throat, nose, eye and ear, and such matters&mdash; that are picked out by the district medical officer for special advice, or special investigation, or, perhaps, tentatively anyhow, for specialised treatment. In that way, having reduced the volume of his work very substantially, his inspections will be more frequent even without increase in staff, because <Col N="1791" /> he will not have to inspect, closely, at any rate, all the children in the school. He will be devoting his attention more to the specialised service, and we hope that for our school medical service in future the officers will have some special qualifications in the matter of nutrition, because we feel that nutrition is a very important matter in relation to the ailments of children.  I want to keep out of technical or scientific discussions.</P>

It may be argued, with some little foundation, I suppose, that the Public Assistance Act in fact makes provision for the treatment of mothers and children who are in poor circumstances. There is no denying that statutory provision exists and it is not for me to suggest, and I do not want to suggest, nor do I think it would be right to suggest, that our dispensary service, taken as a whole, is a bad service.  I think it is a good service, taking it all round.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Labouring under difficulties and with a heritage that is its greatest handicap and, if it were not for that heritage, I think we would get much better results from it.  It certainly has improved out of recognition within the past 20 years.  When I say that, I may also say that it has not improved in the City of Dublin at the same rate as it has improved in the provinces.  There is a special problem in relation to that on which we probably will have to have some discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I have had any responsibility in relation to these matters, and that is a considerable time, the greatest problem that I find in instituting a satisfactory service is not so much in providing for the very poor&mdash;and I am not concerned about the very rich&mdash; but for the general mass of the people; the man who is above the public assistance line and who feels that he would prefer not to accept treatment under that system.  He may be a labouring man with a fairly decent wage.  He may be a small farmer or a reasonably large farmer.  But that middle class, economically speaking, that class between the very poor and the people concerning whom we need not have any anxiety, constitutes a very big element of the community in this country.  As I see it, and I have had a good share of practical experience to guide me apart from administrative experience, the position <Col N="1793" /> has worsened if anything since I was in practice.</P>
    <P>The position is that that large class of the community that desire not to avail of the public assistance code cannot, in fact, provide the full services out of their own resources.  A child gets ill, the father and mother have a consultation about it and they say: &ldquo;It is only a sore throat, it may be all right in a day or two; I think we will wait.  If we bring out the doctor, it will run into a certain amount of money and it may not be necessary.&rdquo; It is not that they are careless about the child, but that they take a chance because the money is scarce.  Deputies on all sides of the House know it is true that very often that delay has fatal consequences.  On the other hand, they may not be in so much doubt about it and they say: &ldquo;We had better bring the doctor out to see the child anyhow.&rdquo;  They bring the doctor out.  But, having brought him out and got his opinion, owing to the fact that they cannot foot a bill that to them might be a substantial bill, though to us it might not be so very big, they will say to the doctor: &ldquo;We will let you know to-morrow or the next day.&rdquo; That case may require close observation for seven or eight days, but the doctor is actually in the position that he cannot bring the best that medical science could provide to bear upon that case because he knows that the people cannot afford to pay a very big bill.  They have a degree of independence that we would all admire and they do not want to be indebted to him.  Whatever the psychology is I could never discover, but the one man who will be paid, if there is any money in the house, is the doctor.</P>
    <P>That constitutes a problem.  I see no other solution for that problem except some such solution as is proposed within the machinery that will be provided here.  It will cost money, but it is worth it.  While the expenditure will be very substantial under this heading, I think it must inevitably bring about a lessening of expenditure under the Public Assistance Act, because the mothers and children who would be entitled to treatment under that Act and who would secure it will <Col N="1794" /> now come under the mother and child service and the State will pay 50 per cent. of the cost of the scheme, whereas, if they remained under the Public Assistance Act, the local authority would pay the whole of it.</P>
    <P>There is just one other aspect of the financial side of it which I should like to mention and that is that the general community would benefit by such a scheme as well as the individuals immediately concerned.  If, in fact, by the operation of a better health service, by detecting disease in the very early stages and by curing many people who would otherwise be invalided for life, we can achieve anything substantial along that line, at any rate we are lessening the burden that the community may have to bear in the future.  That is one aspect of it.  The other aspect of it is that the individual who is above the public assistance line now but who may be unfortunate enough to have sickness about his house will certainly gain under this scheme, because what he will have to pay by way of rates and taxes will be small compared with what it would cost him if he had to bear the full cost of making the necessary provision for his dependents out of his own resources.  His neighbours, who are more fortunate, who have not had illness about their house, will have to contribute towards the general scheme. I do not see anything wrong in that.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about contributory schemes, insurance schemes and all that sort of thing.  This is a contributory scheme.  Every section of the community are to contribute to it.  If they contribute sufficient, regardless of their economic circumstances, to finance the scheme, they are fully entitled to it whether they are above the poverty line or below it.  I do not know whether I have covered all the points the Deputies would expect me to cover.  I have kept the House a pretty long time but it is an important section.</P>

If anybody in this House can suggest to me a better scheme, I will be glad to hear about it.  I may be told that this scheme only applies to a section of the people.  No doubt, but it applies to a very important section.  If the House thinks, or if the Government should decide that a further extension of our medical services is possible within our resources, the scheme before the House now would fit into any service, because it deals with a problem that can be treated as a unit.  I think that any Deputy who feels free to discuss this matter entirely on its merits will agree that it is sound policy, at any rate, to begin to try to build up a healthy population for the future, whatever we may be able to do in relation to the population as we find it at the moment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very unfortunate that a widespread scheme for dealing with the mother and child, which is an important section of the whole of our public medical service scheme, should be launched in this way without any general public discussion of the problem involved in the safeguarding of public health as a whole and security against ill-health as a whole.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself admits the stigma which has to be wiped out in relation to the dispensary system. He admits that there will still remain as part of the scheme in the dispensary <Col N="1796" /> area the public assistance law and the problems which have to be dealt with by public assistance, but he takes the same machinery as deals with these matters and says that the community, as between rates and taxes, must provide through that machinery a service for the entire mother and child population in that area, including the treatment of the child in the school as well.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must have known the psychological problem involved in getting wholeheartedly accepted throughout the country a scheme of that type by the population as a whole.  He has made no attempt to face up to that, to get rid of it or to put the fabric of the health service which should be carried on by the dispensary doctors in a different light. On the other hand, he is introducing a scheme which will practically reduce various parts of the country to the position in which there is no alternative medical person to whom the population there can go for attendance, unless they go out of their district to the nearest town, or, at any rate, travel some distance.  I think he will create medical difficulties for a considerable class of people.</P>
    <P>There is outside the mother and child problem a very big health problem to be dealt with.  The Parliamentary Secretary shows that he appreciates the position in respect of medical expenses of the greater number of our employed people&mdash;those who would be called the middle classes, although I do not know where we are to place, when scheming out a set of adjectives for the various classes in society, the road worker.  The question that arises, to my mind, is whether the road worker is to be a person who is to depend upon the public assistance side of the dispensary system for himself or the grown-up members of his family?  Are we to have the mother and child dealt with by the non-public assistance side of the dispensary doctor's work and the father of a family and the children over 16 years of age by the public assistance side?</P>
    <P>There is a problem of the health of the people outside the mother and child over 16 years, and I suggest to the <Col N="1797" /> Parliamentary Secretary that this does not provide a foundation upon which a general health scheme can be based. If we are to have a general health scheme based for the rest of the community on this particular type of scheme, it will be nothing short of what I call a brass-hat scheme.  It will simply be a dictated medical service with the dictation coming in accordance with the general spirit of the Bill, without any public inquiry, without any technical or professional discussion beforehand, the Bill just being rammed down the throats of the community with the cry: &ldquo;Save the mother and child; save the people from tuberculosis; save the people from the dangers of infection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the way in which to review our problems, and no matter what the Parliamentary Secretary thinks, in sneering at contributory schemes or their proposals, we cannot have a satisfactory system of medical service, a system which will be satisfactory to everybody and full in every way, except upon a contributory basis.  By his proposals here, he is throwing on the rates and on the taxes a very considerable part of the population, and it will make it very difficult to disentangle the finances of such a scheme and to bring about a scheme the cost of which will be satisfied to bear, on the basis of contributions of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I know that contributions to schemes of this kind are in fact taxation, but the very fact that contributions are paid develops a system over the organisation and administration of which the people themselves have control.  The Parliamentary Secretary is forcing an important section of our public services into an absolutely State-controlled scheme of which, except through their public representative speaking here in Parliament and through such spirit of independence as may be left in public representative speaking in local bodies, there will be no direct control or no power of influence over the management. I think the Parliamentary Secretary is making a very great mistake, a very great blunder.  It will be unsatisfactory, and I believe it will be costly, because while you will have under this scheme to maintain a service <Col N="1798" /> capable of dealing with the whole of the population, the whole of the population will not accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can criticise the aims and objects of this scheme, and I must say that I was impressed by what the Parliamentary Secretary said with regard to the problems of bringing a service of this sort to the different sections of the community mentioned.  I was very strongly in agreement with his observations as to the class of the community just above the line of those who are entitled to benefit under the Public Assistance Acts, but I am not quite satisfied that this is the best method of providing a medical service of the sort for the people whom he contemplates.  I am in agreement with him regarding the necessity to provide such a service.  The pride and the independence he has referred to has resulted sometimes in throwing back very serious burdens and responsibilities on families who could not afford it.  Since they were not prepared to seek any benefit from the poor law service, they attempted to shoulder grave financial responsibilities or, as an alternative, they did not seek any medical service at all.  If a service of that sort could be provided for the very substantial section of our people to whom he has referred, it would confer a tremendous benefit on them.  The Parliamentary Secretary suggests that the cost, at over £500,000, would not be very great because, over and above the particular class that would seek service under this particular scheme, a contribution would be made by people who would experience no sickness in any particular year. They would be contributing through the rates to the people who might be unfortunate enough to have to seek medical service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty I see is that the service is to be given by the dispensary doctor. No matter what may be said, a certain amount of stigma attaches to the poor law service in the minds of the people.  Some of them who are still entitled to benefit by such a service are not prepared to look for it.  I am afraid people will scarcely differentiate between the services of a medical <Col N="1799" /> man as a poor law officer and his services as an officer under the public health scheme.  While we are still mixed up in that matter, it is very unsatisfactory.  I am sure the House is anxious to depart altogether from that particular system and, if we are to ensure that those whom we wish to benefit will benefit and will willingly seek the service, the scheme as outlined could scarcely be looked upon as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>As well as that, there is a lot to be said for a scheme on a contributory basis.  The individual who makes a contribution definitely feels that there is no stigma whatever attaching to the scheme and that he is absolutely within his rights, that it is not based on charity, so that he can look forward to benefit from it when the occasion arises.  So far as the administration of the scheme is concerned, I am in agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is the financial side of it that I disagree with.  Notwithstanding the mother and child scheme being in the Public Health Act, the people will mix it up in their minds with the poor law assistance, as the one officer will be working under both Acts.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us there were serious defects in the schools medical service scheme and I am in absolute agreement with him there.  In some counties, the scheme conveys very little benefit, because the inspection is carried out too rarely. Three or four years and more elapse in some cases between inspections.  A great change could occur in the health of a child in that period.  I am glad that we are planning under this scheme to provide regular inspections at shorter periods.  I understand too, from the Parliamentary Secretary, that that will be the responsibility of the local doctor.  The local doctor knows the health history of the families in his dispensary district and will be at an advantage in his inspections.  I understand, too, that the county medical officer will make periodic inspections for dealing with specialised work for which he is particularly qualified.  In that respect, the scheme should be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> However, the ordinary dispensary doctor is a very busy man and I am just wondering how he will find time to carry out all his work.  He may be planning to devote a whole day or a big part of a day to the inspecting of a big school.  How is his ordinary dispensary work to be carried out at the same time?  Is it going to work out as well as the Parliamentary Secretary anticipates?  It means putting on to a very busy man a substantial increase in his work and I wonder how he will find the time to carry out these duties efficiently and effectively, even if it is contemplated that we are going to increase his salary, which is inevitable, I suppose, if we are going to increase the amount of work he has to perform. I would like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary on that aspect of the problem. If we are going to have any benefit from the school medical inspections, they must be done often and regularly.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, in between the present inspections, diseases may have crept in and become deep-rooted, and at present there is no provision for a follow-up to watch the child in the later stages of development.  This new provision will place the family doctor in a very advantageous position.  I have no doubt at all about the advantages of that sort of scheme, but I question whether the dispensary doctors will be able to carry out the work efficiently and carry out the dispensary work at the same time.  When we take into account the cost of this rather elaborate public health scheme, to throw back that burden on the local authority is a very serious matter and it does not seem to me that it is the best method of financing the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said he hoped that certain of the doctors who will deal with this scheme will have special nutrition qualifications.  That is very proper.

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a satisfactory answer.  This clause dealing with mother and child is very welcome but its administration can make it a great success or failure.  If it is to be administered through the poor law system, as we know it in Dublin, it will be a great failure.  There is a certain class in Dublin who, because of their sad circumstances, are compelled to depend upon the poor law system.  In cases of unemployment and illness, it does seem a good work, but there are certain aspects to be considered.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that because of the heritage of that rotten poor law system, and whilst he was satisfied that conditions improved somewhat in the country within the past 20 years, Dublin did not seem to go with the times.  That was an honest and frank statement.  I agree with him.  I have often had cause to find fault with the administration in Dublin, where poor people were thrown half-crowns, sops by way of relief, whereas if there were a scheme like this in operation a man with a family would get an allowance of £1 a week or something reasonable that would help him to save his children.</P>
      <P>Now that the Parliamentary Secretary has admitted that the Dublin poor law system has not gone with the times, I hope he will take the earliest opportunity of improving conditions here.  He should endeavour to take away the pauper taint.  No matter who goes for poor law assistance, he or she comes away with the feeling that that kind of assistance or relief is not acceptable.  People are not inclined to go into a hospital in these circumstances. It is one of the sad things we must accept.  I do not blame the old Dublin citizen, who has a certain pride.  If you tell those people they have to go to the poor law hospital, they tremble with fear.  Of course, I know that in those hospitals they get the best medical and nursing attention, but the taint of the poor law system in Dublin is so rotten that the people the Parliamentary Secretary wants to protect will not go near the institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this scheme will not be worked in Dublin through the poor law system. <Col N="1802" /> We have societies composed of voluntary workers, such as the Infant Aid, Child Welfare, St. John Ambulance, the Red Cross and several Orders, especially in the city.  These people do excellent work.  With great kindness they enter the homes of the poor and give a personal touch.  You know they are not relieving or medical officers coming to examine means and prepared to make the smallest recommendations they can.  I suggest the administration of this scheme in Dublin might be tested for a year or so with voluntary workers.  The Infant Aid Society distributes thousands of bottles of milk and they have 400 or 500 voluntary workers, young girls and others anxious to do all they can.  I would rather see these girls going into the homes than the officials representing the poor law authorities who go there with the idea in their minds that they must cut to the barest minimum what will be given to enable a family to exist.</P>
    <P>I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say that the cost of the scheme will be pretty heavy and he has decided that it will be borne equally by the ratepayers and national funds.  Perhaps I have a bee in my bonnet, but I would like to know what about the Sweepstake millions?  Surely some grant could be given towards this scheme out of the millions accumulated in the Sweepstakes?  Then the poor people would have the feeling that they are not getting charity.  The public have subscribed handsomely towards the Sweepstakes and I suggest a proportion of the money would save the national fund and the ratepayers, to some extent.  I do not want any saving on this clause.  I want the Minister to do the very best he can, but I still think the Sweepstakes millions should come to the rescue in this splendid cause.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said there was no organised follow-up in the school medical services.  I should like to see a follow-up service.  You see girls leaving school without any warning of the dangers that might befall them outside.  They have no education in matters which should have immediate attention in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> We are dealing with the mother and child clause, and I will now touch on a point which, for some time, I hesitated to mention.  I thought I had better not mention it, but I have decided it is well to do so.  I want to know will this clause apply, without any great punishment or any third-degree methods of examination, in the case of the unmarried mother and her child?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary see that there will be no third-degree methods adopted when the unmarried mother seeks aid under this clause?  We who are in public life occasionally hear of sad cases.  A mother and her daughter might visit you, having a sad story to relate.  You would like to know how you could protect that girl and her baby and you are anxious to know whether the baby will get a name, will it be adopted, and what will be the method of adoption of the child so as to give the mother another chance.  All these things must be dealt with sooner or later in the Dáil. They are things which we are all avoiding. We are afraid to mention them. I was a little bit nervous about mentioning it myself.  I heard within the last three or four months the sad story of a Dublin family.  The father is highly respectable, a good-class workman, who nearly lost his mind when he learned his daughter was in trouble.  What of the wife of that workman, with her daughter in that state?  What is she to do in these circumstances? Surely she is not to be hounded down by officialdom.  I ask the Minister to make provision for such cases so that they may get a chance under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree as to the outstanding necessity of a measure of this kind being incorporated in the public health code.  The Parliamentary Secretary outlined the scheme and told us what it proposes to do.  I propose to deal with the cost of it.  I gathered that the existing dispensary doctors will be the pivot of the whole scheme <Col N="1804" /> to deal with mother and child.  The work of dispensary doctors in future will come under the Public Health Act and, in that respect, I want to call attention to the problem that is going to be created in dispensary districts. As far as I can estimate, there are between 9,000 and 17,000 inhabitants in dispensary districts in rural areas.  If we take the average at 12,000 inhabitants, almost half of them would be mothers and children under 16 years of age.  If there are some 6,000 persons to be attended to in the average dispensary area, that means that 50 per cent. of the local population are going to receive free medical attention for all ailments.  The dispensary doctor will also be expected to attend at the schools about once a quarter to inspect the children and, if necessary, to recommend that they should receive treatment by a specialist.  He may treat them himself and then get the public health nurse to give further treatment and visit them.  With the best will in the world I am afraid that the scheme will not work with dispensary doctors.  I do not know anybody who works as hard as dispensary doctors.  They are part-time officials, but they are liable to be called out at any hour of the day or night.  They have to attend all cases coming under public assistance.  They have also to attend private patients, as otherwise they could not carry on.  In my opinion the extra duties involved under this Bill means that their work will be doubled or trebled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to provide this service, it is certain that a full demand will be made on it by mothers and children. I cannot see how dispensary doctors could possibly do the work that the Parliamentary Secretary hopes they will do in future.  Beyond doubt, dispensary doctors are the proper persons to operate the public health services in their districts, but I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, in addition to bringing 50 per cent. of the community under these services he should bring the other 50 per cent. under the public assistance code.  How could a dispensary doctor go into anybody's house to treat children under the Public Health Act and then have <Col N="1805" /> to treat other members of the family as private patients?  That is the difficulty that I see.  I cannot see how it could work.  The doctors are to have at their disposal whole-time fully-trained nurses and, in addition, whole-time maternity nurses.  In future there will be two whole-time nurses in each dispensary district.  That will take some of the burden off the doctors, but I doubt if that will be sufficient to enable them to carry out what is expected under this section.</P>
    <P>In addition, I cannot see how a dispensary doctor can do without a clerical assistant to make out reports after his examination of children and for the information of the county medical officer of health.  A full-time clerical assistant would almost be needed in order to deal with reports on behalf of the doctor if the scheme is to be effective.  I see a further snag in the proposal.  If we are to take it that mothers will be encouraged to go to a doctor for pre-natal treatment, the existing poor law dispensary will have to be used.  There is no other place available at which a doctor could meet patients.  I am sorry to say that from my knowledge of a number of dispensaries they need renovation, and rebuilding. In some cases new dispensaries are required.  I wonder has the Parliamentary Secretary taken into consideration the necessity of providing in rural areas new dispensaries or public health clinics.</P>

      <P>The scheme is an admirable one, with which I am sure every section in the House agrees, but I do not know if it will be possible to operate it side by side with the public assistance code.  I suggest to the Parliamentary <Col N="1806" /> Secretary that he should go further, and at this stage, seeing that 50 per cent of the community will be under the public health service, he should take his courage in his hands and do away with the public assistance code as it affects medical treatment. We can have public assistance in other directions, for home assistance, for example, but I think we should have reached the stage when public assistance in respect of medical treatment for all sections of the community should cease to exist and that in future, district doctors should be public health doctors only and that in respect of medical treatment public assistance should not be available or necessary for anyone.  I do not see how a doctor could operate it, say, having one patient as a public health patient and, in the same house, a public assistance patient and, perhaps, a private patient. That would raise all kinds of difficulties.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary took into consideration the fact that it would be necessary to provide a fairly substantial increase in the staff of local health authorities.  It would probably require from six to 12 additional officials in county council offices to operate this scheme.  Did the Parliamentary Secretary take that into consideration in estimating the £550,000?  I want further to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and, through him, to the Government, that the cost of this scheme will be very serious for the community.  Section 34 of this Bill makes it mandatory on the local authority to provide the total cost of maintenance.  Under that section there is a very serious impost on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not, but I want to point out that Section 34 already imposes a direct burden on the local authorities which the Parliamentary Secretary says will not be recouped to them in any way.  Fifty per cent. of the cost of this scheme, coming on top of that burden, will probably be more than local ratepayers can afford to pay. The local ratepayer, in the first instance, is going to be charged as a <Col N="1807" /> taxpayer 50 per cent. of the cost and, as a local ratepayer, he is going to be charged the remaining 50 per cent. Very many people will escape.  It is curious to relate that very many people are neither taxpayers nor ratepayers.</P>

      <P>Yes, some of them do. We know that quite well, but the ratepayer is going to contribute very seriously.  All taxpayers may not be ratepayers.  Remember that.  A very big proportion of them are not ratepayers. Particularly, they are not ratepayers who have to eke out an <Col N="1808" /> existence on the land.  I want seriously to criticise the proposals in this, from the point of view of the local ratepayers, and I suggest to the House that the financing of this section is going to place a very serious burden on the backs of the local ratepayers. It is an admirable section.  It will be welcomed by all sections of the community and it will be operated, I am sure, by all sections of the community, but I want to point out again that I do not believe that it is possible to operate it partly as a public health measure while having a public assistance code in operation side by side with it.  If the Parliamentary Secretary, who has practical experience of these matters, visualises a dispensary doctor trying to operate it, while trying to do his ordinary work as a dispensary doctor under the public assistance code and operating child welfare, school medical inspection, maternity schemes, etc., at the same time, he will realise that it cannot be done.  To operate this scheme you would require at least twice the number of dispensary doctors that you have and you would need to reduce the dispensary areas.  Instead of costing what the Parliamentary Secretary estimates it to cost, £550,000, he will find before it has been very many years in operation that it will cost £1,000,000 or near it.  At the same time, it is an admirable scheme and I am sure once it is started we will find we cannot do without it.  I welcome the scheme.  I criticise the financial proposals, and I draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the fact that I do not believe it is feasible from the point of view of having the dispensary doctor operating it, and continuing his present work, while the public assistance code is in operation.</P>

Dr. Dignan says in his report&mdash;and it is applicable to this particular service&mdash;</P>

The change of name shows the authorities realised a change was necessary, but a mere change of name does not change the nature and character of the services rendered.  The whole poor law legislation, the Medical Charities Act and similar legislation, should be blotted out from the Statute Book and &mdash;from our memories.  The system is tainted at its root and it reeks now, as it did when introduced, of destitution, pauperism and degradation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in this section is seeking to implant upon that rotten system which the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan condemned, a new service, a service which is of a very far reaching nature and the financial implications of which can only be vaguely guessed at.  The Parliamentary Secretary in introducing this amendment to the House and appealing for our support drew attention to a very deserving section of the community, the people just above the line of poverty, who are not covered by the existing home assistance and medical charities laws, and he dwelt on the sufferings and the hardships of such people by reason of the fact that because of the limitation of their means they are unable to avail of medical aid in time.  But the Parliamentary Secretary overlooked the fact that, notwithstanding that this service which he is proposing is comprehensive, it still leaves out quite a number of deserving people.  Only a few weeks <Col N="1810" /> ago there was brought to my notice a case of a widow with a large family, some of whom are very young.  She was the owner of a small farm.  She could not avail of free medical attention.  She was told by her doctor that she would have to have an operation.  She put it off because of her means and, as a result, she died.  A somewhat similar case only came to my notice last week of a small farmer, a hard working industrious man, who had reared his family well and had reached the age of 70 years.  A couple of years ago he was told that he should have an operation, not a very serious one.  He found that his limited means debarred him from obeying that medical instruction and, as a result, he has been very seriously ill.  His life may be saved but, if it is, it will be only as a result of good medical attention and specialist treatment. Such cases are not covered by this service.</P>
    <P>When we have gone so far, the question is naturally asked by Deputy Allen, why we should not have gone the whole way.  I think it would be impossible, or undesirable, to go the whole way on the basis on which we have started out.  We should have introduced something entirely new, something entirely separated and cutoff from the poor law system.  We should have introduced something such as His Lordship the Bishop of Clonfert advocated, some system under which people would contribute and as a result of which they would receive free medical and institutional treatment without having to bear the stain or stigma of being a burden on the rates, which has always been looked upon, particularly by the independent, respectable farming community, as a deep slur.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Allen, I can see great dangers in this new system.  It is a system which requires very careful attention.  It is right, perhaps, that doctors and the public medical service should be made available to mothers and children.  There is, however, a danger in this that we may be turning the doctor into a Government official. We may be taking him away to a great extent from the ordinary work of his <Col N="1811" /> profession and making him a clerk.  He will have to keep a lot of records, fill a lot of forms, and comply with an enormous number of regulations, having upon his shoulders the responsibility for all the mothers and children in his area.  I think it is implied in this new section that he will have to keep records of such people in his area, of their condition of health, their medical history, etc.  There is a lot of involved clerical work attached to such a service.</P>
    <P>There is also another feature that just strikes me, that the people who are to benefit by this new service will not have what they would have under private medical practice; they will not have a choice of doctors.  Having gone as far as you have gone, there ought to be some system by which the person benefiting may be able to make a choice, to a limited extent at any rate, in regard to the medical officer who is to attend him.  I think there is some such provision in the legislation proposed in Great Britain.  I think it is foolish to rush into such a measure as this without considering it from every conceivable angle and realising the dangers and the difficulties associated with it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may tell us that there is no stain or stigma attached to obtaining medical attention at the expense of the rates.  I do not think that that point of view will be accepted by the majority of the people.  He may say, perhaps, that the same stigma or stain might be attached to obtaining medical attention under such a scheme as the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan advocated.  But the two systems are altogether different. Under one you have a direct tax secured from all sections of the people for various purposes.  As originally intended, it was mainly for the relief of the destitute.  The feeling will be associated always with receiving money from such a source that it carries the stigma of destitution.  On the other hand, if we had a contributory scheme, even if the State did contribute portion of the cost, the person benefiting could hold up his head and feel that he was <Col N="1812" /> simply obtaining a service for which he had paid, a service which he had insured himself to obtain.  There is need also to dwell, as I think Deputy Allen sought to dwell to some extent, upon the inequality and iniquity of the present system of rating.  If you are to have a service of this kind based on direct taxation, it should be based upon a system of direct taxation that is fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>There is another point which arises also: what will be the position of those district nurses under the Lady Dudley nursing scheme who have rendered such a service in the past?  Will they be superseded and thrust aside, or will the valuable experience which they have gained in administering a service somewhat similar to this in the past be availed of to the fullest extent? Voluntary co-operation and help, from whatever source it can be obtained, is absolutely essential to make a service of this kind a complete success.  For that reason, I think it was foolish for the Parliamentary Secretary to discard, and I think in a rather insulting and offensive way, the advice and help that was offered by the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan and, instead, try to initiate something which is not as good by any means and which is open to very serious objections from many points of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear, to my mind, that the duties to be imposed upon the dispensary medical officer under the Bill will be so onerous that he will find it impossible to carry out his public duties under the Public Assistance Acts and this public health measure when it becomes law; but what is to become of his private practice? If he happens to be a very busy medical officer, he may also happen to be a very busy private practitioner. To what extent is he to be compensated if he must neglect his private practice in order to devote virtually his whole time to the duties now imposed upon him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can see, the entire position of the dispensary medical officer is now being altered fundamentally. Formerly, he was a part-time official and he was there for a life-time, being almost irremovable <Col N="1813" /> from office, except in case of grave neglect or misconduct.  Now, by virute of this measure and the 1941 Act, he finds himself converted into a whole-time State servant, and not only a medical servant, but to a large extent a civil servant, because a large part of his duties under these measures will be the recording and indexing of all these cases and the furnishing of various statistics to the Custom House.</P>
    <P>I can see a position in which this machinery will break down, unless he is adequately compensated for his extra duties, or the loss of private practice, or, unless, as Deputy Allen has suggested, additional dispensary medical officers are appointed.  In fact, if the figures quoted by Deputy Allen are anywhere near the mark&mdash;I am not in a position to judge them&mdash;additional dispensary medical officers will be absolutely essential for the effective operation of the Act.  That aspect of this Bill leaves us in considerable doubt as to the financial effect of this measure upon the State and upon the community, and it was quite refreshing to hear Deputy Allen completely converted to the viewpoint expressed from these benches during the past fortnight.  If we achieved nothing else, we certainly achieved a very desirable result in converting one member of the Government Party to our viewpoint on the financial aspects of the measure.</P>
    <P>I do not want to reiterate what has been said already on this matter, but the provision we are now making is really an extension of the old poor law provision relating to mothers and children up to five years of age, and there is a danger that the stigma&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It probably would be a very difficult matter to work out on a voluntary basis, but there should be some voluntary link left.  At least the expectant mother should have the right to choose her own medical adviser, if she has not got one, or to continue to have the assistance of her own private medical adviser rather than be compelled to bring in another doctor in whom she may have no confidence.</P>

I want to make the point that if the mother seeks to exercise a choice she should have the right to choose whatever medical officer she will bring in.  If an outside medical adviser, an adviser other than the dispensary medical officer, is brought in, let him be paid his fee.  Let a scale of fees be drawn up.  The effect of all these measures at the moment is that the medical profession will be reduced to a State service, and so many people will be getting free treatment of one kind or another that private practice will cease to exist, so that future generations of medical men here will have nothing to look forward to but an appointment in the State medical service where they must always obey the behests of the Custom House, or find themselves removed from office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extremely difficult to know what we are debating. The Parliamentary Secretary has put down two amendments, one dealing with expectant and nursing mothers and the other with children.  He made a speech which was somewhat analogous to a Second Reading speech as if these two new sections were the principles embodied in the Bill, and he gave the House an outline of what was intended to be done under this scheme, the scheme which was welcomed by Deputy Allen of his own Party with open arms but with closed pockets.  There is no use in a Deputy like Deputy Allen saying that all sections of the community will welcome this scheme, but will not pay for it. There is no use in paying lip service to the scheme unless the full effects and significance of what is being done are adverted to and the full cost which the scheme will involve appreciated.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that, taking these two new sections which the Minister proposes to insert, they will give the Department a blank cheque to do anything it likes regarding their subject matter.  He gave an outline of what was proposed and spoke of the scheme being carried out through the machinery of the dispensary medical officer.  He spoke of the assistance which would be given by nurses and of the defects of the old system, which did not provide for what he called a follow-up after the medical officer had inspected the children in the schools.  He spoke of the defects of the old system, which involved delay, in periodic inspections, perhaps every three years.  I have searched through the two new sections to find where he got the machinery.  I thought I had misread the section.  All that is in it is empowering the local authority to arrange for attendance to the health of expectant mothers, nursing mothers and children and to arrange for the holding of medical inspections of children in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operative word is &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo;<Col N="1817" /> and, as far as I can gather, that appears to be interpreted as giving the local authority on paper&mdash;in fact, the Department&mdash;power to do anything.  It really is enabling the Minister to direct the local authority what they are to do.  The word &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo; appears to be the operative word.  If there is to be a power granted, either to the local authority&mdash;or, in the guise of empowering a local authority, really to the Department&mdash;to formulate a scheme of this kind, that scheme ought to be set out in the Bill we are debating. The House should have some knowledge of how it is to be done and what the cost of it will be.  As it stands at the moment, the Parliamentary Secretary has merely told the House what the intention is in reference to the powers contained here if they are granted; and all that is supposed to be comprehended in the word &ldquo;arrange ments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was further struck when the Parliamentary Secretary in answer to Deputy Coogan, said that it was not compulsory for anybody to submit themselves to the powers which are to be exercised in accordance with the arrangements, if those schemes are to be carried into effect.  Deputy Coogan asked if the expectant mother who was able to afford it was entitled to have her own medical attendant and the Parliamentary Secretary appeared emphatically to state she was.  But I have an amendment down providing that nothing in this section&mdash;or the section which replaces this section&mdash; shall authorise the compulsory attendance of school children for medical inspection.  I take it that that is unnecessary now, as if the Parliamentary Secretary is right in what he said to Deputy Coogan and mothers are not bound to attend under this scheme for attention, similarly children under a precisely similar provision in the next section for the carrying out of inspection in schools, need not attend if they do not wish to do so.  I would like to know if I am correct in that.</P>

      <P>I thought I was not, <Col N="1818" /> as a subsequent section, Section 87, provides that it is essential for school children to attend.  There is compulsion. How it can be, in two similarly drafted sections with the same language, that in one section it is not necessary for the mothers to attend and in the other it is necessary for the children to attend, passes my comprehension. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary misled himself into two facile a reply to Deputy Coogan.  I do not understand why it should be necessary, under a loosely drafted section of this kind, to give the wide and extensive powers which, apparently, he claims he will have under these sections.  They should be set out specifically, so that some scheme may be available for examination, and that it may not be of a character which may vary from day to day or from Minister to Minister. There should be some specific statement of the scheme with which these sections are supposed to deal. We are supposed to regard these sections as introducing some sort of greatly longed for social reform. Frankly, I do not know what scheme is embodied in this at all.  Arrangements are to be made and the Minister is to say what the extent of them shall be and the manner in which they are to be carried out by the local authority. That is the sum and substance of the two sections.  There is nothing to show what can or cannot be embodied in the word &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo;.  I think the sections are entirely misleading and should be more specifically drafted.</P>

      <P>No one welcomes this whole measure, and particularly the sections under discussion, so much as the teachers throughout the country. They have had experience of the beneficial effects and results of school inspections.  I myself have seen visiting doctors spot weaknesses in children and diseases that were quite unexpected. Very often, when they came for the purpose of mere inoculation, they found other serious things and prevented many a tragedy, to my own knowledge.  That gives us reason to believe that, under the full service designed by this Bill, the health of the people will be safeguarded to a wonderful degree and that the results will be altogether satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the costs entailed by the measure before us.  Some of those references were made by people who were condemning the Government previously for not implementing the Beveridge plan and other plans.  If we implemented the Beveridge plan here, the cost probably would be ten times the cost of this measure.  This whole measure, and particularly these sections dealing with the care of the mother and child, is to my mind, a very big slice of the best part of the Beveridge plan.</P>

Opposition speakers here have warned us against the liberties that may be taken away under this Bill.  When the Opposition were pressing the Beveridge Plan and other plans on us, they did not refer at all to the restrictions on the liberty of the people under such plans.  Under the Beveridge Plan, not only are restrictions placed on sick people, carriers or potential carriers, but also on every healthy man in the country.  There are restrictions on his movements, on his associations and even on the spending of his own earnings. Here there is no restriction, to my mind, except that which is vitally necessary in the interests of the health of the people.</P>

      <Col N="1820" /> Dr. Dignan, at a lecture on social services, given on 12th March, 1945, unfolded his plan and a resolution was passed at the conclusion of that lecture. The Government was challenged, or possibly requested would be a better word, to produce a complete scheme of public health service for the country. Dr. Dignan's plans were found to be impracticable.  I think this Bill is very largely an answer to that challenge, or that request, and it is a matter of great satisfaction to me, anyhow, to find that the mother and child will be well looked after, the child actually before and after birth and right up until a firm foundation of health is established.  I think this whole measure is the very foundation stone of that complete edifice of public service which we intend to build in this country.  I think the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are to be very highly complimented on the production of this Bill.  It is the foundation stone of everything in the nature of public service and the members of this House will, I am sure, see that that stone is well and truly laid.</P>

      <P>This must be a very peculiar day for the Parliamentary Secretary after a fortnight or so having nothing but the pedestrian efforts of his Party to support him.  He has now had two speeches made by his supporters. I wonder whether there has been any discipline, as it were, put on the Party to insist that they should show some more intelligent interest in this great measure of reform in matters relating to public health? These speeches must have produced somewhat mixed feelings in the Parliamentary Secretary.  Deputy Allen welcomes the Bill, but says it will cost far too much and he thinks it will not work.  The other gentleman seems to think that it is a foundation stone. Foundation stones are generally buried.  I wonder would he be glad to see this one out of sight because of the amount of criticism that have been poured upon it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy appears to be annoyed that there is opposition to this Bill. If there had not been as many amendments from this and other sections of <Col N="1821" /> the House, I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary be moved to produce 150 of his own?  The measure would apparently deserve the epithet one of his colleagues put on the document of a certain public man who gave distinguished service in the drawing up of a report&mdash;it apparently would have been a somewhat slovenly measure if it were accepted as it was when it first made its appearance. This measure has been improved because of the fact that certain objections were made to it on an earlier stage.  These got wide publicity and the Department decided that it was necessary to improve the measure in the way in which it has been improved by some of the amendments submitted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen makes the point that this measure will not work, that there will be a break-down as far as certain services are concerned.  He complains that whether it is good or bad, he, as representing the ratepayers, ought not to be asked to put his hand, or the ratepayers' hands, into various pockets in order to provide sufficient for this scheme.  There is a more radical objection still, and that is the one voiced by Deputy Cogan of the Farmers' Party.  That is, that when this scheme works, and even if it is not as expensive as it would seem, and if people will put up the money, it definitely does not go on the basis of the Dignan proposals.</P>
    <P>Long ago it was said by somebody that Christianity had been tried and found wanting, and the answer Chesterton made was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No; Christianity has been found difficult, but it never has been tried.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That phrase can be applied to the Dignan proposals.  They are Christian; they were found difficult and there was an evasion of them.  Now you have this half-baked scheme of socialism. Deputy Coogan pointed out that there is no choice left to the individual. The person who can pay can have his choice of doctor&mdash;that is not going to be taken away from him.  As regards a medical service giving the individual the right to choose the person from whom he will get the medical advice, that clearly is not in this measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1822" /> This measure is another sample of the bureaucratic working of the Government.  The local authority are to be allowed to make arrangements and, after that, there immediately follows the provision that the Minister is, by Order, to direct the extent to which they will use the powers that they may take under the first subsection of each of the two relevant sections.  We know what that means. The Minister will order what these people will do and he will further order them to pay for it, and if they do not strike a sufficient rate, he will sack them and put in somebody who will. That is supposed to be either the Beveridge scheme or the scheme that his Lordship the Bishop of Clonfert put forward.  Of course, it is neither.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputy Butler would intervene in this House when we have schemes like the Beveridge scheme under discussion.  I do not know whether he has read it, but the Beveridge scheme is difficult to understand, lengthy to read and it certainly has not been improved by the hands the English Government laid on it.  If it could be said that this is a substitute for the Bishop of Clonfert's proposals, then the British Government did very much the same with the Beveridge proposals.  The Beveridge scheme was not such an interference with liberty as the present British scheme.  Once the bureaucrats got their hands on it they messed it up; they made it much less of a free scheme than when it came from the author.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to accept as a measure of public service the things set out in amendments Nos. 83 and 84. The local authority are formally given permission to make arrangements.  In the background the Minister says: &ldquo;If you do not make the arrangements, I will tell you what to do.  I will indicate to you the extent to which you are to go.  I will see you work the scheme and further, I will see that the ratepayers pay&rdquo;.</P>

Deputy Allen thinks this scheme will not work.  If it does and when it is all over, the situation will be that if a person is well enough off to pay he can go elsewhere rather than accommodate himself to this so-called arrangement, but if he is not, he will have to take whomsoever is available.</P>

      <P>I am only reading this section, which says that the Minister may, by Order, direct every county authority as to the manner in which and the extent to which they are to exercise their powers.  What does that mean?  It means that the Minister has power to tell the local authorities what they are to do.  Am I saying too much when I say that?  I am afraid the Deputy, before he spoke, possibly did not see there were amendments down, and we are discussing those amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is where I think His Lordship of Clonfert parts company with anyone in this House who speaks in favour of the Bill.  You do not change a thing by giving it a different name.  We have had a good deal of that going on.  We were told that this was not an additional relief service.  Whether so called or not it is so thought, and that thought will continue to attach to the services to be rendered here.  We used to have what was called outdoor relief. It is now called public assistance. There was a thing called emigration. It commenced in the famine years. That is all changed and we have now a passenger movement outwards, according to the statistics.  When you get a passenger movement outwards, and a passenger movement inwards you lose the same number of people under a new name.  It was similar with home assistance. That name was preferred to outdoor relief.  Deputy Butler was afraid of that taint.  The proposal here is fundamentally opposed to that in the scheme of His Lordship of Clonfert. In the early part of his pamphlet His Lordship recognised that the pivotal <Col N="1824" /> point of any community must be found in family life.  He took as the background of the family, people who were wage earners.  He worked out a scheme by which workers would be provided with a wage sufficient to provide for the home, including health, education and something over for the amenities of life, as well as something for what is now regarded as a necessity, a little bit of leisure.  He suggested that health was a thing that the family wage should encompass.</P>
    <P>One of the rights that people should claim is the right to choose and consult their own doctor, as well as the right to choose the services they got from people with whom they had professional relations. They ought to be enabled to get that. The first two pages of Dr. Dignan's pamphlets speak in these terms.  What he wanted was a scheme whereby a family wage would be paid to wage earners.  Of course we have done away with all that.  This is to be a substitute for that, because of the position into which we have been got by the Government, when people are definitely put below the level of meeting ordinary expenses, and when they are below the level in which they could be expected to pay in connection with health or other services.  Then they must be provided for and it is sought here to provide for them by cheap and nasty phraseology.</P>
    <P>The one thing cut out is freedom as to the person to whom people can go for medical assistance, and the freedom of county authorities as to what institutions in their wisdom should be set up, as well as freedom to set up services for the community.  Instead of that we have direction of services from headquarters and complementary directions as to taxation.  It was not a bad thing to have this measure delayed for a fortnight.  I think what has happened during the week-end to Deputy Allen is that numbers of people in his area have been asking him to realise what this was going to cost, and whether the ratepayers could bear the new cost.</P>

      <P>Is that what we are aiming at?  The Deputy stated that these proposals would cost one-tenth of what the Beveridge scheme would cost.  The Beveridge scheme was not based on this sort of nonsense at all. It left all that behind.  The fundamental object of that scheme was full employment, and when there was full employment for wage earners, you could get people to provide these sort of services.  It went in for the coordination of this type of services.</P>

      <P>I would like at some other time to argue what the restrictions are in relation to this measure.  I suggest that the Beveridge scheme left people free.  In so far as people got service they were to contribute.  The fundamental point was that that scheme was based upon employment which would enable people to bear the cost.  Once you get into the region, to which the Government has reduced this country, of having 300,000 people flying from it, a whole group brought into the Army, another group added to the Civil Service, 80,000 unemployed, very big numbers receiving what is called home assistance, and wages lowered so that you have to provide for them as cheaply as possibly, then you provide them with the taint of the poor law, and you are getting far away from the decent policy of His Lordship of Clonfert.  Even at this late hour I wish they would withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to two matters. If these two amendments are passed we will be doing what was never done before, and that is giving the Minister power to draft a scheme, the dimensions of which we have no knowledge. It is a scheme for ante-natal attendance, attendance at childbirth and on children.  It could be very small or it could be very large.  We will be giving <Col N="1826" /> the same Minister power, having provided the scheme, to compel the local authority to put it into operation and to raise whatever rate may be necessary to defray the cost.  If they do not do that, or if any members of the local authority vote against it, the Minister will have power to take proceedings in the High Court to compel them, and to levy the costs of the proceedings on such members of the local authority as deemed it to be their conscientious duty to resist the proposal that the Minister in this section attempts to impose upon them.</P>
      <P>Surely Dáil Éireann is suffering itself to be reduced to a greater degree of degradation than it has ever submitted to before, if it enacts a section without any knowledge, good, bad or indifferent as to the cost of the services which the section is designed to set up, and furthermore, while giving these powers, divesting ourselves in this House of the responsibility of answering to the people for the cost of the scheme and passing that responsibility over to county councillors down the country who may have no voice, good, bad or indifferent, as to the nature of the service, its scope or cost.  Surely, if we want to renege on our own functions of judging the merits of any scheme for which we legislate and delegate our whole power in that regard to the Minister, then we ought to face any odium that may be incurred by that scheme when it sees the light of day.  But we are not doing that.  In the words of Deputy Butler, we are laying the corner stone of a great social structure and then we are passing over to men who have no discretion in the matter, good, bad or indifferent, any possible odium that may accrue from any imprudence of which the Minister may be guilty under the comprehensive powers it is sought to confer upon him by subsection (2) of the new Section 85 which it is proposed to insert in the Bill. That is one point and I am amazed that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should have asked Dáil Éireann so completely to abrogate its functions as to consent to such a proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is made by Deputy <Col N="1827" /> Eamonn Coogan and I wish to underline it.  Deputy Coogan says that under the scheme, if a poor person wishes to avail of it, he or she must go to the dispensary doctor because the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that in any scheme set up under this section which he will approve the dispensary doctor will be the medical man envisaged by the plan.  If you want to provide ante-natal care, all this care and attendance at childbirth and on children thereafter, you must open your eyes to the fact that there is no branch of medicine in which the personal relationship between the doctor and the patient is more vital and a matter of greater delicacy.  I do not think any person with property in the country would suggest that even a woman's husband should impose upon her a gynæcologist of his choosing. There is no matter in which a woman's own personal preference should be or would be more carefully consulted than in the choice of a doctor in circumstances of that kind.  Is it reasonable to say to poor people: &ldquo;Because you are poor, you will just take what you are given&rdquo;?  I can understand that men who spend all their lives in cities, where a very impersonal atmosphere may be expected to obtain, find it hard to think that an ordinary poor woman should have any very strong preference as between one competent medical practitioner and another.  The Parliamentary Secretary has lived long enough in rural Ireland, however, to realise that that strictly impersonal atmosphere does not ordinarily obtain in a rural community.  The local doctors are well known to the people.  The people are in constant contact with them and there may be individuals amongst them who are agreeable and acceptable to certain people and who are anything but that to others.  It may very well be that the dispensary doctor, for a variety of functions, would be acceptable enough but, for the delicate and intimate service that a gynæcologist is called upon to render to a woman in childbirth and the months that go before and the months subsequent to it, any given woman in a country community might have a deep and well-founded reluctance to <Col N="1828" /> place herself in the hands of a particular dispensary doctor.  It might not be due to any mistrust of his professional skill but professional skill would not be the only matter which might properly be reckoned in circumstances of that character.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary appears to think that a scheme which would leave the choice of medical attendant to the patient in those circumstances is unthinkable.  I cannot imagine why.  Under the National Health Insurance Scheme there is a free dental benefit.  The patient can go to any dentist of his choosing who has registered himself with the National Health Insurance Society as being willing to treat a person upon the terms vouchsafed by the National Health Insurance Society to its beneficiaries. Is there any reason why, in a scheme of this character, provision should not be made for medical practitioners in the area to register themselves as being willing to give advice and treatment under this plan on the terms vouchsafed by the local authority, whereupon a poor person would be able to go to the doctor of her choice and enjoy the same amenity as her better-off neighbours at present have?</P>
    <P>Look at it from the point of view of the doctors.  The dispensary doctor is usually an established man once he becomes the dispensary doctor but in almost every small town in Ireland one will find one or two independent practitioners. They are often men who are making their way.  If this scheme were to operate it means that all the patients of modest means who might ordinarily be expected to be the patients of the younger doctor, who would normally charge a smaller fee than a man of standing and distinction in his community, will be constrained to boycott the younger doctor because, should they patronise him, they are debarred from any benefits under the scheme here envisaged.  On those three grounds I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy McGilligan's observations here to-day, I find myself in great sympathy with <Col N="1829" /> them, and I believe that at the back of Deputy Butler's mind he also finds himself in sympathy with them.  I view with growing concern this eternal tendency on the part of us all to usurp from the heads of families all the functions that a father might ordinarily be expected to discharge to his own family and to discharge those functions through the medium of some public authority.  It is a bad tendency. There is no question whatever that an infinitely better system would be to have a social system which would enable every individual in the community to earn a family wage and to buy all the goods and services that his growing children may require and that his wife may from time to time need from his own resources.  But, while recognising that, I am not prepared to say that we should leave the people unprovided for until we have realised so admirable a social system as would permit every individual to secure these benefits for himself and, in the interregnum, I am prepared to accept schemes of social services of the kind clearly envisaged by the section proposed to be inserted.  I think the scheme for ante-natal care, instruction and assistance in time of childbirth is a good thing and a very necessary thing, particularly in our cities.  I am not so sure that it is urgently required in rural Ireland.  I think it would be a great pity, however, if, when we were putting our hand to that task, it were done in a way which must give rise to bitter resentment and legitimate resentment.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will reconsider these amendments and put that scheme, whatever it may be, in some form of annex to this Bill.  Before the House is asked to impose a plan upon a local authority and to require a local authority to raise the finances for it, the House should at least be told what the plan is and what a reasonable man might expect it to cost.</P>
    <P>Lastly, surely the Parliamentary Secretary, from his own experience, appreciates how cruelly unfair it is to say to poor women in rural Ireland that they must take the dispensary doctor at this time or do without.  How minitely preferable it would be to say <Col N="1830" /> that, until such time as the social system is reformed to permit of every woman's husband providing these services for his wife, the community will finance their cost, but leave to each poor woman the prerogative which all women, rich and poor, should enjoy, that is, to have about them at this time not only those in whom they have confidence, but those whom they feel to be sympathetic as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general principle that there should be a scheme which would be capable of adequately dealing with the case of nursing and expectant mothers, I suggest that there will be no disagreement on any side of the House.  But where there may be disagreement is on a question merely of details so as to ensure that that service shall be adequate and of such a character that it can be accepted without any question of stigma so far as the recipient is concerned.  The ideal system would be the system which has been propounded by a number of people recently and which is now being incorporated in a measure on the other side.  Apart from any other question, so long as the need is there for that service, I am not going to be influenced in the least by the question of costs, more particularly as in this particular section we are assured of accommodation that we have not got in other sections, notably in Section 34, so far as the question of the dependents of tuberculous patients is concerned, that we have the advantage of a 50 per cent. recoupment in regard to this particular service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not hear the Parliamentary Secretary make the point, but I understand from listening to the discussion that he maintains that this service will be linked with the dispensary service, that it will be worked in connection with the dispensary doctor.  I want to give my experience so far as the City of Dublin is concerned.  The city dispensaries, as he is well aware, are under the control of the board of assistance and for the last four or five years have been completely outside the jurisdiction of the city council, because the board of assistance has been abolished and the administration is <Col N="1831" /> now in charge of commissioners.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is desirable that this scheme should be operated absolutely and completely free from any suggestion of the old poor law system; that, even under the present administration of the board of assistance, the local authority in the City of Dublin might be permitted to operate this scheme under its own centralised medical staff.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the inadequacy of the dispensaries throughout the country.  I can understand that, because I know some of them, and it is obvious that they are totally unsuited for the purpose envisaged under this section.  The same thing would apply, perhaps to a greater extent because of the number of people to be served, to the type of building in use in the city at present.  I anticipate as a result of this section the provision of other types of buildings which would afford adequate accommodation for the type of service which will be rendered.  I see no reason why that service could not be operated in a practical form, distinct altogether from any association with the board of assistance, whether the administration is carried out by commissioners or under the old system, with representatives from the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The present system in Dublin is that nursing and expectant mothers are catered for under the aegis of the corporation by means of two voluntary organisations; one, the Catholic Social Service Conference, and the other, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, both of which are doing excellent work and to whose funds the city council makes a very substantial contribution each year.  It is evident, however, that what they are doing, excellent as it is in every respect, is totally inadequate to meet the pressing requirements of the City of Dublin at the present time. But these two organisations are in a position to operate that service away from the atmosphere of the board of assistance.  My plea in reference to this section, so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, is that the local authority be allowed to implement that service in its own particular way. <Col N="1832" /> Otherwise, as several Deputies have mentioned, the people who will be benefiting under that system, if they have to avail of it under the dispensary system, will not too readily respond, because, whether we like it or not, there is neither respect nor affection for the poor law system or anything associated with it.</P>
    <P>I take it that sub-section (2) of this amendment was prompted by the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary feels that, in certain circumstances, local authorities would not avail of the facillities provided in sub-section (1) and that in such circumstances he feels it right that there should be this authority.  I confess that I see no objection whatever to a provision of that character if the local authority fails to do its duty.  If for no other reason, I certainly feel that the section should be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much struck by what the Parliamentary Secretary said.  I agree with a certain amount of what he said, but I am afraid that in other respects I did not follow him.  He seemed to suggest with regard to the present system of school inspection that an inspection which takes place on an average every three years was quite a farce.  He did not use the word, but I suppose it is a farce and a ghastly farce.  What the Parliamentary Secretary said about it might be summed up in the phrase, &ldquo;too little and too late&rdquo;.  I think the House is all in favour of increased medical benefits for the community, and what we are debating here to-day with the Parliamentary Secretary is the matter of the methods and the degree to which they are to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that the scheme as envisaged would run from the very poor right up to the very rich, whom he dismissed by saying that they would be able to make their own arrangements, or some such phrase.  He then gave us a description of the class which lies between the very poor and the very rich.  I describe them, for want of a better term, as the black-coated workers.  I could entirely agree with what he said about that section.  Without wishing <Col N="1833" /> to run down any other section, they certainly contain representatives of the very best of our race.  Listening to the Parliamentary Secretary, it struck me that the question to be answered is: where is the line to be drawn?  We have the poor who, I take it, are compelled to avail of these services and the people at the other end of the scale so well off that they need not think of availing of them.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to be very precise as to where the dividing line is.</P>

      <P>I should be very glad if he did want to, because it would show that the richest in the land were prepared to avail of the service.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that?  Does he realise that it would place a hallmark on him if people with free choice and with money in their pockets who could employ whom they liked called in the dispensary doctor? When that situation arises, we will have the very best medical service at the service of the community.  We have heard about the Beveridge scheme on the other side of the water, or rather the revised Beveridge scheme, and it almost looks as if we are going to establish a State medical service here. I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary's idea is, but I think he mentioned that, under this care of the mother and child system and the inspection afterwards in the school, there would be the services of the dentist and the eye surgeon, and no doubt of nose and throat specialist.  Is that all to be linked up with this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not enlarge on that, but medicine, like everything else, has changed in this present generation.  We are passing out of the period of the family doctor who looked after the family from the cradle to the grave, who attended every <Col N="1834" /> ailment and who was both doctor and surgeon.  We have gone into an age, as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would be the first to admit, of specialists.  He has mentioned the dentist and the eye surgeon, but I take it that if the doctor suspected a case of diphtheria, he would have to take a swab of the child's throat and have a culture made of it, and that would necessitate a very intimate association with an organisation in his own house where the swabs he had taken would be registered and docketed, and then sent forward to some central place for the next stage of the examination.  Are all these specialist services envisaged under this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that, because it would be absurd to have it otherwise.  I come now to another very important point in respect of which it is absolutely necessary that we should understand where we are.  Is any alternative allowed to the mother or the family to the dispensary doctor?  Most of us know some dispensary doctors.  They are very hardworking, skilful men, but the most skilful man must occasionally make a mistake and I suppose there are dispensary doctors who have made mistakes.  I have come across quite poor people who would not go to a particular dispensary doctor.  Possibly, they might have a prejudice, which was very ill-founded, but rightly or wrongly those people should have some choice.</P>
      <P>Another matter that calls for attention is the case of a dispensary doctor who may be really hard run to attend to a case that an anxious mother thinks should receive attention.  It may very well happen that he could not come for a couple of days and might be run off his feet.  Is the person to be left in the meantime without being able to obtain any medical care?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which was made by Deputy Allen and which is a very good point was that of a dispensary doctor who was looking after a child in a house, when someone else was ill in the same house.  In my young days, I belonged to a fairly large family and <Col N="1835" /> when one of the children would become ill a doctor would be called in.  It is an extraordinary thing that, when you have illness in the house, it seems to spread, and very often it was a case of the child looking as if it was sickening for some illness and some other member of the family also was laid up. Supposing that was the father or the mother.  Is the doctor to say: &ldquo;I am treating the child, but I cannot look at the adult&rdquo;?  If that is the position, I think it is absurd and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to contradict me and say that a doctor who goes into the house is to look after anybody who is ill there.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to envisage a certain number of nurses in every district.  I can well imagine that, if there are 9,000 people in a district, a nurse could usefully be employed&mdash;in fact, several nurses.  He did not mention the position of the district nurses who are at present used in certain country districts.  I think they get some sort of help from the rates in the shape of grants.  Is it proposed to avail of their services and to continue that service as an alternative which might be availed of as well as the State service?  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying, to answer that point, as it seems absurd that a voluntary organisation which has lasted for a great number of years and done good work and established goodwill in every district, should be done away with.  I am sure he will realise also the effect on a voluntary organisation which has started up, does good work and then is squelched by a Government measure.  I hope he will cover those points when he is replying.</P>

So far as his intentions are concerned, I think we are all agreed, but I would say, with Deputy Allen, that it will be utterly impossible to carry out even the very restricted scheme embraced in this section&mdash;in so far as it is a scheme at all&mdash;through the machinery that he <Col N="1836" /> proposes to use.  I think Deputy Allen's speech was useful to this extent that he certainly pointed out the more obvious snags and difficulties which we are going to come up against right away.  I am sorry I cannot say the same of his colleague, Deputy Butler. I do not know whether it was the speeches from this side or Deputy Allen's speech that brought Deputy Butler to his feet, as he said himself, for the first time since this Bill was introduced.  Having listened to Deputy Butler, one wondered why he decided to break his vow of silence.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in the course of his speech referred to the dispensary system and said that the objection to it in the old days as the poor law system had been almost completely eradicated.  I am sorry to say I cannot find myself in agreement with him there.  I go this distance with him, that there is a more enlightened approach to the present-day services.  I do not want to go into the whole question of the poor law system; but would like to confine myself to the dispensary system and the use of it for carrying out this scheme.  Frankly, in my opinion, it cannot be done.  No matter what we may say, the dispensary system and the premises in which the dispensary doctors have to operate are a disgrace to this country.  The present buildings in many of the dispensary areas are not of a type that will enable the doctor to carry out efficiently the duties already placed on his shoulders, without putting further duties on him at all.  We know the type of house in use not only in the rural areas but in some of our fairly large towns.  It is quite a common thing to see on a dispensary day, in inclement weather, people having to line up outside the door because there is not sufficient accommodation inside.  In so far as there is accommodation inside, it is quite a common thing to see people sitting in a cold, cheerless room without a fire on a winter's day.  The fact of the matter is that, notwithstanding what Deputy Butler has said, this is an attempt to give us something in place of a contributory social service or health scheme&mdash;and it is a very poor attempt.</P>

      <P>From the Money Resolution onwards, we have been warning the House that this measure will place an immense burden on the shoulders of the ratepayers.  We tried to get from the Parliamentary Secretary some indication of the limit and we could not get it.  That has been mentioned, not only by speakers on our benches, but by the members of the Clann na Talmhan Party and the Independent Party here.  We have been trying to convert Deputies on the opposite side of the House for the last 14 days.  Deputy Allen's speech is the most effective answer I could give to Deputy Butler, who says that this is pure obstruction on our part.  Deputy Butler said that 85 per cent. of the amendments put down to the Bill were vexatious.  It is easily known that he has not taken much interest in the Bill.  I do not think anybody should say that 85 per cent. or 25 per cent. or even 5 per cent. of the amendments are vexatious.  I think many Deputies have observed that there was something in the amendments.  It may be some consolation to Deputy Butler to know that, as a result of one of the vexatious amendments moved on this side of the House, he need not fear that he will be carted off and placed in some institution and there have some part of his anatomy removed against his will.  He is free from that danger.</P>

      <P>In that case, like many other Deputies, I want to know what is the scheme.  There is no scheme before us.  Since the initiation of the measure, the Parliamentary Secretary has been referring to the mother and child scheme.  There is no scheme here.  He has been talking about the machinery through which the scheme is to be operated.  There is no machinery provided in this Bill.  He has been talking about the dispensary doctor as the pivot of the mother and child scheme.  The dispensary doctor does not appear in this part of the Bill.  There is nothing beyond the bald statement that arrangements may be made.  In view of the fact that the cost of this, in the main if not altogether, will fall directly on the ratepayers, we ought to get some more information. The trouble about this section is the same as the trouble about Sections 29 and 34.  We are not given any idea of what the Minister may demand or direct the local authority to provide. We have no idea of the cost.</P>

We were pressing to get an estimate of the cost of all parts of the Bill and the Parliamentary Secretary, without pressure, if he likes, said that a rough estimate of the cost of the mother and child scheme was between £500,000 and £600,000, half of which would be borne by the local rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that as a definite, unqualified statement.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given a rough estimate that it will cost between £500,000 and £600,000.  Deputy Allen, going into the thing and analysing it fairly closely, out of his years of experience as a member of a local authority, and having regard to how he sees the present public health services operating, is inclined to believe it will cost double that figure.  He points out that it is not merely a question of putting additional work on the local dispensary doctor.  It means the provision of extra nurses and of quite a number of additional clerical assistants.  In that respect, I agree with him entirely that if the doctors and the nurses are to perform efficiently the duties which this imposes on them, it will be essential for the doctor to have clerical assistance, unless the greater part of his time is to be taken up, not in medical work, but in clerical work, filling in reports for the Department.  I think it would not be an exaggeration to say that, even under the present system, probably 50 per cent. of the time of the county <Col N="1840" /> medical officer goes in compiling returns.  However, it is very hard to criticise a scheme that is not before us. All that is mentioned in the proposed new section is that the arrangements&mdash; what they are to be we do not know&mdash; will cost £500,000 or £600,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to deal with and I shall do so as briefly as I can.  I need not delay the House by referring to the fact that already we have maternity and child welfare schemes operating in this country.  They are operating under Section 3 (2) (b) of the Notification of Births (Extension) Act, 1915.  That section provides that any sanitary authority&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;may make such arrangements as they think fit and as may be sanctioned by the Local Government Board for Ireland, for attending to the health of expectant mothers and nursing mothers and of children under five years of age.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, provides in addition to that clause of the 1915 Act the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and for the purpose of any such arrangements may, subject to the sanction aforesaid, exercise the like powers as they are entitled to exercise for the purpose of the provision of hospitals.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the statutory power under which our maternity and child welfare schemes have been operated up to the present.  We are repealing the power to</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... make such arrangements as they think fit and as may be sanctioned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any arrangements that might be made have to be sanctioned by the Minister or they could not become operative.  I made the case fully when I was speaking earlier to-day as to why it was necessary to take compulsory powers in order that we might be able to secure uniformity in the matter of providing services and so that the few local authorities that might be recalcitrant or reluctant to provide services should be forced to provide them. Bearing in mind that the State is <Col N="1841" /> bearing fifty per cent. of the cost it is reasonable that it should have a determining say in the matter.  We do not want to run into a position in which in 75 per cent. of the geographical area of the State it would operate, and in the other portion it would not operate, because the local authorities might not agree.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy says we are going to throw many people back into the dispensary system.  This scheme will be operated by the health authorities, and not by the public assistance authorities.  We can have a debate on that point.  The purpose and the policy is not to throw anything on to the dispensary system, but to lift the dispensary into the health system.  This is a considerable step in that direction. Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Dockrell and other Deputies talked about the buildings as well as the accommodation in our dispensaries. I think I spoke pretty forcibly on that issue during the last fortnight.  Nobody in the House feels more strongly on that matter than I do.  I understand the position and I have personal knowledge of it.  It is not any credit to us and is one of the things that we must remedy, no matter what the cost. When speaking of the provision of institutions and compulsory powers in relation to them I had in mind, particularly, the provision of clinics throughout the country, in substitution for the type of accommodation we have at present.  Until we provide such alternative accommodation we cannot hope to lift our health services out of the atmosphere in which they have grown up, as far as the poorer sections are concerned.  That is the task before us.  It will have to be tackled energetically.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Byrne talks about millions being in the hands of the Hospitals Trust, I should say that I repeatedly pointed out that the millions in hands, or any further millions they may accumulate will be necessary for capital expenditure. The capital envisaged will include a substantial proportion, from two-thirds to 75 per cent. of the cost of clinics that will have to be provided if we are to operate services in keeping with the <Col N="1842" /> dignity of our people.  Complaints have been made by various speakers that we are not giving a choice of doctors.  In rural Ireland it does not seem to be possible to provide a choice of doctors for this service.  The most ambitious development I can hope for in rural Ireland is to provide an up to date standard of service.  If that does not satisfy the people, and if they want a team of doctors from which to select, I am afraid it is an ideal that cannot be reached.  If anybody can show me how it can be reached in rural Ireland I will be glad.  I do not think it is possible.  I should say in that connection that when a patient goes into a hospital nowadays, even in Dublin, there is very little choice of doctors.  There is no choice in the county hospitals.  Our county hospitals are looked upon as providing a very satisfactory service&mdash; and no discredit to us&mdash;yet, there is one surgeon, and whether you are fully satisfied with him or not there is no team from which to select.  The same applies to fever hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne and Deputy M. O'Sullivan mentioned the position in Dublin City.  The position in Dublin is exceptional. This scheme cannot apply to Dublin City without modification. Dublin Deputies know that.  The Dublin Corporation has under consideration, and is in negotiation with three maternity hospitals in Dublin, with a view to evolving a scheme for mothers and infants.  That problem arose out of the shocking death rate amongst infants under two years of age in Dublin.  The maternity and child welfare scheme evolved in Dublin City extends far beyond that developed in any other part of the State.  There is no intention of scrapping the good work that has been done.  We will have to examine the position in Dublin City very carefully and, probably, the best policy there will be to build up the mother and child services and expand them.  The scheme we have here is not applicable to Dublin City.  I concede at once, that if we tried to operate that scheme in the dispensaries in Dublin it could not succeed in such surroundings and in such circumstances. If I might speak particularly to the Dublin representatives <Col N="1843" /> what we envisage is to provide clinics, build up the health services, and lift up our public assistance people from the type of institution that they are at present being treated in, and to give them a setting and a surrounding to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen and other Deputies talked about the difficulty of securing full services in the rural areas, because of the amount of work dispensary doctors have to do.  We will find that some of our districts are too big.  I think it would be a sounder scheme to have more districts, rather than to put a couple of men into a rural district in which there was not, perhaps, a good living for one man.  If we put too many doctors into an area where the scope is limited we are not providing the very best services.  These are details we will have to work out in good time.  The question that Deputy Dockrell raised about district nurses can be dealt with on Section 96.  Meantime, I refer the Deputy to the statement I made on March 20th.  It arose on the Money Resolution and will be found in the Official Debates.  That was a general indication of our policy in relation to the nurses, and it gives a line of thought with which we can deal in greater detail when we come to it.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last night I was appealing to the Minister to deal with the problem of congestion.  That is really one of the greatest problems in the country.  I suggest that the problem of the rural slum should be treated as considerately as the problem of the city, town or village slum.  We all agree on the supreme necessity of having a new housing scheme in relation to our towns and cities and even our villages. We all agree, regardless of Party, that that problem should be dealt with.  I know that there will be a great measure of agreement also as to the necessity for removing the rural slum that exists mainly in my part of the country, that has its roots in the very bad historical past.  All the wishful thinking in the world will not remove that problem. The problem was recognised by the British Government.  A special commission was set up to deal with it in 1907 which produced a very lengthy and elaborate report, as a result of which the Land Act of 1909 was passed. Under that Act, the whole of Connaught was to be dealt with by a special Department called the Congested Districts Board.  One of the great mistakes, in fact, I would say, the great blot on the Land Act of 1923, was the abolition of the Congested Districts Board.  The British Government realised that that special problem had <Col N="1845" /> to be dealt with in a special manner and by a special department.  The Congested Districts Board existed long before 1909, but it had only limited powers.  As a result of the Land Act of 1909 its powers were largely increased and the whole of Connaught was handed over to its jurisdiction, and also the County of Donegal, County Kerry and West Cork.</P>
      <P>The officials of the Congested Districts Board were called Castle officials but they were practically all Irishmen and they served Ireland in their own way.  Men like Sir Henry Doran did a tremendous amount of work in helping to solve the problem. They established policy and indicated a line for any succeeding chief of the Department to follow.  Unfortunately, certain things happened to interrupt that magnificent work.  There was the first World War.  Then we had what happened in this country and then there was the Land Act of 1923 which abolished the board and handed over the areas concerned to be dealt with as part of the general problem of land settlement.  There are several facets to that problem in the West and other parts of the country.  I am not one who maintains that it can be fully solved by land settlement.  The Congested Districts Board adopted other methods and tried other schemes.  In some directions they did not meet with much success but, at any rate, they tried them and perhaps some of their schemes were not tried out for a sufficient length of time.  They tried developing the home-spun industry and handcrafts.  They tried developing the fishing industry.  The history of their experiments along those lines should be reviewed carefully to see whether or not under modern conditions a greater success could be made of them and thus help to solve the problem of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with some of the statements made yesterday by Deputy Cafferky and Deputy Commons.  I do not think that it would be a wise policy to prevent a smallholder in a congested area in County Mayo, with a valuation of only 50/-, from selling his holding.  I know very well that it causes a lot of heart burning when <Col N="1846" /> neighbours who are hungry for land see, as they think, their one chance of getting some land disappearing.  But, if there is anything in the lip service that we all pay to the three F's, fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale, surely such a policy would be trampling on the principle of the three F's.  Take a family in a congested area which, owing to the death of the head of the family or ill-health or some other misfortune, is forced into the position that they have to sell the homestead.  They do not like to do that.  It is not a hasty decision on their part.  To quote an old saying in the country: it is the last stone on their beads when they have to do it.  Is it fair then to stop such a sale; to stop these unfortunate people getting the market price of that holding, because that is what it amounts to if the law steps in to stop it?  There is no reality in the cry of free sale if the Land Commission or any other Government Department steps in; in that way free sale becomes a sham.</P>
    <P>I also do not agree with the statement by Deputy Cafferky or Deputy Commons about leading a great cattle-driving movement in the County Mayo; not that I think that cattle-driving was immoral or wrongful in its day.  There was a time when it was the one weapon left in the hands of the people. But I would remind these two Deputies that the position in Mayo to-day is that there is very little land left that can be considered arable which should be acquired by the Land Commission for distribution.  Even if the Land Commission came to a decision to-morrow to acquire every holding in the County Mayo of over £30 valuation, it would not go near solving the congested problem there.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to come to a decision regarding counties like Mayo and fix a definite size for farms in those counties.  I may shock the House when I say that I believe that it is right that we should limit the amount of land held by people, but I do say it.  In countries like Denmark, Holland and Belgium there is a definite limitation to the amount of land that can be held by any citizen of the State.  If it is right in these countries, I do not see <Col N="1847" /> why it should not be right here.  This problem has got to be faced and acknowledged by the Government and by all Parties.  I appeal to the Minister to tackle the problem in that way and start in counties like Mayo by saying that any person with a holding of over £50 valuation or £40 valuation &mdash;I would leave it to the judgement of the Land Commission as to what would be reasonable&mdash;should get the option of leaving the county and getting an exchange of holding.  But even when that is done, I acknowledge that it is not going to solve the congested problem in the County Mayo; that it will not go anywhere near solving that problem.</P>
    <P>Not alone should the Minister deal with that problem from the point of view of land distribution and land settlement, but, in co-operation with other Government Departments and Ministers, industrial development, the creation of employment, reclamation and afforestation should be taken in as part of a general scheme to solve that terrible problem of the rural slums. The sands are running out.  If the Government do not take this matter seriously in our time and tackle it in a serious way, it will be solved in a way that none of us would like to see it solved.  It will be solved by the people leaving those areas and going to foreign countries.  I ask the Minister to realise that the old generation of men and women whose hearts were rooted in the soil as it were, who would not want to leave their homesteads if they could possibly help it, is dying out.  They are being succeeded, if you like, by a more ambitious generation, a generation more in touch with modern ways of thinking and acting. That generation is not going to be content to stick to a few acres of bog in some mountainy district in the County Mayo, or some other county like it. They are going to get out and go where they think they can earn a decent living under decent conditions.  They are going to clear out to some foreign country.  What will happen then has happened before.</P>
    <P>We have heard of the eviction campaigns. I discovered in the past, <Col N="1848" /> through my contacts with old people of the famine years and the years succeeding them, that many of the ranches were not created by evictions but by desperate economic conditions which forced people to sell all they could, to put the latch on the door and to clear out to Great Britain or the United States.  I have been told that on several occasions by old men of that generation.  I do not say or wish to imply that conditions now are anything like those which then existed, but if something is not done to deal with this problem in a serious way and in a through fashion to improve the conditions under which these people are living, the young men and women between 20 and 30 years of age will not be content and will solve the problem in their own way by clearing out.  I ask the Minister to tackle this problem and to get all the officials in the Land Commission interested in it, to get them to regard it as serious as the slum problem in our towns and cities and to come to the House with any proposals he may have for additional powers to deal with it and to appeal to all Parties to look on it as just as serious and just as urgent as the slum problem in our towns and cities.</P>

      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon; I have been so accustomed to addressing a Parliamentary Secretary for the last 14 days that I find it rather hard to accustom myself to the use of the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;, particularly as I did not see a Minister sitting on the Front Bench for the past 14 days.  I hope the Minister will give due consideration to the eloquent appeal which has just been made to him by his colleague, but I must confess that I find it rather hard to reconcile Deputy Walsh's chastisement of his two colleagues, Deputy Cafferky and Deputy Commons, for their suggestion that one of the three F's, free sale, should be destroyed with his appeal to the Minister to destroy another, fixity of tenure.  I hope the Minister will give <Col N="1849" /> a little more consideration than apparently the Deputy has given to limiting the farm which a person will be allowed to occupy.  The £40 valuation farm in Mayo would be looked upon almost as a ranch, but I can assure the Deputy that we would not get very excited about a £40 valuation farm in Tipperary or Limerick.</P>

      <P>I rose on this Estimate to ask for information for which I have asked before, and I hope I will get a more satisfactory answer on this occasion, now that the Land Commission have had a few more years in which to consider the matter.  I should like to know why the Land Commission persist in allowing years, in some cases, to elapse from the date on which they take possession of an estate to the date on which they divide it.  During the time which elapses from its acquisition to its division, they do nothing but let the land in conacre year in and year out, so that, at the end of the period, when they are ready to allot the estate, the land has been considerably worsened and in many cases deprived almost entirely of its fertility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that, when land is let in conacre year in and year out, very often it is a different person who has a particular parcel of land on the estate, and that person has no interest, good, bad or indifferent, in the land beyond getting the last ounce out of it.  So far as I know, in general lettings, he is not required by the Land Commission to put anything into it, because I think I am correct in saying that the Land Commission, generally speaking, lets only from year to year. They do not do what some farmers very wisely do.  When farmers, for health or other reasons, are compelled to let their land in conacre, if they see that their difficulties are not going to come to an end in a year or two, they take the precaution of letting the land for two or three years and of insisting that one of the crops put in by the person who takes the conacre shall be a manure crop.  I must confess that I <Col N="1850" /> have never yet been able to understand why two, three, four, five and six years should elapse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not putting it any further; I am deliberately keeping it within reasonable bounds.  I know that there is a considerable amount of work to be done when a farm has been acquired, but I also know that a fair amount of work is done before the Land Commission decide to acquire it.  I know that in many cases there are so many applicants that there would not be a blade of grass, much less an acre per head, for them.  I know that it takes a considerable amount of time, work and trouble to interview each applicant, to check up on his story and so on, but surely, with their years of experience, and with the machinery, trained inspectors and staff generally, at the disposal of the Land Commission, it should not take a number of years.  I should like the Minister to give us an assurance that, for the future, in respect of whatever number of estates may be left to be acquired and divided, there will be some speeding up, and that, as I say, the allottees will not find when they get their allotments that they have been deprived to a great extent of their fertility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter on which I should like to get some information and some assurance is the matter of vesting.  I have never yet been able to understand why some farms can be vested in two, three, five or six years, while others cannot be vested in 20 or 30 years.  I think that, generally speaking, if the person to whom a farm, a parcel of land or a holding is given is a suitable person, to whom the holding is given on merit and merit alone, it is to the advantage not only of the occupant but of the State that the holding should be vested in him as soon as possible.  I know that in recent years&mdash;perhaps it was always so, but not to the same extent as in recent years&mdash;a number of people succeeded in getting land for one reason or other who, perhaps, were not making the best use of it and I know that the Minister is now congratulating himself <Col N="1851" /> on the fact that that land was not vested; but, notwithstanding all the talk we had here, notwithstanding the special measure the Minister had to bring before the House, I think the percentage of allottees who were unsatisfactory and who were not giving of their best in the working of the land given to them would be very small. These are just two points.  There are some other points I could refer to, perhaps, at some length and I could take this Estimate and make a general speech on it and then take it sub-head after sub-head right from the beginning, and, I think, I may say, without boasting, it would be within my capacity to do so.  However, even at the risk of being accused of not opposing the Minister and not putting up opposition to him, I do not wish at the moment to go into any other details.  I would be grateful to him if, when replying, he would deal with these two points&mdash;the delay in allotting land that has been acquired and the delay in vesting land that has been allotted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest taken in land Bills here is indicative of the general interest taken by the people of the country in the land generally.  I suppose more legislation has been passed here dealing with land than in regard to any other subject of interest in our community.  All of us feel that land is the foundation of our economy. It is our history and we have an interest in it, apart from the fact that, whether we are directly concerned with the land as a livelihood or not, we feel that the value of land is important in our lives.  That compels us, on every occasion when the question arises here, to make some contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in that long-standing question of how far the Land Commission is going to relieve that menacing problem of congests of the West and elsewhere.  Statements have been made here in the last few days and on other occasions when this question comes up and they almost invariably refer to the poor condition of the congests in the West, with particular reference to the Mayo and Galway people.  I ask the <Col N="1852" /> Minister not to allow himself to be entirely influenced by those references. There are congests in other parts of the country as well, and it is his duty to ensure fair and equitable adjustment, so far as the means are available, in all parts of those afflicted districts. Judging from the references made by the various speakers, I can clearly understand how difficult it must be for the Department dealing with this problem of land division to get a decision upon which they could act formally.  Various interests suggest that farms should not be allotted into holdings of less than 40 or 50 acres. Others suggest smaller areas, while others again suggest that the larger farms of more than 100 acres are an essential part of our economy.  While I am one who speaks mainly for the relief of congestion and advocates the division of land towards that end, as I am so convinced of the necessity of dealing with that problem that I say that no new holding should be given by the Land Commission until the outstanding and long-menacing problem of congestion has been dealt with, I can see that those who advocate the retention of a number of large holdings are not without reason on their side.</P>
    <P>Large farms are essential to our economy, essential to the grazing of cattle, which can be reared and must be sold from the small farms at an early age.  If we are to continue the development of our tillage schemes in the growing of wheat and such crops, they are essential also, as it is only by the introduction of machinery that this policy can be carried out successfully. It is fortunate that the experiments of the last 25 or 30 years in the distribution of land are available now to the Department.  They have the knowledge gained over those years at their disposal now.  Apart from the economic necessity of maintaining large farms in certain parts of the country, I believe they are useful also in giving employment and that smallholders find suitable employment for themselves and their families in connection with the scientific development and utilisation of those large holdings.</P>
    <P>In the further development which <Col N="1853" /> the Land Commission has in mind&mdash; that is, the migration of people from the congested areas, transferring them as colonies to various parts of the Midlands&mdash;the opportunity arises to establish the co-operative system. Machinery on modern lines might be provided by the Department, with proper technical instruction to train the new allottees in the use of those machines and in the scientific development of their tillage and other crops. Without some form of co-operation, no matter what the Land Commission may do, they must remain always the problem of the congested areas.  The most the Department can aim at is to relieve them to the utmost in their power.  But by an effort of co-operation, which could be more easily established amongst colonies in a new area, experience could be gathered that might be applicable later on to the areas where congestion exists at present.  As we have not land enough to go round to make large economic holdings for all our people, we must by experiment, commonsense, tests and trials, find the best means of utilising the land available to the utmost benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency&mdash;Leitrim and Sligo&mdash;sufficient attention has not been given by the Land Commission in the past.  I am satisfied about that and request the Minister to look into the figures of the areas of land divided amongst people in those two counties. He should examine the condition of the uneconomic holdings there and compare with the holdings of the land which has been divided.  The Department's records will show a considerable area divided in those two counties, but if they are examined he will find that the vast bulk of it is mountain or bogs, which is not land and was never intended to be used as such.  Then he will realise the small attempt made in those two counties to relieve the problem existing there.</P>
    <P>On the question of distribution of bogland, I advocate that, where bog is available in any large area, instead of distributing it in plots to people four or five miles away, many of whom, unless conditions alter very much, will not utilise that bog, the area should <Col N="1854" /> be retained by the Land Commission, let to users at a nominal rent and cut in such a way as to enable a uniform cutting, having regard to the advantage of drainage and possible reclamation subsequently.  Areas of bog have been distributed in an inconsiderate way, wastefully and given directly to owners of holdings far away.  Many of them may use the bog immediately but others may not use it for the next 20 years.  The bog is left in a hopeless condition.  There is no uniformity or care in its cutting, nor can any useful purpose be made of the land from which the bog has been cut.  In the normal way that cutaway bog can be reclaimed and made very useful land and could be a good addition to small holdings.  More care should be taken in the handling of any farm, whether it be a mountain farm or otherwise. Indiscriminate distribution is worse than no distribution.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the size of a farm on which a farmer should be able to make a living.  Many speakers from the South and Midlands pressed for a larger area, 30 or 40 acres.  I may say seriously that it is not the area of land that will determine the living that may be made from it.  It is the individual who is placed there who will very largely determine that.  Care in the selection of those to whom land is to be given is of the utmost importance. It is really essential if the scheme is to be successful.  Deputies have advocated here that no migrations should be made.  They suggest that whatever congestion there may be, either in the West or South, the problem should be allowed to remain there, and give the land, where it is available for division, to those in the immediate neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>Will anybody with commonsense suggest that the land does not belong to the people of Ireland, and that it is not the duty of a Government to divide that land in such a way as will tend to the best interests of the greater number and to the benefit of the community as a whole?  In other words, you must put on to the farms which the Government have determined it is their duty to divide, men with training and experience, men who have practical <Col N="1855" /> knowledge of farming and who have shown that they are able to work the land.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that 20 or 30 acres are not sufficient in the hands of the right man.  Take the case of men who might be migrated from the West of Ireland.  Many of these people have been reared, perhaps their families have been for generations, on 15 acres of bad land.  These are men who have been tried and trained.  Take them out and give them 30 acres of good land and there can be no question that they will make a success of their holdings.</P>
    <P>In to-day's paper I read Deputy Corry's contribution to the debate. Deputy Corry is a prominent member of the Government Party and his words can be taken as representing some indication of policy.  He referred in a slighting way to the hen-roosters and he said it was a mistake to take them and place them in the Midlands amongst respectable society.  He said that his workmen would not exchange their present jobs for a 30 or 40-acre farm.  In one respect I was very glad to hear that, because it shows that some farms must be very prosperous when employees on them would be beyond accepting a 30 or 40-acre farm. Deputy Corry also said that some of the migrants who received a 30 or 40-acre farm had sold them for £1,100 recently. We must take it, therefore, that in a choice between accepting a £1,100 farm or a job with Deputy Corry on his farm, the job with Deputy Corry as a farm labourer would be better.  That is a very big asset and there should be no question of farm strikes for better wages if that represents the condition of farm workers in the Midlands and in the South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely say I was glad to hear it.  I do not know the conditions and I cannot contradict the statement.  I suggest that the Land Commission must be very careful in the future when receiving applications for land that, in giving farms, they will not do men serious injury, especially if it is not a bigger farm than 30 or 40 acres. That sort of applicant must be considered <Col N="1856" /> carefully in the future by the Land Commission, because it might be that by giving him a farm he will be injured rather than benefited.  I hope that Deputy Corry will lead no more deputations of beet growers and other specialised farmers for increased prices for their products, seeing that the conditions on his farm are so prosperous at the moment, because any increased prices will have to be borne by many of the hen roosters so miserably placed in the West.  Let us have no more applications from these prosperous farmers or well-to-do farm labourers.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect.  I strongly resent the remarks of Deputy Corry or any other Deputy to the effect that the men from the West have not a claim on the land of this country, no matter where it is available.  Let us consider the man who led the great and very successful land reform movement in this country, Michael Davitt, whose centenary we are celebrating this year If any of his progeny happened to be in Mayo and if he was an applicant for a farm in Meath or Westmeath, according to Deputy Corry and, I think, Deputy Flanagan, that man should not be given a parcel of land because he would be considered unsuitable for it and would not be regarded as an acquisition elsewhere.  I think such a suggestion is disgraceful.  It never should have been made, and it should not have come from a man like Deputy Corry, a prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party and a man who takes pride in the service that he alleges he gave this country when he was an outstanding republican.  He ought to know the meaning of republicanism that existed in the minds of such men as my own county-man, Seán MacDermott.  He had in mind no distinction of class.  He merely wanted to serve his country so that his country might utilise its resources without any regard to creed, class or personal gain. If Deputy Corry was a fighting man in the cause of freedom, surely he must have understood the principles of the men who accomplished so much in that struggle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust, in following up the division of land, the Minister will not have regard to what may have been said by <Col N="1857" /> members of his Party against the congests of the West, and that he will establish his reputation as a man striving to do the right thing and ensure that it will be the first consideration, so far as his Department is concerned, to utilise the available land in this country for the relief of congests in the West and elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieSnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in protesting against the remarks made last evening by Deputy Corry.  The Deputy's speech, in the first instance, was not by any means charitable.  Before casting a reflection on the people of the West of Ireland Deputy Corry should have gone back on history for a while.  He seems to me to be one of those men who forget that in the West of Ireland an agitation began which leaves Deputy Corry and many of his colleagues settled in comfort in their homes.  It was sad to hear Deputy Corry display his eloquence in such a manner, and it was not very appropriate, as a means of perpetuating and honouring the memory of one great Irishman, Michael Davitt, who was born in Mayo.  Deputy Corry on this question may have been voicing the feelings of his Party, and if such is the case I am sorry and regret it very much.  However, from a few members of his Party we have got an assurance that the Deputy was not voicing their outlook.  I was glad to hear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking on this Estimate last year I brought to the Minister's notice many grievances which exist in my constituency. To a certain extent I must compliment the Minister on having some of these grievances redressed. Some are still outstanding.  I wish to bring to his notice now a few matters which are a source of worry to me and perhaps to his Department.  The outstanding grievance in my constituency concerns water supplies.  I mentioned the matter on this Estimate last year. In one instance where three or four estates were taken over, absolutely no provision was made for a water supply, either for domestic use or for live stock, and despite representations that I made both in the House and by way of correspondence with the Land Commission, practically nothing has been <Col N="1858" /> done.  It is regrettable that people have to travel perhaps three or four miles to get water for live stock.  I appeal to the Minister to expedite the provision of an adequate water supply on these lands.  The evil is of long standing.  For practically ten years nothing has been done about it.  The Minister stated that the activities of the Department would be greatly improved in future.  I am glad to hear that, and suggest for consideration some matters that have been overlooked.</P>
    <P>I refer to housing.  I brought to the Minister's notice last year particulars regarding the materials used on houses built on Land Commission holdings. As well as I could, I pictured the conditions in my constituency, particularly in the neighbourhood of Boyle, where houses were erected some years ago. Most of these houses have given ridiculously bad service, as the roofs are bad, the walls are bad, and they are damp.  In fact, the general appearance of the houses is anything but presentable, and they need immediate repairs. I ask the Minister to have the necessary repairs carried out, so that the tenants would be provided with better living accommodation.  I also wish to call the Minister's attention to the condition of roads which were constructed by the Land Commission when lands were being allotted.  I expect the Minister will say that the position could be dealt with under the rural improvement scheme.  While I have great admiration for that scheme and realise its usefulness, I say that its application is impracticable in a number of cases, particularly to roads on these farms.  The person who is living on a road that is convenient to the main road is quite happy.  He has not to worry about the road leading to his farm, but the man living a mile away from the main road will have to contribute to the road improvement scheme. I approve of that scheme and encourage people to avail of it, but that is not possible in all cases.  Some arrangement should be made by the Land Commission for the maintenance of these roads or, as an alternative, the county council, by arrangement with the Land Commission, should keep them in a proper condition.  As several <Col N="1859" /> of these roads are becoming impassable, the longer the present position continues the worse they will become. In the instance that I am referring to the people concerned cannot avail of the rural improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>There are in my constituency and, perhaps, in other parts of the country a number of unoccupied holdings.  It is regrettable that that should be the case.  I suggest that any outstanding arrears should be wiped off immediately. As I pass through County Roscommon I notice a number of unoccupied holdings on which houses were built many years ago.  When the houses are not occupied they are deteriorating. The first thing the Land Commission should do in such cases is to select tenants and put them into occupation so that the houses would be preserved and the cost of repairs avoided.  It is hard to define an economic holding.  I never heard it defined.  I presume that an economic holding is one that will maintain a man, his wife and perhaps three children. In my opinion some holdings that have been allotted are not sufficient to maintain that family.  In many cases 30 statute acres of land would be adequate for that purpose.  It depends on the quality of the land.  In Roscommon, which has the reputation of being a county with fairly good land, 30 statute acres is not regarded as an economic holding, particularly in the case of land which has been divided.  People on such farms are often in straitened circumstances.  I know through business connections and otherwise that they find it particularly hard to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>As to tillage on Land Commission holdings, I should like to know if the Land Commission are complying with the regulations in that respect.  I have a suspicion that they are not.  My travels through County Roscommon make me more suspicious in that respect. In this hour of need, when Europe is faced with very difficult conditions, the Land Commission should put their shoulder to the wheel and make an effort to fulfil their obligations. That work should not be done in a slipshod way.  It has been done <Col N="1860" /> in a slipshod way.  I have seen tillage done by the Land Commission which was no credit to them and the results of which were very bad.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the Land Commission in regard to rates charged for grazing cattle on farms that have been acquired and which remain to be divided.  I know instances where the rates have been excessive.  They varied from £3 for a 1½-year-old beast to about £4 for a 2-year-old or 2½-year-old beast. I consider these charges excessive.  The Minister should be satisfied just to cover his out-of-pocket expenses in allowing cattle on those farms or letting them for tillage or in conacre.  In answer to a question I put down, the Minister admitted that he made a net profit on these farms. That is not right.  I do not approve of it.  There should be no element of profit.  In two instances the Minister admitted that the profit was in the neighbourhood of £100.  That should not be the case.  I also think there should be more supervision in taking in cattle.  I have seen cattle on those farms.  I have seen them roving around those farms where there was not a blade of grass to be got.  I have seen them in October and November, when they were practically unsaleable. Overstocking should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>To-day a Deputy made reference to land agitation in Roscommon.  In that connection I am glad to have an opportunity of referring to a particular case. Even though the matter may be <i>subjudice</i> at the moment I want to say something that might clear the atmosphere and to give my opinion as to what the position really is.  In doing so, I cannot altogether absolve the Land Commission for their conduct in connection with this farm.  As a matter of fact, I am inclined to censure them. I do not like disturbance.  I do not like acts of hostility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieSnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>The court proceedings are over.  I do not approve of lawlessness, but, to a certain extent, the tenants in this locality were driven to <Col N="1861" /> extremes through the inactivity and complacency of the Land Commission. I have received first-hand information as to what the position is.  As far back as 1939, Land Commission officials inspected the farm, but owing to the emergency no action could be taken.  I absolve the Land Commission for their inactivity during the emergency, but there is one thing in respect of which I cannot forgive them, and that is their consent to the sale of this farm to a man in the locality.  At that time I did not have the honour of representing Roscommon, but I understand from the people in the district that their representatives in the Dáil at the time&mdash;I am not going to mention names&mdash;promised them definitely that, when the emergency would be over, the farm would be acquired and divided among the numerous uneconomic tenants in the area.  In that hope the people concerned waited patiently until a certain event took place last December.  They discovered that a gentleman had purchased the farm.  It is reasonable to assume that the Deputies to whom I have referred must have made representations to the Land Commission in connection with this farm.  At least it was stated to the people, and I have correspondence to prove it from one of the Deputies that he made representations to the Land Commission in connection with this farm.</P>
      <P>In such a case, the Land Commission should have withheld permission to purchase.  Had they done so, all this trouble would have been avoided.  I say they made a mistake.  I have received a letter from the Land Commission, dated 3rd March, stating that they had under consideration the question of instituting proceedings for the acquisition of part of the lands which I mentioned&mdash;250 acres&mdash;owned by Mr. George Clarke.  I am delighted to hear that, but there is one point I would raise.  I have no prejudice against Mr. Clarke.  In my opinion Mr. Clarke is a very good and desirable citizen, and a very good neighbour, and, as far as I know, in that particular district there is a spirit of goodwill between the tenants and Mr. Clarke, and I hope to maintain that goodwill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I understand that this man <Col N="1862" /> bought the farm, that he has cleared it of all the timber and that he has realised something in the neighbourhood of £1,500 for timber alone. That, with the income from the farm, for grazing, tillage, etc., should be considered when this farm is being acquired by the Land Commission.  In addition, the responsibility will rest on someone for the replanting of this farm and I should like that responsibility should be fixed on someone.  I do not say on whom, but I do say that if £1,500 worth of timber was sold off that farm someone should be responsible for replanting.</P>
    <P>A rather novel point was raised to me to-day by a constituent, on which I should like to get some enlightenment from the Minister or from his Department, by letter or otherwise.  The question relates to a small farm on the De Freyne estate.  Perhaps it would more briefly convey what I wish to convey if I read a letter addressed by the Minister's Department to the particular tenant concerned:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;2 Eanair, 1946.</P>
    <P>R. O. No. 98/7524 (4/25/7495), Estate C.D.B. (De Freyne).  Mary Leonard and James Leonard. Lands: Erritt.  Revised half-yearly instalment £1 13s. 1d.</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>In reply to your letter dated the 17th December, 1945, I am desired by the Land Commission to inform you that under the provisions of Part III of the Land Act, 1933, arrears amounting to £6 os. 4d. in respect of the above-described holding were funded and made repayable over a period of approximately 50 years by a Funding Instalment of 3s. 0d. which is included in the Revised Instalment of £1 13s. 1d. now payable out of the above-mentioned holding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means, in effect, that this person is paying at the rate of 3/- a year a debt which amounted in 1933 to £6 0s. 4d.  He is informed by the Land Commission that he is to continue to pay that for 50 years, so that in 50 years, so far as I can make out the figures, he will have paid £15.  To my mind that amounts to extortion on the part of the Land Commission.  I should like an explanation from the <Col N="1863" /> Minister as to that.  I should like, in conclusion, to pay a tribute to the Land Commission officials, particularly in the Castlerea area.  I find them courteous, obliging and painstaking. Everything I put before them is dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin) Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the question of uneconomic holdings in the County Dublin.  We have a problem in County Dublin just as we have it in other counties.  It is a rather serious problem, especially in North County Dublin.  There are farmers there who have only two or three acres of sandy land out of which they are trying to make a living.  They have made numerous applications for additional land to the Land Commission.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to expedite the division of land in that area, especially the land which has been taken over by the Land Commission, and to see that these hardworking farmers who are trying to make a living on these small-holdings will have their holdings brought up to the maximum acreage allowed, or as near as possible to it.  I wish to pay a tribute to the Minister for his outlook of what an economic holding should be.  Unfortunately, in County Dublin a number of slum holdings were created some years ago.  I am glad to be in a position to compliment the Minister on coming to the conclusion that an economic holding should consist of from 30 to 35 acres, which will at least give a man a chance to make a decent living and not have to seek work elsewhere to enable him to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a good deal of land in County Dublin which is under water. I know that that is a matter for the Board of Works, but I would ask the Land Commission to make a recommendation to the Board of Works to have such holdings, which are not vested, properly drained.  The question of the revestment of holdings is also an urgent one.  I have forwarded a number of applications for revesting from people in County Dublin and I have received a very favourable reply from the Minister for Lands.  There are also some smallholders in County Dublin who are anxious to get a loan to <Col N="1864" /> buy machinery to till their land.  I should like the Land Commission to give immediate consideration to claims of such farmers who are anxious to do something for themselves and their families and for the country as a whole in the way of producing food.  In such cases special consideration should be given to the revesting of these holdings.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of Land Commission roads in County Dublin is another problem which requires attention.  Over and over again representations have been made in that matter.  I know it will be said that the rural improvements scheme would solve that problem. Unfortunately, when a road is made by the Land Commission leading to six or seven holdings, one farmer will probably not agree to contribute his share when an effort is made to improve the road under the rural improvements scheme.  I should like the Minister to find a solution for that problem so that these roads will be put into decent repair.  Perhaps a recommendation could be made to the county commissioner to take over such roads after some time.  The people concerned are badly handicapped when threshing engines and other heavy machines have to travel over these roads, especially in the winter time. There are also some holdings in the County Dublin which are devoid of water.  I am happy to state that the Minister for Lands, as a result of representations I made to him, has agreed to sink pumps on some of these holdings and I wish to thank him for that.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening Deputy Corry made some remarks with reference to the West of Ireland and County Mayo in particular.  I wish to dissociate myself from these remarks because, as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, I know that the Fianna Fáil policy is directed towards the welfare of every section of the community.  They are not concerned with sectional interests, but with every section of the community.  Deputy Corry's remarks are to be deeply regretted. We all have heard of the old cry: &ldquo;To hell or Connaught.&rdquo;  Sullivan's history tells us that in the whole of Munster neither the voice of the ploughman nor the lowing of cows <Col N="1865" /> could be heard.  It is regrettable that a Deputy like Deputy Corry should make such uncharitable remarks about Irishmen who are living in that part of the country and who are in their present plight through no fault of their own.  I am sure that he was speaking for himself alone and I leave him to judge his own remarks later on.</P>
    <P>I again impress upon the Minister the necessity for asking the Land Commission to divide the few estates they have taken over in North County Dublin.  There are a number of congests in the Rush area especially who are clamouring for land and who are worthy persons to receive land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Burke say that the Minister has defined an economic holding as a holding of 35 acres.  Since I came into this House, I have listened to the same old story on this Estimate.  We have heard all about the division of land, the sub-division of land, and so on, but I want to put before this House now, not the division of land, but the matter of the flooding of land.  Do the Land Commission propose to do anything to relieve people who are suffering greatly by reason of the flooding of their lands for years past?  During certain times of the year, people down in my constituency who hold land to the extent of about 40 or 50 acres are unable to utilise more than 6 or 10 acres because of flooding, and I think it is most unfair to ask these people to pay rates and rent for land which they cannot use.  There should be some relief for these people.</P>
      <P>We had a Bill here some weeks ago which proposes to give the Minister power to take land from people who got it from the Land Commission. Money is spent in giving land to allottees and money is then spent on evicting them from their holdings. It stands to reason that money should be spent in draining land which is flooded at certain times of the year. I will be told that there is a Drainage Act which is to come into operation, but, while waiting for that Drainage Act to come into operation, these people will suffer quite a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a few weeks ago, I asked a question here with regard to relieving <Col N="1866" /> flooding by the sea in Fenit Island. This little island comprises about three hundred acres and eight families live there.  The land is the best you could find in County Kerry and the farmers there are most industrious.  They grow wheat, beet and so on to get an existence for themselves and their families.  Some 20 years ago, a wall was built around the island to keep out the sea.  The wall was stopped at a certain point and I believe that, if it were extended for another 100 yards, it would completely relieve the flooding, and would give these people a chance of saving their holdings.</P>
    <P>I should like also to bring to the notice of the Minister another most important factor.  At a certain point, the road across the island cuts into the sea and the farmers living there must go to their farmyards and homes through a road across the strand.  This road is not the best in Ireland.  It is a road which winds up a very high incline and the people who have to come from the island in the early morning to get to the fairs and markets in Tralee are in danger of being capsized at any moment.  The Minister should take up the matter of having a road made there.  I happened to be speaking to people on the island some time ago and I was told that they were quite willing to give some of their land to those from whom land would have to be taken to provide this road, as they believe it would be a blessing to them and would save them from having to expose themselves to the dangers to which they have to expose themselves at present when travelling through the strand in the early hours of a winter morning on their way to fairs and markets in Tralee.</P>
    <P>As I have said, something must be done to relieve flooding.  My county is probably one of the most hard-hit in that respect.  From my own town, one can see acres of land which were at one time utilised for the growing of the best oats in the country now completely water-logged, and even the train travelling from Tralee to Dingle has been held up for hours because of flooding of the line.  That is disgraceful and shocking in a country like this where <Col N="1867" /> we talk about utilising the land and where we spend money on the division of land when we should be doing some thing to save land which at the moment is flooded.  Travelling back about nine miles from Tralee to Lixnaw and Abbeydorney, one can see great areas of water, where the people even in summer have to put cocks of hay on the embankment.  All this could be remedied by the expenditure of a few thousand pounds, because when breaches appear in embankments, if they are taken in time and repaired, the flooding of many acres of land could be prevented.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Castlemaine district.  The Minister was down there some years ago and he should understand the position.  We, the Deputies of that constituency, have been pestered by these people, and rightly so, to get something done for them and I hold that the Minister should tackle the job. If, as I say, the people have to wait for the Drainage Act, they will have to suffer for quite some time.  We must save the land the people have, and if people are to be asked to pay rent and rates for land they cannot utilise, it is a great injustice.  I ask the Minister to consider giving these people some relief and not to compel them to pay for land they cannot use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the custom, when starting a long-winded oration, to say that you do not intend to speak for very long, but in my case about ten minutes will do, and I will time myself. Deputy Spring has forestalled me to a certain extent, because I proposed to speak on practically the same subject. I am glad, however, that he did so, because he paved the way for me. I received a letter yesterday from the Land Commission&mdash;the Minister has a dual capacity; he is Minister for Lands and Forestry, so that you, Sir, can scarcely rule me out on this&mdash;which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Lands wishes me to refer further to your representations on behalf of a number of persons in the Cahir area who claim their lands are seriously affected by <Col N="1868" /> flooding, due to forestry operations in the area and to state that it is regretted that the forestry division cannot accept liability for any such damage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with the Minister for some time past on this matter, which has arisen in this way.  Quite a lot of land has been planted along the Tipperary mountains, both the Galtees and the Knockmealdowns.  These lands were drained in all cases and naturally a little stream flows down from the mountains, becoming bigger as it comes down.  Burncourt is about three miles from the mountain foot and is planted. Very good work has been done, but it is little satisfaction for the farmers adjoining the mountain to know that their farms are destroyed every spring. That is hardly fair, as they pay rent and rates.  They see these lovely trees growing and great employment given, but they do not benefit a tinker's curse. There is a definite responsibility on the Minister.  If he denies it is for the Land Commission, are we to wait for arterial drainage?  One must remember that &ldquo;hope deferred maketh the heart sick.&rdquo;  When the hundreds of acres there were drained, the silt was formed in the river as a result of the clay washed down and that has blocked the river.  The houses are flooded.  They were safe until the mountains were planted.  Surely there is definite responsibility on the Minister for that and the complaint should be examined?</P>
    <P>I could suggest a way out of it. Those are industrious men, and, if they took the case into the courts, they might be able to get an injunction against the Department.  Of course, I have nothing to say against the Minister personally, as he and the staff of the Department have been most helpful in every way.  In the city, one cannot build a house higher than one's neighbour's in such a way as to interfere with the light.  There are other ancient rights, too, which must be protected, and something should be done in the case I have mentioned. I have always found the Minister to be a helpful gentleman, and think the tributes paid to the Department are well deserved.  When you go in there, <Col N="1869" /> you know you are among friends.  The Minister has set a very good example, and no one has been more helpful in the House than he, as a Minister.  I will not go over the ground which has been ploughed, harrowed and rolled by the various Deputies, dealing with land division and bringing men from the East, South and North.</P>
    <P>We all remember the old saying: &ldquo;To hell or Connaught.&rdquo;  There was a time when nothing was heard, from the Rock of Cashel to Kerry but the lowing of the beast, and the wild men came out from the woods.  These people were driven &ldquo;to hell or Connaught&rdquo;, and we owe a great tribute to Michael Davitt.  I think it was T. D. Sullivan who said that Ireland was too small to be divided into counties.  The State of Texas is many times larger than the whole of Ireland.  Of course, we would not know our football championships only for the counties.  They give a bit of amusement.  There is good stuff in Cork, the best in Ireland, and they will survive when we are all wiped out. I envy the Minister when it comes to dividing 40,000 acres amongst 100,000 applicants&mdash;each will get half an acre. It was Johnny Pattison, the famous Irish clown, who said he was paid 1½d. a year and paid quarterly.  May the Minister be successful in his work of land division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to the flooding caused owing to the defects in the embankments. The repairs and maintenance of embankments are, to my mind, the liability of the Land Commission.  Since I have come here to this House as a representative of the people, I am particularly interested, because in our county we have a very big mileage of embankment.  I suppose it was not possible to deal with it in the emergency period, as the staff was very limited, but I hope that in the near future the Minister will have gangs in various areas to carry out repairs to embankments that have deteriorated to such an extent that large tracts of very good grazing land adjacent to rivers are subject to flooding, both because of breaches in the embankments and because of tidal flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in with the Land Commission <Col N="1870" /> even to-day because of the loss of 50 acres of good grazing land near Dungarvan. As we are facing a post-war period, grazing apart from tillage altogether is necessary, in order to produce our live stock and capture the market likely to present itself to us in the near future.  By providing more grazing land, we will have much more land available for a tillage campaign. If the Minister cannot deal with the repair of the embankments, I hope he will pass it to some other Department to carry out the work.  In one particular instance, I understand the Land Commission tried to get away from their responsibility for carrying out certain repairs.  Where such repairs are carried out by the Land Commission, I think they should hold the responsibility for the maintenance of those embankments.</P>
    <P>In connection with land division, we have heard a lot during the past few days.  In certain areas where parcels of land are available for distribution, the first consideration should be given to the uneconomic holdings.  It is quite likely that, in any particular area, such opportunities may not present themselves for years and years again.  When the opportunity presents itself now, the uneconomic holdings should be made economic and should get the first consideration before new holdings are established.</P>
    <P>Considerable discussion has surrounded the question as to what the size of a farm should be.  That will depend to a great extent on the type of tenant who is selected for such a holding, and the area from which he has been taken.  I always thought that a holding of 30 to 40 acres was a bit on the small side, because of the fact that the capital outlay in the matter of machinery and equipment is as much on the farm of 20 to 40 acres as it would be on a farm of 100 acres.  We have to get horses, ploughs, harrows and other forms of equipment for the small farm as well as for the big one. The 20 to 40 acre farms will demand as much equipment as the 100 acre farm.  I think, with the introduction of some type of co-operative system in the allocation and the operation of machinery on small holdings, you <Col N="1871" /> might overcome that difficulty.  In the present age, with the introduction of different types of machinery, it is quite possible, where you have a small holding, that the outlay to carry on suitable husbandry can be overcome with less machinery.  That would get over the major difficulty, or the economic difficulty, of maintaining the equipment that heretofore had to be maintained.  Farms of 30 or 40 acres would be a suitable size provided you have a tenant willing and able to carry out the work.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy O'Donnell would have gone very extensively into one particular point.  He is always looking for water.  To-day I noticed he was trying to do away with water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to introduce a scheme under which water could be provided on Land Commission holdings.  A lot of applications have been made for pumps.  It would be a good thing if such a scheme were introduced on these holdings.  It will be admitted that a water supply on such a holding is essential to increase production in every respect.  You cannot carry on tillage operations unless you have manure and stock on the land to keep the fertility up to a reasonable standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many comments during the debate about the Land Commission letting land in conacre.  Any man conversant with farming operations will know that the fertility of land after years of cropping is completely gone.  Therefore, in land division, water should be provided.  It is very essential for economic production on the holding and it will be needed for live stock and other general purposes. Even on existing Land Commission holdings, the cost might be added to the annuity or in some other way over a period of years.  It is necessary that the land holders should have an adequate supply of water.  Every farm in the country needs a water supply. There is nothing more essential in the production of milk and live stock.  I <Col N="1872" /> hope the Government will see their way to introduce such a scheme.  It is one of the most important things that could be introduced.</P>
    <P>In connection with embankments, I hope the Minister will see that in the near future this work, which has lapsed for a number of years, will again be undertaken.  Now that the emergency is over, his staff might be available to carry out inspections so that the various schemes may be carried out in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to lodge my little protest against the statement made by Deputy Corry here last night. Deputy Corry, seemingly, never understood, or tried to understand, the reasons why Davitt threw his whole weight into the Land League.  I suppose we have in the West of Ireland the greatest land problem that has to be solved in any part of the country. I would like Deputy Corry to realise that when the fight against the landlords&mdash;and some of the landlords were tyrants&mdash;was on, our people in the West lived practically in a state of starvation and they hung on to their little hen-roosts, as he described them, while they had practically nothing more than potatoes and salt and perhaps a bit of carrageen to live on. Someone told me quite recently that if Deputy Corry acquainted himself with the position in Cork he would find there were over 10,000 small holdings there under, I believe, a £4 valuation. However, that is for the Cork Deputies and for Deputy Corry.  I join in condemnation of any policy that would be contemplated on the basis of Deputy Corry's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time all of us have raised questions here regarding the acquisition of land, or the resumption of certain holdings.  Recently, I had a number of such questions down.  A number of the holdings in question are holdings where the worst type of husbandry has been carried out.  The farmers who own them, if we can call them farmers, had to comply with the tillage regulations and, in order to do so, they bought a few stone of wheat, a few stone of barley or a few stone of oats, ploughed up an acre, threw the seeds into it, and that was all the <Col N="1873" /> tillage they did.  I think the Land Commission have a big duty in that respect.  If the Land Commission, even with the skeleton staff they had during the emergency&mdash;and most of their staff were on tillage during the emergency&mdash;kept their eyes open, they should be aware of where such farms were not properly tilled or where they were let to small land-owners in conacre at such ridiculous prices as £7 to £12 per acre.  That was the position in my part of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry and some other big land-owners in the Dáil are always quite prepared to tell us that tillage is not paying.  I do not know that Deputy Corry comes under that heading as much as other people.  If tillage does not pay us, when we have our land at 10/- an acre from the Land Commission, surely it cannot pay an unfortunate individual who has to put down £12 or £14 an acre for conacre?</P>
    <P>I know of land that should be taken over by the Land Commission and divided amongst uneconomic holders. I know of one instance where there are three tenants, with valuations of 30/-, and the gentleman farmer who owns the place lives 12 or 14 miles away.  That state of affairs should not be allowed to continue.  I wish the Minister would tell the House why, during the emergency years, the staff did not prepare lists of land that it was proposed to acquire.  They could also have prepared schemes for the division of land that has been on their books for many years.  In my constituency the Land Commission has a number of farms which are let out in conacre and for which no schemes of division have been prepared. Now that the staff is back in the Department, I hope that that work will be speeded up.  I am aware that people offered land to the Land Commission in exchange for holdings in the Midlands.  Some people in the Midlands have a grievance against the type of migrant that was brought up there. Perhaps a certain amount of it is genuine.  I know one man with 213 acres of land on which there is no house, who was prepared to give up his land if he got a holding elsewhere.  I told him to put the offer in writing <Col N="1874" /> and to send it to the Land Commission. They have not yet met him to see what might be done about the matter.  That man would be a good type to bring to the Midlands.  I am sure he would be able to compete against the big farmers and others who have been &ldquo;grousing&rdquo; about some of the people who were brought to the Midlands.</P>
    <P>A good deal of money has been spent on grants to enable people to reconstruct houses and, in some cases, to build new houses.  After that was done in some places the Land Commission migrated people from certain townlands or villages.  I do not see why a survey should not be made of such villages, with a view to seeing what the housing conditions were, and how far the Land Commission would be prepared to assist in improving the position, particularly where it was proposed to migrate people, so that the expense of building houses would not be incurred if they were to be changed.  In a number of places people with 70 or 80 acres have been permitted to buy up as many small holdings as they wished to acquire. If that continues it will lead to the creation of ranches.  A complete survey of that position should be made and permission to sell should not be given in such cases.  If we are to deal with the division of land drastic steps will have to be taken.  Drastic steps were already taken in some instances and the people are no better off.  However, if uneconomic holdings are to be improved drastic steps are necessary. Deputy Heskin said that a decision should be come to as to what should be the size of an economic holding.  I consider that size can only be determined by the amount of land available for distribution in a district. Whatever the size, the aim should be to improve the holdings and to bring about a position in which the people could live on them under better conditions.</P>
    <P>A great hardship in many cases arises where there are arrears of annuities.  I am aware of a case where two or three years' annuities were funded.  Later the holding was sold and the purchaser had, as it were, to carry the baby, and to make up the <Col N="1875" /> amount due on the holding.  If any arrears are funded they should not have to be paid by the incoming tenant but should be the responsibility of the person by whom the debt was incurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

      <P>When people go to an auction they sometimes pay more than they intended to pay for an article. This is a matter that the Land Commission should look into, so that whatever might be due on a holding should be paid by the person who incurred the debt.  I hope these matters will receive attention by the Land Commission. I conclude with the hope that the Land Commission will wake up and get a move on.  The Department has been given a rest for the past five or six years, so that if there is a little spurt there now, I am sure it will not put it out of joint.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Deputies talking about 20, 30 and 40-acre farms.  The only thing that I am interested in is that, for those who are going to divide the land, the workers who are going to build these banks, the Minister will insert in any scheme that will be undertaken a fair wages clause because, at the moment, those working under the Land Commission, to my mind, have a starvation wage. That is one thing that has not been mentioned by any Deputy, so far.  The workers dividing the land under the Land Commission should get a fair wage and, as a representative of the working classes, I ask the Minister not to overlook that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my part of the country is concerned, our grievance seems to be quite the reverse of that of Deputy O'Donnell.  In parts of the county, the better part of the land is flooded.  In the last 25 years the Land Commission drained all the bogs but they did not make any outlet from the bogs with the result that good portions of land adjoining fairly narrow streams and main rivers are flooded and the <Col N="1876" /> land is rendered practically useless for at least half the year.  The serious part of it is that there is always danger that crops may be lost.  If floods should occur at a time when the crop is about to be taken off the land, the crop is destroyed.  If, in areas like North Mayo, a small farmer loses his crop, his prospects for that year are very poor.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission certainly carried out a great deal of work in the acquisition and division of land in Mayo in the past 25 years.  They made roads into the holdings but the roads were made on a grassy soft surface and practically no gravelled surface was made, with the result that there are practically no roads there now.  It is impossible to use a horse and cart on them and almost impossible to walk on them.  The Land Commission should undertake a special survey in connection with that matter and in connection with the question of flooding to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry made reference to the farmers of Mayo.  I come from Mayo and I am proud to speak on behalf of the people of Mayo and to answer Deputy Corry.  The farmers of Mayo stand up to their responsibilities as farmers as well as the farmers of Cork or any other county.  If Deputy Corry or any other Deputy refers to the records of what the people of Mayo have done, he will discover that Mayo, having regard to its size, is able to compete with any other county.  In regard to the number of pigs and eggs produced, Mayo will compare fairly well and will be very little behind Cork.  That reflects credit on Mayo when one considers that the average valuation there is slightly over £7. When that is taken into consideration and when one estimates the quantity of pigs, bacon and eggs produced in Mayo as compared with any other county, I do not think Deputy Corry will be in a position to say very much to the farmers of Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister always wishes to be lenient and to treat everybody with fairness. That is my experience.  On one occasion I made representations to him in regard to something concerning my <Col N="1877" /> constituency and I certainly say that the Minister met me very decently and fairly.  I did not succeed in getting the concession I asked for.  I was disappointed then and I am still disappointed. I refer to the complaint I made in connection with the acquisition of a small holding at Foxford.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that decision. I feel it is a decision that should be reconsidered.  The Minister represents the farmers of the Twenty-Six Counties.  He represents the farmers of Mayo and when he is replyin, on behalf of the people of Mayo, he should repudiate the statement that was made by Deputy Corry.  The farmers of Mayo can compare with the farmers of any other county.</P>

      <P>I have listened to a number of speeches on this Vote and all the Deputies who have spoken have a grievance of some kind against the Minister for Lands, but I think more of them have a bigger grievance against Deputy Martin Corry.  It is only a few minutes ago since I parted from Deputy Corry in the Library, and he was delighted with himself.  I think the Minister should be thankful to Deputy Corry because, of all the venom that was meant for the Minister, Deputy Corry has taken the greater part.  All the Deputies who have spoken have some grievance or, at least, they imagine that they have. Naturally, I have a grievance also and, in putting that grievance before the Minister, I am sure he will give it due consideration.  I come from West Cork, where the people are industrious and work hard, because the land there is so miserably poor that, if they did not work hard, they could never exist. I have heard Deputies talking about what an economic holding is.  Some Deputies put it down at 30 acres. Others want to make it more.  If a West Cork man had a 30-acre holding of fairly good land he would make a living anywhere.  My grievance is that while the Minister knows well that there is a very big number of small-holders in West Cork whose holdings are uneconomic, very few of them who applied for land to the Land Commission have had their claims given any consideration.  I should like to point <Col N="1878" /> out to the Minister and to the Land Commission officials who are present here, or to their advisers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whether Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael he is Irish.  I do not care what a man's policy is so long as he is prepared to work for his country.  I advise the Minister for Lands in selecting allottees in future to give due consideration to applications from West Cork.  If these applicants are put down in Meath or Westmeath amongst a colony of migrants from many other parts of the country they will hold their place.  Not alone will they hold their place, but they will show the other allottees how to work a farm.  Not alone will they show the other allottees, but they will show the other farmers the right way to till land. When coming up to Dublin I can see plenty of good land that is neither tilled nor ploughed.  If we had a little of that land in my part of the country, it would solve a lot of our difficulties. I would therefore like to impress on the Minister that he should give due consideration to applications from my part of the country for any parcels of land that he has to allot.</P>

    <P>There are hundreds of young men in my part of the country trying to get across to England.

If these men could get land in their own country, they would work and till it.  They would not have to be prosecuted as some landowners have been prosecuted recently.  If the <Col N="1879" /> land which was parcelled out to others in recent years had been parcelled out to them the Minister would not have to bring in the Bill which he had to bring in lately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that Deputies almost forgot to discuss the Estimate before the House.  Deputies Corry, Cafferky, Flanagan and Donnellan were so aggressive here and spoke so loudly that I felt like the Duke of Wellington; I did not know what effect they would have on the enemy, but, God knows, they terrified me.  I am a timorous and quiet individual, and I could get on very well with Deputy O'Donnell from Tipperary.  He speaks mildly and politely to me.  Because he does so I should like to be very helpful to him in his constituency.  At the same time, I think that altogether too much has been made of Deputy Corry's offence. I think that if Deputy Corry used the words he used rather in sympathy than in the aggressive tone he uses, there would not be half so much criticism directed towards him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes opened discussion on this Estimate by asking what land policy was.  Deputies should be quite familiar with the history of land tenure and with the history of the land revolution which succeeded in placing the tillers of the soil in this country so securely on their holdings. Since 1923 Deputies have discussed in this House a number of Land Bills and the question of land policy arising out of the discussion of these Land Bills.  Every year since 1923, on the occasion of bringing the Land Commission Estimate before the House, Deputies had the fullest opportunity, and they fully availed themselves of it when they had not Deputy Corry to talk about.  Therefore, there is nobody in this House who should need to ask what land policy is.  It has been described pretty often here as a social economic policy not directed to giving specific benefits to individuals, <Col N="1880" /> but to strengthen the social fabric of the nation.  It seems to me that there is no real ignorance as to what land policy is.  Everybody should know it.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in regard to land policy is not so much any disapproval of it as enunciated, but rather the manner in which Deputies allege it has been administered.  There is a specific regulation in regard to land division, which, of course, is considered as the most important point of Land Commission policy.  In the division of an estate, the matter that is in the mind of the Land Commission is not merely dealing with the estate alone, but dealing with all the land economic difficulties in the particular district.  It is the rule that employees on the estate shall have first preference for land, because compensation is due to them for their disemployment.  It is the rule that local economic holders afterwards have first place, that migrants have next place, then evicted tenants, and, finally, landless men, and landless men only when all the other classes are satisfied.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies would do well to try to keep in mind that the policy of the Land Commission is to try to create as many economic holdings as possible, to deal with congestion wherever it exists and to deal particularly with congestion in the scheduled congested counties where the evils of rundale still exist.  I think it is a mistake to give land to landless men.  I think there are enough people on the land and I dislike the idea of putting more people on the land.  The business of the Land Commission is, so far as is humanly possible, to concentrate on the uneconomic holder in the first place, the man who lives in the vicinity of the estate about to be divided, and, when his claims are satisfied, on the migrant.  I do not care where any migrant comes from anywhere in Ireland.  There is a habit recently in this City of Dublin of organising Leitrimmen's Associations.  Kerrymen's Associations and Wexfordmen's Associations.</P>

I think that is ridiculous&mdash;the idea of dividing this country of ours into water-tight compartments. An Irishman, a citizen of this State, under the rules of the Land Commission, is entitled to be put into a holding in any county in Ireland, and it does not matter what opposition has to be met.  The Land Commission have already met it and we will meet it again.  I personally do not think much of the idea of giving land to employees of an estate.  I do not think they make suitable land owners or workers.  I have not seen them to be successful.  I think it is a waste of land and I would prefer to compensate them for their disemployment in some other fashion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been criticism of the people who have been selected for allotments by the Land Commission, and Deputies&mdash;not Deputies like Deputy Morrissey who has a long experience in the House, but many newcoming Deputies&mdash;have the habit of charging the Land Commission with selecting allottees for political reasons.  That is completely untrue.  In the selection of allottees, there are bound to be errors. In every organisation composed of human beings, errors are a natural phenomenon.  The Land Commission acts in the selection of allottees definitely along the lines of a particular policy, without fear or favour or any bias, but the Fianna Fáil umbrellaman, <Col N="1882" /> Deputy Flanagan, has charged us time and again with selecting allottees merely for political reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has alleged, and has continued to allege, that in the old days, when he was a member of a Fianna Fáil club in Mountmellick, no land could be divided in that constituency without the Land Commission inspector calling upon him.  That is untrue and the innuendo that was inherent in Deputy Flanagan's statement last night was that I was afraid to refute his charge in his presence.  This is the Dáil; this is the Parliament of the nation; and if a man, by innuendo or direct charge, reflects on a Department, it is his duty and his privilege to be here to hear the answer.  Some Deputies have conducted themselves for the past few days in a manner which has brought no credit to the Parliament of this nation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the land policy of the future, Deputy Bennett raised a particular question when he asked yesterday if it was not time for us to consider whether there should never again be any disturbance of the farmer, no matter what the size of his farm, who was performing his duty as a farmer&mdash; tilling his land and producing to the fullest extent on the farm.  That gets us around eventually to the size of the holding.  Very different views have been expressed as to what the ideal holding should be.  My view is that the holdings should be of sizes diversified as much as possible, that we should have large holdings and small holdings, and that, except in exceptional circumstances, we should not have very large holdings and again, except in most exceptional circumstances, we should not have very small holdings.  From my experience, I take the view that there should be nothing in the nature of what is called a standard holding.  The more diversified they are, the more they become the complement of each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not market gardeners or horticulturists.  Our job in the Land Commission is to create farms and to put farmers into them, and if the revolution which brought about <Col N="1883" /> security of tenure in this country was a wise one, if it is right to commemorate Davitt and the other men who brought that about, it is right that that security of tenure should be perpetuated and that a man should be able to go into the market and sell the farm which is his own&mdash;if he cannot do that, there is no security of tenure&mdash; irrespective of the size of the farm and irrespective of where it is.  But there is, as we know, a certain amount of land speculation and the Dáil will have to make up its mind, the representatives of the people will have to decide how far such a scheme of things can be approved and how far such a scheme of things can be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where individuals have bought 10, 12 or 15 farms and it has been argued to me, and it is true, that those people are working them perfectly, and to the fullest extent.  I hold the personal view that, even so, it is wrong that that land should be permitted to accumulate to that extent in the hands of individuals.  The man who has purchased 15 farms because as a result of activities in another sphere he has been able to accumulate their price, has brought about what I consider to be economic eviction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned that labourers in Cork would not accept a 30 acre farm from the Land Commission. One evil effect of Land Commission policy in the division and improvement of land very often is to depress the labourer and make his case infinitely worse than it was before any Land Commission activity took place. State expenditure has been undertaken to provide land for individuals arbitrarily selected.  Very often the break up of the estate has created a certain amount of unemployment.  Very often the small farmer is unable to offer the employment or the wages previously given to the labourer.  The activities of the Land Commission along those lines have not been to raise the labourer's status and one of the difficulties I see is that it is very hard to provide an opportunity for an uneconomic labourer to raise himself in the economic scale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1884" /> I would ask the Dáil (not in any hurried or angry way, but calmly) to consider this question of speculation, to decide whether the representatives of the people approve of the accumulation of farm after farm in the hands of any single company or single individual. Let us all bear the brunt then of the policy that has to be created for either the destruction of the evil as we believe it to be or its approval as a good thing if we so believe it to be.</P>
    <P>The English people have a great flair for archæology; they dug up the bones of Cromwell once.  Many members of the Dáil have been constantly engaged here in Ireland, as archæologists, digging up his bones again.  Cromwell must have been an amazing man.  He had a wonderful progeny; his sons are numbered by the thousand in this country.  Strangely enough, Deputy Commons, in talking about Cromwell last evening, made a historical slip. He suggested that the I.R.A. in 1920 were engaged in cattle-driving.  I know what the I.R.A. were doing in 1920-21; they were engaged in an unselfish struggle for the freedom of this country.  An attempt was made by many selfish people in many areas to cash in on the work of the I.R.A., and in Mayo and in many parts of the West attempts were made to cover up, under the idea that it was I.R.A. activity, the work of people who wanted something for themselves and did not give a damn about the nation. I remember very well a discussion by I.R.A. headquarters officers on the question of cleaning up the cattle-drivers in County Mayo&mdash;and they were cleaned up by the I.R.A., and by the County Mayo I.R.A.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons also mentioned Cong forestry.  The difficulty there, again, is that every Deputy wants the development of forestry, but it is like the ploughing for wheat some years ago&mdash;they want it in some other Deputy's constituency.  There may be, among the existing woodlands of Cong, a patch of arable land here and there, but the layout is such that it seems to me, up to date, without having a close examination into the matter, that it would be far better for the national <Col N="1885" /> economy if the whole place were afforested.  However, I am looking into that estate and will communicate with the various Deputies on different sides of the House who have taken up the attitude that Deputy Commons has taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons also mentioned a 500-acre estate in Mayo.  I do not know if representations have been made to the Land Commission in regard to it, but if there is a farm of 500 acres in Mayo that it is possible for the Land Commission to acquire&mdash; considering the tremendous rundale difficulties in Mayo&mdash;I would be glad to hear of it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that another aggressive Mayo man, Deputy Cafferky, has been reading my speeches.  Even if I say it myself, my speeches would be good for him.  While he read them and saw their purport, I am afraid they did not do him any good.</P>
    <P>I suggest that what is wanted from the Opposition is constructive criticism. Deputy Cafferky produced a lot of heat and a lot of sound, but no light.  The only criticism he had to offer of the Land Commission is that it had no foresight because it did not import in 1939 sufficient timber to carry us on, possibly until 1950.  I think the Government showed a good deal of foresight in 1938 and in 1939 by the creation of the Department of Supplies.  To the work of the Department of Supplies is due the fact that we have come through economically, in many ways, the difficulties that existed during the past six years.  But there is no good in any Deputy advocating illegalities.  I think it is a very foolish thing.  It is a wrong thing in Parliament for men who come here as legislators to advocate illegal action. They are here to make the law, not to advocate its breaking.</P>
    <P>If any man from another country was in the House during the debate on this Estimate, any intelligent, fair-minded man, he would find it very difficult to decide what Land Commission policy should really be, in view of the complexity of ideas, opposing ideas, enunciated by various Deputies.  It is difficult, well-nigh impossible, to please <Col N="1886" /> everybody.  The Land Commission has a very difficult job to do and if it goes along the lines of acceding to the demands of certain Deputies, then the ideas of other Deputies must be left high and dry.  Deputy Browne wants roads repaired by the Land Commission and I think other Deputies mentioned the repair of roads, too.  It is not the function of the Land Commission to repair these roads.  The Land Commission has divided the lands, has made roads which are regarded as suitable, has made them as well as possible, and it is up to the tenants to keep these roads in reasonable repair.  Otherwise, it is the duty of the tenant to go along to the county council and strive to get these repairs carried out.</P>
    <P>Why the Land Commission should be asked to be a permanent fairy godmother to every allottee it creates, passes my understanding.  If we have to do that, then we certainly must do it at the expense of the allottees yet unplaced.  If we are to contemplate expenditure in one place, we cannot develop in the other.  The Land Commission has been accused of bad husbandry. Again, the Land Commission was in a very difficult position here.  It had lands on hands; it had to deal with those lands in order to get in line with Government policy in relation to the production of food.  The Land Commission, in 1942, tilled 51½ per cent. of the lands on hands; in 1943 it tilled 49 per cent. of its lands; in 1944 it tilled 48 per cent. and in 1945 it tilled 39 per cent.  And this was the cause, we are told, of creating infertility in the land, of taking the heart out of it or, as Deputy Corry said, taking the body out of it, when he was referring to hen roosts.</P>
    <P>Deputies speak as if the Land Commission had one particular farm and continued to till it in that fashion for six years.  During the six years, 108,000 acres were distributed amongst 7,000 odd allottees.  In 1939, when we started, we had something over 50,000 or 60,000 acres.  We have 40,000 now and much of that has been acquired within the last few years.  Therefore, the land that the Land Commission took the heart out of has been passing away year after year from the Land <Col N="1887" /> Commission and, if we have created a difficulty for the incoming allottee, I am sure the Land Commission will make every effort to be helpful to that incoming allottee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies suggested that, along with giving land to an allottee, we should give him a cash bonus of £200.  This&mdash;Deputy O'Donnell will know the old Tipperary saying&mdash;would be putting another hump on Jack Madden.  I, as a boy, disagreed with the Bible.  I could never see why the poor should always be with us and I could never understand the phrase &ldquo;To him that hath shall be given.&rdquo;  But those old boys who wrote the Bible were wiser than I.  They were no perfectionists.  They knew that men and things should be treated as we find them.  In the division of land, in pursuit of a social economic policy, we provide property to the value of £500 to £1,000, and surely we must expect from the man who is the recipient of such a magnificent gift, that he will be in a position to make the farm, the homestead, offered him a going concern?  I think it is ridiculous to suggest in these days that we should go around to seek men who have no possibility at all of making a success of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot give £200, £300 or any sum.  If we give a loan to a man who has got land of that nature we are putting a millstone round his neck.  He would be better off never to have got a loan.  Embankments have been mentioned by many Deputies.  The question of embankments has been gone into in the Dáil time and again. Deputy Browne suggested that the Land Commission cannot evade its responsibility there.  The Land Commission is not trying to evade its responsibility. The Deputy should know that in most cases where a question about embankments arises, the tenants know that, in nearly all cases, trust funds have been set aside to meet the difficulty brought about by the creation of breaches in embankments.  The Land Commission even stepped outside its commitments in many cases, and where it was found that expenditure would <Col N="1888" /> be rewarded by good results, have taken on such expenditure for the benefit of farmers affected by breaches in embankments.  I will not generalise about any particular embankments that are troubling the consciences of Deputies, but if they submit such cases to me, I will have them examined and tell them whether there is or is not an opportunity to deal with them, or whether it is not the responsibility of the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no such information.  Deputy Morrissey was very kind to me.  He asked if there was a time lag between the acquisition of an estate and its division. In the Land Commission we think that such a time lag is quite undesirable. Before the emergency it was not unusual, on the day that the Land Commission walked into possession of an estate, to have a scheme prepared and the land divided on the same day. A difficulty arose during the past six years.  Owing to having very few inspectors, and very few supporting troops behind them, as well as a shortage of building materials and other difficulties it was impossible to divide acquired estates swiftly.  Deputies can be assured that that delay will now be obviated as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Another matter dealt with was in connection with vesting.  It would be a great matter for the Land Commission that vesting should take place immediately. It would take a good deal of work off the shoulders of the Land Commission, but, in view of the fact that I had recently to bring in a Land Bill, to deal with tenants who have not done their duty, it seems to me that the decision to have a period of probation imposed before vesting is a very wise one.  As I pointed out in my opening remarks on this Estimate, we have speeded up vesting a good deal during the past year.  We have created a new section in the Department, and have speeded up vesting three times quicker than in the past, and it should be possible to speed it up further in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say to Deputies <Col N="1889" /> Beirne and Killilea that under the 1933 Act all arrears, over three years, were forgiven tenants and the three years' arrears were refunded.  The charges in Deputy Beirne's case were quite reasonable. There is such a thing as compound interest.  This is a loan of so much money over a long period and the Government acted equitably in the case of bad tenants owing arrears over three years in funding them.  No real burden is being placed on tenants.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Killilea's suggestion I do not understand his system of logic.  Because a man did not pay his annuities he was given a gift in 1933 by having three years' arrears funded and the rest of the arrears completely wiped out.  Every man going into a market to buy a farm is told exactly the burdens that are on the farm and he knows what he is buying. He fixes his price according to the value of the land and the burden imposed on it.  If he foolishly makes a bad bargain why ask the Land Commission to remove the burden which he accepted as part of his contract with the seller?  That could not be done and should not be done.  I promised Deputy O'Donnell who has always been kind to me that I would go to County Tipperary to examine certain matters that are creating trouble in the Galtees and Knockmealdown.  There are several rugged streams down by the Galtees. They might be in Kerry.  I gravely doubt if it is the operations of the Forestry Department have created trouble in these streams.  I must go there as the Mayor of Cork went at one time to Tipperary &ldquo;<i>infra dig</i>&rdquo;<Col N="1890" /> because if I do not go there will be a good deal of trouble.  I think I have recently answered all questions that were put to me and there are hardly any arguments that have not been fairly met.  I again suggest that charges about there being a political basis for the selection of allottees should no longer be made.</P>

There are not and never have been any politics in the Land Commission.  The Department is completely free in regard to the acquisition and division of land and in the selection of allottees from the authority of the Minister, and when a Deputy charges the Minister or his Party or the Government with malfeasance in office he is making a definite attack on civil servants who are doing their duty to this country under tremendous difficulties.</P>
