      <P>The scheme of continuation education for young people between 14 and 16 years, which we commonly describe as Part V of the 1930 Act, has been in operation in Cork since 1938.  The total figure of young persons between 14 and 16 years then available, from the census, was 2,949.  The total number at school, including primary, secondary and vocational schools, was 1,792, leaving the number not at school 1,153.  As I mentioned in my statement yesterday, the actual attendance annually over a period of years has been over 900.  It may have escaped the attention of some of the wise gentlemen who write for our newspapers that there are considerable changes in population in cities&mdash;in Cork as well as in Dublin, very large changes from what are described as slum areas to new housing schemes in Gurranebraher and other areas outside Cork City boundary.  Of course, it is only in the city area that the Part V scheme, the compulsory scheme, operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying last night that facilities for vocational education exist over a <Col N="642" /> great part of the country and the speeches I have heard last night have encouraged me to believe that success has been achieved through the work of our vocational education committees. I was urging Deputies who are interested in the spread of vocational education and in making greater use of the facilities available to use their influence in their constituencies to see that the utmost possible use is made of these courses which are of the greatest practical value to the young people of our country.  I was also explaining the reasons why the costs of vocational education seem high.  In classes for practical work, I pointed out that the number of students which can be taken was not very much over 20, if so many, and that a teacher had to be provided for such a class, so that comparisons with other branches of education are rather fallacious.  Then there is the question of equipment.  We heard a good deal last night about the necessity for equipping our schools and I am all in favour of it.  Equipment for motor engineering or electrical work is rather costly.  There is also, even in connection with domestic economy classes, as well as other practical work, the cost of materials.  Even where the figures of population in the area where the school is situated make it possible to have full enrolment and there is a good and regular attendance which secures the most economical return from the teaching power available, these things mean that, even where such favourable conditions exist, the cost will appear to be high.  But, in most of our rural areas, our population is rather scattered.  The density is very low indeed even as compared with rural areas in other countries.  I am not referring to Great Britain, I am referring to comparable countries, let us say, on the Continent.  Therefore I feel justified in repeating that we are giving facilities, if only they are availed of, which I am quite satisfied personally are as good and probably better than those available in any other country for the rural population.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that if we do not get full enrolments and regular attendances over the entire period of the courses from the students attending <Col N="643" /> them we are not making the most effective use of the facilities.  We are not making the best use of the teachers and we are not giving the pupil the advantage that he would have if he followed the course continuously and regularly.  If we do not see that the enrolments are kept up, that the attendance is regular and that the hours the teachers spend in instruction are occupied to the best available purpose there will necessarily be a waste of effort.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some feeling that there are fees.  There are fees, but they are small fees.  As Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, vocational and technical education are practically free.</P>
    <P>I was glad to observe that Deputies from rural areas are keenly interested in the extension of these facilities to districts which have not got them.  In these rural areas we have not this advantage, that we have sufficient population to ensure that we are making as much use of the teachers as in an urban centre.  We probably have not the population to keep a staff of four teachers economically employed, although we have staffs of four teachers working very successfully at a number of vocational schools in the country. In other cases we have two-room vocational schools, in areas which do not require the same staffing.  Where we are not able to get the necessary attendance in the rural centre and where, even under compulsion, we might not be able to get such an attendance as to justify keeping four teachers employed at a permanent rural centre, we try, where the attendance is not so satisfactory, or less than we would wish, to employ a teacher as economically as possible.  He or she conducts classes not alone in the day course, which is the ordinary continuation course for pupils from 14 to 16, but there are also night classes, and not alone are the night classes held at one centre, but at perhaps five or six centres within a radius of ten or 15 miles of the school.</P>
    <P>I do not look on the rural vocational school as supplying only the needs of <Col N="644" /> the immediate school area.  I look on it as being the centre of education, not merely continuation education but adult education, for the rural population over this radius of ten or 15 miles, and that is a very important aspect of its work.  As a matter of fact, in the schools that I have visited, situated in towns like Tipperary, for example, I was agreeably surprised to find that a very large number, probably a majority of the pupils, came from rural areas.  I have some figures showing the numbers which come into our schools from the rural areas.  I have a complete list of the enrolments at the day and evening classes under all the schemes, not including Dublin and Cork cities, and I find that so far as the day classes are concerned and excluding town residents 21.6 per cent. of the enrolments come from within three miles and 20.9 per cent. come from over three and under six miles. For over six miles the figure is 12.5 per cent.  These are the figures for 1944-45.  They show that approximately one-fifth came from over three miles and another one-fifth from over three and under six miles.  A smaller number came a greater distance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am pointing out that 55 per cent., as I calculate it, of the pupils in all centres outside Dublin and Cork come from outside the actual town areas.  If Deputies will visit the schools and examine the position for themselves and base their criticisms on that, I will be quite satisfied.  I think there is a certain inconsistency in those who seem to think that we can go straight ahead with compulsory education in rural areas for the period from 14 to 16 and who refuse to face up to the position&mdash;I admit it is the position &mdash;that the enrolments and attendances in the existing vocational schools in <Col N="645" /> rural areas are not as good as they should be.  They are not as good as they should be even in the primary schools.  In certain cases we have absences up to 20 per cent. all through the year&mdash;sometimes perhaps more.</P>
      <P>These attendances are not compulsory. We have to depend on the goodwill of parents; we have to depend on educating the parents to the value of the schools and not to regard them, although it is an important aspect of their work, merely as an avenue towards employment.  The vocational school is not an employment agency. Its purpose is to enable the pupil to get sufficient practical knowledge to enable a boy or girl to work with his or her hands; it will further their chances of getting employment.  If there are local industries available there is no reason why, as has been done successfully in a number of cases, there should not be a liaison between the local factory or industry and the vocational school and the courses in the school should be aimed specifically at providing for those who will enter that factory or industry.  Where we have not that type of industry, factory or other employment, and where the work of the countryside is what is in question, we try, through the rural science and the woodwork and domestic economy courses, to provide education suitable for rural dwellers.  Surely, it ought to be availed of in a voluntary way, or we should try to find the reason why these facilities are not being availed of if that is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a general demand, so far as I could see, for an extension of the facilities throughout the country. Since, apparently, we cannot have a school in every parish, the vocational committee in each county should distribute its schools as well as possible. They should distribute them to the best advantage geographically.  In that way, they will best meet the needs of the population in every part of the area.  Even if we were to try to build an additional room to each national school, we should be faced with the problem in a number of cases of building not one room but two rooms.  I do not believe that it would be possible to teach domestic economy and woodwork <Col N="646" /> or metalwork in the same room.  Before the war the costs of the two-room school varied very greatly.  In some areas we could get a two-room school built for £800.  That was, no doubt, exceptional.  In other areas the two-room school went up to a much higher figure&mdash;almost to £2,000.  If you take into account equipment and provision of fittings, a further 50 per cent. might be added to that figure.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about the figures I have in front of me is the disparity between the figure of £800, or even less, which was achieved in a few areas, and the figures at the other end of the scale, which were in the neighbourhood of £2,000.  Local committees can deal only with local circumstances but the fact that we have that disparity would seem to indicate that, if more attention were given to the matter, we might be able to get things done somewhat more cheaply.  We have now, however, to face the situation that there is an enormous increase on these figures.  I doubt if it would be possible to provide a single room at £1,000 at present.  If one could get that done at £1,500, one would be doing well.  It is almost impossible to give an accurate estimate of present costs.  One has to wait and see what the amount of the tenders for this type of two-room schools, for which certain committees are arranging, will be.  To add a room&mdash;in effect, it means two rooms in certain areas&mdash;to the rural national schools would be an extremely costly proposition.  It would have cost well over £1,000,000 before the war to attempt that.  That does not mean that it would be the most effective way to get educational results, because, as I pointed out, very few of our rural schools would have now the numbers in the upper classes to justify giving them a teacher whole-time or even perhaps to justify occupying a substantial part of the teacher's time during his weekly programme. Remember that there is no saving so far as teaching power is concerned in this arrangement, though it may be suggested that there is some saving in convenience to the pupils.  There is no saving so far as building costs are concerned.</P>
    <P>If the suggestion is that the primary <Col N="647" /> teachers should undertake this work, that is not feasible.  Everybody knows that elementary education is the work of the teachers engaged in the national schools.  They are not trained, nor have they the qualifications, for the practical work required in the vocational courses.  Neither are they trained in the supervision, administration or control of vocational classes, so that we are driven to the conclusion that, if we are to provide vocational education in rural areas, we must group our pupils at some centre.</P>
    <P>I think that anybody who goes closely into the matter and examines it will come to the conclusion that the best solution is to have a permanent centre.  If it is not possible to utilise the teachers fully at the permanent centre, then they should be sent out at intervals to give short courses in the summer period in adjacent areas, so that those who find that the permanent centre is beyond their reach will be able to avail themselves of the facilities thus provided.  We have got these permanent centres in 100 purely rural areas and in a great many of the urban areas.  As the figures I have given show, it is country children who are very largely being catered for in these centres and I am sure that will be the case to an increasing extent now that the difficulties regarding bicycles and transport seem to be disappearing. The vocational classes have appealed to the rural people and it is largely rural children who are attending them.</P>
    <P>Certain areas are not covered by the existing schools.  These might be covered, as I said, by itinerant classes &mdash;short courses when the regular course is finished at the permanent centre about Easter.  In that way, the deficiency might be made up.  On the other hand, if there are large areas which have no post-primary facilities and no facilities for continuation education, we ought to try to provide those facilities.  The only way to do that which I can suggest is to have a permanent centre&mdash;to select the place where you are likely to get the best attendance, where you can make the best use of your teaching staff, where <Col N="648" /> you are likely to have night classes which will mean that the time of the teachers will be fully occupied and from which you can provide the surrounding parishes with short courses in the summer period.  We are trying, through the rural science and other courses, to provide for the needs of the rural population.  If there is any reluctance, as suggested, to attend the schools, it is due to lack of appreciation of the advantages which are to be obtained from attending them.  I was glad to hear Deputy O'Donnell referring to country crafts.  Country crafts are, undoubtedly, dying out.  One of the reasons I am interested in vocational education, one of the reasons I stand for it, defend it and ask for co-operation in making it more successful is that I believe that it is education for the countryside&mdash;not only for the young people but for the adults, and that we can do a great deal to make country life more happy, more sociable and, at the same time, to introduce the practical benefits of enabling young farmers, their wives, sisters and daughters, to learn things that will be useful to them in their day to day vocation.</P>
    <P>I believe that very much.  I believe that country crafts can be kept alive to a certain extent through co-operation with voluntary organisations like the admirable Irish Countrywomen's Association which is trying to do for our young girls, our farmers' daughters, what the Young Farmers' Clubs are trying to do for the farmers' sons.  With the co-operation of these excellent organisations, the school and the vocational centre can be made a real centre of rural life where there will be courses, lectures, discussions, debates, concerts, céilidhthe, and so on.</P>
    <P>One hears a great deal about the Danish Folk School.  Everything that the Danish Folk School can provide, and a great deal more, is being provided in our vocational school.  The Danish Folk School provided what the Gaelic League provided, but which was not necessary here.  We had the spirit of nationality permeating all our education&mdash;love for our language and <Col N="649" /> love for our history.  Attention is given to them in the vocational school, but not over-attention.  The object of the Danish Folk School was to deal with national history, national literature and the national language rather more than the practical crafts, though they, of course, also have their place. So that we are getting really far more, if we will take advantage of it, from the vocational schools in the rural areas than the Danes are getting from the courses provided in their famous Folk School.</P>
    <P>Does anybody suggest that if a parent sends his child to a university or secondary school to follow a particular course that he is not entirely free to select the course that suits and that he considers most advantageous? Why is it suggested that parents who send their children to vocational schools shall not have some say in the courses?  We may consider they are wrong in their choice.  We may consider that they should select courses that have a rural bias.  But let us be honest with ourselves and admit that a great many people want to get away from the country.  They feel that they have better opportunities, better prospects of employment, better remuneration in any vocation other than agriculture.  Why do not we face that position?  You cannot change that situation simply by saying that all our vocational schools are going to deal with rural science and ancillary subjects and nothing else.  That is a very big question indeed, like the question of domestic servants.  One would imagine that there was some stigma about domestic service.  When I was teaching in a vocational school we had to have one class for the domestic servants and another class for the shopkeepers' wives.  That state of affairs is changing now.  Domestic servants, like every other class that work with their hands, are having their position in the world greatly improved.</P>
    <P>We will never go back to the old situation, in my opinion, and let us face it.  The people who are working hard with their hands are entering on a new phase.  They are entering into new circumstances in the world and <Col N="650" /> they will have to be paid more, in accordance with the troublesome, toilsome work they do, than they have been in the past.  The vocational schools are not for the purpose of providing domestic servants.  Supposing vocational schools did provide domestic servants and that we had thousands of girls trained every year to go into that service, it is not a question of vocational education whether we should let these girls out of the country or not. Does Deputy Roddy suggest that we ought to stop them?  If he does, that is a very big issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I did suggest is that there should be special courses in vocational schools for domestic servants. Deputy Moran mentioned that a number of girls attend vocational schools, especially in towns, for the purpose of learning shorthand, typewriting and book-keeping, that when they get their final certificates there are no openings for them, and that very often they have to leave the country.  Domestic servants are probably better paid than typists or bookkeepers, or at any rate, are paid as highly.  The Minister himself referred to a stigma attaching to domestic service. The Minister has an opportunity of removing that stigma and of raising the status of domestic servants.  There are hundreds of openings in this country for domestic servants and there is no necessity for a very large number to emigrate.  I do suggest that the Minister should consider very seriously the advisability of issuing a certificate for girls who have attended a course of instruction in domestic service with a view to raising the status of that service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said a short time ago that if they draw up a balance sheet and put on one side what they are receiving and on the other side what they are paying out and the losses in the way of inferior food and the lack of the company of their families and of their friends that they enjoy in this country, and other material things of that nature, they will find that the balance sheet will not bring out such a profit as is made to appear.  It is, in my opinion, part of the spirit of the age.  Young people want to get away. I suppose we all want to get away at some time or other unless we feel that we have an assured future wherever we were reared, unless we know we will get employment there.  We like to get away.  Young people like to have freedom. They like to be independent and there may be a certain desire also to get away from supervision and to go to some place where one can be one's own master or mistress.  In any case, it is not a matter that vocational education can deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have suggested to persons interested in this matter that an experiment should be made of setting up a bureau controlled by experienced ladies who have a knowledge of domestic economy and everything connected with it and from this bureau these girls, provided they were assured of reasonably good wages and reasonably good conditions, might be made available, if the bureau were in touch with the vocational education committees. But, of course, it is only in the home and it is only under the supervision of a mistress that a girl can learn her duties satisfactorily.  She can learn a certain amount in the vocational school, but you cannot reproduce there the conditions of a home where there are children and where there is <Col N="652" /> work to be done from an early hour in the morning until late in the evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not facing up to the issue squarely.  The subjects which domestic servants must know are taught in vocational schools at the present time.  Surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility to group those subjects for the purpose of ensuring that girls who qualify in those subjects will be granted some form of certificate which will give them a certain status which they otherwise would not have.  The fact that a girl possesses a certificate and is thereby able to claim a decent wage, probably a better wage than the typist would get, will encourage other girls, who are looking for higher appointments now, to enter domestic service.  That is a problem which is facing the country at the present time and I suggest it is the duty of the Minister, through the vocational schools, to make some effort to solve the problem or to help towards a solution.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in so far as they can and in so far as the prospects available to girls locally can be said to be satisfactory. I know from personal experience that many of the domestic economy instructresses try to find employment for girls here and are anxious, knowing the difficulties that housewives, especially young wives with children, are faced with, to help them.  But if the prospects are admittedly better outside and if people choose to go, it is very hard to stop them and it is a very big question, which would have to be debated fully, how you are going to stop them.</P>

      <P>It will be different entirely in the future and it will have to be faced in a different way.  As regards accommodation in the City of Dublin, I was glad to hear Deputy Martin O'Sullivan referring to the building programme which the Dublin Vocational Education Committee proposes to proceed with.  Even if all these schools are built, that will only provide for a proportion.  Five regional schools would not provide for more than about 2,000 students, while we have about 9,000 to whom the school leaving age, if raised to 16, would apply and for whom we would have to provide facilities.  The Dublin committee at present cannot find sufficient accommodation for those who want to attend voluntarily and feels that it would require at least five new regional schools to provide facilities for that class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Knowing that the Commission on Youth Unemployment intend to recommend the raising of the school leaving age, I had already suggested in 1944 to the Dublin City committee the advisability of being prepared to give effect to such proposals in their area, even on a part-time basis.  The committee did not favour the part-time scheme and preferred to go ahead providing schools for those who would come in voluntarily for full-time attendance at the regular courses.  I agreed to their point of view and told them they could go ahead.  I informed them that the approval of the Minister for Finance had been given to me and <Col N="655" /> that I was in a position to assure them that they would have the necessary financial aid for this purpose.  Therefore, the only point that arises now is the speed with which the committee can make these facilities available.  If Deputy O'Sullivan and the other Dublin representatives were here, I would ask them to take a personal interest in this matter and do everything possible to speed up the work of providing sites for these schools and get the buildings erected as soon as possible.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1946&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget statement this year announced his intention of asking the Dáil to vote an increase in the agricultural grant in order to allow further rate relief to occupiers of agricultural land.  At the time the announcement was made the county councils were well advanced in the preparations for levying the rates for the current year. Accordingly on the Dáil approving of the Minister's proposals, the councils had to be instructed to take steps to make the additional relief available in respect of the present rates.</P>
      <P>As these reliefs differ from those provided for in the existing law, which is contained in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1939, it is necessary to bring in this amending Bill to give statutory authority to them and to the action which has been taken by the councils in anticipation of such authority.  The Bill, I should emphasise, also makes provision not only for the increased grant in relief of rates this year, but for next year as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, I am sure, the agricultural grant had its origin in the Local Government Act of 1898, and by reason of that fact, it has preserved in its allocation many features which arose <Col N="656" /> out of the circumstances of that time. It amounted originally to one-half of the total amount raised by poor rate and county cess off agricultural land 50 years ago.  For the whole of Ireland it was over £727,000, of which almost £600,000&mdash;£599,011 to be exact&mdash;was the share of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The agricultural grant remained at the sum at which it had been fixed until 1925.  In that year the Oireachtas doubled the grant, thus increasing it to £1,198,022, at which figure it remained until 1931, when an additional sum of £750,000 was voted.  In the following year, that is, the year 1932-33, the grant was again increased, this time by £250,000.  For this allocation a new and novel basis was adopted.</P>
    <P>The new grant was intended mainly to benefit the small farmer and was divided between the counties in proportion to the valuation of all holdings under £10, and for the first £10 of larger holdings, and was applied to the relief of rates on such holdings or parts of holdings.  The addition of £250,000, to which I have referred, brought the total grant up to £2,198,022, which was the largest amount given in any year until the present.  In the years following 1932-33 various changes were made in the amount of the grant and in the principles on which it was allocated until, in 1939, the Oireachtas passed the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, by which the grant was fixed at £1,870,000 and the method of allocating and distributing it which has heretofore obtained was settled.</P>
    <P>I assume, and I trust correctly, that it is not necessary for me to recount in full detail the main provisions of the 1939 Act.  Briefly, it provided for the application of the agricultural grant to the relief of rates in three allowances which were known as the primary, the employment and the supplementary allowance, respectively.  The primary allowance was given in respect of the rates on the first £20 valuation of every holding.  Where the total valuation of the holding was less than £20, the primary allowance was given on the whole valuation of that holding. Where the owner had male relatives, or other men, employed on the holding a further limited allowance was given <Col N="657" /> towards the rates on that valuation of the holding which was in excess of £20, and this constituted what was known as the employment allowance.  Finally, the supplementary allowance was given in relief of the rates on that portion of the valuation of the holding in respect of which no other allowance was obtainable.  Under the 1939 Act, the procedure for settling the amount of the allowances and determining the various rates of relief was somewhat cumbersome and perhaps even arbitrary.  One of the merits which I think may be claimed for the present Bill is that it sweeps away many anachronisms and anomalies, and provides that the distribution of the allowances will be governed by simple mathematical formulae which will uniformly apply to the country as a whole.  Last year, as the House knows, the distribution of the grant was governed by the 1939 Act.  Out of the total of £1,870,000 available under that Act, the primary allowances took £1,212,740, the employment allowances took £351,298 and the supplementary allowances £297,093. The balance, amounting to £8,869 of the total grant, went to certain urban areas that had been constituted or whose boundaries had been extended since 1898.  Under this Bill, the amount of the allowances under all heads will be very substantially increased.  Thus, according to the estimates supplied by the county councils, the primary allowances will take over £1,820,000 as against £1,212,740, employment allowances will take about £590,000 as against £351,298, and the supplementary allowances over £460,000 as against £297,093.</P>
    <P>In drafting the new measure which is to provide for regulating the distribution of these increases, the principle originally embodied in the scheme for 1932, that the greater need of the small farmer in this matter of rating relief must be provided for, has been retained. Whilst effecting this, however, it is also proposed, as I have mentioned, to bring about a general uniformity in the rate of the primary allowance.</P>
    <P>I have already reminded the House that in the beginning the agricultural grant was equal to half the poor rates <Col N="658" /> and county cess as they stood 50 years ago, but since then the rates have become widely different as between one county and another, so that, notwithstanding the efforts which have been made from time to time to secure greater uniformity of treatment over the State as a whole, great disparities still exist between the ratio of the grant to rates in the several counties.</P>
    <P>The generous grant which this Bill provides for offers an opportunity to remedy this situation, and due advantage has been taken of it.</P>
    <P>Henceforward the rates as they stood in a particular county 50 years ago will no longer affect the allocation or distribution of the agricultural grant and, what is perhaps equally important, it is not proposed to fix the grant at all in relation either to the primary or the supplementary allowance.</P>
    <P>The amount of the grant will be what is needed to give the increased reliefs under these heads whatever that sum may be.  This represents I think a concession of very great value indeed to the local authorities and to the agricultural community and I am sure will be fully appreciated by them.</P>
    <P>After the passage of this Bill the primary allowance rate, which is the rate of relief given on all valuations up to £20 and on the first £20 of higher valuations, will be three-fifths of the general rate for the year and will, therefore, vary as the rate varies.  This, I am sure, will commend itself to the Dáil.  It is certainly, as I have said, an arrangement much more equitable in itself and much more favourable to the county councils than that hitherto obtaining.  The supplementary allowance rate will be fixed at one-fifth of the general rate and will be allowed on the whole valuation above £20.  At present, as we know, it is allowed only on that part of the valuation above £20 which does not rank for employment allowance.</P>
    <P>In addition to these two allowances, there will be an employment allowance but it will be at a very much higher rate than the existing allowance. Hitherto the employment allowance varied according to the primary rate of relief&mdash;on the average it worked out at about £3 for each worker.  As, however, <Col N="659" /> a supplementary allowance was granted in respect of any valuation over £20 for which an employment allowance was not obtainable, the net advantage to the occupier who had a man at work was only about 30/-, because if he did not get an employment allowance he got a supplementary allowance.  Under this Bill, the average net employment allowance will be more than trebled, for it is proposed to raise the allowance to a maximum of £6 10s. per man employed and to make it a uniform rate throughout the country. Hitherto the employment allowance rate varied by counties between the limits of 4/8½ and 8/8, because it varied with the primary allowance rate.  Subject to the maximum prescribed by Section 7 (1) (c), it will be allowed both this year and next year in every county at the rate of 10/- in the £ on each £ of the valuation above £20.  Perhaps an example will give the Dáil a better appreciation of what is intended.  If, for instance, an occupier of land valued at £33 has one man, either relative or employee, at work he will get by way of relief: first, 3/5ths of the general rate on £20, then 1/5th on £13, which is the part of the valuation above £20 and, in addition, he will get the employment allowance of £6 10s., that is 10/- in the £ on £13.</P>

      <P>He will get a credit note for £6 10s.  I was proceeding to take the context of the Bill and to explain briefly the purport of its several provisions.  I take Section 1, naturally, to start with.  The general rate, for the purposes of this Bill, is defined in Section 1.  Except in County Dublin, the general rate means the rate levied over the whole of a county health district for any purpose except the defraying of charges for compensation for criminal injuries.  I should mention here that in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall deal with them later.  If the Deputy bears with me I hope I shall be able to explain <Col N="660" /> any difficulties that appear in the context of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister I am very interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already mentioned that in relation to this definition, a special position obtains in County Dublin.  In Cork County the circumstances are also peculiar because in that county there are three county health districts and each of them has its own general rate.  The money value to individual ratepayers of the relief will vary, not only with the amount of the valuation and the employment they give, but also with the level of the general rate.  The effect of that in Cork might perhaps be explained. Hitherto all occupiers of agricultural land in County Cork received relief at a uniform flat amount, irrespective of the varying general rates in the three county health districts.  Thus the relief given by way of primary allowance was at the rate of 6/8 in the £.  This applied in the North, South and West Cork County Health Districts.  Henceforward, however, under this Bill in Cork, as elsewhere, the primary allowance will be the equivalent of a definite and prescribed fraction of the general rate in each of its county health districts, that is to say, three-fifths, while the supplementary allowance will likewise be definite and uniform at one-fifth, and the employment allowance similarly definite and uniform at the rate of 10/- in the £ on every £ of valuation in excess of 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned and I am stressing, that under the Bill uniformity in the ratio of the allowance to the rate will obtain over the whole country and this will include Dublin County.  But in that county, although there is only a single county health district, in contra-distinction to Cork where there is in one county three county health districts, there are three public assistance districts, each of which has a different rate.  It is to meet this case that the reference is made in Section 1 to a public assistance district when defining the expression &ldquo;the general rate in the pound.&rdquo;  The primary and supplementary allowance will, of <Col N="661" /> course, represent exactly the same fractions of the general rate in each public assistance district in County Dublin as they do in each county health district throughout the rest of the country, that is to say, three-fifths and one-fifth respectively, and the employment allowance will be reckoned, as elsewhere, at the rate of 10/- per £ of valuation over £20 and will be subject to the same maximum.</P>
    <P>A further important consequence flows from the definition of the general rate as given in the Bill.  I think this may perhaps touch on the question which Deputy Hughes was anxious to have answered a moment ago.  This definition makes it clear that, for the purpose of the Bill, all rates levied over the whole of the rating area, county health district or public assistance district, as the case may be, for any purpose except for defraying charges for criminal injuries will be regarded as part of the general rate.  Some counties will find this a substantial concession for, in a county where charges such as charges for piers and harbours, repayment of loans for housing and sanitary services, charges for public lighting and fire fighting, are listed amongst the separate charges but are in fact levied equally over the whole county health district, the rates of these charges will all be included in the general rate and the grant will go to the relief of such rates so far as they are assessed on agricultural land.  They may be listed as separate charges but if they are levied over the whole of the rating area, they will count for relief under the section. I should point out, however, and I want to emphasise, that separate charges for such services as water, sewerage and light assessed on groups of townlands of former rural districts, will not rank for relief.  Relief will only be given where the charges are spread over the whole of the rating area, the county health district or the public assistance district, as the case may be. I trust that this is well understood.</P>
    <P>Section 2 prescribes the period for which the Act will be operative.  As the Minister for Finance indicated, it is not intended that the new employment allowances should remain permanently at their present value.  It is to be hoped <Col N="662" /> that in normal times an efficient Irish agriculturist will be able to pay his employee a decent wage without artificial subventions of this kind.</P>
    <P>Therefore Section 2 of the Bill limits the operation of its provisions to this financial year and next, but as the Minister for Finance pointed out, in his Budget statement, the Government will be as interested as the farmers in keeping local rates within reasonable bounds, seeing that it will have to provide by general taxation each year for three-fifths of the rates on the first £20 valuation of agricultural land and one-fifth of the rates on land valuations above £20.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the fact that certain provisions of the present measure may be of temporary effect only and because the administrative machinery for the new proposals is to be found in the existing provisions of the 1939 Act, the present measure, as those who have studied it may have noted, constitutes a graft on the Act of 1939.  It is this fact which has determined the manner in which Section 3 has been drafted.  The section provides, first, that the additional agricultural grant of £370,000 which was given under the Act of 1939 will continue.  This, added to the earlier grants under the Acts of 1898, 1925 and 1931 brought the total grant, as I have already reminded the House, in relief of rates on agricultural land up to £1,870,000.  But there is a striking departure from existing practice set out in sub-section (2) of the section.  This sub-section provides that the county councils will be entitled to get the difference between the sum allocated to them under Section 4 (3) (a) of the 1939 Act and any deficiency in their revenues which but for the new increase in the grant would arise out of the new reliefs granted by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> The grant under the Bill therefore will be added to the existing agricultural grant and treated in all respects as the existing agricultural grant, but it will provide the local authority with the full amount required to give the reliefs contemplated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the ascertainment of the &ldquo;specified valuation&rdquo;.  In this connection, the Dáil will remember that a new rating system was prescribed in the Local Government Act of this year for land in urban districts.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill do not apply to such land and it has accordingly been necessary to redraft the provisions of Section 2 of the 1939 Act, which relate to the ascertainment of &ldquo;the specified valuation&rdquo;.  This has been done in Section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It will be noted from the phraseology of the section that the significant changes consist in the dropping of sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the earlier Act and the substitution of the expression &ldquo;a rating area&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;county&rdquo; wherever the latter occurs in the remainder of the old section.</P>
    <P>The scale of primary allowances is prescribed by Section 5.  It is to be equivalent to three-fifths of the general rate.  It may happen that an occupier has holdings of land scattered over a county.  Under the section these are aggregated and treated as one but as the rate of relief may be different in different parts of the county it is necessary to make provisions contained in sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 5 in order that county councils may deal with such cases on uniform lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>That will increase the calculation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so.</P>
      <P>Section 6 deals with the new supplementary allowance.  As I have already explained, it differs from the old in being an allowance on the whole of the valuation above £20, whether any part of that valuation is covered by an employment allowance or not, and it will be at the fixed rate of one-fifth of the general rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> The provisions relating to the employment allowance will be found in Section 7.  This section raises the employment allowance to 10/- in the £ on the valuation above £20 and fixes the maximum employment allowance for each man at work, whether relative or employee, at £6 10s. od.</P>
    <P>In view of the increase in the allowance, it is necessary to provide that all the employment allowances that an occupier may receive shall not exceed four-fifths of the general rate on the valuation above £20.  Otherwise the actual amount of the rates on that part of the valuation might be exceeded by the reliefs.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 7 is a new provision.  Under the Act of 1939, a county council could not receive claims for employment allowances after the date on which the rate was made. The reason for this was that they had by then distributed all the grant except a small portion which they kept in reserve and would not have a sufficient balance of the grant from which fresh claims, if they were numerous, could be met.  Under this Bill the grant will not be fixed.  As may be seen from sub-section (2) of Section 3, it will be whatever is necessary to make up the deficiency caused by granting the reliefs.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to me by Deputy Sheldon that in some counties farmers had not put in claims to employment allowances before the rate was made and were surprised when they found that they had not got the allowances they anticipated.</P>
    <P>It is proposed since it can be done conveniently, to allow county councils to accept claims up to the 1st February in the financial year in respect of which the employment allowance is claimed.</P>
    <P>Section 8 safeguards any occupiers whose rates on land this year under the Bill might be greater than they would be under the Act of 1939.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will allow of the relief of rates being given by way of credit notes this year.  Wherever they could not be given by way of abatement of the rate shown on the demand note, <Col N="665" /> it was necessary to issue credit notes, and this validates such issues.</P>
    <P>Section 10 suspends the operation of sections of the Act of 1939 which will be temporarily superseded by this Bill. Section 11 of the Act of 1939, which contains provisions in relation to urban districts, has been wholly superseded by the Local Government Act, 1946, but the repeal will not come into operation until next April.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to Section 12 of the Act of 1939, which is partly repealed by the Act of 1946.  I do not think that the remaining sections call for any explanation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface my remarks on the Bill by dealing with one particular observation which the Minister made.  He said that he hoped to arrive at a time when the efficient agriculturist will pay decent wages without artificial subventions of this kind.  I want to tell the Minister that this is not an artificial subvention.  This is a relief of something which should never have been there&mdash;a tax and a heavy burden on the raw material of the industry. Within the last 12 months we listened to a very long speech from the Minister elaborating on the necessity of expanding production and utilising the British market for our exports.  I take it that any form of relief of this sort is to help the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that, if he was really sincere in the views which he expressed at that time, he might compare the position of the agriculturist here who pays wages, with the farmers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland who also pay wages, both selling in the same market.  The Minister was concerned about the development of that market and recapturing that market.  So far as Irish agriculture is concerned, he must realise in connection with these artificial subventions he talked about, that the British and Northern Ireland farmers have no rates on their agricultural land and that, notwithstanding this relief, the Irish agriculturist paying wages still has to meet a considerable rate and that there has been a very substantial increase in rates in recent years.  As we are dealing with the main <Col N="666" /> industry of the country and as this provision is made to help and foster the main industry, I want to say to the Minister, arising out of that observation of his, that if we are to have efficient agriculture and expanded production we must rely, not merely on the farmer and financial assistance and help to individual farmers, but on a properly-directed Government policy.</P>
    <P>I think it will come as a shock to farmers all over the country this morning to find that one of the results of the recent mission to London of the Minister for Agriculture on his way back from Copenhagen is that Irish turkeys are now to be put into the foreign class on the British market.  Heretofore we were always classed as British and sold our turkeys there on the same terms as the English farmer.  Now we are to take a reduction of 9d. per lb. for first-class birds.  During the emergency, Irish birds were not merely better than foreign and colonial birds, but they were better than Norfolk birds in the British market.  The result of the announcement made this morning is that our turkeys are to be put, not into a colonial class, but a foreign class. They are to be put in the same category as Argentine or Hungarian turkeys.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering whether there have been recent talks with the United States, whether we are to have trade with the United States and not with Great Britain, whether the Imperial preference which the Minister talked about in the last few months&mdash;we are all very interested in the policy he adumbrated for the country then&mdash;has now gone completely by the board when we have a very considerable portion of our produce classed as foreign going to the market about which the Minister talks so much.  One would expect anyway, after 15 years of Ministerial experience, that the Minister would be a bit realistic about the whole position when he talks about help and assistance from artificial subventions and that he expected he would have more efficient farmers in this country capable of paying decent wages.  He cannot overlook, and no one can overlook, <Col N="667" /> the conditions under which the Irish agriculturist has to produce and sell his produce.  If an inept Ministry is incapable of providing favourable marketing conditions, then I suppose we will be looking, not merely for assistance of this sort, but for much greater assistance.</P>
      <P>However, so far as this whole problem is concerned, I welcome the provision of £1,000,000; but we certainly say that it must be permanent. I cannot see that there is any hope of rates coming down after two years. The Minister must realise that that cannot possibly happen in view of the programme before the country for housing, his grand plans for road construction, and so on.  It is grossly unfair to throw back the burden in the form of a tax on the raw material of the primary industry of the country, particularly when that industry has to compete with British and Northern Ireland farmers in the British market. The Minister indicated that the relief provided 15 years ago at the inception of this scheme represented 50 per cent. of the total rates on agricultural land. He also told us that in 1932 the amount of agricultural relief provided was £2,198,000.  He did not tell us that at that time the rates levied on agricultural land amounted to £1,260,000, while in 1945-46 they went up to £3,207,000.</P>

      <P>The relief for last year, as the Minister indicated, was £1,870,000.  The aggregate assessment made this year is £5,400,000.  In 1932 it was £2,403,000.  It has gone up by £3,000,000.  With the jump of £3,000,000, the Minister is now clapping himself on the back for providing this relief of £1,000,000 for two years only.  I submit that that subvention must be permanent and that, not only must it be permanent, but it must be progressive.  If we are to look forward to progress in agriculture, you must relieve agriculture of that burden and that tax.  If the Irish agriculturist has to sell against British and Northern Ireland farmers, we must march in step as far as the conditions <Col N="668" /> under which he is producing are concerned.</P>
      <P>When we turn to the wages paid in this country and the wages paid in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, we find there is a very big disparity, and the Minister must agree that that is not desirable.  I have nothing to say by way of criticism so far as the policy of relief is concerned, but I say it is not enough; that it must be greater, and that the policy must be to provide relief in a progressive way, rather than for two years and then step it down again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As was stated in the course of the debate on the Rent Restrictions Bill, when it was going through this House, there are numbers of factors which have contributed to an aggravation of the position concerning the controlled type of house and, in fact, to the general housing situation. Since 1939 there are fairly substantial numbers of people who are richer, but there is a very great number of people who are poorer as a result of the control of wages and the rapid increase in the price of the various commodities that these people have to buy.  We also experienced an almost entire cessation of building work, in so far as the construction of new houses was concerned. The result is that the large numbers of people who were looking for accommodation in 1939 have been added to by the numbers who, since then, have married or are looking for alternative accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who have made money either directly or indirectly out of the war have been put in the position that they are prepared to pay far higher prices for houses than they would have been had the war not benefited them. At the other end of the scale numbers of people have had their wages controlled; they find their incomes inadequate to meet existing needs. The price of houses has been forced <Col N="669" /> up by the people who benefited by the war on those whose incomes are at the same level as before the war, or who may have received a very small increase. The people whose incomes have not increased, or who have received only a paltry emergency bonus, have to compete with large numbers who are infinitely better off.  The prices of houses since 1939 have far outstripped the incomes of the majority of the people who are looking for accommodation.</P>

      <P>The debate went off the rails a bit; it developed into a very wide debate on the housing shortage.  The object of the motion is to get the Government to codify the Rent Restriction Acts into a fair rent code.  That is rather limited in scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to take the discussion very far from the subject-matter of the motion.  As a result of the factors which I have outlined, people who require houses, who are anxious to secure accommodation, find themselves, as it were, between two millstones.  On the one hand there are houses controlled and in many cases people are unable to get sufficient accommodation in these houses and, on the other hand, they are forced, if they want to purchase a house, to raise a mortgage.  Many people are thus taking over financial commitments which they will be unable <Col N="670" /> to meet.  They are forced to apply for a loan or raise a mortgage and the prices ruling at the present time are far in excess of the value of the type of house these people are buying. Perhaps that is not strictly within the Minister's sphere, but I suggest it is a matter he should not leave out of consideration when he is discussing the subject with the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rent control was brought in at the end of the first world war, but the factors which have contributed to the continuation of this control are factors which, while not within the Minister's activities in the normal way, must be present to his mind.  One serious flaw in the 1946 Act is that dealing with furnished flats.  Under Section 3 a flat is not controlled if the commodities provided by way of furniture and the services associated with furniture equal 25 per cent. of the rent.  The situation that has developed is that if a landlord provides a limited quantity of furniture, it is invariably the practice that that furniture is taken to be equal to 25 per cent. of the rent.  The result is that with quite a small supply of inadequate and inferior furniture a landlord is able to evade the provisions of the Act and he can charge a very substantial rent for limited accommodation.  If he increases the rent he must increase the furniture to keep in step.  The furniture brings the landlord outside the provisions of the Act and forces the tenant to pay well for limited accommodation.  No matter how a flat may be supplied with amenities, and no matter how large or comfortable it may be, it affords limited and unsatisfactory accommodation. So far as I can see, this section of the Act does not meet the situation it was designed to meet.  As soon as there has been sufficient opportunity for the working of the Act to be tested, I suggest that the Minister should inquire as to whether or not this section has effected its purpose. There is a general complaint that it has not.  I suggest that some standard system of valuation should be adopted. Although the Circuit Court and the District Court provide reasonably satisfactory tribunals, there is no set standard on which the valuation of <Col N="671" /> furniture can be assessed.  The normal procedure is that a valuer is engaged to give his view as to the value of the furniture from the standpoint of the landlord and that the tenant engages a valuer to estimate the worth of the furniture from his point of view.  In general, the system is unsatisfactory and the sooner the Minister inquires into its working the better.</P>
    <P>The other flaw in the Act is that, owing to the very substantial increases in building costs since 1939, the landlord can produce sufficient evidence to warrant a substantial increase in respect of services provided or repairs carried out.  On the other hand, having regard to the type of house and the accommodation available, the tenant is seriously prejudiced in comparison with tenants of similar houses in 1939.  The working of the Act, so far as permitted increases for building costs are concerned, has operated harshly on tenants.  These two flaws have come to light since the Act was enacted this year.  Having regard to the position regarding shortage of houses, which is likely to last for some time, the Minister should inquire into those matters as soon as he can collect sufficient data, and, if necessary, amend the Act.  Most houses are now let at a rent the basis of which is later than 1914.  In the case of the few houses in which rents go back to 1914, it is comparatively easy to get evidence of value of similar houses.  In many cases, evidence of the actual rent paid is available but, where it is not, it is comparatively easy to obtain the alternative evidence required.</P>
    <P>The fact that houses erected since 1941 are not controlled has put a large number of people who are anxious to secure accommodation in a difficult position.  I think the Minister should consider that matter even though it does not come within the terms of the motion.  One cannot consider this matter in isolation.  A factor which must be taken into consideration, so far as rent control is concerned, is the selling price of houses.  That price has rocketed without any commensurate increase in accommodation or suitability. In many respects, the services which some landlords provide, such as lighting <Col N="672" /> and heating, are inferior to pre-war standards because of rationing and control, while the tenants have to pay at the same rate.  Both those factors should be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>The motion has served a useful purpose, even if the Minister responsible is not in the House, in directing attention to the problems confronting us as regards housing.  If I read the terms of the motion aright, the effect of its adoption would be to lift existing control and to substitute therefor a system of judicial tribunals for the fixation of fair rents.  I take it that that would include all houses at present controlled under the Rent Restriction Acts.  That raises a very serious issue.  I want, in the first place, to deal with the cases of houses built by local authorities.  Houses built by local authorities are let at rents which are not economic.  If the House were to adopt the principle of this motion, the tenants of all houses built by local authorities would have to go before the courts and have a fair rent fixed according to the present-day market value of their houses.  In the case of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, the position would be that houses which we are at the moment building and propose to let at rents of from 15/- down to 10/6 per week would have to be let at from 20/- to 30/- a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon's idea then is that we should adopt the social principle which is adopted everywhere now&mdash;that shelter is a necessity of man, that every man is entitled to adequate shelter, and that that shelter should be provided for him as a matter of course, whether by private enterprise or by the local authority or by the State.  If we accept that principle, I am afraid the responsibility will fall upon the State and it will <Col N="674" /> then be very difficult to reconcile the interests of private enterprise and State enterprise.  In these circumstances, you will have to face up to the social principle that every man must have a house and that, if private enterprise does not provide a house, the State must do so.  That opens up a wide field of discussion.  I do not think that it would be within the terms of the motion.</P>
      <P>If we are to lift rent restriction and set up a tribunal for the fixation of fair rents, we shall not cure existing anomalies.  We shall make them more acute.  I have instanced a case which is bound to arise&mdash;the case of the tenant of a local-authority house and that of his neighbour living in a privately-owned house.  On the question of control, I cannot see why, once you adopt the principle, control should end at £60 valuation instead of £65, or at £80 instead of £100.  Housing is as acute a problem to the middle-class man as it is to the workman, if not more acute.  Once you accept the principle of control, there is a case for applying it all round.  This matter has received consideration on the other side and many authorities incline to the view that control should be widespread. In fact, because of the peculiar war situation existing in England, it is quite on the cards that control will be universal in England in the near future.</P>
      <P>The difficulties which Deputy Dillon instanced as to rents payable in 1914 are not, in my opinion, of very great importance to-day.  In any event, where it was impossible to prove the rent payable in 1914 by reason of the family having gone away or because there were no relatives or dependents still alive, the courts were always able to get evidence from valuers or auctioneers of rents of comparable houses at the time.  There certainly may have been difficulty in getting the evidence but the evidence always could be procured and the courts inevitably accepted the evidence of such people as to rents prevailing for comparable houses at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And is the 1914 rent plus 20 per cent. a reasonable rent to fix to-day?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other additions. I do not say it is but if you discuss 1914 rents you have to consider that in 1914 you had not the pressure for housing that you have to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you go back to 1914 you will find there were more houses available than tenants seeking them and that the landlord of that day was getting a competitive rent for his house.  One difficulty you have in approaching this problem of housing is, as I put it before to the Minister, that we have not had from the Minister a survey of the housing problem. By that I mean a survey of the rents payable all over the country.  Before we can get anywhere with this problem we will have to get a survey made by the Minister.  That survey could be easily done through the local authorities. The rent and rate collectors could collect the information very rapidly and could give us a national register of rents so that we could approach this problem in the full light of the facts so disclosed.  The present register set up under the 1946 Act will undoubtedly help the courts but it will take many years before that register can be regarded as anything in the nature of a full register.  Owing to the emergency situation, the shortage of supplies, and the general opinion that the emergency condition is going to continue for the next five to ten years, we must face up to the whole question on the broad basis of a national survey. I seriously put it to the Minister that to enable the House to get down to solid work on this problem we should have that survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present we are building houses in Dún Laoghaire.  It took us 18 months to prepare plans, specifications, tender for contracts and that sort of thing. We have at the moment one contractor carrying out one housing scheme. Operations have been commenced.  As late as last week we were coolly informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we must redesign our plans and cut down the amount of timber in our houses.  The letter which we have received, in my opinion, was written by a bureaucrat, who has <Col N="676" /> no conception of the housing situation and who certainly has no conception of what it means to tell us to revise our plans.  If we, after 18 months, have to do that, the contractor will have to leave the job and it will take another six months to redesign and alter our plans to meet the Minister's requirements.  It seems to me an extraordinary position that the Local Government Department should approve our plans and tell us to go ahead, apparently without reference to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing and, if that is general, I put it to the Minister that it is a matter deserving the most serious consideration.  I feel that drastic measures will have to be taken, and taken at once, and that some system will have to be devised whereby houses intended for the working classes and for the middle classes, if you will, will receive priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>And until, either by public or private enterprise, we succeed in producing houses, rent control, bad and all as it is, must exist and continue to exist and I do not think we can do anything about it, because if we lift control we will have chaos.  Mention has been made of furnished flats.  That matter was put to the Minister in the debate on the 1946 Act, and since I spoke on that measure I consider that the position in Dublin and in several towns throughout the country has become more and more acute.  I put it to the Minister that it is necessary for him to have a survey of this position. I can give instances&mdash;Kilkenny, Dundalk, Cork, Waterford&mdash;where very acute problems of this kind arise.  It is a very difficult problem.  It is a problem that has been giving considerable trouble both in England and Scotland.  Commissions of inquiry have discussed these problems and have made reports and the Minister will not be in the dark in tackling the problem. He would have the benefit of the views of experienced men and of the facts collected from these inquiries if he did now undertake some survey of the problem.  I do not think it will be denied that the rents obtainable for what are called furnished flats to-day are appallingly high.  There is no doubt that an owner of a reasonably decent flat can command any rent he chooses for it.  The present position is that if a flat is available, not only can he ask any rent he likes, but he can get a lump sum down from a prospective tenant to pay that exorbitant rent. Many seekers after flats and houses are young people either recently married or about to marry, and it baffles me how they can hope, with their limited means, to continue to pay these exorbitant rents.  Very often the furniture in these flats is very meagre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> Under the provisions of the 1946 Act these flats are uncontrolled unless the court can be satisfied that the rent charged for the flat is based on 75 per cent. for the accommodation and 25 per cent. for the furniture supplied with the accommodation.  The court is bound to make an apportionment, but with the present high cost of furniture a few chairs and tables, a few ordinary articles of household furniture, can easily be made to exceed 25 per cent. of the rent.  That safeguard is in no way easing the position here either for the tenant or the prospective tenant. I would put it to the Minister that a survey based on an annual valuation of flats would be the appropriate way to approach the problem, that the flat should be valued empty, unfurnished, and that the valuation list should be revised annually.  Taking a fair valuation of the vacant accommodation, you could relate the rent to it in some way and ignore furniture altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily, but I would insist that the flat, whether furnished or unfurnished, be valued on the basis of the accommodation rather than on accommodation plus furniture.

I am anxious to raise the narrow point <Col N="679" /> and have it discussed and disposed of, so that we can go on to other business. For that reason, I would point out that it is a narrow matter.</P>

      <P>It is absolutely impossible to discuss this matter without relating it to the housing problem. The effect of the adoption of this motion would be to decontrol houses which are controlled and bring in some system of fair rent tribunals.  Surely I am entitled to point out that, if that happens, the position will be far more acute than at present.  I am trying to show how acute the present position is and I do not wish to detain the House much longer.  The housing shortage here is aggravated by two factors. We have the new rich who, strange to say, are very numerous.  I know cases where those gentlemen have paid anything from £3,000 to £14,000 in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  I know cases where they have paid three and five times the pre-war value, both in Dublin and in the country and it is a mystery to me where the money is coming from.  Then there is the stranger coming into our midst, into the South of Ireland and into Dublin and anywhere they can settle down. These people are evading their lawful liabilities on the other side, evading income-tax and surtax.  They can say to their neighbours: &ldquo;I can save £50 a week in tax by living in Ireland.&rdquo; I can give concrete cases of that. These are the people who are sending the price of houses sky-rocketing.</P>

      <P>I am trying to answer Deputy Dillon in this way and will not be much longer.  Building costs have soared to twice and three times the pre-war costs.  The house built for £800 pre-war is costing anything from £1,500 to £2,000 to-day.  I know cases of men who built those houses pre-war and who are building them to-day. They are reasonable people who are not trying to profiteer on the existing situation and who are keeping their profits within the limits of their pre-war profit margins.  These gentlemen assure me that if they charge £1,800 to-day for a house that cost them £800 pre-war their profit to-day is actually less than their pre-war profit on the £800 house.</P>

      <P>I have been trying to show that a fair rent tribunal will not meet the case.  I am arguing against the motion and trying to show that a fair rent tribunal will not settle the problems which we have.  I thought I was entitled to make that point.  However, if I am out of order on that point, I do not intend to press it beyond saying that I think there is a case for investigation with regard to the whole question of building profits and building control with a view to exercising some system of control of prices and, further, with a view to giving the native Irish an opportunity of getting a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the motion again, I want to say that I think the 1946 Act, though it did not go as far as some of <Col N="682" /> us would like, was a vast advance and improvement on the previous position, and that the Minister has gone a great distance towards clarifying many of the ambiguities and anomalies which existed before that Act was passed.  To my mind, it is too soon yet to say that the Act has failed.  It has been in operation only for a few months, and I think it will have to get a fair trial. Its duration is limited, I think, to five years.  It can cease to operate at the end of that period.  I am sure that if before the end of the five years a case can be made for the scrapping of the Act, the Minister will be the first to come to the House and say that conditions have so altered as to warrant the introduction of a new measure.  I feel myself that though certain flaws, some of which were adverted to by Deputy Cosgrave, particularly in the matter of furnished flats, have become apparent, that, nevertheless, taking the Act on the whole, it is too soon yet to pronounce judgment on it in the wholesale manner which the adoption of this motion asks us to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that I felt bound to raise a point of order while Deputy Coogan was speaking.  I felt obliged to do so because I should feel a certain sense of guilt if an undue part of the time of the House was spent in inadequately discussing the very much broader and wider matter of housing that does not arise on this motion at all.  That may create the impression that the House failed to take the interest which should be aroused by the larger matters which are very naturally concerning Deputy Coogan's mind when the House simply forbore to discuss them because it decided to adhere to the narrow topic raised in this motion.  That narrow topic can be simply stated in this way: Is it criminal or wrong for an ordinary citizen to want to know what his rent should be approximately without embarking on protracted litigation, without feeing solicitors or barristers for their opinion as to what the effect of the rent restriction code is on his particular house? Now, I am not expressing any legal opinion on this.  I am a member of the legal profession but not a practising member.  Lawyers have got into the <Col N="683" /> habit of saying to the laity: &ldquo;These are matters which you do not understand; leave these matters to us.&rdquo; Well, I do not see why Deputy Cormac Breathnach and Deputy Dillon, two ordinary citizens of this State, who are not practising barristers, are not entitled to look at their own thatch and make up their minds as to what the rent of it ought to be under the law without feeing a solicitor or barrister and starting the whole machinery of the High Court in operation.  That is all I want.  Is that presumption? The whole purpose of my representation is to sweep away this whole abracadabra of law decisions and so forth, and get a criterion for assessing rent on a house occupied by a tenant which the average man can understand and at least approximately apply.  Do not deliver us, by the complexity of your statute law, into the toils of the legal profession out of which it may take us a small fortune to struggle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the House that there is a general principle in regard to statute law and, indeed, to all law, and it is that it should be certain and clear so that every man may know his rights and duties under it: that it should be equitable in that it imposes on all men the same duties and confers on all men the same rights.  Now, that is not a bad definition, I think, of good law, and if you accept that criterion for good law the rent restriction code, as it stands at present, answers neither. The standard laid down is most uncertain.  Not even the most highly skilled lawyer in this country can, in any given case, tell you with certainty what the verdict of the court may be where you go in for the purpose of getting your rent fixed or a declaration as to what are the obligations and rights of tenant and landlord respectively under the rent restriction code in a given case.  I submit that, in respect to any house, if the tenant approaches his solicitor and raises questions as to security of tenure, the rent payable and all liabilities accruing, he will get from any reputable lawyer an opinion, but he is likely to get from an equally reputable lawyer an opinion in the direct opposite sense, and when he gets into court he <Col N="684" /> may find that neither of them is correct in their forecast of the decision that the judge will give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that law, unlike measles, should be certain and clear.  I cannot accept the Deputy's view that the profession dealing with law should approach it in the same way as doctors approach their patients, wondering is this the rash of measles, chicken pox, typhus, typhoid or what not.  That is the very fault I find with the present state of our law.  I want the law to be certain so that humble members of the community like Deputy Cormac Breathnach and myself, who are both entitled to wear a wig and gown but who do not, can decide these questions for ourselves and walk our way in peace without being put to the necessity of handing out guineas to solicitors to ascertain what the position is.  We should probably be told if we did consult a solicitor that the best way would be to start litigation, and that by the time it was finished, we should probably find out what our rights were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us apply this test.  Is there any Deputy who is living in a rented house who can go home, look up at his thatch and say to himself: &ldquo;If somebody invoked the Rent Restrictions Act to determine what my rent should be, I know what it is&rdquo;?  I venture to say there is not.  I venture to say that if <Col N="685" /> he went to his best friend and asked him what he should do in order to get a proper answer to that question, that friend would say to him: &ldquo;Look here, if you take my advice you will say nothing about it, but if you can afford it and if you want to be foolish, go to the best solicitor you can find and God knows what will happen after that.&rdquo; Does any Deputy own a house, and if so, has he a tenant in it?  If he is a quiet, peaceable man, is there any landlord in this House who will advise his tenant to go into court and fight him to get their respective rights and duties defined under the rent restrictions code?  Will he not pray to God that that tenant will never start it, not because he is afraid that certain liabilities will accrue to him, but because he is filled with a numinous awe, an awe of the unknown, and he feels that once he starts out into that desert, God knows where he will end up.  I say that is bad law, and that is why I am making my alternative suggestion. Under the existing law, it is quite possible for two houses offering identical accommodation, side by side in the same street, occupied by tenants in precisely the same circumstances, in receipt of the same income, to have rents one of which will be fixed by law at a maximum of £65, and the other fixed by law at a maximum of £110.  I assert that to be true on the best authority.  That is inequitable and is a manifest departure from one of the reasonable criteria which I have laid down for good statute law.</P>
    <P>I know it is popular in this House to represent oneself as a champion of tenants for the excellent reason that there are more tenants than landlords. I do not give a fiddle-de-dee for landlords or tenants.  There is nothing in their gift I want, but this House has a duty to do justice by all, be they numerous or few, weak or powerful. Is it just to say to a landlord, whether he is a blood-sucking tyrant or a widow who has her slender means invested in house property in order to get a small but certain income, that if a certain rent was paid in 1914 on a house which was his or her property, he or she shall be deterred from getting any higher basic rent to-day than the 1914 rent plus 20 per cent.?  What <Col N="686" /> commodity of any sort, kind or description can be purchased to-day at the price ruling in 1914 plus 20 per cent.? Some people who do not understand the theory of money are puzzled by it. The plain fact is that money has lost its value.  That reduction in the value of money was a matter of policy for the purpose of reducing the burden of national debts.  We by statute have passed that burden on to the individual property owner.  Why?  Very largely because there are more tenants than landlords, and if you vex the tenants they will vote against you. If you vex the landlords, they have not enough votes to make very much difference, and nobody likes them in any case because they are called landlords. One of the evil side effects of enforcing that basic rent is that landlords in their own defence must abstain from paying a worker to keep such houses in the condition they were meant to be kept, and they will try to compensate themselves for loss of income by cutting down on these repair and maintenance charges for which they cannot get an adequate allowance under the Rent Restrictions Code in addition to the basic rent of 1914 plus 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Now here is a simple alternative which I propose to the Minister.  I want a fair rent fixed for houses. I want this House to lay down a rent which is fair and just.  For instance, I think it would be quite reasonable for this House to say: &ldquo;We shall allow landlords 3 per cent. on the capital value of their houses, and if you like, whatever would be equitable for repairs.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Connor, who is supposed to know everything that opens and shuts about houses, is peevish and crotchety and talks about the irresponsibility of bringing forward a motion of this kind, though he talked himself like a halfpenny book upon it. I do not propose to be an expert in public utility societies and the ramifications of these organisations, but I make this suggestion.  Suppose you instruct fair rent tribunals to allow landlords 3 per cent., with an allowance for maintenance and repairs, as the maximum rent which they can charge for houses.  This situation then <Col N="687" /> arises, that simple citizens like Deputy Cormac Breathnach and myself living in rented houses, when we get our rent demand for 12/- a week, can stand out, look up at the thatch and make up our minds that it would take about £1,000 to build that house.  Say that the capital value ascertained by a fair rent tribunal would be £1,000. The landlord has a right to 3 per cent. on that, that is £30, and he may be allowed £2 per annum for repairs.  If he is charging 12/- a week for that house, there is no need to go into court&mdash;he is fairly near&mdash;but if he is charging £1 or 22/- for that house, Deputy Breathnach and myself will go down the street to him and say: &ldquo;We are not lawyers, but 22/-, according to the way we reckon it, at simple interest would be the interest on nearly £2,000. Will you go to any tribunal and say it cost you £2,000 to build that&rdquo;?  The landlord will know full well that there is no use in his maintaining that the capital value of the house is £2,000. He will say: &ldquo;What would you say it is worth?&rdquo;, to which I will reply: &ldquo;£800.&rdquo; He will say: &ldquo;£1,200&rdquo; and we will split the difference and arrive at the rent in the back parlour without going to solicitors, lawyers or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Is there anything shocking in that proposal?  Is there anything evil in it because it makes it possible for the ordinary citizen to get an approximate knowledge of his rights without invoking all the abracadabra of the law? Would it not give every citizen that opportunity, or is there a flaw, is there some defect, in my argument?  It is an extraordinary thing that the legal profession, like the bankers, manage to surround their whole proceedings with an aura of mystery and the average unfortunate layman, when he dares to make a suggestion of this kind, quails under the contemptuous smiles of the professional lawyer, whose head, incidentally, may be as empty as a drum.  I know them.  He smiles and, of course, he is a &ldquo;larned&rdquo; man.  In the South of Ireland, they call him Attorney So-and-So and in the West we call him Counsellor So-and-So.  He is a <Col N="688" />&ldquo;larned&rdquo; man.  Very many of them are as innocent of the elements of the law as the babe in the cradle.</P>

If we lay down a system of rent assessment which enables 99 per cent. of the citizens to meet in their own back kitchens and arrive at a knowledge of their mutual rights under the law because it was so simple and clear and certain, would it not be good law?  That is what I think is good law, and it is the kind of law that lawyers do not like.  It trespasses on this sacred area where no one dares to walk if a lawyer does not hold his hand.  It is like the bankers when you talk of credit.  They grow fat on their fraudulent fiction that they serve some useful purpose in the communal life.  Anyone who dares to discuss this mystery of credit is looked upon with contempt as venturing on fields which no sensible man would dare to tread, were he not a banker, most of whose heads are solid ivory and who qualify for their right to sit on bank boards solely and exclusively by the solidity of their heads.</P>

No, and after 20 years the tenant could go into court, get his rent fixed and recover from his landlord all the excess rent paid on foot of the agreement made between them.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned to make any attack upon a very honourable profession to which I am proud to belong and to which many members of my family have belonged.  I am merely concerned to assail the pretensions of some unworthy elements in it who would seek to impose upon the people the belief that law, in order to be good law, must be obscure, rather than the true doctrine that good law ought to be clear, equitable, fair to all citizens and easy for the simplest to understand.  That is why I move this motion and I put it to the Minister that surely the alternative I suggest would be better than the jungle of case law and obscurity in which we at present are.  Surely it would be fairer if tenants in houses of similar character were paying the same rent and if every landlord in possession of houses of similar character were getting the same rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it would be better if every tenant in this country were in a position to go very near what his just rent should be without the intervention of any third party between himself and his landlord.  There is the narrow point that concerns me.  Deliver us from obscurity and bewilderment and give us instead something simple, clear and fair.  I know that that evokes from the legal profession sneers of contempt.  It would distress me to think that the Minister for Justice, by his proximity to lawyers, should have forgotten that desire which I believe he once had for the right to live within the law without having to keep a pet lawyer to tell you how to do it.  That is all I want.  It is very simple; not very fashionable; in the ears of lawyers almost blasphemous; but in the ears of most simple men an attractive kind of life.  I do not think it is hopeless to ask Dáil Éireann that her people should be given that benefit.  It is for that reason I put down the motion.  I do not intend to press it to a division because, if I did, all the lay members of the Fianna Fáil Party would vote against their conscience. They would vote for the lawyers because they had to; but in spirit they <Col N="691" /> would be walking through the Lobby with me.  It would distress me so much if the separation of soul and body were to precipitate their dissolution, that I spare them the ordeal and the labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the valuation of any land, turf bog or turf bank should not be increased by the operation of emergency legislation; and more specifically by reason of the taking or purchase of turf therefrom by or for disposal through local authorities, or through schemes intended to provide fuel during the emergency contemplated by the Emergency Powers Act, 1939; and that proposals for any necessary legislation should be introduced forthwith by the Government.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which was raised at the end of last year and the disparities and the injustices which are being suffered by a very small number of people in the country have been continued ever since.  The motion asks that any necessary legislation should be introduced forthwith by the Government to redress the situation.  Whether legislation is necessary or not, I do not know.  But the matter to which I am calling attention and for which I am asking redress is that a small number of people in North Tipperary, as distinct and apart from any other people, I might say, in the country, except some in County Monaghan, have had their valuations increased and are being asked to pay additional sums by way of rates, because either they had had their bogs rented by the local authority for turf cutting or because they sold turf off their bogs during the emergency.  If there is a law and that law is being operated in a partial, inequitable, unjust and unexpected way, then that is a matter of which Parliament should take cognisance.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter before, but the Minister for Finance thought I was simply trifling with it and could not see why I had taken up the case at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> The Minister for Local Government on another occasion also scoffed the case that we were making out of the House. The position is that in 1941 emergency powers were given to local authorities either to rent bogs and carry on turf-cutting operations by their own organisations or to buy turf from local people.  At that time an urgent appeal went out from the Government that, where turf was available, it should be cut in order to provide the country with fuel during the emergency.</P>
    <P>A large number of counties threw themselves into that campaign and a large number of local bodies took the situation in hand and either rented bogs or induced people to cut turf for them and acted as the machinery for selling that turf through Fuel Importers, Limited.  Amongst these counties were Galway, Roscommon, Clare, Limerick, Kerry, Cork, Waterford, South Tipperary, Meath and Laoighis.  That is one particular set of counties.  These were counties that produced substantial quantities of turf. In no single case between 1941 and 1946 did whatever law is there operate in any way to raise the valuation on anybody who either was renting a bog to a county council or was cutting and selling turf either to the county council or anybody else.  Then another group of counties&mdash;Sligo, Mayo, Longford, Westmeath and Cavan&mdash;appeared to be in practically the same position as the first group I mentioned, with a very small dot of a difference.  Then you have Donegal and Wicklow and then you have North Tipperary and Monaghan.  There are four groups of counties.</P>
    <P>Let us take the first group.  It is not easy to give exact figures as to the amount of turf produced in these counties or the amount of profit made by any persons owning bogs, either by renting them or working them themselves and selling the turf.  But figures are available giving the approximate quantities of turf supplied by the local authorities to Fuel Importers, Limited.  During the years from 1941 to 1945&mdash;the figures for the 1945 season's crop being just provisional&mdash;we find that that part of the production of turf in Galway that was <Col N="693" /> disposed of by being sold to the Fuel Importers, Limited, by the local authority amounted to 218,000 tons; Clare, 66,000 tons; Kerry, 159,000 tons; Cork, 31,000 tons; Roscommon, 125,000 tons.  Limerick, in the matter of turf production, is scarcely worth talking about, and we can ignore Waterford and South Tipperary, because the figures are not available.  Those figures will give an impression of the position that those counties occupied in the provision of turf.  These are much greater than the quantities provided by other bodies.  In none of these counties was the valuation increased on anybody as a result of the cutting of turf.</P>
    <P>In the second group we have Sligo, Mayo, Longford, Westmeath and Cavan.  Sligo, during the period, provided, through the local authorities for Fuel Importers, Limited, 21,000 tons; Mayo, 286,000 tons.  The amounts provided from Longford, Westmeath and Cavan were infinitesimal.  In County Mayo in 1941, the first year of the operation of this scheme, one person had his valuation increased. No other person in Mayo, during the whole of that period, had his valuation increased as a result of turf operations. In Sligo, in the year 1944, one person had his valuation increased because of turf operations.  In Longford, in 1941, one person had his valuation increased, and in Westmeath, in 1946, one person had his valuation increased.</P>
    <P>Now we come to Donegal and Wicklow. In Donegal, in the year 1942, four people had their valuations increased, and, in the year 1943, two more people there had their valuations increased. In Wicklow, in the year 1944, eight persons had their valuations increased, and in the year 1946 two more persons in Wicklow had their valuations increased.  That is the third group.</P>
    <P>Now we come to North Tipperary and Monaghan.  North Tipperary, to the extent of 45,000 tons, figures in the list of counties where turf was sold by local authorities to Fuel Importers, Limited.  In North Tipperary, in the year 1945, 40 persons had their valuations increased by reason of turf operations and, in 1946, ten other valuations there were increased.  In <Col N="694" /> Monaghan, in 1944, 26 persons had their valuations increased; in 1945 four more persons had their valuations increased, and in 1946 there were three others whose valuations were increased.  There were 50 people in North Tipperary and 33 people in Monaghan and an odd person here and there in Sligo and Mayo who had their valuations increased at a time when, throughout the country, as a matter of emergency, an extraordinary production of turf took place.</P>
    <P>If the law is there by which, according to the Minister's statement to me on the 12th September, 1945, &ldquo;we are entitled to see that these people who have been drawing such sums should bear their equitable portion of rates&rdquo;&mdash;if people who, according to the Minister, have been getting substantial royalties out of turf operations are liable, under the law, to pay rates, and if we find the law operating in such an inequitable way as to be absolutely unjust and outrageous, then we ought to know something about that law.  The fact is that something, from the year 1852, like the measles that Deputy Dillon spoke about, has hit a small number of people in a concentrated way in North Tipperary and has passed, unscathing, over the people in South Tipperary. It is called law and we want to know what that law is.  I say that whatever it is, it is unjust, inequitable and partial and it has been operated against a small number of persons. The situation should be redressed and the only way in which that situation can be redressed to-day is by seeing that the people who have been struck by this law and damaged by it will be compensated and will have their payments made good.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government speaks of some people who got £2,000 from the local authorities or from other people for turf and they were charged only an extra £100 in rates. I think it is very wrong, when there is such an obvious case of injustice operating in the country, that anything would be dragged across the discussion of this matter to distort the situation.  I want to concentrate on North and South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> In an answer given to me on the 10th October, 1945, it was shown that the expenditure by the North Tipperary County Council for the period ended on the 31st March in the years 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945, was £268,000 and, in the case of South Tipperary, the expenditure on the same work was £122,800.  The expenditure in North Tipperary may be double what it was in South Tipperary, but it is obvious that turf operations were proceeding in South Tipperary just as effectively, if not in as great a volume, as in North Tipperary.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that, under the law, the ratepayers of County Tipperary or any other county have the right to move, through their officials, to get a bog, which had not been worked, revalued when it became a valuable property.  I want to know in relation to the law who are the &ldquo;ratepayers&rdquo; in these circumstances? Does it refer to individuals paying rates to the elected representatives of the county or to the county manager? I want to know what has operated in the County Tipperary to bring about a position in which 50 persons in the north have had their valuations increased&mdash;in some cases, by the action of the county manager&mdash;whereas no action has been taken in South Tipperary. In County Tipperary alone, there is a case requiring explanation of the law.  Why has the law operated so peculiarly and through whose action has it operated so peculiarly?  If it has operated through the action of the county manager and if it is as a result of his action that the valuations of people in North Tipperary have been increased because of payments made in a particular year, did the county manager operate to get these valuations reduced when he was not paying so much in subsequent years as he was in the earlier years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy the figures by which the valuations were reduced?  They amount to about one-third of the increases. Those figures are contained in the answer given on the 6th of this month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not related any reductions that have taken place to the increases.  Whether or not reductions have taken place in any of the North Tipperary cases, the question of the difference between North Tipperary and South Tipperary and the other areas arises.  I want to know whether the county manager operates in the same way in relation to reductions as he does in relation to increases.  The partiality which reveals itself as between North Tipperary and South Tipperary and the big list of counties I have given where nothing at all has happened is all the more unjust when we consider what has happened in some of these cases.</P>
      <P>Here is the case of a bog given over in 1941 as the result of an advertisement: &ldquo;They cut it for three years and left it unprofitable for cutting any more.  My old valuation was £16 and my new valuation is £25, with no deduction for agricultural land.  They left the bog in the most dangerous way with holes.  Some of the banks were let slip in and can never be cut again. It seems they want us to pay for all this squandering of money.&rdquo;  He means that they want them to pay for damage actually done to their places.  In another case, where a bog was taken over compulsorily, the position is set out as follows: &ldquo;Before the county council cut turf in 1941, I could take 40 grazing cattle on the mountain at £2 per head.  Since the council came in on the bog, I cannot take any cattle on it.  There are too many trenches open and it would be dangerous to cattle.  If they were there, they would be destroying any turf which was there.  I had to clear them away entirely as I had nothing for them to feed on.&rdquo;  He claims that, for grazing alone, he could have got £80 a year without any increase in his valuation. In this case, the amounts paid by the local authority were&mdash;1941, £78; 1942, £116; 1943, £8; 1944, £28.  On the average, he received £57 a year.  He could have had £80 a year if his grazing rights had been undisturbed.  He was told by the county manager that, besides these payments, the county manager expected that he received rents from private turf-makers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the past, I want to <Col N="697" /> know whether the increases in valuation have been made solely on the strength of rents paid by the county council to the people concerned or whether the increased valuations are based upon the sale of turf in any other way or the renting of bogs to any other persons than the county council.  What procedure operated to get those valuations raised?  I understand that, under Section 10 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, the commissioners have power to enter upon any land for the purpose of examining it and seeing to what extent the valuation should be raised.  If the commissioners entered on the lands, what type of examination has been carried out in cases where the valuation has been raised for reasons other than payment of rent by the local authority and what technique is adopted for assessing the increase in valuation?  The law has operated in an astounding way because, in large areas where there was substantial turf production, the matter has been allowed to go by default&mdash; in circumstances in which we would have agreed to that.</P>
    <P>If the Emergency Powers Order issued in 1941 or the general Orders issued controlling the turf situation had stated that the valuation of no property would be increased during the emergency in respect of any operations carried out for the purpose of providing fuel for the country, everybody would have considered that reasonable and equitable.  In practice, that has been the position over the whole country, with the exception of 50 persons in North Tipperary, 33 persons in Monaghan, six persons in Donegal, ten persons in Wicklow, one person each in Sligo and Mayo, two persons in Longford and one in Westmeath. In these cases, entirely new valuations have been made.  In the case of one person in Monaghan, two persons in Cavan and one in Westmeath, the valuation of turbary, which was already valued, has been increased. Surely those figures show that over the country as a whole, the Valuation Act of 1852, in this matter of turf, has operated as if the emergency Order and other Orders issued during that period contained a clause that there would be no increase in <Col N="698" /> valuation as a result of turf operations except for these people.  My object in moving this motion is to show that something unjust and inequitable has been done to these people, which should be redressed, and that in so far as operations were carried out for cutting turf or affording facilities for turf-cutting during the emergency period, nobody should have his valuation raised or should be expected to pay increased rates which his neighbours and his fellow-citizens in every county in the country have in actual fact escaped because the law has been completely unoperated, if it is a law, and we have yet to have it proved to us in this House that it is a law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion.  I want to protest on behalf of the tenants in Mayo at the latest demand for returns of turf produced during the years 1944-45-46.  The people in County Mayo, a mountainy district, were not anxious to have their bogs cut, but the emergency was such that turf production was necessary. The county engineer visited the various turf areas and asked bog owners voluntarily to offer turf banks. I do not think the response was very good.  However, some people did respond and did volunteer to give turf banks, but at least 80 per cent. of the turf banks that were taken over were more or less acquired compulsorily. The rent received in respect of them was on a very small scale.  The rent that would have been received for that particular land for grazing purposes would certainly have been equal to the rent received for the turf banks.  Prior to the scheme of turf production, that land was more valuable to the owners. It was a matter of necessity during the emergency that turf should be produced and therefore the Department should not take advantage of the position to increase the valuation of that land, as they would appear to have in mind in asking for returns of income for those three years.  In certain cases bogs were opened up and were found to be unsuitable, and the banks were left partly opened.  Other bogs were <Col N="699" /> opened up where good turf was produced but there was certainly abuse of some bogs.  When the emergency is over, and I suppose it will be over some time, turf may not be necessary and County Mayo, being a long distance from the cities and big towns, may be one of the first counties to lose any benefits to be derived from turf.  It is for that reason that, on behalf of the people of County Mayo, I protest against this new demand.  It is a demand that should not be made of any farming community of any bog area in Éire.  The people living in bog areas have to rear their families and it is the very least that might be expected that there should be no levy in respect of any little benefits that they received during the war and they should not be asked to repay what they got during the emergency.  I strongly appeal to the Minister not to have new increased rates of valuation applied to the bog areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that, if this motion were adopted, it would cut across the principle of the whole valuation law.  It may be good or bad and it certainly is slow in its operation, but I think that, without a very elaborate and complicated system, you would find it very hard to get a more equitable law on which to base the rates.  We are asked in this motion to agree:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the valuation of any land, turf bog or turf bank should not be increased by the operation of emergency legislation; and more specifically by reason of the taking or purchase of turf therefrom by or for disposal through local authorities, or through schemes intended to provide fuel during the emergency contemplated by the Emergency Powers Act, 1939; and that proposals for any necessary legislation should be introduced forthwith by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, we are asked to take the people who supplied turf&mdash;alone among all the other people who helped during the emergency&mdash;and not ask them to pay their proper share if, by reason thereof, the value of their holdings has increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> If we take that section alone and exempt them, we cannot make a case for refusing other sections who will claim exemption.  These people are only being asked to suffer what everybody else has had to suffer in regard to things other than agricultural land. If the value of their premises is improved, they have to put up with an increased valuation and if the value of their premises deteriorates they have the right every year to appeal to have the valuation decreased accordingly.</P>

      <P>The complaint in this motion really is that the law has operated in Tipperary and has not operated in other parts.  But valuation law operates slowly and in the course of time it will operate all over the country.  The proposal is that these people should be refunded the rates which they had to pay as a result of their increased valuation.  If we are going to adopt that attitude, just because one part of the country moves a bit more quickly than another, I do not know how we will collect the rates at all.  This means you would pick out one section of the people for exceptional beneficial treatment.  I think it would be unfair to the community in general and I see no reason whatever for it, unless we are going to upset the whole basis of valuation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that Deputy Colley does not understand the motion and was not listening or following Deputy Mulcahy very closely.  Deputy Colley says we are asked to pick out one section of the people for exceptional beneficial treatment.  Does he consider this one case exceptional beneficial treatment? This man's rates on his holding, before the county council went in on his miserable big of bog, were 13/- per year.  His demand last year was for £39 12s. 0d.  The Deputy is assuming that the increased demand is based necessarily on the improvement to holdings.  Not at all.  We can prove beyond yea or nay that county council activities in many cases have destroyed holdings to a large extent.</P>
      <P>I will give the House one case of a farm of which I have personal knowledge.  The county council went in on this farm.  There were three acres of a callow running right along the bank of the river and it was the man's principal place of approach to running water for his stock.  That man's three acres, which for certain periods of the year would carry and feed stock, was entered on by the county council, who cut through it by means of trenches in many places. They left seven pits, which were death traps for live stock and destroyed for ever that callow and the use of it to the water for the owner of the land. Within three months of the county council leaving that field&mdash;and leaving it for ever, as they would never cut on it again&mdash;that man lost one of his working horses, valued £35, which slipped in and was unable to get out. The unfortunate man had no claim in law against the county council and was unable to recover even one shilling. That is one case of which I have personal knowledge.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said in his opening remarks that, if this motion were adopted, it would cut across the whole field of valuation law.  Not at all.  It is the action of the county managers, supported by the Minister, that is cutting across the whole valuation code.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite wrong.  This matter was brought before the county council and the action taken by the county manager and the Minister was condemned unanimously by every member of the county council.  Does the Minister contend that, when the county council have left the bogs and have ceased to take any turf from them, having in most cases injured rather than improved the man's property, this enormously increased rate may be levied?  I have quoted one case already and can give the Minister the man's letter, with his name and address; and I have the copies of the rates demands with me, showing the increase from 13/- to £39 12s.</P>
      <P>The Minister has to satisfy this House on two or three very definite points.  Firstly, he has to quote the legal authority to increase the rate.  On whose instructions were the rates increased and who made the valuation of the bogs and determined the amount by which they were to be increased? The Minister will also quote for us, I hope, the authority under which the manager may reduce the amount added to the valuation.  I would like to know. Deputy Colley's explanation is not an explanation.  He says the valuation law moves very slowly.  That is not the experience of anyone who attempts to improve a house.  He will find the valuation people on him very quickly&mdash;and the Deputy ought to know that from his experience in Dublin.  The Deputy says they can only move county by county.  I do not think the Income-tax Commissioners move county by county, or are anyway slow either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> Would the Deputy ask himself this question: Why should North Tipperary, which produced through its county council about one-fifth, if even one-fifth, of the quantity of turf produced in counties like Galway and Mayo&mdash;be subjected to this increase? Why should more people be penalised by having their valuations increased in North Tipperary, in half of one county, than in the rest of the State put together?  If there is a law, if there is legal authority for this, why is it not fairly, justly and impartially administered? If we make laws here or <Col N="704" /> if we have adopted the adapted laws that were made elsewhere, we did not adapt or adopt them for any particular part of the country or any one section of the community.  They were made for the nation as a whole and every citizen of the State is entitled to have the law administered towards him fairly and impartially.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
