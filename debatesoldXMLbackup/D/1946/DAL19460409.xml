      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware that Mrs. William O'Brien, widow of the late William O'Brien, M.P., has now reached the age of 86; that she has recently made repeated pleas for financial assistance to enable herself and the French ladies with whom she has been living in France and who have taken care of her for years to return to the home they were forced to evacuate at the time of the German invasion of France and to replace the household effects which were then destroyed; and whether, in view of the services rendered by her deceased husband and herself to the Irish nation, and because of the urgent necessity of securing the comfort of Mrs. O'Brien in the last years of her life, he will take immediate steps to have a small, but reasonably sufficient, capital sum made available from public funds to enable Mrs. O'Brien to re-establish her home.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that Mrs. O'Brien has recently made repeated pleas for financial assistance, and the Deputy's reference to the need for a capital sum to enable her to re-establish her home is the first I have heard of the matter.  Our Minister in Paris has been keeping in constant touch with Mrs. O'Brien and only last January he had a letter from her assuring him that he would hear from her whenever she was in difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> As the Deputy knows, the Legation in France maintained contact with Mrs. O'Brien throughout the war years and were able to come to her assistance when, owing to exchange restrictions and other circumstances arising from the war, the income made available to her was insufficient for her needs.  If the Deputy is aware of any circumstances which Mrs. O'Brien herself has not brought to the notice of the Legation, I hope he will communicate them to me.  I shall gladly consider them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware that large numbers of Irish workers in the United Kingdom, finding it impossible to continue to work there because of the difficulty of supporting two homes on the reduced earnings now available, are meeting with grave difficulties in securing their return home, in particular, not being afforded free travel vouchers when unable to pay fares; and whether he will consider the matter with the object of affording such Irish citizens advice and assistance in overcoming the difficulties confronting them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that, owing to the change-over to peacetime industry, some of our people working in Great Britain are not earning as much as before.  The High Commissioner had recently occasion to take up with the British Government Department concerned the case of a number of Irish workers who appeared entitled to free travel vouchers but did not receive them.  Apart from that case, however, I have no information to suggest that the Irish workers in Great Britain who desire to return home have any difficulty in doing so. If any Irish citizen in Great Britain puts the facts of his case before the High Commissioner, he will be given every possible assistance.</P>

I wonder would the Taoiseach consider any representations that would be made to him in connection with these particular cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state what revenue it is expected will accrue from the restoration, as from 1st April, 1946, of the customs duties on glass; further, if he will state the object of taxing any glass, other than sheet glass, which is manufactured in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The customs duties referred to by the Deputy were reimposed to protect the sheet glass industry which has resumed production.  There is provision for the issue of licences to import, without payment of duty, glass not procurable from home sources, and it is not anticipated that the revenue collected will be appreciable.</P>
      <P>The duties cover both sheet and plate glass.  There are practical difficulties in excluding plate glass which are being considered, but, in the meantime, duty free import licences for plate glass will be issued on application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that it is this imposition of duties which are not going to be collected which is causing the present congestion on the quays?  I would earnestly beg the Minister to consider what are the difficulties, for instance, in letting in polished plate glass free. There has never been a foot of it manufactured in this country and, if it should be manufactured in this country, the duty could be reimposed.  The same remark applies to all the classes of rolled plate.  I am not opposing the legitimate protection for sheet glass which is at present manufactured in this country and in respect of which the manufacturer is entitled to protection. I am only asking that the present delay and circumlocution should be done away with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>County managers have proposed for sanction from time to time emergency bonuses of varying rates.  As a rule higher rates have been proposed for officers resident in urban areas than for officers in rural areas and the rates for married officers are higher than those for unmarried.  Where the emoluments include rations in kind there is also differentiation in rates and part-time officers receive lower rates than whole-time officers.  In dealing with these applications my Department endeavours to preserve some degree of uniformity.  The County Manager of Meath proposed bonuses of 7/6 to 15/-. The County Manager of Wicklow proposed bonuses varying from 4/6 to 13/-. I have sanctioned 12/- a week bonus for whole-time married officers resident in urban districts in Meath and Wicklow. It is desirous as far as possible to secure a measure of uniformity of practice in the matter of the rates of emergency bonus to officials of the same class serving under the various local authorities and in sanctioning proposals received from any one local authority regard must be had to the practice of local authorities generally.</P>

      <P>The remuneration of public health nurses, which is primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned, was reviewed in 1944 when the adoption of a uniform rate of remuneration was recommended for the posts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to a recent lecture, given by the head of the fisheries branch of his Department, at the Maritime Institute for Ireland, in which reference was made to the proposed formation of a trawling company to prosecute deep-sea fishing; if so, if he will state what it is intended to do regarding (a) deep-sea fishing, and (b) inshore fishing; further, what steps are to be taken to ensure that the prosecution of deep-sea fishing will not result, as in England, in the ruination of inshore fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of this question is in the affirmative. The position, as I have on many occasions explained to the Dáil, is that it would be desirable to set up a properly managed, well-equipped, but not large, deep-sea trawling company to work in collaboration with, and not in opposition to, our inshore fleet.  The inshore men with their small craft are not of themselves able to ensure the regularity of, and variety in, landings necessary to counter an unrestricted flow of fish imports into this country; but it may be taken that any development of deep-sea trawling will be subordinated to the interests of the inshore fleet.</P>

The position of the Government has been clearly stated already and the only proposal I can make is that, in the interests of all parties, the teachers should decide to terminate this ill-advised strike at the earliest possible date.  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question the Government does not regard the issue in dispute as one which lends itself to arbitration and the answer is, therefore, in the negative.</P>

      <P>Restrictions on the felling of trees are at present imposed by Emergency Powers (No. 169) Order, which forbids the felling of roadside trees, and by the Forestry Act of 1928 which gives me a certain control over the felling of other trees.  The restrictions imposed by the Emergency Powers Order are a matter for the Minister for Defence.  As regards those exercised by me under the Forestry Act, I do not see any necessity for revision or relaxation.  Trees which are decayed and useless for commercial purposes, or which are not necessary for the shelter or ornament of the holdings on which they are growing, and are to be used for fuel or for the repair of buildings on that holding are exempt from prohibition and, in the vast majority of cases, felling notices in respect of such trees are allowed to pass unquestioned.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Costello, I move amendment No. 168:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (b), line 15, before the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;wilfully and knowingly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A number of amendments appear on the Order Paper to this section but I think the form in which Deputy Costello has put his amendment is perhaps the simplest.  The section generally proposes that if a person suffering from infectious disease fails to take certain precautions, in certain circumstances he may be held by a court to be liable for damages for infecting some other person with the disease.  Paragraph (b) simply says: &ldquo;if such person has failed to take the precaution&rdquo; indicated in this Bill or in some other regulation.  The effect of Deputy Costello's amendment would be to make the paragraph read: &ldquo;where such person has failed wilfully and knowingly to take the precaution&rdquo;.  On the section itself we can discuss the morality and reasonableness of the proposal when we see it as a whole but if the section is going to stand in any way, it should not be possible for a person to be mulcted in damages who either innocently or through ignorance had been the cause of transmitting an infectious disease to some other person.</P>

      <P>Surely so long as we proceed intelligently there is no necessity to give hostages that we shall not restrict the discussion in any way.  Under this section a person is liable to be mulcted in damages by a court, in case he passes on an infectious disease to another person.  I submit that when we seek to have an amendment inserted to provide that that can only happen where an infected person wilfully and knowingly fails to take certain precautions, the whole matter of the section is completely open for discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The general purpose of the section is to provide that if a person, who knows that he is a probable source of infection, fails, to take precautions&mdash;the particular precautions are covered in Section 19&mdash;and as a result of his failure, some other person has been exposed to the possibility of infection, and such other person has in fact been infected, the court shall presume the guilt of the first person. I submit that the point covered by Deputy Costello's amendment, &ldquo;that such person wilfully and knowingly failed to take precaution&rdquo;, is already covered in the sections previously dealt with, because if a person does not know that he is a probable source of infection, he is not guilty of any offence if he exposes himself in a public place or if he fails to take any precaution laid down concerning which a statutory obligation is placed on him. It seems to me that this amendment, therefore, is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, with the permission of the Chair, I might say a word about the general approach to the section, I do not think it will be denied that the principle contained in the section is a sound one.  If a person is a probable source of infection and, knowing that, does in fact endanger his neighbour and expose him to infection, and his neighbour in fact, becomes infected as a result, it seems to me that in such circumstances the person infected ought to have a definite sustainable claim for damages. It may be said that he has a civil right or his rights at common law.  He has, but the difficulty is that it has been found almost impossible to prove that the person who is responsible for transmitting an infectious disease in fact acted in a guilty way.  In the earlier sections of the Bill, we have provided that if he knows he is a probable source of infection he must take certain precautions.  We now go a step further in an effort to protect the community &mdash;by providing the possibility that a person may secure damages against an infected person who acts in that careless, irresponsible way, knowing he is a source of infection.  There are various approaches to the section in the amendments which have been put <Col N="1452" /> down.  Deputy Costello has a number of amendments aimed at making it somewhat more difficult for the person who contracts the disease to secure redress in a court of law.  Deputy Mulcahy has a further amendment that would appear to me to nullify the section and Deputy McGilligan has a set of amendments that aim at safeguarding to a lesser extent the statutory rights of the person who knowingly exposes his neighbour to the possibility of infection.  I think that the section may be too severe as it stands because it provides that, unless it was proved that it was impossible for the infection to be carried in any other way, the defendant would be held to have committed the offence.  If we can approach this in a general way I think that amendments Nos. 170, 173, 177 and 178, standing in the name of Deputy McGilligan, would not be objectionable to me in principle.  I would be prepared to meet criticism of that section on the Report Stage along the lines suggested by Deputy McGilligan.  I do not select his amendments because of any particular love that I have for him as opposed to my undoubted &ldquo;grádh&rdquo; for Deputy Costello, but I think that the acceptance of the principle of Deputy McGilligan's amendments would leave us a reasonably workable section.  I think that, if the House is prepared to meet me in that way, it would be a better solution than that suggested in the other amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The first one I referred to was No. 170, which proposes to insert the words: &ldquo;who is unaware that such person is a source of infection with an infectious disease&rdquo;.  The principle of that, for example, could scarcely be argued against.  If I am aware that a person is a probable source of infection, and I deliberately associate with that person, I do not think that I have much of a grievance if I contract the disease.  Therefore, I think that the line of thought behind amendment No. <Col N="1453" /> 170 is reasonable.  The next is amendment No. 173&mdash;that the infection should be &ldquo;after such exposure&rdquo;.  That, too, appears to me to be a reasonable suggestion, because I take it that it is intended to guard against the possibility of a person already incubating the disease before the exposure took place.  With regard to amendment No. 177, the section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unless the court is satisfied (and the onus of so satisfying the court shall lie on the defendant) that by reason of the time of such infection or for any other reason it was impossible for such failure to have caused such infection.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan's suggestion in amendment No. 177 is that, instead of saying that it was impossible for such failure to have caused such infection, it was &ldquo;unlikely that&rdquo; such failure caused such infection.  That makes it somewhat easier.  I think the amendment is not unreasonable.  The actual wording of it, of course, will have to be examined.  Subject to the agreement of the House, I would be prepared to accept the general principles of these amendments.</P>

      <P>No.  I submit that the Parliamentary Secretary has given no reason for leaving out the words &ldquo;wilfully and knowingly.&rdquo;  He has just admitted himself that the section may be too severe.  Even the section as re-modelled, in relation to the amendments in Deputy McGilligan's name, will not have much of its severity removed.  These amendments will simply eliminate some person who, as the Parliamentary Secretary himself has suggested, habitually associates with a person affected by an infectious disease.  There is a modification of the section with regard to the outlook which the court may take of these cases.  We can deal with that later.  The section provides very serious penalties.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that he is going a good step further to see that it will be easy to get damages in court from a person who is shown to have passed on an infectious disease.  Even if the words may be implied in previous sections, I think that in this very penal section it should be explicitly stated that failure on the part of a person to take precautions which would involve these penalties on him would be a failure that had taken place &ldquo;wilfully and knowingly.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>The defendant will have to persuade the court that it was unlikely that he was responsible for causing the infection.

The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that it was difficult to secure damages in the courts in matters of this kind in the past, but he must remember that the law in regard to infectious diseases is being altered considerably under Section 19. The courts will have a clearer picture of what constitutes failure to take precautions and so on, and thus it may be more likely that a person will be able to secure damages.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should be satisfied with that, without seeking to tighten up the law still further.</P>

      <P>The section is a little in the air at the moment, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said <Col N="1458" /> that he proposes to consider certain parts of it, but I should like to put this to him as my opinion.  I do not like the idea of the defendant having to prove his innocence.  That seems to be a departure from the ordinary legal procedure and an infringement of the rights of the citizen.  We recognise that people who wilfully contravene various regulations and sections of this Bill have done a wrong act.  I would like to see that the ordinary legal procedure operated in those particular cases; in other words, that the defendant went in not as a guilty man having to prove his innocence but as a man going in on a charge.  I have not put that into legal language, as I am not a lawyer.  Forcing the hand of the court, under paragraph (d) of this section is going a good deal too far.  The results which we all wish to get could be obtained in a much fairer manner by letting the ordinary court procedure stand.  Let the court be satisfied as to the guilt of the man and let us not tie the hands of the court by that sub-section.  I would like to see that put into legal form in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I need not delay the House any further on the section.  I would mention, however, particularly to Deputies Cogan and Dockrell, that the person affected and against whom this section is more or less directed is a person who knows already that he is a danger to his neighbours.  Knowing that, he is under a statutory obligation to take certain precautions for the protection of his neighbours and if he fails to do so, if he does not bother his head, as a result of such failure somebody else may, in fact, contract the disease.  All along the line, this person has been acting, not only in a careless and irresponsible way but in a criminal way.  As the law stands at the present time, it has not been possible to secure redress against him, as he has not been under a statutory obligation to take precautions and it has never been <Col N="1459" /> possible to trace the matter home to him.</P>
      <P>I think everybody would agree that a citizen who acts in that way and endangers the lives of others by his deliberate negligence and criminal conduct deserves to be punished.  If you or I contract from him a deadly disease as a result of his carelessness, we may survive or we may not, or somebody very dear to us may not.  I think it is time we brought it home very forcibly to those people who are acting in that irresponsible way and endangering the lives of others that, apart from any other consequences, there will be certain material consequences to follow if the guilt is brought home to them.  That is the purpose of the section.  It may be said that we are making it difficult for the person who is the source of infection. That is granted, but in this particular instance we are more concerned with the innocent person who has done nothing wrong and who, because of the negligence of the careless person, has his life endangered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 179:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute therefor a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  In all prosecutions for an offence under this Part of this Act the complaint shall be made within 12 months from the time when the cause of complaint shall have arisen but not otherwise.</P>
      <P>Section 37 as framed removes the limit of six months for prosecution imposed by the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851 and does not put in any limit.  I am suggesting that the proceedings should be taken at least within 12 months and I think that is not unreasonable.  I would also point out that under the 1878 Act, Section 250, there was a limit of, I think, six months or 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of this amendment is not just as simple as it appears to Deputy Coogan.  Certain offences may be committed under this Part of this Bill and may not come to light for a considerable time afterwards. If you ask me to recite a number of such cases, I could not do so offhand; but I will give one example.  Take the letting or the sale of a house.  A person suffering from tuberculosis may have been a tenant or may have lived in the house as occupier.  Subsequently, the house may be closed for a considerable time and a stranger from another district may come along and take a tenancy or purchase it.  In the course of a little time, it is found that the infection had remained about the house and that no one had known anything about it.  That is a definite circumstance where a time limit would be dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I concede at once that we do not want these actions to be arising five or six years afterwards. One could easily have that type of frivolous action, but no one wants to see it arising under this or any other section.  Deputy Coogan has a number of amendments on that point and, on thinking over them and examining them pretty closely, it seems to me <Col N="1461" /> that the machinery provided under the National Health Insurance Act would probably be appropriate.  I will read the details of that machinery for Deputies now and have their views on it.  It is intended to cover the same contingency as in the case of this section, the type of case which would be dealt with in a court of summary jurisdiction and would ordinarily be subject to the same restrictions as to time for the prosecution.  Power to deal with such actions would be similar to a provision of the National Health Insurance Act, 1920, and it would run like this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any proceedings for an offence under this Part of this Act before a court of summary jurisdiction may, notwithstanding any enactment limiting the time within which such proceedings may be brought, be brought either within the time so limited or within three months from the date on which evidence sufficient in the opinion of the Minister to justify a prosecution for the offence comes to the knowledge of the county authority... and for the purposes of the section a certificate purporting to be signed by the Minister as to the date on which such evidence as aforesaid comes to the knowledge of the county authority, and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the said date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under that type of machinery, if evidence came to light after 12 months and the sanitary authority desired to prosecute, they could only prosecute having first satisfied the Minister that there were reasonable grounds for the prosecution and that the lapse of time was, in the circumstances, inevitable. They could only prosecute on the Minister's certificate.  I think that is a rather useful type of machinery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  A thing is very often continuing until the person is caught.  There might be non-compliance over a period of years before any evidence would come to light.  Sometimes it would be discovered for the first time when the person affected became ill.  Then, when it is traced back, it may be found that non-compliance has been proceeding over quite a period.  If you prosecute only within a period of 12 months you will be completely out of court.  I consider it is a useful type of machinery and it ought to meet the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the types of offences in Part IV, to which the section refers, differ in their nature, but they are clearly defined.  It would be reasonable to have the sections looked at and classified from the point of view of the period of time that might be allowed.  The section the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to wipe out indicates a kind of formula by which things might be done.  He proposes there shall be no limit to the time that will elapse inside which a prosecution could be brought or action could be taken.  If he refers to Section 10 (4) of the Act of 1851 he will see:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In all cases of summary jurisdiction the complaint shall be made, when it shall relate to the nonpayment of any poor rate, county rate or other public tax, at any time after the date of the warrant authorising the collection of the same, and when it shall relate to the non-payment of money for wages, hire or tuition within one year from the termination of the term or period in respect of which it shall be payable, and when it shall relate to any trespass, within two months from the time when the trespass shall have occurred, and in any other case within six months from the time when the cause of complaint shall have arisen, but not otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> There is a sample of a piece of legislation which takes particular types of offences and, in a reasonable way, marks the period inside which, if action is to be taken, it must be taken. I think it is a slovenly way to wipe out the whole thing and then apply it to cases under various classes of offences. I think it is unreasonable to leave an unlimited period.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should look at this section and replace it with a new section.  This is a lazily prepared section.  Let him give us a new one, which will differentiate between the various types of offences.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain a little further.  The suggestion I have made does not preclude the operation of the time limit for taking proceedings, but it does provide that if the proceedings are not taken within the prescribed time they cannot be taken unless the Minister issues a certificate.  In the ordinary course of events the restrictions that are in the law at present as to time would operate and it is only in exceptional circumstances where the sanitary authority would satisfy the Minister that there was good and sufficient reason for not proceeding within the time that the Minister, having considered the representations, will decide whether he should issue a certificate to enable the prosecution to be taken. I think that is the type of statutory machinery that would adequately and properly meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That machinery may work, but in connection with the National Health Insurance Act it applies to a very limited number of types of cases.  One is where a person is working, receiving a small wage or allowance, and at the same time is drawing national health benefit.  In that case it may or may not come to light within the six months.  With that exception, there are practically no cases.  It is confined entirely to non-compliance in connection with <Col N="1464" /> receiving national health while drawing wages or emoluments.</P>
      <P>In this case there is a variety of types of infection and it may not follow that the confined terms of the section of the 1920 National Health Insurance Act will accurately fit the conditions.  It can happen that a person has been a source of infection for a time and, probably not knowing that he is such a source, he infects others.  If proceedings are to start, there is the difficulty of defining when the person became a source of infection.  Comparing that with national health insurance, it is limited entirely to a question of fact, whether the person was receiving insurance while at the same time drawing a salary from a position.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should look into the matter. On the face of it it seems applicable, but I do not know whether it will work out so in practice.</P>

      <P>To delete lines 37 and 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am moving this amendment for the purpose of getting an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary as to the necessity for the change that is being made.  We have now a new form created by what is known as &ldquo;combined drain&rdquo;.  As far as I can see, the only distinction between what was a drain and what was a sewer is being <Col N="1465" /> done away with, and, if that is so, it would seem from Section 39 (1) that a certain responsibility of local authorities in reference to sewers may be diverted from local authorities and imposed upon a private citizen. Generally speaking, I want to get some indication as to the proposed policy in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Coogan will be the first to agree that this is a very technical and a very involved matter.  Briefly, the position is that the attempt to distinguish between a drain and a sewer has given rise to endless litigation and confusion. Under the Act of 1878 a drain went from one building or from premises within the same curtilage. Every other drain was a sewer. Within the meaning of the Act sewers were all vested in the sanitary authority which was liable for repairs. In that way, when several houses were drained from what was called a common drain in private property to communicate with the public sewer, the common drain was also a sewer and the sanitary authority was liable for repairs, although it had no responsibility for its construction and design.  An attempt was made to remedy that position in the 1890 Act but it was not very successful.  Under Section 19 of that Act, where two or more houses belonging to different owners are connected with the public sewer, it is what is called a single private drain, and the sanitary authority could recover from the owners of these houses any expenses incurred by such authority to remedy a nuisance arising from the drain. We had a most complicated position. Under the Act of 1878 we had a drain which applied to one building.  If it applied to more than one building it became a sewer, and all sewers were vested in the local authority.  Then when several houses were drained through a common drain in private property that was a sewer.  Whether they belonged to the one individual or belonged to different individuals the local authority was responsible for maintenance.  Section 19 of the Act of 1890 did not remedy the position. It merely gave the local authority <Col N="1466" /> power to recover, but added to the confusion of the term.  The legal construction set out here is based upon years of experience of the legal difficulties involved in this whole question, and I may say that the legal fraternity thought they had done a very excellent piece of work when they presented this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No, from that point of view it was a bad day's work as it sought to get away from a lot of the litigation that we had in the past, and the legal difficulty of determining when, in fact, and under what circumstances, is a drain a sewer.  Sections of the law covered by the Acts of 1870 and 1890 are being repealed, and we think we have prevented any doubt with the existing terminology.  This is a new plan deliberately set out for the purpose of clarifying an obscure and difficult legal position.  There is no other purpose in it, and it comes from men who could reasonably claim to be experts in this particular type of law. They are satisfied that this presents almost foolproof legal machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that the Parliamentary Secretary has succeeded in clarifying the position.  I notice that &ldquo;combined drain means a single private drain used for the drainage of two or more separate premises&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated, this definition in the past gave rise to a number of questions we are still continuing the phraseology &ldquo;a single private drain&rdquo;.  That phrase give rise to a number of questions which, I think, were eventually settled. I cannot say whether it is being improved by what is contained here, as I do not profess to have very good knowledge in these matters.  I want to point out that, under Section 25 of the 1878 Act, which is being repealed, and to some extent re-enacted, power was given the sanitary authority to enforce the drainage of houses.  &ldquo;House&rdquo; was given a very definite meaning.  Here we use the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo;.  I take it that the term &ldquo;house&rdquo; is being dropped for the purpose of taking in a wider class of premises.  &ldquo;House&rdquo;<Col N="1467" /> was a dwellinghouse and would not relate to a shop or factory.  You are now widening the term by dropping &ldquo;house&rdquo; and using the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; which lets in a whole lot of new types of buildings not covered by previous Acts.</P>
    <P>I foresee, under the provisions of Part V, a situation arising where the local authority may be able to divest itself of its past responsibility and throw this suddenly upon the owners and occupiers of premises of all kinds. For that reason I put down this amendment to see exactly what was intended. I know cases in, say, the Dun Laoghaire Borough where undoubtedly there is necessity for somebody intervening. Under the existing law perhaps nothing could have been done but now, if you open the door as wide as you seem to be doing here, it may mean that the owners and occupiers of houses would have to take over, as it were, a legacy of inaction from the past, and where the local sanitary authority in the past failed to do its job, they could step in now and compel the owner and occupier to do it.  That, I think, would be a very harsh provision.  It is for that reason that I wanted to get clear as to the implications of these sections.</P>

      <P>I want to direct attention here to the fact that under Section 39, sub-section (2), every combined <Col N="1468" /> drain which was immediately before the commencement of this Part of this Act, vested in a sanitary authority by virtue of Section 15 of the 1878 Act shall, on the passing of this Act, cease to be so vested and will presumably become the responsibility of the owner and occupier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 186:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), after the word &ldquo;vested&rdquo;, line 15, to add the following words: &ldquo;provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be construed as entitling any sanitary authority to impose on any owner or occupier of land or premises within the area of control of such sanitary authority any financial liability or obligation for the maintenance or repair of such drain which before the passing of this Act was the financial liability or obligation of such sanitary authority.</P>
      <P>It is clear to my mind from the reading of this section that we will have a wholesale transfer of liabilities from the sanitary authority to the individual house owner or occupier or owner or occupier of business or factory premises and it may lead to a very heavy imposition of charges from the public, as it were, to the private citizen.  My amendment is designed to ensure that nothing which was previously the financial responsibility of the sanitary authority shall be transferred from that authority to the private citizen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <P>I am afraid I could not accept the implications of that.  Under Sections 38 and 39 or under this Part of this Act the liability of the private citizen and the liability of the sanitary authority are definitely and specifically set out.  It would seem illogical if, under the previous definitions of drain, sewer and combined drain and because of defects in the law, a private person succeeded in having the financial liability for the maintenance of a drain put over on a local authority, that that should continue for all time.  If a private person, by combining more than one premises in his little drainage scheme, has succeeded in getting it <Col N="1469" /> passed off as a sewer whereas in fact it is a private drain, it seems to me that it is not unreasonable that the sanitary authority should be relieved of the obligation to maintain what should always have been a private responsibility.</P>

      <P>That require drainage, yes.  You are opening there a whole host of buildings to these new liabilities and, secondly, you are providing a complete change from the old law. The old law was that where a drain was used for the purpose of draining one building only&mdash;a number of accommodations, if you like, all under the one roof and within the same curtilage &mdash;that drain could not by any stretch of the imagination become a sewer at any time.  It was the private responsibility of the owner or occupier.  But now you are getting to a different position altogether, where you provide that a combined drain means a single private drain used for the drainage of two or more separate premises.  Under the old law, where such a drain was used for the drainage of two or more separate premises it automatically became a sewer and the liability for the drainage and the removal of nuisance, and all that sort of thing, in relation to that drain was on the sanitary authority.  Now that is being definitely transferred to the private owner or occupier and I have put down this amendment largely to direct attention to that fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel inclined to agree with Deputy Coogan on this question of responsibility for a combined drain. Where you have a number of houses connected to what I call a combined subsidiary drain to the main drainage scheme, I think that the responsibility for keeping that combined subsidiary drain in proper working order should be on the sanitary authority.  The Parliamentary Secretary states that heretofore it was their responsibility and under this Bill he proposes to relieve them of that responsibility.  I think it is fair to assume that he is throwing the responsibility on the sanitary authority, at the same time, to see that the occupiers of the houses, whose sanitation is provided for by that drain, will be responsible for keeping the drain in order and that, if they do not do it, the sanitary authority will recoup themselves from those people for the cost of keeping that drain in order.  The real snag I see in it is this.  You have, we will say, a number of houses, one to 12.  For some reason or other, it is decided to connect all these houses to a combined drain 40 or 50 feet from the backs of the houses, each house having its own independent connection.  That combined drain eventually enters the main sewer through a manhole.  If that combined drain gets choked, the man in charge of the sewerage system for that particular area, when it is reported to him, comes along and proceeds immediately to take steps to have it cleaned from one manhole to another.  I take it that the sanitary authority's responsibility is to see that they are recouped by the owners of those 12 houses for the cleaning of that drain.  The real point is: who is <Col N="1472" /> the culprit in the case?  You have 12 families living in 12 different houses made up of different types of people. Some of them may be careless.  I can assure you that there are a great many careless people so far as drains are concerned.  It is a handy way of disposing of a lot of things.  If that is done, the other 11 people will have to pay for the cost of cleaning that drain, the choking of which was caused by one individual.  The probability is that he is the individual who will kick up a row about paying.</P>

      <P>My point is that combined drains heretofore were the responsibility of the local authority. If they have to recoup themselves in future for the cost of cleaning a combined drain, they will find great difficulty in doing so.  I think that should be obvious.  For that reason, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the local authority should be held responsible for combined drains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make one point which may, perhaps, clear up the confusion? I thought I made it clear.  I grant you that it is complicated and very difficult to follow.  Under the law at the present time, if a man who owns one house makes his own drain and comes along a certain distance, a maximum of 100 feet, and connects it with the main sewer, he is responsible for the maintenance of that drain.  Is that clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>From his own house. But if he happens to own two or three houses and drains the three, or more than one, jointly, the sanitary authority, otherwise the ratepayers, because of the fact that he has more than one house, are to maintain that drain for him.  I do not think that is right just because of the fact that he has more than one house.  Under this <Col N="1473" /> structure here, the 12 tenants in the 12 separate houses referred to are not going to be held responsible.  That cannot occur.  But if it is a private drain, constructed and maintained by a private person without any consultation with the sanitary authority, the sanitary authority, which means the ratepayers, should not be called upon to maintain that private drain for the owner of that terrace of houses.</P>

      <P>I should like to continue on the instance that the Parliamentary Secretary has given.  Supposing a builder builds a house and connects the drain to the public sewer, as he would have to do in order to dispose of the drainage.  Then he comes along and builds a second house.  He thinks it is a long run to the main sewer and that if he puts a manhole at the junction he can run the drainage of two houses down that drain.  Then assume that he builds a third house and thinks the scheme is working very well and puts the drainage of that house into the combined drain, or whatever you like to call it, and it goes down to the sewer.  Now, he sells out to other people and I am afraid that a great many people are not gifted with second sense as to where drains go.  They look at a house and say that it would suit them. At present, they have not much choice and they say: &ldquo;We will fit into this place.&rdquo;  There are three separate owners.  The case made is that the public authority should, at a certain stage, have said: &ldquo;There ought to be separate sewerage for each of those three houses draining into our main sewer.&rdquo;  That has been left over for a number of years.  A drain might even have become defective.  It is most unfair&mdash;I think this is what Deputy Coogan is trying to get at&mdash;that those people, after the lapse of many years, should be prodded up and told to provide a drain into the main sewer.  If the public authority were content to let sleeping dogs lie, it is most unfair that, at this stage, the owners should be compelled to put in a new drainage system for the public authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 187:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 44 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the owner or occupier of any premises requests the sanitary authority to connect such premises with an existing system the sanitary authority shall connect the premises and may take all appropriate measures to execute or complete such drainage works.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the owner or occupier of any premises requires the making of a system for any premises and the total length of the drains in the system exceeds 100 feet, the sanitary authority shall themselves make every portion of the system which is more than 100 feet (measured along the system) from such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, the sanitary authority can compel an owner to connect his premises with an existing drainage system.  There is provision for the making of that system and any portion in excess of 100 feet may be made by the sanitary authority.  I know a place where a property owner wanted to connect either an existing property with the drainage system or erect houses on a portion of ground which was some distance from the existing drainage system.  When application was made to the local authority, it failed to co-operate and made no attempt to assist in the extension of the drainage system.  If this amendment is accepted, an individual may request the local authority to connect his house or premises with the drainage system <Col N="1475" /> and, on that being done, the local authority shall connect the premises. The amendment is, I think, desirable. It applies particularly to undeveloped areas.  On the outskirts of small towns in County Dublin, a builder may wish to erect houses on a site some distance from the existing drainage system. The local authority oftentimes fails to give permission for the erection of a cesspool or tank in these cases, on the ground that it would be detrimental to the public health.  Unless they are prepared to give such permission, they should co-operate with builders and private individuals who wish to erect houses and connect those houses with the existing drainage system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The acceptance of this amendment might have far-reaching repercussions.  There are two points in the amendment and both are objectionable.  Sub-section (1) of the amendment puts a statutory obligation on the sanitary authority to provide a drainage system.  Surely, the sanitary authority should have some discretion in the matter.  It will be primarily responsible for the public health of the district and, in the ordinary course of affairs, such authority would show anxiety to provide proper facilities within its sanitary district.  To give the sanitary authority no option in the matter, regardless of the circumstances, would be going rather far.  In sub-section (2) we get into greater difficulty, because it is proposed to put a statutory obligation on the sanitary authority to make so much of the system as exceeds 100 feet from the premises. The premises might be a very long distance, indeed, from the public sewerage system and we might be putting a statutory obligation on the sanitary authority to make a sewer half a mile long.  Clearly, it would be undesirable to do that.  I do not think that the Deputy would be well advised to press this amendment.  On reflection, he will, I think, agree that it would unduly interfere with the discretion which a sanitary authority should have vested in it in ordinary circumstances.  In fact it would leave them no discretion at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I had some difficulty in drafting this amendment.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, it opens the door very widely but I have knowledge at the moment of a couple of cases in which builders were held up in this way.  One has land at Dalkey and Killiney and wants to connect the existing system which, though not adjacent, is quite near and the local authority in that particular case would not co-operate.  While the amendment as it is framed at the moment would put a statutory obligation on the local authority to make the connection, no matter how far away, if the Minister would consider amending the section so as to provide that where the distance to be covered did not exceed 200 or 300 feet, the connection should be made by the local authority, it would meet my case.  I merely want to provide that where the local authority's system is near a proposed development scheme, it should co-operate and make portion of the system at any rate.  In a number of these cases, builders have been held up for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>I have on the other hand, knowledge of another case in which the local authority and the builder have been able to come to terms.  In that case the local authority are prepared to make portion of the system because they will be draining at the same time some cottages which are the property of the local authority. A number of builders have experienced difficulty in these matters, and I think that, subject to a maximum length, the authority should be obliged to provide the necessary connection, particularly in view of the fact that Section 43 gives power to the local authority to compel a private individual to connect his premises. Portion of this amendment is actually copied from that section.  If the sanitary authority is to have power to compel private individuals in this way, on the other hand where a private individual wishes to drain his premises, the sanitary authority should provide him with similar facilities.</P>

      <P>Unless the local authority had very sound reasons for not cooperating, the local authority would, in such circumstances, be pressed to co-operate.  I think it would be better to deal with the difficulty administratively than to try to impose a statutory obligation on the sanitary authority. Apart from the actual distance mentioned a few moments ago, which might constitute a difficulty for the local authority, there is, as the Deputy will see at once, the question of the possible configuration of the district &mdash;topographical difficulties.  You might be very near to the private drain and yet because of the intervention of rock you might not be able to make the connection.  You can scarcely introduce a statutory obligation in relation to that.  In ordinary circumstances the Deputy's difficulty ought to be met in an administrative way.</P>

Deputies will observe in the Third Schedule the matters in respect of which provision is made for the making of by-laws.  Now, it might be safe enough to assume that all the matters in respect to which the sanitary authority would require to make by-laws are listed under the five headings set out in the Third Schedule, but there is always the possibility, with a change in circumstances, that some new, and unforeseen, circumstances might arise.  If the sanitary authority were confined, in its power of making by-laws, to the matters set out under these five headings, it could not make by-laws to cover any new contingency that it might encounter.</P>
      <P>I could, I suppose, score some debating points off the Opposition now if I were to remind them that it is the elected members of a local authority who will make the by-laws.  That is a reserved function.  I find myself in the rather embarrassing position that while trying to extend the powers of the elected representatives of the people, I am being asked by the Opposition not to do so.  I do not intend to rub that in since we are getting on so nicely.  It would be a pity to spoil the present atmosphere.  The Opposition, however, could not expect me to pass over that interesting development without making reference to it.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (5), to delete in page 31, lines 43 and 44, the words &ldquo;A licence may be granted under this section in relation to land subject to specified conditions with respect to any&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Where a licence is granted under this section by a sanitary authority in relation to land, the sanitary authority shall attach to the licence specified conditions with respect to all&rdquo; and to delete paragraph (1), page 32, lines 9 and 10, and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the supervision of temporary dwellings on the land (including, where necessary in the opinion of the sanitary authority, the employment of a warden for that purpose).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of sub-section (5) would enable a sanitary authority to grant a licence in relation to land for camping subject to conditions with respect to any of the matters set out in the sub-section.  It is considered that the licence should only be granted subject to all the conditions set out there.  The contention is that these conditions should apply to any licence.  In fact, the wording was open to the interpretation that if one of the conditions attached to the licence it might be sufficient.  There are a couple of other <Col N="1482" /> points that I can deal with on Report Stage.  Deputy Cosgrave is interested in this.  The scout organisations are of opinion that the 14 days' period appears to be rather short, and are anxious to get three week-ends.  On the Report Stage I propose extending the 14 days to 18 days.  That will give them three week-ends, with one day for coming and one day for going. There are other proposals from the scout representatives that I intend to look into further with a view to amendment on Report Stage.  You have the type of difficulty that was mentioned in the course of our earlier discussions: that a scouting organisation might be presented with a camping site, and that the owner of the camping site might not bother about, and might not be interested himself in securing, a licence&mdash;while he would have no objection to scout organisations camping on his site and perhaps would give the site free, he probably would not take the initiative.  I am anxious to provide if I can&mdash;it is purely a matter of drafting&mdash;that scout organisations, or recognised camping societies or associations, might themselves be empowered to secure a licence for a site which they had either rented or otherwise secured.  I merely want to mention it at this stage, so that when we come to Report Stage I will not be open to criticism on the ground of introducing something new.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter which is not strictly provided for in the Bill, but which I think is germane to it.  I raised it on the Forestry Bill&mdash;the matter of damage done by accidental fires in the Dublin mountains and other parts of the country. It applies particularly to brushwood and gorse in mountain areas near towns from which trippers go out at week-ends or on Sundays.  Campers under scout organisations or other recognised associations take adequate precautions, but very often groups who go out on bank holidays or at week-ends leave behind them the remains of the fires on which they cooked their meals, and these fires flare up and cause considerable damage.  Large tracts of forest land and gorse on the Dublin mountains <Col N="1483" /> have been burned at various times. On the Forestry Bill, the Minister for Lands said it could not be provided for in that Bill, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary should consider the point before Report Stage, because representations have been made to me that, in cases where these fires are started accidentally, no compensation is payable.  It is not so much a question of compensation as of preventing these occurrences.</P>

      <P>I realise the advisability of trying to deal with the matter raised by Deputy Cosgrave, but I do not know how it can be provided for in the Bill.  I will have it examined, but I have not got much hope of being able to provide any machinery to deal with it.  In so far as Section 60 is concerned, arising out of our discussions and the amendments already incorporated, some further amendments will be necessary on Report.  There is no provision in the section for the cancellation of a licence, and it struck me, on closer examination of the section, that it might not be necessary to have the 12 months' limitation with a requirement to renew a licence every 12 months.  If the site is satisfactory and properly developed, and if it is once licensed and there is power to cancel if the people who camp on it are not complying with the law, it ought not to be necessary to insist on the annual renewal.  However, we may give some further thought to these matters and they will arise again on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (6), to insert the following new sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6)  Where a person applies to a sanitary authority for a licence under this section and such person is aggrieved by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the refusal of the sanitary authority to grant the licence, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a condition attached to the licence by the sanitary authority,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>such person may object to such refusal or condition by giving notice <Col N="1484" /> in that behalf to the Minister within 30 days after the day on which the grant of the licence was refused or the licence was granted subject to such condition (as the case may be) and the notice shall be in writing and shall contain a statement of the grounds of such objection.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where a notice of objection in relation to a refusal to grant a licence under this section or to a condition attached to any such licence is given under this section, the Minister, after consideration of the objection and after consultation with the sanitary authority concerned, shall either reject the objection or direct the sanitary authority (who shall comply with such direction) to grant the licence refused or to vary in a specified manner the condition objected to (as may be appropriate).</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to provide a right of appeal to the Minister in case of a refusal by a sanitary authority of a licence under Section 60, or where a condition is attached by a sanitary authority to the licence, which condition is considered by the person aggrieved to be too onerous.  The amendment has the effect of providing appeal machinery.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) if the land is occupied by members of a lawful youth organisation whose objects, rules and camping regulations are approved by the Minister, and the camping is carried on under the approved camping regulations of such organisations and under the supervision of its lawfully appointed officers and the sanitary authority, having inspected the camping place, have approved of the camping arrangements and have satisfied themselves of the <Col N="1485" /> adequacy of the supervision to be exercised by such officers.</P>
    <P>The point was mentioned already by the Parliamentary Secretary that scout organisations appear to have considerable difficulty in this matter of licences, and it was put to me that it would be better if some procedure could be instituted by which the Minister would license such organisations, in the first place, would approve of their general rules and particularly their camping rules.  As all these organisations have properly appointed officers, including medical and sanitary officers, it is scarcely necessary to apply to these organisations the provisions which are being made to apply to indiscriminate campers.  I think there is something to be said for that viewpoint.  I have no personal interest in the matter; it was at the suggestion of one of the leaders of one of the Catholic Scout organisations that I put down the amendment.  I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say he was considering some special provision for these organisations and perhaps he would cover what I have in mind on Report Stage.  The idea was that, if these organisations can satisfy the Minister with regard to their general rules and regulations for camping, it ought to be sufficient to exempt them from having to apply to the local authority in every case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision which I mentioned earlier on with regard to special facilities for camping organisations do not run altogether parallel with the provision in the amendment. The amendment suggests that certain lawful youth organisations, whose objects, rules and camping regulations are approved by the Minister should, in fact, be exempt from the requirement of securing a licence.  No doubt the camping organisations which the Deputy has in mind will observe high standards of hygiene and sanitation and, presumably, high standards of conduct, and I personally have not got any anxiety under any of these headings; but, at the same time, when we have placed a statutory requirement on people who do not belong to these organisations to secure a licence for a camping site, <Col N="1486" /> it seems to me that it is better, notwithstanding the fact that we have no doubt as to their high standards, that they should comply with the law the same as any other private citizen. The amendment I have in mind, and which I have already mentioned, which would empower scouting organisations or camping organisations themselves to secure a licence, will probably meet any difficulty those organisations have in mind.  However, I would prefer not to place the sanitary authority in the position that these people were taken completely out of their control, if one might put it that way, and granted exemption by the Minister.  I think it is better that they should go through the formality of securing their licence from the local authority; and if we can provide them with the right to license a site they do not own but which has been presented to them, perhaps without remuneration, by someone interested in providing such facilities, I think it will go a long way, and perhaps the whole way, to meet the difficulty.</P>

    <P>Paragraph (a) is intended to deal with the case in which land intended for use for camping is in the possession of the owner and is not let to an occupier. Paragraph (b) is intended to deal with <Col N="1487" /> any attempt on the part of a person using a movable temporary dwelling to extend the concession granted under sub-section (6) of land for camping being allowed to be used for 14 consecutive days without the occupier thereof being the holder of a licence by removing the temporary dwelling to some other site for 48 hours&mdash;or a shorter period&mdash;and then bringing the dwelling back again to the original site.

      <P>In sub-section (1) (c), before the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 3, to insert the words &ldquo;safety-lockers for the safekeeping of bathers' clothing, money and valuables&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the experience we have had in Dun Laoghaire, it is desirable that a specific duty should be imposed upon the local authority to take certain steps for safeguarding the personal property of bathers.  There is a loose system in operation at the moment, but it is not at all adequate, particularly on holidays when there is a rush of people.  What I have in mind is something on the Continental system, whereby each bather would be given a safety locker or box.  These are usually inserted at the back of the bather's cubicle.  It is open there when he arrives in his cubicle to undress and he is given an armlet or ringlet bearing a number which corresponds with the number on the locker.  He wears that while he is bathing.  The locker or box is taken away and the local authority is responsible for the contents while the bather is absent bathing. I feel we want some system of that kind, particularly in Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock, where, from my personal knowledge over a long period of years, I know there have been many larcenies of money and valuables.  I <Col N="1488" /> know that in many of those cases the victims were visitors to this country and it created a very bad impression on them, when they went down to have a dip, to find their valuables&mdash;passports, in one case; watches, jewellery and other valuables in others&mdash;were gone on their return.  There is a loose system whereby you can dispose of articles of jewellery, but even articles of clothing are being pilfered at the moment.  When we are making these provisions, I think we should make a provision for the safe keeping of bathers' property by some method of that kind.  I instanced this particular method, as it is foolproof and works very well elsewhere.  Under the present loose system, it is almost impossible to fix responsibility once a larceny occurs and it is hopeless to try to trace the individual concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt as to the desirability of making the provision that Deputy Coogan has in mind and the only matter at issue is whether the section provides the necessary machinery within which safety lockers for the safe keeping of bathers' clothing, money and valuables may be provided by a sanitary authority.  Under paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section, the sanitary authority may provide and maintain conveniences for bathers, including, in particular, dressing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. It is suggested that &ldquo;conveniences&rdquo; would include the possible provision of safety lockers.  If it is necessary to mention them specifically, I have no objection at all to doing so, notwithstanding the fact that it is held to be included in that wide term &ldquo;conveniences&rdquo;.  I agree unhesitatingly that such provision is more essential than most of the other provisions mentioned there.  I will look into the point and will circulate an amendment, as even if such safety lockers are included in the general term, I think it will be better to mention them specifically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if the public authority may do so free of charge? Section 62 says that a sanitary authority may make charges for the use of a public washhouse.  I have in mind the washhouse where the working-class element assemble for the purpose of washing clothes publicly. There is a small charge for hot water and soap.  It is quite possible that a very poor person might not be able to pay the couple of pence required for that and it is not made clear here that the public authority shall have power to admit poor persons free of charge. It is a small point, but I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give the public authority power to admit free of charge persons desiring to go into a public washhouse to avail of the hot water and soap and the use of the drying appliances.  I have genuine knowledge of cases where persons on more than one occasion were not able to provide the soap or pay for it.  In view of the public health and the talk about cleanliness, I think this would be an opportunity to allow people to go to those washhouses whether they had the couple of <Col N="1490" /> pence or not.  I have in mind the washhouses in Dublin.</P>

If that is not sufficiently clear, I will have it examined to see if it is, beyond question, the interpretation of the law. That is my interpretation of it at the moment.</P>
      <P>If the desire is to place the facilities at the disposal of any section of the community free of charge, they have full statutory authority to do that.  Clearly, in such circumstances as the Deputy recites, it is desirable that the facilities should be free of charge.  A sanitary authority may, on the other hand&mdash;and it is entirely a matter for the sanitary authority&mdash; feel that a nominal charge may be necessary for certain disciplinary reasons, to prevent overcrowding and things of that type.  The point I wish to emphasise as strongly as I can is, that the power is a permissive power and they are not bound by law to make a charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this section should put a statutory responsibility on the local authority to provide swimming pools and washing facilities. Large schemes, such as the Crumlin and Kimmage scheme&mdash;there are other schemes, but that is the one I have particular acquaintance with&mdash;were built without any provision being made for swimming baths or washhouse facilities.  While this is probably a wider question, I think opinion is now strongly in favour of smaller communities than the one, say, at Crumlin. Such a big scheme as that has numerous drawbacks.  It lacks any identity or character of its own, except perhaps its size.  However, that is a matter for another occasion.</P>
      <P>In this section provision is being made for swimming pools and bathing places.  It is an extraordinary fact that Dublin has the same number of swimming baths to-day as it had 40 years ago.  We still have the Tara Street Baths and the Iveagh Baths.  As far as I am aware, the Iveagh Baths are at present taken over for the treatment of people suffering from scabies. I am not sure if that is actually so, but they were for a time devoted to that purpose.  In an area like Crumlin, or any of these areas a long distance from the sea, bathing pools are essential. Even if the children could afford to travel across the city to the sea, their parents are in the dilemma that they have no one to go with them, travelling such a long journey.  The section should put a statutory responsibility on the local authority to provide these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that in a number of these housing schemes no provision is made for playgrounds either.  I think a swimming bath and a playground are essential in any such scheme and, for <Col N="1492" /> the future, it should be a statutory responsibility to make these facilities available.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave will scarcely expect me to introduce an amendment on Report Stage making it mandatory on local authorities to provide swimming baths.  I do not quarrel with him as to the desirability of making more extensive provision by way of public baths and swimming pools, but I am rather afraid that if I had introduced a mandatory power into Section 61 and had made it obligatory on the local authorities to incur expenditure, providing swimming baths and public bathing places, I would have been open to criticism by the Opposition Party.  They gave me what some people consider a pretty bad time, though I did not feel it so much in that way, in connection with mandatory or compulsory powers in relation to the provision of hospitals and other such institutions.  Various unpleasant suggestions were made about taking the last vestige of authority from the local authorities and there were suggestions about dictatorship and so on.  Fortunately, we have got away from that; but we have gone the full cycle, and now it is suggested to me that I should exercise the same type of dictatorship in relation to public baths and bathing pools that I was so severely criticised for exercising in relation to essential institutions for the treatment of infectious diseases. That does not seem consistent, and while I do not doubt for a moment the sincerity of Deputy Cosgrave in the matter, what he said does not carry with it a lot of conviction.</P>
      <P>I hope that sanitary authorities will, in fact, avail of their permissive powers to make greater and better provision of the type contemplated under Section 61, but I would prefer not to make it compulsory or mandatory upon them, seeing that we are making so many other matters under this Bill mandatory upon them in case they fail to provide the necessary institution and accommodation and equipment of their own accord.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-sections (1) and (2) and substitute the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A sanitary authority may employ one or more than one lifeguard at&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a bathing place or swimming bath maintained by them, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a bathing place or swimming bath situate in their sanitary district to which the public are admitted free of charge and which is maintained neither by them, by any other sanitary authority nor by the commissioners of any town.</P>
      <P>(2)  A sanitary authority may provide and maintain equipment and appliances for saving persons from drowning at&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a bathing place or swimming bath maintained by them,</P>
      <P>(b)  a bathing place or swimming bath situate in their sanitary district to which the public are admitted free of charge and which is maintained neither by them, by any other sanitary authority nor by the commissioners of any town, or</P>
      <P>(c)  any place situate in their sanitary district which is not a bathing place or swimming bath.</P>
      <P>This provision would authorise a sanitary authority to employ lifeguards at a bathing place or swimming bath maintained by that sanitary authority. It seems desirable that they should have power to provide and maintain lifeguards outside their own area. Take the City of Dublin, for example. Dublin Corporation, probably, will require such statutory power in connection with some of the seaside resorts convenient to the city, but yet not within the area of jurisdiction of the corporation.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 15-16, to delete the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment merely to call attention to the fact that the section allows by-laws not merely in relation to the matters referred to in the Fourth Schedule but in relation to anything else.  Why cannot it be confined to what is in the Fourth Schedule and, if necessary, enlarge it?  It details the prohibition of public bathing, the regulation of the manner in which bathing machines may be used, and the regulation of the conduct of persons resorting to any area and even the bathing togs that may be used?

The by-laws are subject to Ministerial sanction, and I do not think that anything of an extraordinary nature will be incorporated in them. No great advance defence can be made for the phrasing, and I do not think any great case can be made for the deletion of these words.  The section merely gives unlimited power, in addition to what is set out in the Fourth Schedule, to make by-laws in respect to matters that cannot be foreseen. It may be unnecessary, and it is unlikely to be abused.  I have no very strong views but I think it is better to leave the words there.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the Schedule as being a kill-joy one.  I quite agree with that.  Paragraph 10 of the Schedule places a restriction in regard to undressing on boys under six.  I know that some age has to be fixed but boys six years old would be incapable of dressing themselves, if segregated from families.  They would require the assistance of their mothers or some other person who would be in charge of them.  When bathing it might be dangerous to put them on a different part of the beach.  The effect would be to limit the amount of bathing that small boys do, and that would be unfortunate.  It all depends on the manner in which the Schedule would be interpreted.  As the section stands it seems to prohibit the present arrangement which does not give any annoyance.  I have been bathing on beaches all my life, and I have never been shocked when I have seen small boys bathing.</P>

Many mothers bring their children to Dollymount, Sandymount, Merrion, <Col N="1496" /> Portmarnock, Bray, and undress them when they are going to bathe. Anybody who would be shocked by seeing a child of ten years of age undressing should not be on the beach.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly 1846.  Section 77 of the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, also makes reference to conditions in relation to this matter.  Under the law at present the position can be dealt with in this way, as the provisions of the Act of 1846 include one for securing that men and boys above eight years old shall bathe separately from women and girls and children under eight years of age.  100 years ago eight years was considered to be the proper age limit.  As to how far and in what direction we have developed in the past 100 years would form a subject for very interesting discussion but I might point out to Deputy Byrne two things at least: In the first place, the by-laws will be made by the local authority, not by the Minister and, secondly, it is a reserved function, that he himself will have a hand in it.  The by-laws are subject to sanction.  So that I think, between Deputy Byrne on the outside and the Minister on the inside, we ought to be able to secure that there will be nothing incorporated in the by-laws that is highly objectionable. Personally I do not see any reason <Col N="1497" /> why, within the terms of paragraph 10 of the Fourth Schedule, it should not be possible to provide that mothers may be present with their six-year old children.  It says, &ldquo;the reservation of areas for undressing and dressing by boys under six years of age and families&rdquo; but it does not say that the by-laws must not include any provision regarding a person who may accompany children over six years of age.  However, I think the position is fairly fully safeguarded, first by the fact that we may presume, I hope, that the elected members of the local authority will act in a very responsible way, and we have the other safeguard that, if they should slip up seriously, the Minister will see that they do not do anything that is very foolish.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 68 provides that a sanitary authority may make by-laws for the regulation of a swimming bath or bathing place maintained by them, for the regulation of persons resorting to the swimming bath or bathing place and for the exclusion therefrom of undesirable persons, and the by-laws may empower any officer of the sanitary authority or any member of the Gárda Síochána to request any person contravening any of the by-laws to leave the swimming bath or bathing place and to remove him therefrom if he does not comply with such request.  I do not know exactly what the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind by the words &ldquo;undesirable person&rdquo;.  It would be very difficult for a sanitary authority to enforce the provisions of this sub-section in relation to a public bathing place, whatever they might be able to do in the matter of an enclosed bathing place or swimming bath.  I consider that this by-law is unnecessary and might lead to a good deal of trouble if a sanitary authority were to attempt to enforce it.  If it were a case of misconduct on the part of a particular person at the bathing place, I could conceive of a request of the kind being made but does it mean that a poor person whose presence might be objectionable to, shall we say, a person with certain social airs or graces, might be classed as undesirable and that that <Col N="1500" /> person might be at liberty to have him removed?</P>

      <P>The purpose of the provision was to arm sanitary authorities with necessary powers to exclude what are described as undesirable persons from swimming baths or bathing places maintained by them.  I grant that there may be considerable divergence of opinion as to what constitutes an undesirable person.  The definition could, I think, include a very wide scope of citizens but in this particular setting, anyhow, it is intended to cover the type of person who by his conduct had proved himself to be undesirable in the public bath or public bathing place provided and maintained by the sanitary authority.  I can very well envisage an undesirable person gaining admission to a public bath and making himself very much a nuisance by his conduct or his language.  I think the sanitary authority would be in a rather humiliating and helpless position if they had not any power to deal with him.  By reason, perhaps, of his previous conduct, he may have made himself fairly well known to the officials of the local authority who would be in charge of these places.  I think it is a proper provision.  Whether it can be amended in any way to make it more specific or to make its meaning more clear, I do not know.  I would be glad to have any suggestions which could be made under that heading. But I think the intention of the section is one upon which we should have agreement.</P>

Take paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Fourth Schedule regulating the conduct of persons resorting to an area. Under the Fourth Schedule people may be prevented from bathing except in specified places and they may have their conduct regulated when they resort to any place where they will be allowed to bathe.  If there is a breach of any of the regulations, they can be put out, requested to leave, or thrown out by the Guards.

      <P>You can get them out.  Suppose a person broke a by-law by using abusive language on three occasions and had been told to get out and got out.  If that person makes an appearance for the fourth time, is it proposed, because he misconducted himself three times, that he should not be allowed to bathe on the fourth occasion when he may conduct himself? He may be in a better state of mind, not having refreshed himself to the same extent; he may be in a better position to bathe in a wholesome way.  When we give power to a sanitary authority to make by-laws saying that people may not bathe except in specified areas, that they may only bathe within specified hours, that their conduct when they resort to any place where they may bathe is to be regulated by by-laws, and that if they break any of these by-laws through bathing at unspecified places, bathing at unspecified hours, or being ill-conducted when they do bathe, they can be asked to go out, and, if they fail to go, they can be thrown out by the Guards, why should we say that by-laws may be made to exclude <Col N="1503" /> undesirable persons?  I think that an undesirable person would be a person who broke by-laws.</P>

      <P>All the headings which the Deputy set out relate to the control of public baths or bathing places and the conduct of persons resorting to baths or public bathing places.  The exclusion of an undesirable person is an entirely different matter.  There is no power under the headings set out here to exclude from the baths an undesirable person.  There are persons who are well known to be undesirable and I think the local authority should have power to exclude them from baths.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 31, to delete all words after the words &ldquo;bathing place&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment to take out those words which would allow an officer of the sanitary authority to get a member of the Gárda to remove a person, who is in breach of a by-law, if he does not comply with a request to leave.  I should like to know the situation in which the Gárdaí can be told to throw a man out.  If he be a thief, as Deputy Dockrell suggested, he is caught in the act and the Gárdaí do not require this provision to put him out.  Is it contemplated that the sanitary authority should be given power to get a Gárda to throw a man <Col N="1505" /> out because some two or three persons say that somebody has had his hand in their trousers pocket?  I do not see any reason for taking this power to get the Gárdaí to remove a person. A person will be in breach of a by-law or he will not.  If he is, I imagine that penalties will attach to the breach. If a person is likely to cause a breach of the peace, he can be taken away by the Gárdaí without enlarging their present power.  If he is misconducting himself by way of obscenity, he can similarly be taken in charge by the Gárdaí without any special power.  We do not want further to widen the powers of the Gárda.</P>
    <P>An officer of the sanitary authority may ask a Gárda to request a man to leave if that person is in open contravention of a by-law.  Is it intended that the Gárda should have power to remove a man from a bathing place for breach of the by-laws?  There are by-laws to be made stating where a person is to bathe and the hours during which he is to bathe.  If a man goes to a bathing place ten minutes after the specified hour, are the Gárdaí to be asked to come and take him out?  Or is that to happen in the case of some breach of regulation with regard to the costume he wears?  I do not think that these extensions of the power of the Gárda should be permitted without knowing to what they relate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the section is very clear.  By-laws may be made to</P>
      <P>&ldquo;empower any officer of the sanitary authority or any member of the Gárda Síochána to request any person contravening any of the by-laws to leave the swimming bath or bathing place and to remove him therefrom if he does not comply with such request.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have discussed various matters which may be covered by the by-laws. A sanitary authority makes by-laws for the regulation and proper conduct of its public baths and bathing places. Somebody comes along and infringes those by-laws to such an extent that the responsible officer of the sanitary authority thinks such person should be <Col N="1506" /> requested to leave.  There ought not be much difficulty in envisaging circumstances under which that position would arise.  If the person refuses to leave, the section empowers the responsible officer of the sanitary authority to send for the Gárdaí.  The Gárdaí request the man to leave and, if he refuses to leave, they are empowered to remove him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, it would hardly be necessary to secure the assistance of the Gárdaí at all.  I do not think that this is an unreasonable power to vest in the officer acting on behalf of the sanitary authority.  Power must be vested in the officers who will be responsible for the control and management of these public baths and bathing places to ensure that the by-laws will be observed and that, if anybody refuses to observe them, he will be removed from the premises.  If such power is not vested in the sanitary authority, and power to act through its officer, I do not think that the by-laws could be properly enforced at all.  Deputy McGilligan may say that, if a person violates a by-law, we can have him brought into court and punished.  We can, but circumstances might be such as to demand that the person violating the by-law be removed from the premises without delay.</P>

      <P>I should like to know whether the county authority could delegate its functions in this respect to a local council or a local committee because I think in some cases it might be desirable to do so.  There is nothing more urgently needed than bathing accommodation particularly in places far removed from the seaside.  We have heard in other sections about the necessity for cleanliness.  One thing we know to be true is that there is a larger proportion of our population than that of the population of any other country who do not know how to swim.  That is a great handicap and I think it is a thing that should be rectified.  As far as most rural areas or small towns are concerned, no accommodation is provided.  We have been battling for weeks with infectious diseases, wallowing in drains and cesspools and we expect in a short time to pass on to the sombre subject of illegal burials.

      <P>In rural areas, the county authority would have the statutory powers in regard to this matter that <Col N="1512" /> town commissioners or urban authorities have in urban areas.  As to the delegation of their functions, there will be restrictions on that but the county authority can provide facilities and appoint a committee to control, supervise and operate the facilities.  The statutory responsibility for providing the money and equipment and for any extension of the development would rest with the local authority.  The only other way that facilities could be provided for a purely voluntary organisation would be by way of grants out of the unemployment relief fund but I do not think that would bring us very far in that type of development.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4), line 33, to delete the word &ldquo;summary&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole tendency in this measure is to make an enlargement of the criminal law, and, in doing so, to throw cases for consideration into the District Court by talking of summary prosecution and summary conviction on every possible occasion.  I want to draw attention to this, that, whether we say summary or not in these measures, that does not end the matter.  According to the Constitution, everybody who is charged with an offence has the right to have a trial by jury, which means a trial in a court higher than a District Court.  There are exceptions with <Col N="1514" /> regard to special courts which I am not considering at the moment, but the only big exception to that is in regard to those offences which are handed over for summary prosecution, and under the present Constitution the only offences that may be taken in a summary way are minor offences.  I have the feeling that whoever drafted this Bill had his eye not on the 1937 Constitution but on the 1922 document. Why I say that is this: that under the 1922 Constitution you had the same provision with regard to trial by jury and with regard to summary prosecution. It was stated that offences which were of a minor character, and which were made triable by summary prosecution under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, or any enlargement of it, could be presented before a summary court.</P>
    <P>Under the 1922 Constitution, if any Act said that the matter was one for summary prosecution or summary conviction that made it so; but saying it in an Act now does not make it so because it is a matter for the courts to consider whether or not it is a minor offence.  The mere fact that some piece of legislation says that the matter can be tried in a summary fashion does not mean that the offence will, when it comes to be charged in court, be taken in the District Court in a summary way.  It will be a matter for the determination of the court, whether or not the thing is a summary offence, judged by the only test which the Article of the present Constitution establishes, and that is whether it is a minor offence.  In that connection the courts have often established for themselves various tests by looking at the Act and considering whether a matter is one which might be met by a term of imprisonment of a minor type or some enlargement of it, or by some small fine or a large fine.</P>
    <P>This section speaks of a fine of £100. I should say that <i>prima facie</i> any offence which permits of a penalty as large as £100 would not be considered a minor offence by the courts, and, therefore, would not be triable in a summary way.  I do not know whether that point has been considered.  I rather take it that it has not, because we find this running right through the <Col N="1515" /> Bill&mdash;offences created which are made triable in a summary way with penalties ranging from £5 to £100, and in one instance to £500.  They are all, in a most generous and comprehensive way, regarded as summary offences.  I submit that will not be the test, and I think this is a good section to draw attention to the matter because the penalty here is £100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was mentioned earlier in our discussions by Deputy Costello.  Deputies will appreciate that it is a purely legal matter. It is largely a question of the interpretation of the Constitution.  Deputy McGilligan points out that by throwing such offences as are mentioned in this Bill into the district courts we are enlarging the criminal law, or at least widening the scope of the type of cases that, ordinarily, are disposed of in the districts courts.  The Deputy also mentioned the right of the subject to trial by jury, presumably on a criminal charge.  Needless to explain, I do not consider myself competent to deal with a question which relates purely to constitutional law.  Deputy McGilligan is an authority on that, and any views that I express will be those, more or less, of a layman on such matters.  I understand the Constitution provides that minor offences fall to be tried in the district courts, and that offences that are not deemed to be minor fall to be tried in the higher courts.  So far as my knowledge goes, we have no explicit definition of what constitutes a minor offence.  Now, if we relate the magnitude of the offence to the penalty attached to a breach of the law we certainly come right up against the position that a very wide range of matters falls to be dealt with by the district courts, and that these carry very substantial penalties.  In fact, under various enactments, the Road Traffic Act, for example, as well as under various customs and excise regulations, and statutory restrictions, heavy penalties are liable to be inflicted by the district court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be unconstitutional.  It is a matter which ought to be examined, but if the matters which are to be dealt <Col N="1516" /> with in the manner proposed under this Bill are held to be unconstitutional, on the ground that they cannot, within the Constitution, be deemed to be minor matters, I think we have reached a position in which many matters are being disposed of under various Acts of the Oireachtas in our district courts which ought properly to be dealt with in the higher courts.  Whether, in fact, we have been acting in an unconstitutional way all down the years, and whether Deputy McGilligan's explanation now offered of the difference in the position as compared with the position under the earlier Constitution adequately clarifies the matter, it is not for me to say.  The Deputy has raised an interesting point which the constitutional lawyers can enjoy themselves in elucidating.  In the meantime, I can only say that, if we are acting unconstitutionally in relation to this Bill, we have acted unconstitutionally in relation to quite a number of Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the point in order to have it considered.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to be able to say at a later stage that the various offences created by this measure have been brought under the consideration of some legal authority, and that that legal authority has expressed his view in an official way that they are all proper to be considered minor offences, and will, in all probability, be regarded as minor offences if brought before the court. I should like this one in particular to be brought to the notice of such legal authority.  Here is a case in which, for a breach of the regulation, a person may be fined £100 or may get a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, or may get both such fine and imprisonment.  If that particular type of thing is to be considered a minor offence, it must be remembered that, to that extent, the alleged right of a citizen to trial by jury is done away with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point may better be regarded in bulk.  This Bill creates an enormous number of offences, all of which, so far as I know, are to be brought before the summary courts.  That means that <Col N="1517" /> every offence that may be committed, in relation to which all sorts of penalties ranging from £5 up to, in one case, £500 are imposed, is to be a minor offence and that the citizen in breach of the regulations has no right to be tried by any jury.  I should like to have somebody with legal authority advising the Parliamentary Secretary that this point has been raised and giving an authoritative statement at some later stage that, these matters having all been considered, there is no hesitation on the part of the Government in saying: &ldquo;We know that this deprives the citizens of the right to trial by jury.  We think we are entitled to deprive them of that right and to hale them before the District Court&rdquo;.  If we can have an assurance that all the multitudinous offences created and the many penalties, both of fine and imprisonment, which are associated with a breach of the regulations have been considered, it means that the matter has not slipped through, that it has been considered and a definite decision given.</P>
    <P>It does not matter what the House says about it.  In the old days, if the House did say: &ldquo;This is to be tried summarily&rdquo;, it was so, because the Constitution declared that if any Act said that a matter was one to be dealt with summarily, it fell to be dealt with in that way.  The present Constitution does not say that.  The simple phrases are &ldquo;minor offences&rdquo; and &ldquo;triable summarily&rdquo;.  It is for the adjudicating authority, which would necessarily have to be the High Court, to say that this is or is not a minor offence.  In the case of any of these offences going before the District Court, it is open to any person alleged to be an offender to say he wants it removed to the High Court because that is the only court which can try any matter related to the provisions of the Constitution.  Every one of these things could, on the motion of the person aggrieved, be removed upstairs, not merely to the Circuit Court but to the High Court, for adjudication there as to whether or not the offence in the circumstances of its alleged commission was a minor offence.  I think we ought to pay some attention to that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the amendment ought not to be accepted. There are many foods in which certain constituents are more or less inevitably present and in several cases any standard fixed would of necessity be a maximum standard.  Take the case of butter and margarine.  The amount of water permitted to be present has obviously to be fixed at a maximum figure as water in these articles has no nutritive value.  Flour is also mentioned.  The fibre in flour is an inevitable concomitant of the milling process and any standard fixed would inevitably be a maximum standard. Certain foodstuffs are customarily permitted as ingredients of other particular foods which are regarded as diluents of the principal. For example, cereals are sometimes added to sausages more as a vehicle than as an addition to the nutritive value of the sausages, so that when <Col N="1519" /> these points are related to the Deputy's amendment, or when the Deputy's amendment is related to these considerations, it seems to me that the word &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; ought not to be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that one case under the offences sub-section. Suppose a person sells any of the articles for which a standard has been prescribed.  If the food does not conform to the standard so fixed, surely there will be a difficulty, if the standard is not phrased in terms of a minimum?  A person could sell milk which had more butter fat than was prescribed.  Nobody would think of penalising him for it, but there would be a possible offence under the section. Surely in regard to any diluents in any foodstuffs, the position can be met by phrasing it in terms of a minimum; in other words, by phrasing it so that the other ingredients shall be present in minimum percentages.</P>
      <P>I have always understood that the run of all these matters related to food and drink under the Public Health Acts was based upon minimum standards.  You can always get your minimum of the desirable matters in the composition and the offence then is only in cases where any person contravenes by falling below the minimum. Certainly, if regulations are going to be prescribed in regard to the sale of milk, that there shall be such and such an amount of butter and fat and if a person does not comply with that standard, if the milk has more butter or fat, it is not the situation that is usually contemplated.  I always understood it ran in entirely the opposite direction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shall not make such regulations except following the <Col N="1520" /> publication of a report from a duly qualified authority set up for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that amendment No. 27 also deals with this, but it can be considered separately.  We are, or ought to be, a rather important food-producing country and we have some of our very biggest industries based upon production of food and drink. If we tie up the manufacturers too tightly or if we, by Government action or regulation, interfere in too blind a way with the people carrying on those important industries, the result may be very harmful.  It is very desirable to protect the public interest in relation to the preparation of food and very desirable to have proper standards from the point of view of the excellence of the food, its nutritive value and the general public health.  I think that these two amendments should be accepted.</P>
    <P>The first says that, when any regulations are being made, they shall not be made until there has been an inquiry by qualified people into the matter the Minister is concerned about and that no action shall be taken as a result of that inquiry until the report has been fully published.  That is to ensure that the attention of persons engaged in the manufacture of food and drink will be fully drawn to the terms of the report and that the public will have an opportunity of understanding what is involved.  The second amendment, No. 27, says that, even assuming the proper authority has made an inquiry and has published the report, for general public information and for the information of persons engaged in the manufacture of articles of food and drink, when the Minister comes to frame the particular regulation dealing with such an item of food and drink, he should not make a regulation without first publishing the fact that he proposes to make such a regulation, in order to give an opportunity to manufacturers to study the regulation and make an appeal against any aspect of it they think may be undesirable or harmful from the manufacturing or any other point of view.  It is very desirable that the report would be published and that there would be a period <Col N="1521" /> for reviewing the regulations the Minister proposed to issue, so as to enable manufacturers to see exactly what the result of the regulations would be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 72 provides that, if the Minister is of opinion that the composition of any food, by itself or as an ingredient of any other food, consumed by the general public, is of special importance to the public health, he may, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture, make regulations prescribing the standard. The next sub-section sets out the particular matters that may be dealt with under those regulations.  Deputy Mulcahy's amendment No. 26 proposes that the Minister shall not make such regulations except following the publication of a report from a duly qualified authority set up for that purpose. I rather think the machinery he proposes would be cumbersome and difficult to operate.  To begin with, there should be some difficulty in defining &ldquo;a duly qualified authority&rdquo; for this particular purpose.</P>
      <P>I would direct the Deputy's attention to sub-section (1) of Section 72, which I have just recited.  Clearly, the regulations will not be made in any hasty way.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health will first consider the matter and, presumably, draft regulations will be drawn up.  These will be submitted then to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture.  Each of these Departments will be directly concerned, one with the agricultural industry and the other with the manufacturing industry in the main.  They, in turn, will consult the interests concerned before agreeing to the regulations.  Undoubtedly, as a result of the exchange of views, the three Departments will be brought into consultation on these regulations before they can become effective. Within that machinery, no doubt, the fullest consultation will take place with the persons immediately affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is the usual course to put a statutory obligation on a Minister, who has such a responsibility as is envisaged here, to consult everybody concerned or to consult, as the <Col N="1522" /> Deputy sets out here, what is described as &ldquo;a duly qualified authority.&rdquo;  It is much more important that consultation should take place with the interests immediately concerned in the question of food standardisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but there is provision for consultation between three Departments before anything effective can be done.  Everybody knows that each of the three Departments concerned will have the closest consultations with the interests involved before any decisions can be reached.  The Minister for Agriculture will take very good care that any regulations which are made will not injure agriculture. Similarly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be at pains to ensure that the regulations that are made will not unduly interfere with manufacturing processes.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health will be mainly concerned to secure that the health of the community will be safeguarded.  Not only is it unlikely, but it is scarcely conceivable that such regulations could or would be made without the fullest consultation with the various people concerned.</P>
      <P>In the setting up of such a body as Deputy Mulcahy has in mind, the selection of personnel would be a difficult matter and I doubt if any such authority could be set up as would be satisfactory or acceptable to the various interests involved.  I think it would be wiser to leave it to the ordinary process of consultation and inter-Departmental exchange of views, and that the results will not be found objectionable by any considerable section of the people concerned.  These regulations will always be open to public discussion and, if any regulations should be made within the powers conferred here, it will be open to people who feel aggrieved to have the matter fully discussed and, if not remedied, at least exposed.  I think that safeguard is the best that can be provided and I think it is a sufficient safeguard to satisfy anybody who is reasonably easy to satisfy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 4 of the Sale of Food <Col N="1523" /> and Drugs Act, 1899, it is provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Board of Agriculture may, after such inquiry as they deem necessary, make regulations for determining what deficiency in any of the normal constituents of genuine milk, cream, butter, or cheese, or what addition of extraneous matter or proportion of water, in any sample of milk (including condensed milk), cream, butter, or cheese, shall for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts raise a presumption, until the contrary is proved, that the milk, cream, butter or cheese is not genuine or is injurious to health, and an analyst shall have regard to such regulations in certifying the result of an analysis under those Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Sale of Food and Drugs (Milk) Acts of 1935 and 1936 enable the Minister for Agriculture, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, to make regulations prescribing the minimum percentages of milk fat and milk solids, whole milk, cream and skimmed milk.  They repeal Section 4 of the earlier Act in so far as it relates to milk and cream.  Under these provisions, as far as they go, in relation to the standardisation of the foods mentioned, the Minister for Agriculture, in the one instance, acting alone, has been free to make such regulations, after such inquiries as he deems necessary &mdash; regulations determining the type of matters it is proposed to determine under this section. Similarly, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1935 and 1936, the Minister for Agriculture, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government, was free to make regulations.  It was not necessary under either of those Acts to set up advisory authorities or what would be described as duly qualified authorities to report to the respective Ministers before making such regulations.  In so far as the limitations of the statutory powers permitted, these Acts have worked satisfactorily and there has not been any complaint on the ground that Minister acted in any hasty way or without full consideration of the relevant factors.</P>

      <P>In so far as cheese, butter and milk are concerned, there is nothing indicated under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d) that they apply to butter, milk or any of these things.  It is no use the Parliamentary Secretary feeling a sense of inferiority and feeling that a duly qualified authority, because it has not capital A's, might not refer to representatives of Government Departments. My intention in putting down &ldquo;duly qualified authority&rdquo; was somebody nominated by the Minister&mdash;a representative of the Department of Industry and Commerce, a representative of Agriculture or a representative of Local Government&mdash;being a duly qualified authority to inquire into any matter affecting the standards of food and drink.  What I am anxious about is that, in opening up this new field of inquiry and control, it would be systematically done and the public, in the first place, would be able to understand what was being done for the purpose of preserving proper standards in food and drink and, in the second place, that manufacturers would know the lines upon which their thoughts were expected to run in seeing that proper standards were secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any more satisfactory way than requiring that the field of food production that the Minister intended to review and to make regulations about, would be examined and that the public would have a report. The consultation with the Minister for Agriculture is intended, no doubt, to have certain safeguards and to result in inquiries, but I think an inquiry should be carried on in a formal way and there should be something informative and educational arising out of these inquiries.  There is nothing in the section which would put, from a statutory point of view, the onus on the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Agriculture to consult the industries or the persons concerned.  It is most desirable <Col N="1525" /> that there would be statutory safeguards for these people and I feel the best statutory safeguard they could have would be a formal report and the publication of that report.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) of Section 72 there is reference to the composition of any food consumed by the general public.  The Parliamentary Secretary has eliminated the words &ldquo;general public&rdquo; in the amendment he proposes.  What he said was probably drafted prior to the time that amendment was thought of.  The section relates to the food which is of special importance to the public health.  I cannot see what objection there should be to the taking of the second of the amendments, suggesting that there should be a notice outlining the regulation. The Parliamentary Secretary said the two Ministers will see that there will be consultation with the interests immediately concerned.  If they are going to see that there will be such consultation, why not say they must have it?  The Parliamentary Secretary's line has been that they will do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the second amendment asks is to give these interests and opportunity of putting themselves forward as people immediately interested when regulations are about to be made.  I am not so sure that these consultations with the interests directly concerned always take place.  I spent the morning dealing with one matter in which quite clearly the points in controversy were only in controversy because there had not been an association with the interests concerned. Anybody who has been through the courts within the last five years cannot have failed to observe the big number of occasions on which regulations were drafted and had to be amended simply because the consultation with the interests concerned took place after the first regulation came out, and when attention was drawn to the fact that a particular order had been made.  The analogy which the Parliamentary Secretary seems to make is not a correct one at all.  I agree that the regulations made by a Minister or by two Ministers in connection with a particular substance, either butter or <Col N="1526" /> milk, might be objected to by the public.  I do not know anything which has been the subject of so much inquiry as milk for the last 1½ years.  In fact, a commission was appointed to deal with it.  I do not think they have yet reported.  That was in relation to the whole Dairies Act, and it was proposed as a matter of urgent public importance. As far as I know, the public have not yet been enlightened as to the result of that inquiry.  The things that it is possible to discuss in connection with milk are limited.  There has been so much in the way of regulations and so much thought has been given to the matter that the points open to discussion are very limited.  The requirements to be discussed cannot be very wide. What is proposed here?  The section reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister is of opinion that the composition of any food consumed, whether by itself, or as an ingredient of other food, by the general public is of special importance to the public health, he may, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture, make regulations prescribing a standard for the composition of such food.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The nature, quality or amount of substance to be contained in the food as well as any substance not to be contained in it.  There is even a provision in relation to the methods to be used, and the time taken either in the manufacture, preparation or distribution of such food.  That is a very big area to open up.  Paragraph (2) (d) deals with the methods to be used in the manufacture of food.  Many people have processes of their own and it may be that, unless a manufacturer of a particular type of food got notice, that whole proprietary brand might be ruled out by regulation. One can imagine a regulation being made that stuff made in such a way could not be sold.  That might not happen in relation to proprietary articles but it might be necessary to give the maker notice so that he could have the manufacture modified.  All I ask of the Parliamentary Secretary is that notice should be given; a notice, giving some opportunity of an appeal <Col N="1527" /> being heard; in other words, publication to those immediately and directly concerned that a regulation was about to be made and inquiring what they had to say.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that he will have some report. I imagine he will.  It is not likely that one, two or three Ministers would think of this by themselves. What will happen in the ordinary way is that some one in authority in connection with the public health will draw attention to this matter.  I think one knows enough about the delay in Departments to realise that it will be canvassed before anything is done.  Surely these people should be given, at least, an indication that a report has been received, and generally what the subject matter of the report is.  There is nothing formal with regard to this.  It seems quite proper to insist that notice should be given. If any question arose, some exception would have to be made.  Something might occur as to the prohibition of certain foods.  That could be provided for.  In the general run, these regulations will, I assume, be made in a leisurely way.  It is always better to have people's attention drawn beforehand to such matters and to let them come and make their observations.  It is said the difference between the English community and this community is that, in matters of legislation, the English community always make their objection before a law is passed but that once it becomes law they are out to obey it, and that here it is the reverse. You take away the stimulus to agitation if you give notice of what is to be done.  There is nothing about representations in the amendment.  It simply provides that notice be given and that people be given an opportunity of having their say.  The Parliamentary Secretary might consider the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £750,640 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1947, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (44 and 45 Vict., c. 49, sec. 46, and c. 71, sec. 4; 48 and 49 Vict., c. 73, secs. 17, 18 and 20; 54 and 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38 and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c. 42; Nos. 27 and 42 of 1923; No. 25 of 1925; No. 11 of 1926; No. 19 of 1927; No. 31 of 1929; No. 11 of 1931; Nos. 33 and 38 of 1933; No. 11 of 1934; No. 41 of 1936; and No. 26 of 1939).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> Compared with last year's figure the net Estimate shows an increase of £57,182, of which £54,216 is attributable to the three sub-heads A, B and I, covering respectively, salaries, travelling expenses and estate improvement works.</P>
    <P>The increase of £25,046 in sub-head A is due partly to the emergency bonus granted under the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) regulations, and partly to the provision of £17,000 to cover proposed additions to the staff of the purchase branch and the acquisition and re-sales division.</P>
    <P>Travelling expenses under sub-head B are up by £4,000.  The gradual improvement in the petrol and tyres situation, coupled with the prospects of filling vacancies in the outdoor staff, holds a promise of increased field activities on the part of our inspectors and surveyors.</P>
    <P>The maximum which it is considered can be usefully spent on improvement works while the present shortage of materials continues is £254,800&mdash;the amount asked for under sub-head I. Building and constructional work is still restricted by shortage and high prices of materials, and we can only hope to do somewhat better than last year, when we spent £202,000.  The increase of £25,170 is therefore based on the doubtful prospect of an immediate, if slight, improvement in the flow of supplies.</P>
    <P>There is little need for me to comment on the other items beyond mentioning that sub-head H (3), which is increased by £2,000, is one of four statutory sub-heads (H (1) to H (4)) devoted in the main to the servicing of Land Bonds.  The total amount required under these sub-heads is £771,100, considerably more than half of the total net estimate.</P>
    <P>In introducing last year's Estimate, I emphasised that the most essential task of the Land Commission was the clearing up of an immense accumulation of arrears arising out of past operations.  In this arrear category I placed the 73,000 holdings of tenanted land vested in the Land Commission under the Land Acts, 1923-39, and not yet revested in the tenants, as well as some 15,000 tenanted holdings on the <Col N="1530" /> former Congested Districts Board estates; and I drew attention to the absolute necessity of achieving more in the way of output if the tenant-purchasers affected were to be made owners in fee-simple in anything like reasonable time.  I am glad to report that during the past year 4,100 holdings in the first class were revested, as against 1,400 in the year 1944-45. Some 520 holdings of tenanted land on the old Congested Districts Board estates were also vested in the tenants &mdash;more than doubling the figures for the previous year.  These old holdings I should particularly like to see disposed of, but most of them are congested holdings requiring rearrangement, enlargement or improvement before they can be revested.</P>
    <P>I also spoke of some 45,000 parcels of untenanted land allotted, but not yet vested in the allottees, title to which, in common sense and equity, apart from the fact that it is our statutory duty to do so, should be given to those who have made good, before land division on an appreciable scale adds to the waiting list.  In this respect, also, we have made fair progress, some 2,100 parcels having been vested in allottees during the year as against 558 in 1944-45.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of revesting, the slowing-down in the division of land, brought about by circumstances outside the control of the Land Commission, is really an advantage of which I propose fully to avail myself. I am satisfied that a sustained effort to expedite the revesting of holdings, both tenanted and untenanted, is being made: the figures of holdings revested which I have just quoted are the immediate fruit of that effort.  But I will not be satisfied until the pace is so accelerated that, by the time normal conditions return and land division and rearrangement of holdings form once more a substantial part of a full Land Commission programme, the Land Commission will have been relieved of much of the arrears with which they are at present so heavily burdened.  To that end I am at present negotiating with the Minister for Finance for the additional staff to which I referred when dealing with sub-head A.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> I know that most Deputies are more interested in the question of the acquisition and division of land than in the equally important but more or less unseen work of revesting.  I anticipate that many will demand to know why, now that most of our staff have been returned, we do not concentrate on that side of our work.  The answer is simple: new holdings mean new houses and building materials are not yet forthcoming in quantity.  Besides, we are still short of inspectors&mdash;some absent on loan and some vacancies unfilled.</P>
    <P>Last year, acquisition of fresh land was virtually confined to commitments already undertaken and to areas needed for turbary or afforestation. The area acquired for division came to about 9,000 acres, while roughly 13,000 acres were divided.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have on hands at present some 40,000 acres, more or less, of arable land and pasture suitable for division, apart from 60,000 acres of mountain, moor and bog.  The division of these 40,000 acres presents a problem to which priority must be given.  A large part of it is in the midland counties and, on paper, is laid out in holdings mainly intended for migrants, local needs on the individual estates concerned having been reasonably satisfied.  But for the emergency these holdings would before now have been equipped with buildings and suitable migrants would have been installed. As it happened, the Land Commission were faced with the problem of what to do with the land during the past six years.  Originally intended for early division, it had to be tilled or grazed in the interests of the nation's larder and of the national economy and, as continuous cropping tends to exhaust fertility, it is incumbent on the Land Commission to endeavour to dispose of the areas as soon as building materials become available.</P>
    <P>Priority will also be given to that part of the lands in hands which, as Mayo Deputies, for instance, will know, is held over to be the basis of complete schemes of rearrangement for some of the large and badly congested <Col N="1532" /> western estates.  Some of these rearrangement schemes are ready to be put into operation; they are a credit to their originators but, unfortunately, building materials are essential for their execution and without the materials they must stay on paper.  Other essentials are agreement between the tenants to accept rearrangement and a sufficiency of inspectors to handle a most intricate job.</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough to make the position clear.  With conditions as they are I can see no practicable alternative to present policy and it is quite useless for the public, or Deputies on behalf of the public, to urge the Land Commission to acquire fresh land here, there, and everywhere.  The Land Commission can do no more than take note for future use of any representations made; they cannot travel beyond their capacity either now or in the future.</P>
    <P>The debate on the Land Bill recently before the House will have given Deputies an opportunity of examining one of the post-division tasks of the Land Commission.  The placing of the allottees on probation long enough to test their suitability is a precautionary step which experience has shown to be absolutely necessary; at the same time it adds immensely to the duties of the staff.</P>
    <P>Let me close on a more cheerful note.  The collection arrear for all gales since 1933 as it stood on 1st March last was £352,930&mdash;that is to say, only 1.15 per cent. of the total amount collectable.  A collection representing 98.85 per cent. of 12 years' annuities is a definite indication of the general prosperity of the farming community and the financial credit of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a motion on the Order Paper dealing with the very important question of land division, and I do not want to anticipate that motion.  Realising the difficulties in regard to the food requirements of the world, and the likelihood of the requirements of the world in the matter of food not being available for many years, I think we should appreciate that the disposition and the utilisation <Col N="1533" /> of land is of paramount importance. When we notice what those nations that attended the Hot Springs Conference were planning to do to provide an adequate diet for all the people of the world, a properly balanced, nutritious diet, I think that the food required to fulfil that programme will be appreciably more than the amount of food that was available in the world pre-war, and will be food of a different character.  The protective foods will have to be substantially increased.  In our circumstances here, I think our capacity to produce protective foods is obvious.  Therefore, I feel that the responsibility of dealing with the disposition of land is a very important one for the Department concerned.  I often wonder what exactly is our land policy in that respect.  I have been in this Dáil for some time now, and I have never heard a Minister elaborate in detail exactly what our land policy is.  I think it is important that we should have a land policy, that we should have a certain goal at which to aim.  I think also that it is unfortunate that we have no co-operation between the Department charged with the responsibility of looking after the disposition of land and the Department of Agriculture that is charged with the responsibility of looking after the utilisation of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems which confront us, so far as stagnation in our production is concerned, must definitely be related to this whole question of land disposition and land utilisation and the selection of people who are to use the land in the national interest.  The Minister has indicated recently in the discussion on the Land Bill that he is anxious to ensure that only people will be put on the land who are capable of utilising it properly. That is a step in the right direction.  Whatever activities are to take place, so far as the Minister's Department is concerned, in the division and rearrangement of land, I feel that when there is an estate, whether large or small, being divided in a particular locality, the activities of the Land Commission ought to go outside that estate.  Their activities ought not to be confined merely to the <Col N="1534" /> estate, because we all know that all over the country there are economic difficulties so far as certain holdings are concerned.  When we talk about rearrangement, I suggest that we should aim at empowering the Land Commission to go outside the particular estate concerned&mdash;possibly they have the power at present; I believe they have&mdash;and try to deal with any economic difficulties in that particular neighbourhood.  If a man has two small holdings that are not economically placed in relation to each other, that should be taken into account in the division of the particular estate. That could be corrected without any great difficulty.  If the Land Commission are to do their job properly, I think that when they are charged with the responsibility of looking after land they ought to deal with the disposition of land generally.  If an opportunity occurs to correct an economic difficulty so far as the ordinary tenant farmer is concerned and his position could be improved, it would be not only an advantage to him, but a national advantage as well, because economy in utilisation of land is very important and eventually substantially affects the cost of production.</P>
    <P>If we are to survey the situation, and if the Minister is looking into the future and making up his mind what the Land Commission are to do under his guidance in the coming years, I feel that in dealing with an estate, the Land Commission ought to try to correct any difficulties there are in the particular neighbourhood, because it is the only opportunity they will ever have to correct difficulties of that sort. I suggest, therefore, that the Land Commission should avail of every opportunity to deal with matters of that sort.</P>
    <P>With the change in the methods of using land in other countries, and with the tendency to increased mechanisation in this country, I think that the Minister, in the division of estates, especially big estates, ought to try to encourage co-operation.  As a matter of fact, I think he could actually start to help people whom he is settling on the land to work co-operatively in the way of having a machinery centre and <Col N="1535" /> utilising that machinery in their own interests.  We all know that a great deal of the failure that has occurred in connection with people settled on what are supposed to be economic holdings is due to the difficulty of maintaining sufficient equipment to work the holding.  For instance, on a holding of 20 or 25 acres, it is extermely difficult for a tenant to maintain a pair of horses.  It would scarcely be economic for him to have all the equipment necessary to work the holding efficiently.  If we continue in connection with our policy of land division to settle people on rather small holdings, I think the Minister cannot look forward to any great measure of success unless we attend to the problem of equipping people to use their land properly.  That can be done only by ensuring that they will co-operate and that the modern equipment necessary to expedite work on the farm is available to them at a reasonable charge.  It would not be difficult to do it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look into the matter.  We should be, at least, experimenting in that respect.  When we were discussing the Land Bill, the Minister told us of the number of failures that had occurred and we know the powers he sought, and got, in the Land Bill. Surely, the Minister should concern himself with ascertaining what is responsible for the large number of failures and why it is necessary for him to take those exceptional powers to dispossess people who were placed on the land.  He should satisfy himself as to whether they are given a fair chance and whether the means at their disposal for working the land are sufficient. I do not think that they are. The Minister and his Department should ensure that the people settled on the land get a fair chance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he proposes to deal with the land at present in the hands of the Land Commission before acquiring any considerable area of new land.  I think that that is absolutely sound.  The Minister mentioned the considerable amount of land in the hands of the Land Commission. Some of it has been in their <Col N="1536" /> hands for many years.  I believe that some of it was acquired by the old Congested Districts Board and has not yet been rearranged.  That is not very creditable or desirable.  The Minister rightly mentioned another aspect of this important problem&mdash;that land in the hands of the Land Commission, has, in order to comply with the compulsory tillage Order, to be let in conacre year after year.  If the Land Commission are to be the arbiters on the question whether a tenant is using good husbandry or not, they themselves should set a good example.  If a person claims to be a judge in a particular matter, he should not be an offender in that respect himself.  The Land Commission claim to be judges of what is good husbandry.  At the same time, they are responsible for the very worst form of husbandry, because a great deal of land has been abused during the emergency and its fertility lowered because of continuous cropping.  That is most unfair and unfortunate so far as the incoming tenant is concerned.  Practical farmers know very well that fertility is not restored to land in a year or two years.  Incoming tenants on lands which have been abused in that fashion have to face a great handicap.  They have to restore to the land something which is very valuable and which has been destroyed by the policy pursued. I am glad that the Minister has made up his mind to deal with the arrears of land division.  That is essential.  This House should be very strong in its criticism of any abuse of the land, especially by a Department of State.</P>
    <P>On that question of the acquisition of land, the practice of the Land Commission was to serve a resumption notice on the owner of land, and let that resumption notice lie for many years before the land was acquired. That practice is very bad and unsound. A resumption notice means to the owner of the land that his period of occupation is to be short.  Obviously, the owner or occupier will take all he can out of the land while the going is good.  I know of one or two cases in which land has been abused and its fertility has deteriorated because the owner realised that his interest would continue only for a few short years. <Col N="1537" /> In all cases where resumption notices are in operation, the question whether the Land Commission will take the land over or not should be determined at the earliest moment.  The Minister mentioned that there were 40,000 acres of land in the Midlands still to be dealt with, and that plans for its division had already been prepared with a view to settling migrants on it, after local needs had been dealt with.  I want to stress that qualification.  I do not think that the people of Kildare or Meath have any objection to providing land for people living under congested conditions in the West, but it is grossly unfair to pass over the claims of some of the local people who have small holdings and are capable of using land.  Their ancestors may have been evicted from the particular estate about to be divided.  They know that their chances of getting land in the future will be very remote if their claims are not attended to at the time of division.  It is grossly unfair to local interests that the claims of people in the area should not be even examined. We know that that has taken place both in North Kildare and in County Meath.  A number of estates were, before the emergency, settled with 100 per cent. migrants and local interests were ignored.  That has given rise to bitter feelings&mdash;with a good deal of justification.  Let the Minister bring in migrants by all means when dealing with these 40,000 acres of which he speaks, but let him make sure that the claims of local people are carefully examined.  If local people who have a claim show that they are capable of using the land, they should be provided for.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the figures given by the Minister regarding the vesting of land showed some increase.  Even with the increase indicated, it would take many years to deal with the whole question of vesting.  The primary purpose of the Land Commission, when first set up, was to deal with this question of vesting.  In the past 20 years, very slow progress has been made so far as vesting is concerned, and that is a disgrace.  It is the right of the tenants to be made the real owners of their property.  That responsibility <Col N="1538" /> was placed on the Land Commission many years ago, and nothing can be offered as an excuse for their failure. The problem is still there.</P>
    <P>The amount of land that has been vested is not anything like 50 per cent. of the total.  I do not want to minimise the difficulty.  I know it is rather an involved matter which requires a good deal of examination, as the Land Commission must be satisfied that everything is in order before a holding is vested.  I think the Minister is anxious to attend to this problem.  I understand that the staff dealing with the matter has been increased, and I hope it will be increased still further, because even the increase the Minister indicated this evening would not be anything like sufficient to deal with the matter in a reasonable period.  The Minister, in regard to sub-head I, told us that the building and construction work is still restricted, and I suppose it is likely to remain restricted for a considerable period.  The difficulty of getting timber especially is very great, but there is a good deal of work to be done and more money should be spent under that sub-head.</P>
    <P>One of the things I could never understand is the policy behind the method adopted in the selection of tenants.  I think we ought to aim at having the best possible machine so far as the selection of tenants is concerned. We must realise that there is only a limited amount of land available for division and the Minister's aim should be to select tenants who are best qualified to use that land, especially tenants whose existing holdings are uneconomic.  I think that the Government's policy in recent years has come round to a large extent to that object.  In the early years of the Fianna Fáil Government a good many landless men got land and a great many of them proved to be failures.  I think the Minister has made it perfectly clear on more than one occasion recently that his anxiety is to solve the problem of uneconomic holdings. I think he would almost go so far as to say that land should be provided exclusively for the solution of the prolem of the uneconomic holding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> At all events, in the division of estates, the aim should be to use the land mainly to provide allotments for uneconomic holdings in the district.  It is only in the event of failure to select tenants from that category that we should give land to landless men because, as I have said, experience has shown that very few of the landless men have proved a success in these holdings.  Very few of them were in a position to work the land; very few of them had the necessary capital, equipment or stock.  I feel that the present method of selecting tenants&mdash;sending down an inspector to go round as a sort of detective through the district to ask Paddy Murphy what he thought about John Ryan as a tenant, and encouraging neighbours to tell lies about one another&mdash;is all wrong.  However, I have a motion on the Order Paper in relation to this matter and I do not want to anticipate the debate that will take place on that motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the bulk of the increase in the Estimate, about £57,000 odd, is due to the increase on the cost of living bonus.  There is also an increase in the amount of travelling expenses of £4,000.  I suppose that means that there are more inspectors on the road.  I do not think there is very much change in the other sub-heads. The Minister has already indicated that the principal increases occurred in sub-heads A and B.  Sub-head A is up by about £25,000, and sub-head B by about £4,000.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether the increase under sub-head B means that the staff down the country has been increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Land Bill a few weeks ago has more or less superseded this debate because practically everything that could be said in regard to land division was said on that Bill.  I was glad that the Minister had the pleasing information for those tenants who have had their land for the past 15 or 16 years that they were going at last to be vested. That has been a burning question with most of us for quite a long time.  I <Col N="1540" /> am glad that the Minister is going to tackle it and that he hopes that inside 12 months these allottees will be in a position to call the land their own and to deal with it as they would like to deal with it.  Before land division starts, on a new scale, I should like to see a general review of the principles governing land division so that we shall be able to see the errors of our ways in the past and take such steps as are necessary to climinate these errors in future.  I think one of the first questions calling for examination is whether we are satisfied that we are not creating new agricultural slums in the cottages which are being built on small holdings in the Midlands. I think that is a matter that will seriously affect the future prosperity of the agricultural population if we do not give it the necessary consideration now.  In my county, which is one of the most important from an agricultural point of view in the country, we have had a number of new colonies started in recent years.  The cottages on these colonies may look very well at the moment when times are good, when money is flowing freely around the country and the tenants are doing fairly well.  I do not think, however, that we shall always be in the happy position of getting good prices for everything we have to sell and these tenants will be severely tested when the bad times come.  Will a tenant with a holding of 25 statute acres be able to make good in such times and, if not, what will happen in these colonies?  That is one of the matters which I should like the Minister to review before we decide to go on creating new colonies and expecting people to live on holdings of 21 or 25 acres.  I know there is not enough land to go around but, at the same time, what is the use of creating agricultural slums?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to review that position fully.  Suppose we have a period of depression in the next five, six or even ten years, and that these holdings are vested, if a man finds that he cannot make a living out of his holding, he will put it up for sale and get out.  We do not want that to happen.  I saw that happen on an estate within the last 25 years.  It <Col N="1541" /> occurred in the case of the Browne estate outside of Trim.  Of the ten or 12 allottees who got holdings on it, I do not think that there are more than three of the original men there to-day. One man did very well.  He was the herd.  He was a thrifty, hard-working man, and, thanks to his energy, he has bought up practically half that estate, and is a well-to-do man to-day. That, of course, is bound to bring us back to the ranching system again. That sort of thing is bound to happen if, in the first instance, you do not give a man a holding large enough to enable him to rear his family on.  He ought to be in a position to be able to do that in bad times as well as in good times.</P>
    <P>I live in the County Meath, and I am satisfied that no man who has to live by the land alone can live out of 25 acres.  The Minister will reply to me that the migrants there are doing very well.  I agree, but so is everybody else who wants to work his land. Everybody who has land to-day is doing fairly well.  They are all making a little money.  What I want to tell the Minister is this, that while the migrants there are making good, and are working hard, they are not making their living solely out of the land.  I am sure he will agree with me on that.  Large numbers of their young men and women go across to England, where they earn good money.  Portion of it goes to the payment of rents and rates. The fact that it is coming into the country is all to the good.  There is no use in anybody saying, however, that the migrants there are living solely out of the land, because they are not.</P>
    <P>In connection with the colonies that we have in Meath, I want to put this point to the Minister; I think it is a bad thing to have them isolated. Groups of migrants are brought from Mayo, Clare or Kerry.  You may have 20 or 30 families.  A colony is formed, and that group of people is more or less isolated from the people of the county.  The tendency is to create a feeling of mistrust between the migrants and the people of Meath.  The two peoples do not mix.  The Meath people look on them as a blight, and they look on the Meath people as <Col N="1542" /> bounders.  If the Department has to make colonies in Meath, then let there be a mixture of Meath and Kildare people with people from Mayo, Kerry and Clare.  The House seemed to be alarmed at the conditions in Meath as I described them here some time ago. Deputies need not be alarmed.</P>
    <P>The conditions there are bad, with fighting going on from publichouse to dance hall.  It is a shame to see what happens there.  I believe myself that the cause of it all is that no attempt is made to have a blending of the Meath men with those from Kerry and other counties.  The Meath man may say to the Kerry man: &ldquo;What brought you up here to get land that should be given to us?&rdquo;  The other man replies that his people were driven off the land 100 years ago.  That is how fights start.  They fight from dance hall to dance hall, in publichouses and in public places.</P>
    <P>The people in Meath have no objection to the migrants coming there if a good, decent type is brought.  I must say that during the last seven or eight years the Department has concentrated on bringing a good, manly type of migrant to the county.  My advice to the Department is that if we are to have more colonies in Meath, then some effort should be made to mix the people of Meath with the migrants. That is the only way in which we will get rid of this bitterness, all the fighting and squabbling that goes on. We are all Irishmen, and we all like the other fellow if e can.  It is all a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; to say that colonies of Irish speakers have been put there who will help to bring back the Irish language. What I find is that the people who come there from the West and South are doing their level best to learn good English.  The young people say that is their ambition, so they will be able to go across to England and earn their living.  There are several people in my locality at the present time who are waiting for their passports to go to Britain.  The fact is that in Meath at the present time the whole ambition of these people is to get to the other side so that they may be able to get quick money.  They do not want to work in Ireland.  I agree that in the <Col N="1543" /> case of some of them, when they make good money on the other side, they come back and marry into a neighbour's farm.</P>
    <P>In connection with the division of land in Meath and in other parts of the Midlands, I want to suggest to the Minister that I think it would be far better, instead of giving an allottee a horse or a cow, to give him a good farm of land and £200 in cash.  With this money he could buy a cow or a horse if he wanted one, or a mowing machine. There is no use in the Land Commission forcing a cow or a plough on a man who wants something else.  Give him the £200 in cash and 30 acres of land, and see to it that he spends that money wisely.  Some of the horses that have been given to those allottees were most unsuitable.  The Land Commission paid up to £60 and £65 for some of them.  In fact, they purchased half-thoroughbreds that cost £70 and £75.</P>
    <P>What is the use in giving a half-thoroughbred to an unfortunate man who has hardly ever yoked an ass to a car in his life?  When a man like that takes out a half-bred horse, he soon finds himself on the roadside with the horse kicking sky-high.  A veterinary surgeon told me that he is out practically night and day attending the horses given to some of these allottees. The horses get caught in the barbed wire and injure themselves badly.  I have known of cases where good horses that cost £70 or £80 had to be sold within a fortnight by the migrant for a £5 note.  In other cases the horses had to be destroyed.  That is why I suggest that the £200 in cash should be given to an allottee with a fairly good farm of 30, 35 or 40 acres.  If that were done, those people would make good farmers.  The British did that when they were here.  I do not mention that with the intention of suggesting that everything the British did here was right.  But they did that in the case of some land that they divided before we got our freedom, and that method proved satisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I want to bring to the Minister's notice, and it is that these allottees have no place in which to store the grain that they <Col N="1544" /> grow.  They are given a little stable or shed for a horse and a couple of cows. What they need most of all is accommodation for the storing of grain.  At present they have to put it in a room in the house, but after a week or so it begins to sprout.  The result is that they have to dispose of it to the nearest merchant as quickly as possible and at whatever price they are offered.  It would be of great advantage to them if they could hold the grain until such time as a reasonable price was to be obtained.  If the Land Commission is not prepared to put up a loft for the allottee it should at least allow him to spend an additional £5 in having the walls of the shed raised a yard higher.  I say to many of these new allottees: &ldquo;Get it specially built; the Land Commission will not build the walls high enough for you to put in a loft.  Go to your contractor and tell him that you are prepared to put up so much money to have the roof raised four feet.&rdquo;  The Land Commission engineer almost always agrees and says he is glad to see these allottees putting up a little of their own money for the out-offices.</P>
    <P>It is most essential that every allottee should have a grain loft, because it is not possible to store wheat, oats or barley on the ground floor.  It must be stored up high on a good wooden floor.  When sowing time comes around, all these allottees have to rush to the merchants to buy grain at huge prices and in many cases they get the same grain as they sold earlier at low prices.  It will cost the Land Commission very little to do what I suggest.  The aim of the Land Commission is to make a holding a good holding, and the only way to do it is by giving the allottee a chance, by giving him a good loft.  With regard to the fencing of holdings, nearly everybody who came up to Meath got a pair of piers and a gate, but the Meath people who got farms in most cases got neither piers nor gates, and I urge the Minister to see to it that, when a man gets a new house and a holding, he will at least get a pair of piers and a gate.  He is certainly entitled to it.  Let there be no discrimination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> After 25 years of land division, we find that the majority of our little holdings are fast deteriorating, and I defy contradiction of that statement.  It is easy to understand why that should be so.  The land of Meath was formerly the richest in Europe.  It would grease your boots to walk through it, but, with these small uneconomic holdings, people can feed only small stock.  The hardest animals in the world are young live stock who take the bone out of the land, and the small allottee cannot get manure enough to replace it, with the result that the land is deteriorating year after year.  It is all due to the fact that these men have not got enough land, and so can have no rotation. If a man with 25 acres wants to work on an economic basis, he must keep two horses and three cows.  If he does so, he will be able to keep very little more, whereas if he had 30 to 35 Irish acres, he would be able to close off part of his holding during the winter and have it in good trim for 1st April for putting his cows and young stock out.  At present nearly all these allottees are trying to put in all the stock they can, and I do not blame them.  It is the only way they can make their holdings pay, but the result is that they have more stock on the holdings in winter than they can hold and the animals are deep in mud, from October to April.  The land does not get the smallest chance to get into condition.  The land is fast deteriorating, and that is why I ask the Minister to review the position, with a view to seeing whether he can make the holdings a little bigger, and so enable men to close off ten acres or so and give it a chance of getting into condition for two or three months.  It would make a vast difference to the economy of the men on these holdings.  These men are able to produce only small scraggy store cattle and are never able to turn them out for fairs or markets in proper fettle.  The result is that the bigger man buys these cattle at scrap prices and brings them to his rich lands, possibly across the road, where they immediately start to thrive and he doubles his money on every bullock he buys.</P>
    <P>Our small people will never be able to get on their feet if we continue this <Col N="1546" /> policy of giving them small holdings. As one who lives in their midst and who has a small holding, I know what I am talking about.  I want to see the policy stopped, because these men in bad times will never make good, and as fast as these little holdings can be sold, they will be sold when depression comes along.  There is nothing else for them to do.  Even in good times, these men are put to the pin of their collar to make good, and if they have from six to nine children, they have livings which are amongst the most miserable in Europe.  I do not suggest that the man with five or six sons up to 18 years of age has a miserable time.  He is able to make good because he has not got to pay any wages.  The sons perhaps get half a crown at the end of the week, but the man with a young family has a hell of a job.  The fact is that that man is in rags.  I know that the small, uneconomic farmer is one of the most miserable creatures, with never a day's comfort.  When the farm is beginning to get on its feet, that unfortunate man dies.  He may leave a little behind for his children, but during his lifetime he will have had no comfort.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new Land Bill, I was sorry that it had to be introduced, but I know that the Minister had no alternative.  There are a vast number of men who could have made good, but did not, and there are other men who could have made good but for the fact that the hand of God was against them.  I know one man who, within a month of getting his farm, lost all his stock through a fire, but I am glad to say he is getting on his feet again.  I know another man with a large family whose wife was taken from him and who was left in a miserable condition. Another man has been in bad health for the past ten years and will never be able to make good.  I ask the Land Commission to be lenient with these people, to judge each case on its own merits.  I do not, however, ask them to be lenient with the &ldquo;buckos&rdquo; who got a new house and a farm and who will not live in them, who in many cases have set the houses and live perhaps in a labourer's cottage.  These are fiends who deserve everything.  These men are doing more harm to County <Col N="1547" /> Meath than anything else.  It is easy for the Land Commission to tell me: &ldquo;So-and-so got a new house and a farm and never lived in it and why should any other Meath man get a farm?&rdquo; and to say that they will bring them from the North, South and West and show the Meath people how to work the land, but that is not fair because the fact is that many of these people who got land never should have got it. It is a disgrace that these men should have got new houses and farms valued at £1,200 for which they had no respect.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the Gore Estate, Dunshaughlin, where cattle taken in on the 11 months' system from the big ranchers were allowed to roam around, smashing glass in windows, tearing the doors off the houses and leaving the place in a dirty condition. If you saw the condition of the place, you would not sleep a night afterwards. Six or seven houses were allowed to go derelict.  These &ldquo;buckos&rdquo; would not live in them and would not even put a fence around the houses and they still hold the land.  If they do not mend their ways, I hope the Land Commission will give them the order of the boot as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the unfortunate tenant who got into difficult circumstances.  There are many like that.  Forty or 50 of the new tenants in County Meath may find themselves at the pin of their collar to keep their holdings, under the new Land Bill.  I ask the Minister to take each on his circumstances and to have his inspectors visit the parish priest of the area, who knows the circumstances in every case from A to Z.  Many of those who may be evicted under the new Land Bill are the unfortunate victims of circumstances and would have made good if they could.  It is not their fault.  I know that we did give land to men who never had a shilling.  That type of man will never make good, as he has not the inclination in the first place and has not the land spirit in the second place.  Such men never care whether they rise or fall.  Even if some of them fall and <Col N="1548" /> rise in the morning they do not continue and they say that the moment they are vested they will cash in and get out.  I know many of them who are waiting to be vested in order to get out.  Even so, I would rather see them vested and let them get out, so that some thrifty lad may come in and make good.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hughes, who mentioned that when dividing a large estate one should go outside the scope of a mile-and-a-half.  There are many small farms which have ten acres at the home, five acres further on and perhaps five more further away.  It is a most wasteful position and it is not economic.  They have to do a little farming here and a little farming there.  Such men should be able to say: &ldquo;I have three little holdings and will give them up for a full estate.&rdquo; Their case should be considered.  The first thing we want in land division is economic holdings&mdash;to make uneconomic holdings economic.  There are many little farmers in my own area who could be put on those estates and who would do work which would have a lasting effect.</P>
    <P>I again stress the point I started on, that if you are making new colonies you must see that you mix the Meath people and the other people so that there will be friendship.  It should not be as it is at present, with the migrant's son on one side of the road and the Meath people on the other side of the road, at the church gates, with no friendship between them. There is no reason why they should not be friendly.  As it is, if there is a charity dance being run, you find they come together.  But then, when there are three or four pints exchanged between them, you find them quarrelling with one another.  It is all over the land.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not believe me, let him go down to any part of County Meath and see what is wrong.  Things do not all appear in the papers, but enough appears in the papers to alarm the people.  The migrants were rushed in too quickly and too secretly.  No one was told anything about it.  All we knew was that charabancs and buses came to the town of Navan and the <Col N="1549" /> people were left there at the hotels. The hotels were told to have so many dinners ready for so-and-so, and so the migrants were brought down to the colonies.  If the word were carried beforehand, instead of doing it in secret, there would be much better results.  The Meath people said: &ldquo;We are not going to have these people in here; we want the land of Meath for the people of Meath.&rdquo;  I do not stand for that.  Let the land be divided four square between us all.</P>
    <P>I believe the problem of congestion has been there not for hundreds of years but for thousands of years.  I would ask the Minister, in relieving congestion, to go back to Mr. Hogan's policy and see that some of the big estates in the West&mdash;as big as in Meath, and bigger&mdash;are taken over.  One could give such people a farm of 80 acres in Meath, which would be as good as 300 acres in the West; and the estate in the West could be divided, instead of bringing hundreds of smaller fry up to Meath.  I do not want to stop migration, but why should not that policy be adopted?  We have Lord Adare and Lord So-and-So, with 5,000 and 6,000 acres.  Why leave them in that position? Why not take that land and give them an estate near Dublin or in Meath of 80 or 100 acres?  That would mean keeping the population in the West and making it economic.  I think the old system is good, but should be worked more in conjunction with present migration.  If you keep the present system going, two or three parishes in Mayo would be able to send enough to flood the whole of Meath. The large estates in the West should be tackled first and, if that is not sufficient, one can try the other system. Do not be studding Meath with isolated colonies, which are only breeding hatred and discontent.  We are happy to live with the migrants and work with them, and they wish to do the same, but things are bad and they are left isolated.  If the Minister can set that right, a big bone of contention will be taken away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate started on the same lines as that on the Land Bill about three or four weeks ago, and probably will follow on much the <Col N="1550" /> same lines.  I look forward with hope to the assurance from the Minister that in the years to come a faster move will be made to straighten up affairs not only in relation to the land that is in the Land Commission but also in the matter of the acquisition of new land for division.  No matter how fast the Land Commission may move in my constituency, we still would have people left out, who will have to wait a long time.  For that reason, no matter at what speed the work is done, I could not say I would be satisfied. Nevertheless, I have not the slightest doubt the Land Commission and the Minister have a thorough understanding of the position.</P>
      <P>Once a man gets an economic holding and is established on it, he is automatically of benefit to the State. If he is on an uneconomic holding, he can be of no benefit, as on account of it he can always lay a claim to the dole or some sort of assistance from the Government.  Therefore, if a man who is willing to work land can be given sufficient to provide food for this country&mdash;and food is one thing for which the world is crying out and, by all appearances, will be crying out for, for a long while&mdash;he can make his contribution to an increase in the production of agricultural goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bad to do too much looking back and I admit it is better to look forward.  I wonder if there ever will be a genuine and honest effort in the post-war period.  If I thought there would be, I would not add another dozen words to this debate, but would rely on the old saying: &ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;  As Deputies on this side of the House have said, one must give good criticism, as it is the one thing that counts.  It might help to stir up a Department that is pretty lax.  I think the Minister himself, in introducing the Estimates, admitted that, when he mentioned to Deputies from Mayo that their representations were being looked into and that they would definitely get the consideration they should get.  He also said that most Deputies were interested in the acquisition of land more than anything else.  He is perfectly right there. Even though 45,000 acres may be on <Col N="1551" /> the hands of the Land Commission, which we have almost a guarantee will be dealt with within the next year or two, there is a lot more that can be acquired.  Some estates can be acquired definitely without much trouble, though in other cases there may be a tough struggle.</P>
    <P>When things are balanced one against the other, we know that the citizen has certain rights and cannot be dispossessed of his land, because it has been vested in him and is his property. The big landlord and rancher cannot be thrown out, as that would be a move towards totalitarianism.  He must be handled in just the same way as the smaller tenant in order to get the parcel of land from him.  Therefore, under the present system of land division, there will always be a very slow movement in the acquisition of land.  Representations have been made.  I think I can safely say that I have made as many representations, or almost as many, for the few months I have been here, as any other Deputy. Every question that I have put down, with one exception, has been addressed to the Minister for Lands.  From that alone he can understand that land division and land troubles are the chief sources of worry in the area I represent.</P>
    <P>The position that has been created there is that people, for 30 or 40 years, since the Congested Districts Board was inaugurated, have been looking forward to the time when they would get a holding.  Two generations have passed, and still nothing has been done for those people in the way of land division.  The position now is that they have almost given up hope.  I have made representations on their behalf, and the people there asked me what answer I got.  All I can say is that if I make representations to the Land Commission, I get a short note of acknowledgment, and if I make them to the Minister, he replies that my representations have been noted, and will be looked into as soon as possible.  That expression &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; has become a sort of joke as far as County Mayo is concerned.  I sincerely hope that in the coming year something will be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> Deputy Giles has touched upon a point that is indeed very interesting. He said that in Mayo there are big farms.  Undoubtedly there are very many big farms, perhaps not altogether of the same magnitude as farms in the Midlands, but they are nevertheless big enough to attract the attention of the Land Commission.  If the Minister will listen to representations, I can assure him that for the next year I can every week draw his attention to one or other of the big farms of land which could be taken over by the Land Commission and distributed among the people who are uneconomic holders, if not in the immediate locality, then in the vicinity, and these uneconomic holders could be migrated to the big farms in Mayo at a lesser cost than to holdings in the Midlands.  Deputy Giles said it would be better to transfer the owners of the big farms in Mayo to the Midlands, and it would be less expensive.  I admit candidly that he is right, and I think the Minister will agree with me that it would be easier to move out one substantial landholder from Mayo and redistribute his land among the uneconomic holders and landless men there than it would be to migrate five or six or seven of the tenants to midland holdings.</P>
    <P>I realise that there is not enough of land in Mayo to go around.  A former Minister for Lands, the late Mr. Hogan, said that the main worry is that there is not enough land.  All the same, it is surprising the amount of land there is and the amount that could be added through reclamation and drainage.  Only to-day I was reading an article in a paper which I found most interesting.  It described what the monks in Cappoquin have done on a barren mountain there. Would it not be possible, under Government supervision, to do the same type of thing elsewhere?  I admit that it would not bear fruit for five, or perhaps ten years, but in the long run it would prove its worth.</P>
    <P>In this country we are blessed in one way and cursed in another.  We are blessed in that we do not suffer from erosion.  We have a moist climate which keeps erosion down.  Of course, we have instances of it, but not an <Col N="1553" /> awful lot.  There are millions of acres that could be reclaimed and added to our national wealth if a serious effort were made.  I think it is time to move in that direction after so many years of native Government.  Let us hope that we will have something better in the future.  Let us from now onwards move in the direction of reclaiming more territory.  The Minister mentioned that there was no land division worth talking about since the emergency. He gave one genuine excuse, that there were no building materials available for housing.  Nobody can contradict him there.  But how about localities where there is no necessity to erect buildings and where there is land that could be taken over and divided? I asked a question some time ago on that subject and I was informed by the local tenants that one estate was over 30 years in the hands both of the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission.  Why could not that estate be rearranged?  Of course, there is always an answer; it is very easy to give an answer behind which one can hide.</P>
    <P>It may be that the amount of land left is not sufficient to satisfy the needs of the people and, after being parcelled out, you would still have the trouble of rearranging the area because holdings still there would be uneconomic. But there are plenty of other areas, and I have first-hand information about them because I live right in the centre of them, where land could be acquired and there would not be one penny of expense on the Government with regard to building materials.</P>
    <P>All that is necessary is to make the fences.  The greatest distance people would have to travel to an addition of land would be, at the outside, three-quarters of a mile, and nobody will say that that is long.  There are three or four farms in my neighbourhood which could easily satisfy a large part of the county; yet no effort has been made to acquire and divide it.  The land struggle has been carried on for so long that the people have lost hope, and I am afraid they have every reason for losing hope.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the abuse of land that is held by the Land Commission <Col N="1554" /> and that is let in conacre.  We dwelt on this subject in a debate some time ago.  Any sensible farmer who works a farm, big or small, knows that the land that has to bear two crops of wheat, or perhaps three crops of oats, will lose its fertility unless it is well manured.  If he does not have a root crop of some description his land will definitely deteriorate; nothing can prevent it deteriorating unless a certain amount of yard manure is distributed over it, so as to bring back its fertility and put into it the heart it possessed before it was broken up.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen under the Land Commission in cases like that, where land will, perhaps, be divided within the next few years?  It will take five or six years' hard work, at the expense of the tenants, to restore such land to any kind of fertility.  It must be admitted that the land produced the food during the emergency, and that if anything was to bear the burden, it was better that the land should do so.  When uneconomic holders are willing to take land, they would clear it, they would look after it, and see that it was brought back to fertility. I do not think the Minister can make any excuse for not taking action in cases like that.  The Minister was genuine when he talked about building and migration having to be undertaken. Nobody can contradict him there.  But, on the other side of the ledger, he must admit that there is something wrong.  There is some fine land on the Ashford estate in Cong.  I was informed on a recent visit that that estate is going to be turned over to the Forestry Department, and that some of the finest arable land to be found in Mayo is to be planted with trees.  Is that fair in an island where land is so valuable?  I hope the Minister will take steps, if such is the case, to see that that is stopped, and that the estate will not be given to the forestry section for planting.</P>
    <P>Within the last three weeks the Land Commission divided a farm which they held in my locality.  I do not know whether political influence was used but one thing is certain, that people of both political Parties, on holdings with valuations from £2 to £3 got none of that land, while others on holdings <Col N="1555" /> with valuations of £6 or £7 got 15, 16 or 17 statute acres.  I do not know what is going to happen to those who were left out in the cold.  Will they be provided for at some future date, and will they have to wait long before getting land?  Will their cases be looked into when land is available in other parts of the county or will they be migrated? I was speaking to some of these people last week.  One man told me that his valuation was £2 3s. 0d. and that he had not been given any land.  What is going to be done in cases like that? In an area between Castlebar and Westport, which is a very congested one, a farm of 500 acres was recently purchased.  Some of it was mountainy, some of it boggy and some of it arable land, but, on the whole, it would be a very valuable gift to the people in that locality if they had it.  If the Land Commission will negotiate with him the owner is willing, if he gets a reasonable holding in the Midlands, to hand over the 500 acres within ten days.  Nothing should stop a settlement of the land question in that area within 12 months or even before next November.  The needs of the local tenants could be settled in that way without any ill-feeling towards those who have land and without troubling the Land Commission. I ask the Minister to take a note of that case.  If he wants further particulars I shall give them to him, to see if anything can be done.  I want to see how genuine the effort to settle the land question is, and what steps are going to be taken during the coming year.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in a recent debate on the Land Bill to the question of allowing outsiders to buy up tracts of land.  When replying the Minister stated that he would allow anybody who had money to buy land.  Everybody agrees that a farmer with two sons, if he was able to put up the money, should be allowed to buy a holding for one of them, as that would mean so much less expense on the Land Commission and so much less expense on the State.  Nevertheless, I consider that nobody should be allowed to buy beyond a certain maximum acreage. No matter who he may be, nobody <Col N="1556" /> should be allowed to buy more than 50 acres in the Midlands, especially in a country like this where land is so valuable, and where the question is so acute.  Balancing one thing with another, and in view of the recent debate, one has grave doubts as to what effort will be made in the coming year to solve the land question.</P>
    <P>We must look at the problem cautiously, because people have suffered for quite a long while and they have had wonderful patience waiting to get land.  The law had to be broken. I do not deny that I broke it myself in an effort to get land.  I drove cattle and I knocked down fences.  I broke the law in every way that it could be broken in the effort to get what the people were entitled to get.  I am not a bit ashamed of that.  I think it is more shame for the Land Commission to have forced people to do such things.  I think the Land Commission is to blame and not the people.</P>
    <P>I stated that we should not look back but when, remembering what happened 25 years ago, we know that land division was handled pretty smartly then for a few years, and that many big estate owners, some of them descendants of Cromwell who were here, moved out when the Irish Republican Army came along on their heels, I only wish that that could have continued and that some of those people were kept out.  That would have saved the Land Commission and Deputies much worry.  Unfortunately it did not, and we have fallen back into a worse system of land division than we had under the English Government and the Congested Districts Board.  We find ourselves now almost as far from a land settlement as we were 100 years ago.  The present Minister took over the Department of Lands at a time when it was, I admit, hard to make a big move towards settling the land question.  We give him credit, at least up to a point, that he had to shoulder responsibility when it was difficult to do anything.  Now he has no excuse, and I hope that when the Vote for the Department of Lands is moved in this House next year, instead of having to criticise him I will be able to say to him: &ldquo;If you did not do everything <Col N="1557" /> that I or other Deputies from Mayo wanted you to do, you did what you possibly could; you made a man's effort to right the affairs that have been crying out as a scandal and shame in this country for such a long time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The first thing to which I wish to refer is the speech that has been made by the last speaker. One was rather amazed to hear such a speech here and further amazed that, holding the views he apparently holds and having done the things that he has admitted he has done, he has come into this House.  Surely in a country where the agrarian tradition is so deep-rooted, anyone with a sense of responsibility would avoid making a speech of that kind, particularly when everybody is desirous that the best that can be done with the limited amount of land available should be done.  The suggestion, that he approves of an illegal body taking control of the question of land division in this country and disposing of the duties of the Land Commission seems to me, to put it mildly, to be an outrage.  I could not let such a speech pass.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the last paragraph of the Minister's statement where, with reference to the collection of the arrears of land annuities, he patted himself on the back.  I am not so disposed to pat him on the back in that matter.  In answer to a Parliamentary Question to-day the Minister told me the amount of outstanding arrears of uncollected annuities on the 1st March was £352,922.  The House will observe, of course, that the outstanding arrears refer to the uncollected arrears of the halved land annuities, which were halved under the 1933 Act.  They are standing at, approximately, between £300,000 to £400,000.  The Minister, of course, said the collection, representing 98.8 per cent. of 12 years' annuities, is a definite indication of the general <Col N="1558" /> prosperity of the farming community and the financial credit of the State. In 1930, everybody who was then interested in the affairs and the economy of this country will recall that the world was passing through the greatest slump in history which particularly affected the primary producers, that is, the farming community.  On a final examination of the accounts of the Land Commission on 31st July, 1931, on the full annuities then due, there was outstanding £299,446.  Remember, that was in the middle of the greatest slump ever experienced by the agricultural industry. There was only £299,446 outstanding of uncollected land annuities in respect of twice the sum, that is to say, the undivided land annuities. To-day the Minister referred to the fact that it is to the credit of the State that that sum of £300,000 odd is outstanding on the halved land annuities. That does not impress me at all.  It is far from impressing me.  It does not impress me that the agricultural industry can be prosperous if there is between £300,000 and £400,000 outstanding in respect of the halved land annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can pass over what has happened in the last four or five years, because during that period the Department were not in a position to do very much, and it strikes one as rather obvious that they may not be in a position to do very much in the immediate future owing to the shortage of supplies of building materials.  The first thing to consider is the question of policy in regard to land division.  Deputy Hughes referred to co-operation between allottees.  Deputy Giles followed that.  For 14 to 15 years I have been pleading in this House that these farms are too small, that a farm of 22 acres, having to bear the overhead charges on land of the character that is allotted, leaves no surplus to maintain a man and his wife and family. Anyone who knows anything about land will agree that you have to put all the equipment of a reasonably sized farm, say 50 to 60 acres, on a farm of 20 to 22 acres.  It seems indefensible to allot farms of 22 acres on which the allottee is expected to keep two horses and to maintain them during the year. That item alone destroys whatever <Col N="1559" /> little capacity a farm of 22 acres has to keep live stock in the form of cattle, calves and sheep.  I was struck by Deputy Giles' approach to this matter. He approached it in another way, that such a farm did not leave any possibility of leaving ten, 12 or 15 acres to get a rest during the winter months, which could then be used for the grazing of cattle and sheep.  On a 20-acre farm, the greatest part of it is tramped black during the winter months and, in April and May, when it should be ready for the grazing of cattle, when house feeding is ended, it is as bare as a board.</P>
    <P>Now that the war is over and when, I hope, we are entering on a new era of peace and ultimate prosperity, I again urge that the question should be reconsidered of taking a group of farms of not less than 40 acres and, if possible, 50 acres, and giving them to a group of allottees and allowing them, we will say, ten or 15 years, to see how it will work out and to compare that with the 20-acre farm.  Surely there can be no damage done there.  Knowing what small farms of land are, having been born and reared in a district of small farms, I am convinced that a farm of 22 acres, even of the best land in the country, cannot economically maintain a man and his wife and family, after providing the overhead charges on it.  This divided land has a high valuation and high rents and high rates.  These outgoings will take away any surplus which may be left.</P>
    <P>I expect that there is a modicum of truth in what Deputy Giles said, that while there is apparently considerable prosperity in those areas now, it is not due to money being made out of 22 acres of land, but to money earned in Great Britain by the boys and girls who are sending it home.  If the parents got what would pay the rent and rates it would mean a great easing of the burden.  It would go a long way to ease the economic pressure on a 22-acre farm.</P>
    <P>I submit that damage has been done by the policy which has been pursued. I have stated time and again, and I repeat it, that we are only wasting public money and creating new congested <Col N="1560" /> problems so long as we pursue this policy of allotting 22-acre farms to people.  But, when they are placed on a farm of that size, a co-operative movement should be developed amongst them so that the overhead charges may be reduced to the minimum. Every Deputy who knows anything about land knows that it would take the entire cereal crops of 20 acres of land to feed two horses throughout the year, if they are to be kept alive at all.  Having placed these people on these holdings, we should do all we can to assist them to make a real success of them.  One of the ways in which we can be of great assistance to them is by developing a co-operative movement so as to reduce the overhead charges.  The main overhead charges are the rent and rates which present a very serious problem.  In order to work these small farms they have to maintain two horses.  It is quite easy to criticism these people.  I heard a lot of criticism of them during the debate on the Land Bill.  I did not agree with much of what I heard on that occasion. If a man with a wife and a family of six or eight children is working one of these farms, with no money coming in, and the rent and rates having to be paid before there is a penny left for the family, it must be an exceedingly difficult job for him to carry on, seeing that he has to maintain a pair of horses to plough and to till the arable part of it.</P>
    <P>Seeing that the Minister has some 40,000 acres of land for division, I think it would be worth his while considering the giving of larger farms of land.  In every other country in the world where Governments have undertaken this job, farms of 50 acres of land are allotted.  Deputy Giles talks about the fertility of Meath, which I do not question.  But the Pontine Marshes in Italy, being quasi-slob land, must be land of high fertility and the farms allotted there were all 50-acre farms.  Surely all these other countries cannot be wrong.  In my opinion, they are obviously and patently right and we are obviously and patently wrong.</P>
    <P>With reference to these 40,000 acres of land which await division, the <Col N="1561" /> Minister says it is arable or pasture land and that, owing to the exigencies of the emergency, it could not be allotted and has been let in conacre for tillage.  I wish the House to note that. The House has first passed a Land Bill under which people can be evicted if they do not carry on their holdings according to what has been decided is good husbandry.  I should like the Minister to tell us if the portion of the 40,000 acres which was fit for cultivation has been cultivated for the last six years.  If so, has he insisted that the arable part of it which was cultivated was manured in rotation, that it was not persistently kept in cereals without any farmyard manures being applied?  That raises a very vital question.  Poor people who are hungry for land will jump at these holdings when they are being allotted, not knowing the snag that is in front of them.  If the land has been under cereals for six years without being manured, it will be practically useless. When these people have worked these holdings and rotated them in tillage, it will take a period of 20 years to bring them back to any sort of decent fertility again.  If the land has been in cereals for the six years, I suggest to the Minister that, in order to be honest with these allottees, he should make provision for giving them fertilisers and manures in order to bring the land back as soon as possible to a reasonable state of fertility.  I think the House will not grumble at that, and certainly I will not.  If the land has been worn out by six years' growth of cereals, it would be a grave injustice to leave these people under the impression that the State was coming to their aid by giving them farms costing about £1,000.  Normally, £1,000 would buy a farm of 50 or 60 acres of arable land.  It would be a great tragedy if we led these people to believe that they were getting 22 acres of good arable land if, in fact, it has been worn out by continuous cropping.</P>
    <P>From the figures the Minister has given us, I do not see any hope of the land of the country being vested in our time.  According to the Minister's figures, there are 129,000 parcels of land of all kinds&mdash;congested district, estate lands, tenant farmers' lands and <Col N="1562" /> allottees' lands&mdash;to be vested.  At the rate we are proceeding, our generation will have passed away before that will have been done.  I do not know what the snag is; perhaps the staff is too small.  Having undertaken the duty of purchasing the land and vesting it in tenants, we should put up the money to provide the necessary staff so as to make the people freeholders.</P>
    <P>Non-vesting means that there is a clog on the title, which depreciates the value of the land in the event of sale. There are 129,000 parcels of land to be vested, and the maximum capacity of the Department is about 4,000 vesting orders in the year.  That is not a bright prospect.  If the question is one of staff, then, unless the Minister makes a substantial addition to the staff, I do not see how he hopes the task to be completed in his lifetime, or even in the lifetime of his successor.  One is at a loss to appreciate the reasons why the process is so slow.  The minute engineering and mapping of an estate is, of course, slow work, but it should not be so slow as all that.  Down through the years, farms have been changed by giving corners away and taking in other corners.  I suppose that that presents considerable difficulties, but the difficulties should not be so enormous as to cause this slow rate of progress. Having tackled this problem, we should throw off our coats and create whatever machinery is necessary to complete the work.  The land should be vested in these people, and they should be given the title to which they have a right.</P>

      <P>The increased estimate for travelling expenses over last year's figures&mdash;£4,000&mdash;is surprising.  I understood that the Land Commission was less active last year, and for the past few years, than in any other year since the outbreak of war.  Why this increase? I can hardly accept the Minister's explanation, that it is due to the cost of petrol and increased transport charges.  The land question is a very burning question, and I agree with everything that has been said by my friend, Deputy Commons, who represents the same constituency as I. Although Deputy McMenamin comes from a different part of the country. <Col N="1563" /> he must be aware that Deputy Commons was not encouraging law-breakers or inciting law-breakers to go out and do things they should not do.  I wonder if he is aware that, in County Mayo and other counties, the Land Commission have never divided land until after the law was broken by the tenants&mdash; at least, that is so in many instances. I am sure the Minister is well aware of that.  If not, his inspectors are.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy McMenamin is well aware that it is quite true that people, before they got any satisfaction not only from this Minister but from any Minister in the past or present Government, have had to break the law and that it was necessary to bring strong police forces there to try to protect the individual who occupied the holding. Eventually, the Minister had to give way to the agitation of those people, with whom, I am sure, Deputy McMenamin would agree&mdash;those who forced the gentleman who owned the holding or estate to leave.  But he left only under certain circumstances.  He was well compensated before he left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not encourage or ask any group of citizens to break the law.  Only in the final analysis, when the Minister and the Land Commission refuse to listen to our representations, when the Minister and the Land Commission refuse to do their duty, then force can only be met by force and stubbornness by stubbornness.  When the Land Commission and the Minister are going to be stubborn and refuse to give land to the tenants who are entitled to it, then the tenants must take the law into their own hands.  That is what has been happening in my memory and, I suppose, in the memory of my parents, from the days of Davitt down to the present moment, and on the same scale.  That is happening.  It has happened even in the past few weeks in County Roscommon.  It happened within a stone-throw of my own house &mdash;on Brooklawn farm.  What did they do there?  They allowed the Brooklawn farm to be sold to a gentleman who won the sweep in America.  After he bought it, there was an agitation.  Men were sent to Sligo gaol and, when they were let out after doing their sentence, they compensated the gentleman <Col N="1564" /> who bought the land and divided it. That is what Deputy Commons has been talking about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons has not encouraged lawlessness or disorder.  He has pointed out that any lawlessness or disorder that has come about is due to the inefficiency and the laziness of the Land Commission and the Minister over that Department.  We have, in County Mayo, at least 20 different estates of from 50 to, perhaps, 1,000 acres and we believe that that land should be divided amongst the tenants who would work it and take more out of it than some of the gentlemen who own it at present. We also believe that the lands in the various counties of the Midlands which are in the hands of certain gentlemen should be divided.  In my travels by rail and road, I have never yet seen a decent haggard in one of these places. I want to tell Deputy Giles that.  I judge a farmer's ability when I go into his place about October and see his haggard&mdash;his stocks of hay and corn and so forth.  If they are not there, I come to the conclusion that he is not a farmer.</P>

      <P>I mentioned the Midlands. I did not mention Meath.  I think that Meath is not in the Midlands, according to what I learned when going to the national school.  The Minister has constantly informed Deputy Blowick, Deputy Commons, myself and other Deputies from all sides that the cause of the slowness in the Land Commission is the lack of material for houses.  As Deputy Commons pointed out, many holdings for which no houses are required could be divided.  But they have not been divided.  We want to know why they have not been divided during the past five or six years, and given to men who would not only work them, but would take care that the body and heart of the land would be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin wants to know whether a rotation of crops is being carried out in this land.  Surely he is not so innocent as to think that a man who takes conacre is going to keep the heart and body in the land?  He is taking <Col N="1565" /> it only for what he can get out of it, and if he thinks he can get a crop out of it without using stable manure or other fertilisers, he is going to get that crop out of it.  Deputy McMenamin should know that people are not so foolish as to worry about the body or the heart of land which does not belong to them, or to which they have no permanent claim.  In my county there are something like 6,000 acres in the hands of the Land Commission, some of it for the past 30 years, and people are continually renting that land as conacre and paying a very high rent for it.  How is it that for the past 14 years under this Government, or for the past 23 years under two native Governments, this land has not been allocated?  I do not accept your promises at all.  Your promises are so much hot air as far as I am concerned, and I can prove it.  For instance, there was the lack of foresight shown by the present Government in failing to have a sufficient stock of materials for house construction in the emergency through which we have just passed.  They failed to foresee the war, and they failed to have a sufficient stock of timber and other necessary materials, not perishable goods, but goods that would last for years and years, which they could have utilised during the war.  It may be an excuse for you&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It may be an excuse for the Minister to tell us that the delay in the division of land is due to the lack of materials for house construction and that it is no use giving a man 30 acres of land, if he has not a roof over his head but that lack of materials is due to the lack of foresight on the part of the Government. Even allowing for the lack of foresight and for the lack of materials that have held up the division of land, why is it that where no houses are needed, the Minister and his Department did not take the necessary steps to have land allocated?  How is it that the Land Commission is allowing holdings in congested areas on which the owners do not reside, holdings from which people emigrated 20 or 30 years ago <Col N="1566" /> and to which they are never going to come back, to be put up for sale, although the adjoining tenants are agitating to have the lands taken over and divided by the Land Commission? How is that the Land Commission is allowing other tenants to come in and buy that land, thus adding to the problem of congestion?</P>
      <P>We will take, for example, an area in which there are 20 or 30 holdings, each holding having only about five or six acres of arable land.  A certain lady left one of these holdings 20 years ago, and went to America.  All her relatives are now dead, and she intends to sell the property.  The tenants in that area offered that lady the market price of the holding so that it might be allocated amongst the adjoining tenants. The Minister and the Land Commission refuse to assist in that but they will allow some outside person to come in and buy that holding, thereby adding to the congestion in the district. While permitting that, they are migrating other tenants in order to relieve congestion in the district.</P>
      <P>Does that not look foolish?  On the one hand you remove a tenant to make way for the redistribution of his land to relieve congestion, and on the other hand you allow another person to come in and buy a holding which is for sale in the district.  The Minister may not believe me but I shall give him the details of a case in my own area.  The Land Commission references are:&mdash; A.&amp;R. (F) 40290/45.  Estate I.L.C. (Sir J. P. Brabazon), County Mayo: C.D.B. 100.  Record No. C.D.B. 9714, Holding of Martin Walsh (formerly John Walsh, Junior), Rental No. 282, in the townland of Derrygay.  This communication from a firm of solicitors to the tenants concerned came into my possession a few hours ago:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The following is our report on the steps in connection with the application to the Land Commission for resumption of above holding with a view to having the holding divided and we have made our report as brief and concise as possible.  On the 21st February, 1940, we wrote the Irish Land Commission on behalf of Michael Joseph Egan, Thomas Devine and yourself (Patrick Moran) <Col N="1567" /> stating that the above holding of John Walsh (Junior), comprising about 30 statute acres, had been vacant for some years since the death of the tenant; that a Mrs. Mary McDevitt, a daughter of the deceased tenant, who is residing in the U.S.A., was seeking to have the holding sold to persons living in England; that the holding was worth about £120 and each of you would be prepared to provide £20 in cash towards the purchase money if the Land Commission would assist in providing the remainder or if the Land Commission would acquire such holding and distribute it in equal shares amongst the three of you.  We pointed out that the three of you were suffering considerable hardship by having such wretchedly poor holdings to live on and that the Land Commission were at the time dealing with the migration of one tenant in the same townland of Derrygay to relieve the acute congestion which existed there.</P>
    <P>The following particulars were given of your circumstances:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Michael Joseph Egan, of Derrygay, Kiltimagh, tenant of land comprised in Collection No. 5761, Section 23, Land Act, 1931, lands of Derrygay, half-yearly revised annual sum 9/10, Poor Law Valuation of land £2 5s. 0d., of buildings 5/-.  He has only about four statute acres of arable land, the remainder thereof is rough grazing and bog.  He is aged about 40 years and has his father and sister living with him on the holding.</P>
    <P>(2) Thomas Devine, of Derrygay, Kiltimagh, tenant of land comprised in Collection No. 5759, Section 23, Land Act, 1931, lands of Derrygay, half-yearly revised annual sum of 10/10, Poor Law Valuation of land £2 15s. 0d., of buildings 5/-.  He has only about four statute acres, the remainder of his holding being rough grazing and bog.  He is a married man residing with his wife and has six children, five of them being sons from nine to twenty-two years of age.  All the sons are living in the holding.</P>
    <P>(3) Patrick Moran, of Derryool, <Col N="1568" /> Kilkelly, the occupier of the holding comprised in Receivable Order No. 94/1167, County Mayo, lands of Derryool, Estate C.D.B. (Dillon), Poor Law Valuation on land £5, on buildings 5/-.  He has only about five acres of arable land, the remainder is either waste or rough grazing.  He is married, resides with his wife and two young children, also has his aged father-in-law and mother-in-law living on the holding with him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Letters of reminder were sent to the Land Commission on the 4th and 23rd April, 1940.  In May, 1940, an inspection was made by the Land Commission.  Several further letters were written to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In the issue of the <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> of 22nd February, 1941, the following report appeared:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Martin M. Nally, T.D. (Fine Gael, South Mayo), in Dáil Eireann, asked the Minister for Lands (Mr. T. Derrig), if he is aware that acute congestion exists on the Brabazon estate, Derrygay, Kiltimagh, County Mayo; that the poor law valuations of Michael J. Egan, Thomas Devine and Patrick Moran, tenants on the said estate, are £2 15s. 0d., £3 and £3 5s. 0d. respectively, and if he will state what steps, if any, are being taken by the Land Commission to acquire the vacant holding of John Walsh, Junior, on the Brabazon estate (Congested Districts Board No. 100, Column No. 5760/09), lands of Derrygay, near Kiltimagh, County Mayo, for relief of existing congestion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister (Mr. Derrig), in his reply, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission is aware of the congestion existing in the townland of Derrygay on the estate of General J. P. Brabazon (Congested Districts Board 100), and proceedings are being instituted to resume the holding of the late John Walsh (Junior), for relief of congestion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many further letters and calls were made on the Land Commission without result, and on the 22nd November, <Col N="1569" /> 1945, the Land Commission wrote as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am desired by the Land Commission to refer to your letter of the 12th instant in which you inquire on behalf of Messrs M. J. Egan, P. Devine and O. Moran, tenants of holdings on above estate, whatever it is proposed to take steps towards the resumption of the adjoining holding of Martin Walsh (formerly John Walsh, Junior) Rental No. 282, in the townland of Derrygay.  I am to state that a notice of intention to resume this holding was published on 16th February, 1943, and that having considered the circumstances of the case the commissioners on 4th May, 1944, decided to grant the petition which had been lodged on behalf of tenant against the proposed resumption.  Permission to sell the holding to Mr. Martin Walsh (Tom) without prejudice to the exercise by the Land Commission of their powers....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies can see from these statements that the Land Commission have not got any policy for the removal of congestion.  What greater chance would the Minister for Lands or the Land Commission have got than the opportunity which presented itself in that case to relieve congestion?  I accept these statements as true. The Department of Lands removed one tenant out of the townland of Derrygay for what purpose?  Because acute congestion existed there.  You have small holdings and small valuations which are not sufficient to enable the people to eke out a livelihood on them.  If the tenants had to depend solely on them, every one of them would be beggared.  They would have to go out and beg but for the fact that members of their families emigrated to England for a period of six months every year in order to supplement what was got out of these little parcels of land.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Land Commission have gone to considerable expense to migrate tenants to the Midlands and to other areas where they were able to provide better holdings, they have turned around now and allowed an outsider, as we would call him in our part of the country, to come in and purchase <Col N="1570" /> a holding which has become vacant in the same village, although, according to the former Minister for Lands, who is now Minister for Education, the Land Commission were taking steps for resumption there.  They have given no explanation as to why they dropped resumption and allowed this person, known as Mr. Walsh (Tom), who has been residing in England, to purchase the holding.  I have nothing against Mr. Walsh, but what I am against is the idea of allowing any man, even if he were my own brother, into an area to help to increase congestion when the aim should be to relieve it.  The Minister had a golden opportunity of doing that.  If he had waited until two or more had been migrated, he could have had these holdings redivided and reallocated amongst the remaining tenants.</P>
    <P>I do not see that the Land Commission are making any genuine effort to relieve congestion and have land allocated amongst people in need of it.  I can assure Deputy McMenamin that no one on these benches has ever encouraged lawlessness or disorder.  I also want to assure him that if the Land Commission and the Minister for Lands refuse to do their duty there is only one way out, and that is that the Irish tenant farmer, living on an uneconomic, congested, miserable holding must voice his opinions in the form of a protest.  The only way we can make that protest is by carrying out the age-old tradition of driving cattle, and in that way bringing to the notice of the Minister that the ordinary civil law must take proceedings against the people who drive the cattle.  True to that tradition, we in the West of Ireland have forced the Land Commission time and time again to take active steps to have holdings allocated and divided amongst tenants in congested areas.  If within the next 12 months the Land Commission shows any signs of being genuinely prepared to take steps for the allocation of the lands that have been in their hands for a number of years in County Mayo, and that they are willing to migrate tenants to counties where there is land available for them, then we will give the Land Commission every encouragement. Instead of making speeches <Col N="1571" /> here and criticising, we will clap the Minister on the back and tell him that he has this Party behind him.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a few days ago in Limerick that he had to depend on his own Party for constructive criticism. Will he admit now that he has not to depend on the Government Party for constructive criticism?  He is listening to constructive criticism now, and has been listening to it since he became a Minister&mdash;since we came into the House.  Time and again we have requested him to take the initiative in the allocation and division of land.  I myself was reared on a holding of 32 acres, about ten acres of which is semi-reclaimed arable land.  When the Dáil was up I spent three weeks working on it in order to add my quota to the food production effort of the country.  If we had a decent holding we would be able to do much better. My father, who is not the worst-off man there, lives at Carrowbeg in the Barony of Costello, between Swinford and Kilkelly.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister knows the locality well.  He has often driven through it during by-election, and other election, campaigns.  We on these benches have a real genuine grievance when we stand up here.  It is sometimes said that we deliver tirades in this House and indulge in unspecified generalities.  We have good reason for delivering tirades and speeches of the kind.  It is not because we find any pleasure in denouncing the Government or in denouncing the Land Commission, but because we are called upon by our constituents to do so.  We were elected to do our duty to our constituents, and intend to vindicate their rights as long as we are in this House. We shall continue to do so until we get some recompense for them from the Government and from the Minister. That recompense will have to be in the form of migration or in the allocation of land to them.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies said that a 25-acre farm is not large enough, and that a man would want at least 50 acres.  I agree that 25 acres is a small farm, but I can assure Deputy Giles that there are many men in my county who would <Col N="1572" /> be jolly glad to have 25 acres of good arable land.</P>

      <P>We do not ask them where they come from.  Quite a number of them come from the Six Counties.  I can assure Deputy Giles that my dad would feel very satisfied if he had 25 acres of good arable land. He reared a family of nine or ten of us on the holding that he has, and did it through hard work.  His eldest son was 18 years before ever my dad went to England.  He worked the land with a loy and a spade.  He had no plough.  I know that my dad, and hundreds and thousands of other honourable men like him in the County Mayo, would be well satisfied if they had 25 acres of good arable land.  They would be prepared to work it.  Of course, if they could get 50 acres it would please them better still.  A good portion of the land they have is reclaimed land, reclaimed in much the same way as a lot of the land in Italy was reclaimed under Mussolini's régime from 1929 onwards.</P>
      <P>The rundale system is a system which the Minister should take steps to abolish.  I have some sympathy with the Minister in this respect, but I might not have that sympathy if I had not learned a lesson of late.  The Minister's Department for the past few months has been trying to settle the rundale system in the Midfield area.  I cannot give the names of the estates, but I expect the Minister knows them. The inspectors there have failed to satisfy some tenants and I think the reason for their failure is the fact that they set out to re-divide the land before they had removed a few more tenants.  If they had removed three more, it would have been possible to settle the question.  I went down there myself with Mr. Mullany, a Land Commission inspector from Kerry, who did everything possible to settle it.  He made as good a fist of the re-division as was possible, but the tenants were not satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> We did everything possible to get the tenants to accept a settlement, with a promise from me that I would ask the Minister to agree that, if at a future date they wanted to migrate, he would give them land elsewhere; but they were not satisfied because they had come to the conclusion that some tenants had got more arable land than others.  It would have been impossible for a Land Commission inspector to divide equally the arable land available because it was nearly all situated in one area, but he did as well as he could.  The whole crux has arisen because several other tenants were not migrated beforehand.  If three or four more had been migrated, the question could be settled much more easily, and I can see no hope of settling the problem in that area until the Minister encourages three or four more to migrate at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>The rundale system is one which has many drawbacks.  The tenant farmer cannot take advantage of the farm improvements scheme and cannot put into his piece of land the skill and enthusiasm required for reclamation or for putting body into it.  He has to keep children from school to herd cattle because it is, so to speak, no man's land.  There are many other drawbacks to the system, and I urge the Minister to do everything possible to have it abolished in County Mayo, both north and south, because it is a disgrace that, in 1946, after almost a quarter of a century under a native Government, and certainly after 20 years of good settled government&mdash; leaving out the first three years&mdash;we have progressed so very little in the matter of the division of land, the reclamation of land and the removal of the rundale system which exists in my county.</P>
    <P>When the Minister's Department are putting up out-offices, they should include a granary for corn.  The one thing from which the small farmer suffers is the want of a loft to keep his corn dry and safe, so that he can take it to market when he thinks the best prices are going for it.  If he has to put it in a damp barn or on a damp concrete floor, the corn will become blue-mouldy, but if there is attached to his dwelling-house on the estates to <Col N="1574" /> which these men are migrated a loft sufficiently large and high for the farmer to store his corn, the difficulty would be solved.  It is not always possible to have bags, but even if you have bags and they are placed in a damp barn, the corn will rot.  I suggest that the Minister should consider that point and that when he is removing a tenant from the West&mdash;or even a man in Meath, or from the West or South of Ireland&mdash;and giving him a holding of land, a building such as I describe should be provided to enable him to keep his corn dry and safe.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that I have no faith at all in his promise.  I cannot believe that he is prepared to take the necessary steps, in view of all the setbacks and failures we have had. I will wait until this time next year and see what steps the Minister will then have taken, so far as my constituency is concerned.  If we see that the Minister is making a genuine effort, he will have the support of this Party who, according to him, never offer constructive criticism.  We all know that we say lots of things at cross-roads or at conventions.  That is Party politics, but the Minister knows that he gets very little assistance from his own Party.  Deputy Corry, I think, is the only man who gets up now and again to give him and the Minister for Agriculture &ldquo;the works&rdquo;, and it is leading the people astray for a man in such a very important position as Minister for Lands to try to convince them that the Opposition in Dáil Eireann is not capable of helping or advising the Government, or of offering constructive criticism.  Have we not done that to-day?  Have we not hauled him over the coals for his failure and his lack of policy?  It is all very well for him to smile.  I wonder would he smile down in Mayo.</P>

The Minister will find in us, as a Party, men who are prepared to give him every assistance, but he will find in us men who will constantly attack and expose if he does not do his duty to this House and to the country as Minister for Lands. <Col N="1575" /> That is what we are here for and we are not going to apologise to any Deputy&mdash;or any group or any Party&mdash; who accuse us of inciting or encouraging lawlessness or disorder.  That is the last thing we desire to do&mdash;it is not our policy&mdash;but if the Minister fails to do his duty and there is no other road open to us, we have to take the inevitable step, which we do not desire to take, that is, to lead the tenants, to help them to fight their battles and to get from the Land Commission the rights due to them, not to-day or yesterday but for the past 50 years.</P>

I wonder, if those 40,000 acres were divided up amongst the &ldquo;jokers&rdquo; from Mayo with the four acres, would they be satisfied?  I do not believe they would.  Nobody can tell me that the man living on four acres of arable land with a valuation of £2 5s. 0d. is knocking out a livelihood, nor do I believe that anyone in the House could say he is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time to-day, I asked the following question, No. 18 on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Education whether he has any proposals for the settlement of the dispute, on the question of the inadequate salaries now being paid, between his Department and the national school teachers; and, further, if he will state whether it is proposed to appoint, or to accept the offer of, an outside body to arbitrate in the dispute.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister replied as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The dispute between my Department and the national school teachers does not concern the scale of salary now paid but new and very much improved scales which it was proposed to pay but which were rejected by the Teachers' Organisation. The position of the Government has been clearly stated already and the only proposal I can make is that, in the interests of all parties, the teachers should decide to terminate this ill-advised strike at the earliest possible date.  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the Government does not regard the issue in dispute as one which lends itself to arbitration and the answer is, therefore, in the negative.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With full appreciation of the Minister's difficulties in regard to the last line of his reply, &ldquo;that it does not lend itself to arbitration,&rdquo; I ask him why not? What is the difference between a dispute between his Department and the teachers and a dispute between a body of individuals outside and their employers? I hold that in this matter the Dáil has been treated with contempt and that we, the members elected to look after our constituencies, have been informed only through advertisements in <Col N="1577" /> the newspapers of what has taken place, with nothing more than a short newspaper advertisement and a reply by the teachers.  I think that the Dáil is entitled to more consideration and that this is the place for the Minister to make an announcement and tell us how he has treated the teaching profession, when he met the teachers and what his proposals were.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the merits of this dispute.  It would not be fair to the Minister or to the House, as it would be a matter for a motion taking two or three hours to discuss, giving each one an opportunity and giving the Minister full opportunity to reply.  For many months and many years since this State was established, there is no body of men and women who have got more lip service and praise than the teachers.  Lip service is all very fine, but if a junior teacher does not get sufficient salary to buy himself or herself a second suit of clothing in a period of five years, then I say there is something wrong with the State as employers.  I am aware that junior school teachers in the City of Dublin, young men, were not able to buy a second suit of clothes in a period of five years.  As well as that, the teachers have in many cases been serving in very wretched schools.  People may think they have had an easy time, but with the demand of the Taoiseach for a high standard of Irish, these young men and women, for many hours after school and even up to midnight, have been working and training so as to keep up the standard required of them in Irish.  I ask the Minister if he thinks he has treated them fairly.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, this is the first time the teachers, or any other organisation associated with the State, have had to accept and adopt the strike weapon.  It is the only weapon the workers have against tyranny, whether it be tyranny of a Government or of a body of employers.  That right is theirs.  In that connection, I want to draw attention to the fact that when the teachers found themselves having to face a strike in order to bring their conditions home to the country, the Minister, in my view, adopted the most tyrannical attitude&mdash;one that no body, <Col N="1578" /> no, federation of employers, ever adopted in this country.  That attitude was shown in the sending of a letter to the men and women teachers of the country, which stated that, if they attempted to strike, his offer would be withdrawn, carrying with it, of course, the innuendo that they were breaking their pension rights.  To a body of men and women who had done so much for the building up of this State, what did that do?  It irritated them, and, in my opinion, it forced the strike.  The stupidity of whoever prepared that letter for the Minister&mdash;if it was not prepared by the Minister himself&mdash; forced the hands of those who might have reconsidered the position and not gone on strike at all.  Through his letter, the Minister challenged the whole trade union movement, and to their credit be it said every member of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation is involved in this dispute.  Those who are not on strike are giving their loyalty and practical support to those who are carrying on the fight in Dublin for better conditions for teachers.</P>
    <P>It was stated recently by a Minister that the Government themselves were contemplating setting up machinery for conciliation, to be operated before strikes took place.  Was there ever a more golden opportunity offered to any Minister than the present one, to set up conciliation machinery, to step in and once and for all show the workers and employers alike that there was machinery that would prevent strikes or at least go a good way to prevent them?</P>
    <P>I am, and I am sure every other member of the House is, against strikes.  In the long run it is the strikers who pay; it is their women and their children who suffer. Whether it be to-day or to-morrow, the Minister, and all employers of workers who feel it necessary to go out on strike, will find that the day will come when there must be conciliation and they must arbitrate.  While full of appreciation of the Minister's difficulties, I ask him to drop now that domineering attitude of his and withdraw the letter which he sent to the teachers, telling them what would happen if they went on strike.  I believe it is not too late.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> I want you all to understand that in this matter I do not speak even for one teacher.  Not one teacher in Dublin or in any part of Ireland was aware that I was putting down such a question. To-morrow, in any of the newspapers, they may repudiate me completely.  Regardless of the teachers, or the Government as their employers, I think I have a duty to perform to the mothers of the 40,000 children who are at the moment being deprived of their education.  As I said to-day, it will be disastrous if this dispute is allowed to continue and if the children are allowed to walk the streets. Even the tenement children in Dublin who are not at school have said to me: &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Byrne, we would rather be at school and wait for our natural, our ordinary holidays.&rdquo;  What will happen a child who has a liking for school?  Of course, that does sound strange, and it may be strange to a number of us, but what is to happen to a child who has a desire for school, who wants to go to school and who is looking forward to his ordinary holidays?</P>
    <P>When I gave notice that I would raise this matter on the Adjournment, I did so on the spur of the moment because I was dissatisfied, and I know that other members of the House were dissatisfied, with the Minister's reply, which stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the Government does not regard the issue in dispute as one which lends itself to arbitration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that connection I asked the Minister would he accept the good advice of an outside arbitrator.  I had in mind a body of school managers, parish priests of the city, the children in whose schools are deprived, because of the dispute, of the education to which they are entitled.  I had in mind that it was quite possible a number of those parish managers might get together and offer to the Minister their good advice with the view of bringing to an end the present unfortunate dispute.</P>
    <P>I have little else to say.  I did my utmost to avoid getting into the details <Col N="1580" /> of the dispute.  I remember the old days&mdash;I can go back 40 years to the days in the City of Dublin when quay labourers were paid 18/- a week.  I remember the strikes when the masters, the employers' federation, cracked the whip, saying: &ldquo;Get back to your work; there is nothing here for you.&rdquo;  I remember strikes dragging on for months, and the women and children suffered.  I remember the coal strike, which lasted for months.  I remember the carters' strike, which lasted for months.  Then the tram strike and the coal heavers' strike lasted for months.  In the end, each strike in turn had to be arbitrated upon.</P>
    <P>Why should the Minister take up the attitude now that he wants nobody to help him to bring this unfortunate matter to an end?  Does he realise what he is doing?  Does he realise the encouragement he is giving to other employers?  The emergency Orders may be withdrawn very shortly and other employers may take up the same attitude as the Minister.  Instead of an attitude of conciliation and arbitration, they may take up the attitude that the Minister is now taking up with the result that there will be prolonged strikes and grave hardship to the families of the workers who may be involved.</P>
    <P>I will finish by appealing to the Minister to give us some word of encouragement that he does not want this strike to continue.  He said to-day: &ldquo;Let the men go back to work; let them decide to terminate this ill-advised strike at the earliest possible date and&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;  There was no indication that he would have the matter considered; he did not say that his staff would go into the matter or that he would ask advice from the managers or others interested.  It is because he stopped at that &ldquo;and&rdquo; and gave no encouragement, only cracking the whip and saying: &ldquo;Get back to work; I have made my final offer and I am master&rdquo;, that I decided to raise this subject on the Adjournment.  I appeal to the Minister to change his attitude and decide to meet the teachers or those who have authority to speak for them. I can assure the Minister I have no <Col N="1581" /> authority to speak for them.  Not one teacher in the country was aware that I was putting down the question at all.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had opportunities to raise this matter during the course of the Central Fund Bill debate.  The matter was mentioned by another Deputy and I replied to him.  Subsequently it was raised in the Seanad and I replied there.  I am always prepared to reply, but, on the occasion of a question, obviously this matter cannot be gone into, as the Deputy admits, satisfactorily. He admits also that it cannot be gone into satisfactorily now.  He admits that he is unacquainted with the details.  He has not taken the trouble to study them.</P>

Nevertheless, he has made an attack upon me, which is what I might expect from him. The decision taken by the Teachers' Organisation on this matter was not known when the Deputy put down his question and, unless my memory fails me, I think he stated that he had been approached by women teachers.  I suggested to him then that his intervention at that stage was unhelpful.  I am of opinion that his intervention this evening is more unhelpful still.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the circular I issued to the teachers. That circular was in reply to a statement in a letter from the Teachers' Organisation informing me that the executive had decided that the members of the organisation engaged in schools in the City of Dublin would be called out on strike on Wednesday, March 20th.  The Government are perfectly entitled to withdraw their offer and, in my opinion, they would not be acting with a full sense of responsibility <Col N="1582" /> if they did not adopt every means open to them, legally, to bring home to the teachers the serious nature of the action upon which they were embarking.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's reference to my &ldquo;innuendo&rdquo; in the &ldquo;tyrannical document&rdquo; which I issued about the teachers pension rights, there was no innuendo.  What was stated is the opinion of the Government's law officers.  Any teacher or other public servant who withdraws his services in such a manner thereby deprives himself of all benefits and rights accruing to him during his employment.  I was simply stating the legal position.  The Deputy must know that, when strikes of this kind occurred before, legislation had to be introduced to restore to the strikers, when they returned to work eventually, their pension rights. I am fully aware of the ill-effects of the strike and of the hardships which are brought upon parents, many of whom are not in a position to endure such hardships owing to poverty, unemployment, illness, shortage of accommodation and other unfavourable circumstances. Neither do I underestimate&mdash; and I need not now stress this&mdash;the serious results of this ill-considered action upon the education and the future of the children who are affected by it.  It is a matter of the gravest concern to their parents.  The majority of these children have to depend solely upon the education they receive in the national schools.  Why, then, should they have inflicted upon them, and on their parents, this additional penalty at the hands of their teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is not the reason this, that a minority&mdash;and, in my opinion, a small minority&mdash;have forced this situation, in the erroneous belief that they will eventually force the public to compel the Government to yield to their demands? Yet, those who have precipitated this action know full well, and even admit, that they cannot win.  It is quite clear to those who take this matter seriously, and to those who have responsibility in connection with it, as I have, that the longer the strike continues, the more difficult will it be to restore conditions in our schools to normal, without carrying on and continuing the ill-effects of it.  The Government <Col N="1583" /> does not wish this grievous situation to continue a day longer. They would be very glad, indeed, to see it ended.  They are not animated by any vindictiveness, any pettishness or any desire to score over the teachers or to defeat them in this strike.  They are, certainly, very seriously concerned regarding the grave results to the children. But they are also equally, if not more seriously concerned, regarding the grave results that would accrue to the community as a whole if this strike should succeed or if, when ended, it should be made to appear that it had succeeded.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, if he had any sense of responsibility, would have admitted&mdash; and Deputies and Senators of all Parties will agree&mdash;that it is quite impossible that the Government should concede to strike action something that they had refused in the ordinary way to peaceful and harmonious negotiations. Negotiations between the teachers and myself went on for some three months.  There was exhaustive discussion and correspondence.  The attitude of the Government is best manifested by the fact that, when the teachers on the 16th November rejected the original offer I made to them, that offer was improved very substantially not once, but twice, to the extent, between two amounts, of £250,000 per annum over the 1938 scale, and an addition to the present cost of £1,250,000 or a percentage over-all increase over teachers' remuneration in 1938 of 40 per cent.  The teachers did not go on strike in 1924 when a cut was imposed upon them nor did they go on strike in 1934.  They would not have gone on strike, I venture to say, under the old régime.  They are not going on strike now against something wrong that has been done to them or some injustice to which they are being subjected. They are on strike because they want to force the Government to do something that it thinks, and has good reason for believing, it is not entitled to do.  This matter has been the subject of serious, careful and sympathetic consideration by the Government over a considerable period.  In my opinion, the offer was a fair and reasonable one and was not, as I have <Col N="1584" /> stated, ungenerous in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talked about arbitration. It would take too long to deal with the question of arbitration now, but, whatever may be said, there is a strong case against arbitration in the case of remuneration of public servants or others paid from the National Exchequer because, in effect, it seems to me that the position might be summarised in this way&mdash;that the Government would be handing over its authority and its discretion to an arbitrator.</P>
    <P>He would make an effective decision, and the Government could not honourably refuse to carry that decision into effect, no matter what the consequences might be to the National Exchequer, and no matter what the extent or the enormity of the bill which the taxpayers might have to carry.  In this particular case, negotiations went on for a considerable time and, during the course of these negotiations, the question of a strike, which had not arisen, was mentioned in a letter from the teachers of 10th December.  It stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The executive sincerely hope that this is not the Government's last word on the matter, but should that be so, and should this offer of £150,000 represent the final effort of the Government to reach agreement, the executive desire to repeat what was stated to you in the course of Saturday's interview, namely, that the Dublin members of the organisation will be called out on strike on January 17th.  The executive do not wish that this should be regarded as in any sense a threat.  It is a bare statement of the course which events will eventually take if the appeal which has been made to the Government through you is ignored, and it is stated now in order to impress on the Government the seriousness of the position as it now stands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before I had time to communicate with the teachers about the matter, the paragraph was withdrawn.  On December 11, I received the following letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have learned with regret that a paragraph in the letter addressed <Col N="1585" /> to you on the 10th instant is regarded as containing a threat to strike.</P>
    <P>That being so, we desire to say that the paragraph in question is hereby unreservedly withdrawn.  We feel that, in taking this action, we are expressing the views of the whole executive.</P>

    <P Just="Right">General Secretary.</P>
    <P Just="Right">D. J. KELLEHER,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Vice-President.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On February 12, I received the following letter from the general secretary of the Teachers' Organisation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to inform you that at the Special Congress held on February 9, the following resolution was adopted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Congress rejects the Government's offer, and directs the executive to make further representations immediately to the Government with a view to improving the present offer as regards scales and date of operation; and that the final offer be submitted to a referendum of all the members of the organisation in the Twenty-six Counties&mdash;this referendum to be by secret ballot on the lines of the C.E.C. elections.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wrote to the teachers pointing out that the Government had submitted the offer as in every sense final, and that the executive could not have been under any misapprehension on that point after the last meeting.  I pointed out that there was no hope whatever that any improvement in the new scales offered would result from further negotiation, and also that the date had been fixed in order to meet the wishes of the teachers.  It was the earliest date which the Government felt possible to name.  In view of these circumstances I explained that the <Col N="1586" /> offer must be regarded as final and irrevocable.  I took it that the offer would be submitted to the teachers throughout the country for acceptance or rejection.  What was my surprise to find that a circular was sent out and that in the daily newspapers a statement was made&mdash;which, in my opinion, was in violent conflict with the trend of the negotiations which had been going on&mdash;that if the offer of the Government was rejected, the executive proposed to call the teachers out on strike.</P>
    <P>That was not the kind of negotiation, the kind of goodwill or good feeling that I should have expected from the representations of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  This strike may continue for a very long time or it may end fairly quickly. There is only one way in which it can be brought to a rapid conclusion and that is through the action of those who called the strike.  They are the only persons who can bring it to an end. They can do that, in my opinion, without any loss of face.  There is no compulsion upon them.  They can do it in the public interest, and in the interests of the children regarding whose education and future they ought to be concerned.  The Government have no desire to humiliate the teachers in any way.  There is no desire to make matters difficult for them.  Nobody is more anxious than I am that the strike should terminate and that we should, as speedily as possible, get back to normal conditions.  In view of the circumstances which I have explained, I think the House will agree that it would be very bad policy, indeed, very much against the national interest, and that the country would have to pay very dearly, if the Government were to yield to this strike action.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, April 10th, 1946.</P>
