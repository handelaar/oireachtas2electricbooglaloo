    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been called to statements concerning the withholding of batch bread subsidy from Messrs. Fitzsimons and Sons, Ceanannus Mór County <Col N="769" /> Meath; and if he will state the reasons for the action taken by him in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen certain statements published in the Press in reference to claims for batch bread subsidy made by Mr. James C. Fitzsimons, proprietor of the firm of Peter Fitzsimons &amp; Sons, Kells.</P>
      <P>The non-payment of the subsidy to this firm is in accordance with the general policy of withholding subsidy from bakers who contravene Acts or Orders governing the production and sale of flour, bread or confectionery. Due publicity has been given to the fact that such contravention involves withholding of subsidy, and it is well-known to all firms in the trade.  Mr. Fitzsimons was convicted at Kells District Court on the 10th July, 1945, of overcharging for batch bread sold by wholesale during several months of the year 1944; investigations showed that this overcharging for batch bread extended back to September, 1942.  The investigations also showed that Mr. Fitzsimons had over-charged for fancy bread as far back as July, 1942.</P>
      <P>The subsidy on batch bread is paid to enable bakers to sell their products at the fixed price, while making a reasonable margin of profit.  There is no justification for paying it to bakers who endeavour to increase their profits by overcharging.  I consider that I would not be warranted in paying subsidy from public funds to Mr. Fitzsimons in respect of subsidy periods during which he overcharged for bread. I have, therefore, decided that his claims in respect of all two-monthly subsidy periods from the 1st June, 1942, to the 30th September, 1944, must be disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the statement mentioned in the Question, reference is made to three local firms and it is suggested that there has been discrimination against the firm of Fitzsimons and Sons.  In addition to the case of Fitzsimons and Sons, proceedings were instituted against two other firms in the same area.  In one case, conviction was secured and the payment of subsidy for the relevant period was withheld.  In the second case, the Attorney-General <Col N="770" /> advised that proceedings were unlikely to succeed: the summonses were withdrawn in this case and successful proceedings were instituted instead against one of the firm's employees who, it appeared, over-charged for bread against the express instructions of his employers.  In this case, subsidy was not withheld as it was clear that the firm had not benefited by the overcharging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he is prepared to introduce legislation to make good contributions lost as a result of the repeal of Section 25 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The repeal of Section 25 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, did not affect in any way the validity of contributions standing to the credit of insured contributors.  It withdrew certain rights to refund in respect of contributions.  Experience had shown that these rights imposed an excessive burden on the unemployment fund.  Cash compensation was, however, made to those insured contributors whose rights under Section 25 were, by reason of age, approaching maturity.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that any legislation in the matter is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the conditions on which the county council property at the Burrow, Portrane, was sold; the name of the person who purchased the property; why the sale of the property was not advertised, in order that the ratepayers and other people living in the district could be afforded an opportunity of purchasing same; and if he will make a statement concerning the whole matter; and, further, if he is now prepared to have the site advertised for sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are as follows: In November, 1944, a Mr. O'Leary submitted to the county council a proposal to build a shop on a site adjoining his premises beside the beach at Portrane.  Permission was refused under the Town and Regional Planning Acts inasmuch as the proposal would conflict with the county council scheme for the development of the area.  Mr. O'Leary then proposed to the county council that he be allowed to rent the piece of land beside the mental hospital grounds in the village of Portrane for the purpose of erecting thereon a suitable structure to <Col N="772" /> be used as a shop.  A proposal to this effect was submitted to my Department, and I was advised that the rent proposed, namely £10 a year, on condition that a suitable structure be erected on the site, was reasonable. No exception was, therefore, taken to the proposal.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Leary subsequently intimated to the council that he did not intend to proceed with the building.  In July last, a Mr. Dockery applied to the county council for a lease of the site on the terms proposed, namely, £10 a year on condition that a suitable structure is erected thereon, in accordance with the requirements of the county council. There is no statutory obligation on the local authority to advertise the proposed sale, and I do not propose to take any further action in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in either Mr. O'Leary or Mr. Dockery, because neither of these men was entitled to get the site unless it had been advertised for sale.  Mr. Dockery does not belong to the district at all.  What I want to know is why this property, which belongs to the ratepayers of County Dublin, was not advertised for sale and everybody interested, particularly local people, given an opportunity to buy it, as all property of local authorities is advertised.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that in March, 1945, two temporary minor clerks employed by the Dublin Board of Assistance, and having no experience of the administration of home assistance, were appointed by the commissioners administering the affairs of the Dublin Board of Assistance, on a temporary basis, to positions as temporary inspectors in the home assistance section, and subsequently as temporary assistant superintendent assistance officers; whether, in the making of such appointments, due consideration was given to the claims of permanent home assistance officers having long and meritorious service; and finally, whether in view of all the circumstances, he will arrange to have the two appointments in question terminated forthwith and the vacancies, if such exist, on the superintendent assistance staff, filled by suitable persons from among the permanent home assistance officers, having due regard to the service, experience and personal suitability of the applicants.</P>

      <P>I have already supplied the Deputy with all the information available in regard to the temporary appointments made by the commissioners for the Dublin Board of Assistance of assist the superintendent assistance officer in the investigation of home assistance cases.  The commissioners <Col N="776" /> were satisfied that the two persons selected by them for this purpose are of the type required for making independent investigations and reports to the superintendent assistance officer.  The Period of temporary employment has been extended because of the retirement of the superintendent assistance officer and the death of the assistant superintendent assistance officer.  The two persons employed are not graded as temporary assistant superintendent assistance officers and their temporary employment need not affect the relative position of the permanent or temporary assistance officers when future arrangements for the appointment of permanent supervising staff and the reorganisation of the home assistance section of the commissioners' office have been finally determined.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will recall that these appointments were originally made in March of last year and thus have been held for nearly 12 months.  The permanent officers feel that something in the nature of a reflection has been cast on either their ability or trustworthiness to perform the duties which fall to be performed by these temporary appointees.  Will he now give further consideration to the fact that vacancies for permanent officers will now arise and that the permanent officers should be given an opportunity of securing them? Further, with regard to these appointments, the two officers appointed have no direct financial responsibility.  They are not liable to a surcharge and yet they have been appointed to these two vacancies, their salaries being increased by £1 per week, over the heads of permanent officers.</P>

      <P>1.  Under the Blind Persons Act, 1920, approved schemes for the welfare of the blind have been in operation in every county and county borough since 1935.  The following provisions for necessitous blind persons are made under the schemes:-(a) Education or industrial training in approved institutions.  (b) Employment in workshops of approved institutions, maintenance in a hostel and augmentation of wages.  (c) Maintenance in approved homes, if incapable of work owing to age, or infirmity.  (4) Monetary assistance to necessitous and unemployable blind persons living in their own homes or lodgings.</P>
      <P>The approved institutions provide training in basket and mattress making, brush making, chair caning and in knitting.  When trained, the blind persons are employed in the workshops of the institutions, and many of them live outside the institutions.</P>
      <P>2.  With regard to (2), as I have already stated, schemes are in operation in each county and county borough.  It is permissible under the Blind Persons Act, 1920, to continue the payment of contributions to approved agencies after a blind person has attained the age of 30 years.</P>
      <P>3.  An approved scheme for the welfare of the blind is at present in operation in Galway County.</P>

      <P>A person suffering from physical disability and unable to provide for his own support comes within the definition given in Section 18 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, of a person eligible for general assistance. Section 19 of that Act places a statutory duty on the public assistance authority to afford such assistance as shall appear to them to be necessary or proper in any particular case.

The scheme of contributory widows' and orphans' pensions is interlocked <Col N="779" /> with the national health insurance scheme as persons insured under the latter scheme are insurable under the pensions scheme.

    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> (b) and (c).  Grants are equivalent to 50 per cent. of the estimated labour cost of approved works.  As the scheme is at present operated there are considerably more applicants than can absorb the total sum made available for the scheme in each financial year. This indicates that the present rate of grant is sufficiently attractive to farmers who wish to carry out necessary improvement works on their holdings. Any increase in the proportion of grant would have the effect of reducing the number of applications which could be accepted and lessening the volume of work which could be effected.  In the circumstances I am not prepared to consider an increase in the rate to grant offered.</P>
    <P>(d).  Grants are at present provided under the scheme for the laying of concrete floors in outoffices, erection of concrete stall divisions and concrete feeding troughs in byres and the plastering of walls inside byres; construction of concrete water tanks, liquid manure tanks, silos, concrete stands for corn stacks and cattle enclosures with walls of concrete or stone and mortar for the purpose of facilitating the making of farmyard manure.</P>
    <P>This is as much as can be done in the direction of providing or improving buildings under the scheme as at present constituted, but the possibility of assisting farmers to improve and modernise their farm buildings generally is being examined.</P>

      <P>Where a report has been made by the Referee on an application under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, sub-section (5) of Section 8 of the Act gives me power to request the Referee to review his report in the light of additional evidence not available prior to the making of such report.</P>
      <P>In making application to me for the exercise of this power applicants are required to embody certain particulars in a statement, including particulars as to the additional evidence available, and to subscribe to this statement before a peace commissioner or a commissioner for oaths.  This sworn statement when received is examined, but if the evidence put forward is found not to be additional evidence I have no power to request the Referee to review his report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sworn statement referred to by the Deputy in the case of Eugene McCurtain was not referred to the Referee because it contained no evidence not available prior to the making of the Referee's report. <Col N="784" /> Before furnishing his report in the case, the Referee informed Mr. McCurtain of his findings, and gave him the usual 21 days' notice within which to make any further representations or furnish any available additional evidence, but Mr. McCurtain did not reply to this notification from the Referee.  If Mr. McCurtain had then intimated his desire to state his case orally before the Referee, the latter would have considered his request.</P>
    <P>As Mr. McCurtain's application has not been before the Referee since October, 1939, the question of now affording him an opportunity to state his case does not arise.</P>

      <P>Mr. John J. Breen, 12 Macken Street, Wexford, a member of the Maritime Inscription, was injured on 14th May, 1944, while taking part at manæuvres at Rosslare Strand.</P>
      <P>As a member of the forces called out on permanent service, but permitted to follow his normal occupation, his claim for compensation fell for consideration under the Army Pensions Act, 1927, as amended by the Act of 1943, which provides for the grant of a wound pension based on the degree of disablement from which the applicant suffers on the date of his examination by the Army Pensions Board, as from the day following date of discharge from the forces.</P>
      <P>Mr. Breen was discharged from the forces on the 12th January, 1945, and was granted a, temporary wound pension at the rate of 10/6 per week based upon a degree of disablement of 25 per cent. from the 13th January, 1945, the day after the day of his discharge, to the 31st August, 1947, when his case will fall to be reviewed.  The rate mentioned is the rate applicable to the degree of disablement assessed by the Army Pensions Board, as contained in Part II of the Third Schedule of the Act of 1927, as amended by the Act of 1943, and so cannot be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No award of pension can be made under the Acts to a member of the forces in respect of any period prior to the date of his discharge from the forces.  I have, however, examined the circumstances of this claim in relation to medical expenses incurred and possible loss of earnings by Mr. Breen and am prepared to discharge reasonable <Col N="786" /> hospital expenses, and to consider further representations by Mr. Breen in regard to loss of earnings (if any) incurred by him prior to the operative date of pension.</P>

      <P>Thirty-six holdings on the Bellingham estate, County Mayo, were vested by Vesting Order dated 24th January, 1935, under Section 28, Land Act, 1931. Objections to the vesting of 29 of these holdings were lodged, each of which was individually investigated.  Owing to the length of time involved in pursuing investigations, the emergency intervened before the objections were listed for hearing, with the result that the objections were not heard until 12th December, 1945, by the commissioners on circuit.</P>
      <P>Objections entered on the grounds that vesting should be deferred until houses, out-offices, fences, etc., were erected, and additional turbary rights granted, were disallowed.  Ten objections were allowed on technical grounds.</P>
      <P>Vested tenants are eligible for assistance under Gaeltacht Housing Acts or for grants under the Housing Acts administered by the Department of Local Government and Public Health and may apply to the Land Commission for additional advances to supplement the latter grants.  They may also apply to the Department of Agriculture for assistance under farm improvement schemes in connection with fencing, etc.  As regards the provision of additional turbary rights their applications will be considered according as turbary becomes available.</P>

If all the conditions, except the application and receipt of a grant, are complied with in respect of one of these houses, then that house would be put in exactly the same position as a house for which a grant has been received. Accordingly, sub-section (4) of the Bill, as originally introduced, will apply, that is to say, the valuation of the hereditament shall not be increased on account of the increase in value arising from the accommodation until a period of seven years has elapsed.

      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and insert in lieu thereof the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A person, with whom, on a date which is for him a qualifying date, three or more children who are on that date qualified children normally reside, shall be qualified for a children's allowance in respect of those children if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  he is on that date an Irish citizen, or</P>

      <P>(c)  he has, for the two years immediately preceding that date, been resident in the State.</P>
      <P>The effect of the change, by the abolition of the original sub-section and the substitution of the new sub-section proposed in the amendment is to qualify for children's allowances the parent of a child where one of the parents is dead, or one of the parents was, if deceased, an Irish citizen. Under the law as it stood heretofore, the only person entitled to qualify was an Irish citizen or a person resident here for two years.  Under the change proposed the third class will qualify, that is where one of the parents is an Irish citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy in the courts of law to displace the claim of a father of children in favour of a grandmother.  Is the Minister's Department ready to accept less evidence than a court of law when inquiring into the full rights of a father as against a grandparent, in order to allocate children's allowances to the grandparent? There are many cases of grandparents caring for children, the father of whom may send a £5 note occasionally, but does not send a regular contribution. I have heard of cases of that kind, where it is extremely difficult to establish evidence that a parent was not maintaining children, and in which the grandparents ought to get the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise under this section.  The same difficulty arose because the qualifying condition was &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;, and &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; was interpreted by the provisions of the Act as &ldquo;residing with&rdquo;.  In other words, the fact that children were residing with a person was <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the children were maintained by that person.  That double condition of qualification led to conflicting claims.  We are getting rid of that by deleting the word &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; altogether from the legislation, and making the sole condition normal residence, it being assumed that the child was normally resident with the parent, even though the child may have lived with a grandparent or some other relative on the qualifying date. Power is taken to make regulations defining the manner in which normal residence will be interpreted, and regulations made in that way will be binding.</P>

      <P>I should not like to answer that question straightaway. If the father of the family was a migratory worker in England, who was likely to return in a short time, it might be held that he was the person entitled to claim the allowance.

      <P>If Deputies had been present during the discussion on the previous stage, they would have got an elaboration of the argument why this change is desirable.  If actual residence on the qualifying date with another relative were to debar the parent from claiming, there would be many parents who would never get the children's allowance, because families would be split up and the qualifying number would not be available.  It is only by regarding the child as normally resident with its parents, even though its actual residence is somewhere else on the qualifying date, that the claim to the full allowance can be sustained by the parent.  The child will be regarded as normally resident with its parents unless there is evidence that the link between parents and child has been permanently broken.</P>

While it is undoubtedly correct that the national executive of the live-stock trade might be regarded as representing the biggest section of the live-stock trade, circumstances may arise in respect of the major harbours, or any one of them, where another organisation, say representatives of pig exporters, might have <Col N="806" /> a prior interest in the harbour development and in such circumstances it is considered that there should be power to nominate by two live-stock organisations, each of which will have the right to nominate a member.  That is the change which is proposed in this amendment.</P>

      <P>As I have not been permitted to move the amendments standing in the name of another Deputy, I should like to say on the section that in the constitution of the harbour board every interest is represented except the agricultural community&mdash;the people who purchase most of the stuff coming through the ports, who have to pay freights and charges of that kind and who, therefore, should have some voice in saying what these charges should be.  They are also the people who produce the live stock which is exported from these ports, who contribute practically the entire revenue of the harbour board and yet they are given no representation. Every other interest seems to have got representation whether it is a secondary interest or a primary interest.  I am not concerned with the question whether the county council should represent the people for whom I speak. Personally I have no desire to be a member of this board.  I think some Deputy last week here suggested that they had no right to be on the board as they did not subscribe to taxation. I say that that is entirely wrong as they provide almost the entire revenue of the port in the case of Cork, both from what is imported and what is exported.  I think it is essential that these people should have representation through some body on the board. I am not concerned, as I say, whether that representation should come through the county council or through the county committee of agriculture, but these people should have representation through some body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any case to be made on these grounds. It is proposed, of course, in accordance with the recommendations of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal to constitute the harbour authorities for the four major harbours on a similar basis and <Col N="809" /> it is not contemplated that there should be any county council representative on the harbour boards for any of these ports nor do I see the need for such representative.  It is, of course, completely fallacious to talk about producers of live stock and of agricultural produce having a direct interest in the facilities available at ports and harbours.  These facilities are the concern of those who trade in these commodities or who are involved in their shipment or in their importation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.  I am sure there are other Deputies who know as much about the circumstances in which the live-stock trade is carried on as the Deputy and they will admit, I think, that 99 per cent. of the live-stock produced here are sold by the producer at the local market or fair.  After that stage the producer has no interest as to their ultimate destination&mdash;whether they are slaughtered for home consumption, exported for consumption abroad or whether the purchaser passes them into a circus.  The only question in which the purchaser is concerned is whether there is available at the ports the necessary lairages which he requires, whether the management of the port is efficient and whether his business of trading in live stock is facilitated by the harbour authorities.  The same applies to every commodity whether agricultural or industrial.  The <Col N="810" /> merchandising business that is involved is a concern of the harbour boards and ample provision is made in the constitution of the harbour boards to ensure that these trading interests are fully represented on the harbour authorities.  I do not think that there is any case whatever for giving representation upon these harbour authorities to the county councils for the adjoining counties.  No doubt, that position did exist in Cork previously but I am sure that Cork wants to get out of the position of being a second-class port and develop to the status of a first-class port, the same as Dublin and the same as it is proposed that Limerick and Waterford will be.  In the case of those smaller harbours, the harbour revenue is not always likely to be sufficient to defray the cost of harbour improvements.  In such cases is is not unusual for the harbour authorities to go to the county council for financial help.  Where the county council undertakes to give such financial help provision is made in this Bill to secure for the county council representation upon the harbour board concerned. That circumstance is not likely to arise in Cork, I understand, but if it did arise and if the Cork Harbour authority required financial help from the Cork County Council, then arrangements could be made to give the Cork County Council representation on the harbour board.  Otherwise, I do not think that it is desirable that the county council should have that right to representation.  It is, certainly, not proposed to give the Dublin County Council any representation on the Dublin Harbour Board or the Limerick County Council representation on the Limerick Harbour Board, or the Waterford County Council representation on the Waterford Harbour Board.  In each of those cases, the board will be constituted as proposed in the Bill.  Unless there is a very special reason why Cork County Council should be given representation on Cork Harbour Board, I should be disposed to resist that claim. I do not think that there is any reason why they should have such representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have suggested three ways out of this difficulty for the Minister, <Col N="811" /> in so far as Cork County is concerned.  One is the reduction of the representation given to the Cork Corporation, the second is the reduction of the representation given to the Cork Chamber of Commerce and the third is the addition to the number of the representatives of the Cork Harbour Board of two additional members, representing agriculture.  The difference between Cork and Dublin is that Cork Harbour is actually Cobh Harbour, lying some nine miles outside Cork.  Since this Bill was discussed on the Committee Stage I went to the trouble to make some investigations.  I found that 80 per cent. of the members of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers in Cork are also members of the chamber of commerce.  Some 60 per cent of those paying dues and also entitled to representation are also members of the chamber of commerce. Therefore, the chamber of commerce is getting eight representatives on the new harbour board, that is, two from the federation, two from the due-paying body and four from the two chambers of commerce themselves.</P>
      <P>Surely the producers, as represented by the elected representatives of the county council, and the consumers, as also represented by the elected representatives of the county council, are entitled to some representation?  Why did the county council, as an independent body, get representation on Cork Harbour Board before?  Is this going to be a new body, in which we are not going to have any interest?  I have something like 12 years' experience on the Cork Harbour Board and can see what has been happening there for a long period.  Outside of the interests of the city itself, the harbour board is not concerned with the general interests of the harbour.  When any proposal is brought up in connection with Cobh Harbour, it is immediately put on the long finger, or some committee is appointed, which will report ten years afterwards, and that gets rid of it.  Any proposal in regard to the extension of the deep water quays in Cobh or anything that would serve the rural community is put off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is now fixing up a <Col N="812" /> harbour board for Cork of 19 members, 18 of whom are to be from the city, and one urban representative from the town of Cobh.  That is to be the full representation. How much does he expect the Federation of Irish Manufacturers in Cork to export out of Cork for the next ten years, as compared with the exports of the rural community?  The total exports of the rural community are to be catered for by two gentlemen from the live-stock industry.  They are not concerned with the export of bacon, eggs, fowl or anything of that description. If we find, as we frequently do, that we have to make representations to the Department of Industry and Commerce, in connection with the manner in which boats are supplied for our services&mdash;for instance, for removing that for which we have a big trade in Cork, early potatoes for the export market&mdash;to whom are we to go, or what particular interests will represent that side of the farmers' trade in Cork in the future?  We have to pay for this and I consider that the least the rural community in Cork is entitled to is two representatives on the harbour board.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the time of the House, and I regret I was not here to move my amendment.  The Minister has given the traders of Cork three doors into the harbour board&mdash;one door wide open from the federation, another from the due-paying body and another from the two chambers of commerce&mdash;and I am giving him three doors out.  There is no representatives of the consumers; no representatives of the consumers; and no representative of the producers in the county.  I appeal to the Minister to consider amendment No. 11, if he does not wish to hurt any of the other interests concerned, that is, if he does not wish to reduce the representation of the chamber of commerce or the corporation, he has an easy way out.  I suggest that the Minister has an easy way out there in No. 11.  I think it is only fair that this should be done, and I hold that it is really only a small thing so far as this matter is concerned. With regard to the question of Cork deteriorating from a first-class port, I can tell the Minister that any question of the deterioration of Cork <Col N="813" /> from a first-class port is due to the fact that the suggestions put up by county council members on the harbour board were not carried out.  I say to the Minister that whatever danger may exist of Cork deteriorating into a second-class port lies in what he suggests now: that outside Blackrock Bend there is to be no representation. It takes a considerable amount of money each year to dredge the river from Blackrock Bend to Parnell Bridge, and the people have to pay that cost in extra dues for the upkeep of the harbour.  For instance, when it was suggested to the harbour board some years ago, when Rushbrooke Dockyard was being sold for scrap, that the dockyard should be acquired for the benefit of the port, that was defeated by the gentlemen who could not see below Blackrock Bend.  Now, however, the Minister contemplates shutting out from representation on Cork Harbour Board any interest outside Cork City trading interests, and he is giving representation to these trading interests only on the harbour board.  The Minister may think that he can do that, but I warn him here and now that if that is his object, it is an object that will definitely militate against Cork continuing as a first-class port in the future.</P>
    <P>I have had 20 years' experience of the Cork Harbour Board, and I have found that these people have no interest whatever in the expenditure of any money on the harbour unless there is something to be got out of it for the citizens of Cork City; but the rural community have to provide whatever it costs to keep up the harbour board.  Whatever port dues there may be, these people have to pay the cost, and the producers, accordingly, should have representation.  I do not think that the Minister will argue here for a moment that Cork Harbour is going to serve the producers and consumers of Cork City alone.  It is definitely going to serve the needs of Cork County.  Everything that the people of Cork County require, which has to be imported, will generally come in through Cork Harbour, just as everything that the people of Cork County <Col N="814" /> wish to export will definitely have to go out through Cork Harbour.  Therefore, the rural community have a very definite interest in seeing to the proper working of the Cork Harbour Commissioners&mdash;a very definite financial interest&mdash;and they are now going to be deprived, for the first time, of representation on that body.  As I have said, I wish to make a last appeal to the Minister on this matter.  I do not wish to see the port of Cork deteriorating, but, from my own personal experience there, I can say that it definitely will deteriorate if it is going to be left to depend solely on the interests of the people of Cork City.  I make no bones about that.  I speak from experience&mdash;from bitter and long experience&mdash;of what I have seen happening there.  The Minister can please himself, of course, but I would make a last appeal to him not to turn down the suggestion that the producers and consumers in Cork County, through their elected representatives, should be given representation on the Cork Harbour Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with some of what the Minister has said, I entirely disagree with what he says about the purchase of stock coming in here or going out from here.  Is he not quite aware that the value of that stock depends, first, on its efficient handling, the freight charges that will have to be borne, and so on? Whoever is the purchaser takes the net value and whatever profit there is, and, accordingly, the agricultural community throughout the country are very vitally interested in the efficiency of their harbours, and very vitally interested in seeing that there should be reasonable charges and proper facilities for delivery.  It is fundamentally their right to see to that, as it is a matter that is of very definite importance so far as the value of their cattle and other produce is concerned. I have already said that I am not particularly interested whether you give representation to the Dublin County Council, the Waterford County Council, and so on.  Where I come into direct conflict with the Minister is where he says that the producer has <Col N="815" /> no other interest in his stock once that stock has been purchased from him.  I have pointed out that other things happen subsequently, such as the handling of the stock, the freights to be charged, and so on, and that all these things have a decided bearing on what is required internally.  In that way, I think that the agricultural producer has a more vital interest in this matter than any other section of the community.  If these people are contributors to the cost by direct taxation, then they should be given direct representation.  Painful experience in this country has shown that the biggest revenue can be derived by indirect rather than by direct taxation, and I think that in no case is that of such vital importance as in the case of our harbour boards.  So far as direct taxation is concerned, nobody can realise the value of Cobh Harbour, not alone to Cork City and County, but to all Munster.  At the recent interview I stated that no matter what expense was involved in keeping up that harbour and making it what it ought to be, the corporation were prepared to give, through the county council, any sum that was necessary: they have not put any bar against it.  If I have not convinced the Minister, on all these grounds, of the vital necessity for this, I am afraid that I shall have to ask for the opinion of the House on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed the view that the representation here is loaded, in view of that section.  I hold that our predominant industry here is agriculture, and that the Minister should aim at getting representation on the harbour boards for that industry, so as to ensure the efficient handling of goods, and particularly agricultural goods.  If the Minister looks at the volume of trade in this country, I think he will find that the goods which dominate that trade consist of agricultural products and the raw materials for them.  The representation that is given here and the source from which it is drawn is not representative of the trade passing through the port.  If we have to sell <Col N="816" /> our exports against keen competition from other countries, transport and transport facilities are an essential matter and a primary consideration so far as the element of competition is concerned.  With the Deputies who have already spoken in the matter, I feel that the representation in that respect is not adequate.  I think something can be said, too, for the point of view expressed by Deputy Corry, that representatives from commercial interests may not give the attention to goods produced from the rural districts that they deserve, and I think the Minister should reconsider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that the efficiency of our transport service affects every commercial interest in the country.  But it affects other classes as well, and the producers of live stock and other agricultural produce for export are in no different position in that regard from any person engaged in a commercial occupation here. What Deputy Corry and Deputy Broderick suggested is that, because of the interest of producers in the efficiency of this particular transport service, they should be given special representation upon the directing board.  I am sure they will admit that the interest of producers is at least one stage removed from the management of these boards and that in between the management of the boards and the producers there are the commercial interests concerned with the shipment, either outward or inward, of goods.  It is these commercial interests that are primarily concerned with the adequacy of the harbour facilities and the efficiency of the harbour management, and there is obviously no conflict between their interests as commercial agents and the interests of the producers, as described by Deputy Broderick.  I think it is a complete fallacy to argue that, because there may be a trade in seed potatoes through the port of Cork, the only persons who should have any say in the management of the Cork Harbour Board are the growers of potatoes. That is Deputy Corry's argument and it is Deputy Broderick's argument applied to live stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The harbour board must manage the business so as to enable them to have the resources to maintain the harbour, to develop the har bour, and to provide new facilities when required.  They can do that only through the business of selling facilities of one kind or another in the area of the harbour.  They are regulated in that regard at the present time by the provisions of various Acts.  They will be controlled in future by the power of the Minister, who is now, for the first time, coming in in a supervisory capacity over the administration of the harbour authority and, consequently, they have not an unlimited power in charging for services.  Certainly the rates will be so fixed as to enable them to conduct the harbour efficiently and to accumulate whatever financial resources are necessary to provide for its future development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, one harbour is in competition with another.  Cork Harbour Board cannot, any more than the Dublin Harbour Board, charge whatever <Col N="818" /> it likes.  There are other means of shipping goods in and out of the country and, if the services are not adequate or the charges are too high, the shippers of goods will use these other facilities and not Cork Harbour or Dublin Harbour.  That is why the harbour authority must be concerned to ensure that it so conducts its affairs as to encourage the use of its harbour and certainly not to divert trade elsewhere. Again, I submit that this is a business matter and the principle has been adopted of giving the responsibility for appointing those who are to run that business concern to those local interests that are most obviously and directly concerned with its success.  In any event, that has been the principle followed heretofore and it is the principle recommended by the tribunal, and I would be very slow indeed to depart from the general idea of main taining a uniform constitution for these harbour authorities.  I may say that in the case of the other major harbours there has been no claim for giving representation to county council interests. It is only in the case of Cork that that claim has been advanced, and I cannot see the slightest justification for it.</P>

The Minister has given representation to the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, whose total interests when bulked together would not amount to one-tenth of the agricultural interests so far as that county is concerned.  In addition to that, they have another road in through the chamber of commerce.  I am sure the Minister will admit that no port could be termed a first-class port unless it had a dockyard where ships, if anything happens to them, at least can get temporary repairs done. Some years ago, when Rushbrooke and Haulbowline dockyards clashed, the Rushbrooke dockyard was put up to be sold for scrap.</P>

The Minister had that dockyard dismantled and the machinery removed out of it.  Our contention that the dockyard was necessary was proved afterwards, by the Minister himself coming down and taking it over.  A gap that could have been filled by £10,000 in 1933, when it was proposed to take it over and when the machinery was sold for scrap, cost the Minister at least 20 times that sum in 1941.  You had the spectacle, in a first-class port, of an old ship being held up for a week, while they were filling in the gaps outside with cement, to enable her to travel to Britain to be repaired.</P>

    <P>Those are the things which have made me say that the representation of the harbour board, as contained in this Bill, is wrong and will militate against the future turning of the port of Cork into a first-class port or anything like it.  If it is just to give representation to eight members of the chambers of commerce, surely it is also just to seek at least two representatives of the consumers and producers in Cork County on that board? I can see no justification for the Minister's attitude.  The claims of the county council were freely acknowledged by the constituting authorities up to the present and the county council had always two representatives on the harbour board.  I am not concerned with what happened in other harbours or other authorities.  There is a very definite idea creeping about in this country at present that the whole of the management of the country is to be taken over by trading bodies or something of that description and that the producers, the wealth in this country, are to be left standing behind the scenes and to have no voice.  That is <Col N="820" /> what is happening in regard to this Bill and that is the attitude which has been adopted with regard to it throughout.  I do not wish to hold up the time of the House, but in a matter like this, which is vital to the interests of the people in Cork County, the Minister should give way and give us the two representatives we are seeking.</P>

      <P>We had better be clear about this.  The Minister could not comprehend the idea that the potato producer, once he sold his commodity, had no further interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last analysis, he is the man affected.  The other man simply deducts the transport charges and his profit; so, no matter what the market conditions, it is the producer who pays all the time.  I merely rise to say that the Minister should be elear on that and that I am in sympathy with the representations which have been made here to ensure that the people who have a vital interest in the particular commodities being handled should have some voice in fixing the charges.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment is to preserve the operation of the Commissioners Clauses Act, 1847, in respect of certain harbour authorities which derive powers under it, during the interim period between the enactment of this measure, which repeals the Act, and the establishment of the new harbour authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We had some discussion on the Committee Stage on the sections in respect of which it might be made an obligation on the Minister to lay Orders before the Oireachtas, the Houses of the Oireachtas having power to annul. I have gone through the Bill and find that there are a couple of sections in respect of which it is desirable that power of annulment should be retained by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is one of the sections, and it is I think the obvious section in respect of which <Col N="829" /> the power should be exercised if it is to be exercised at all.  Deputy M. O'Sullivan has a similar amendment to a later section, but this is the really operative section, because it is the Orders under this section which displace a harbour authority and substitute commissioners.  If the Dáil wants to check the Minister and prevent the exercise of that power, it is when he makes an Order under this section that it should assert itself.</P>

With regard to this amendment, may I say that I expressed some misgivings on Second Reading and Committee Stage regarding what I considered to be the arbitrary powers vested in the general manager, but I am satisfied, on re-reading sub-section (4)&mdash;I hope at least that I am right&mdash;that in so far as the powers of the general manager are concerned, he is, in the last analysis, subject, even in the matter of staff, to the overriding authority of the board, and am prepared to salve my conscience in the matter.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>In page 26, before Section 40, line 17, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>40.&mdash;(1) Where the general manager of a harbour is on vacation or is through illness, absence from the areas in which the harbour is situated, or suspension, temporarily incapable of executing the functions of his office, the harbour authority of the harbour may appoint a deputy general manager for the duration of the vacation or incapacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The power to appoint a deputy general manager conferred by sub-section (1) of this section may also be exercised before and in contemplation of any vacation of the general manager of a harbour or of any temporary <Col N="831" /> incapacity on his part to execute the functions of his office through absence from the area in which the harbour is situated.</P>
    <P>(3)  A deputy general manager appointed under this section shall, during the continuance of the vacation or incapacity on account of which he is appointed or until he is sooner removed or dies or resigns, have all the powers and shall execute and perform all the functions and duties of the general manager for which he is deputising and for that purpose the references in sub-sections (3) to (7) of Section 39 and Sections 170, 171 and 172 of this Act to the general manager of a harbour shall include a reference to such deputy general manager.</P>
    <P>This new section provides for the appointment of a deputy general manager by a harbour authority to act when the general manager is absent through illness, or while on vacation, or for any other reason.</P>

    <P>(2)  The expenses incurred by a harbour authority in connection with the removal under this section of an obstruction shall, so far as not recovered under sub-section (3) of this section, be paid to the harbour authority by the owner of the obstruction or, at the option of the harbour authority, by any former owner thereof.</P>
    <P>(3)  An article which is either an obstruction removed under this section by a harbour authority or a part of such obstruction may be sold by the harbour authority subject to the following provisions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the article shall not be sold for home use where any prohibition or restriction on importation applies in respect thereof or where the price which would be obtained is less than the amount of any duties of customs or excise payable in respect of the article;</P>
    <P>(b)  where the article is sold for home use, the harbour authority shall apply the proceeds of the sale&mdash;</P>

    <P>and shall pay the balance (if any) on demand to the owner of the obstruction;</P>
    <P>(c)  where the article is sold otherwise than for home use, the harbour authority shall apply the proceeds of sale in payment of any such rates and expenses as aforesaid, and shall pay the balance (if any) on demand to the owner of the obstruction;</P>
    <P>(d)  the expenses incurred by the harbour authority in connection with the sale shall, so far as not <Col N="835" /> recovered under this sub-section, be paid to the harbour authority by the owner of the obstruction or, at the option of the harbour authority, by any former owner thereof.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where, in the opinion of the harbour authority, it is inadvisable to offer an article for sale under sub-section (3) of this section or where the article cannot, having regard to paragraph (a) of that sub-section, be sold, the harbour authority may destroy the article, subject, where any duties of customs or excise are payable in respect thereof or any prohibition or restriction on importation applies in respect thereof, to the consent of the Revenue Commissioners and to compliance with any conditions which they may impose.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where an article is destroyed under sub-section (4) of this section, the expenses incurred in connection with the destruction thereof, so far as not recovered under sub-section (3)  of this section, shall be paid to the harbour authority by the owner of the obstruction or, at the option of the harbour authority, by any former owner thereof.</P>
    <P>(6)  A sum payable to a harbour authority under this section shall, in default of payment, be recoverable as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(7)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>the word obstruction means any obstruction being&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a vessel laid up as unfit for sea service,</P>
    <P>(b)  a wrecked or derelict vessel,</P>
    <P>(c)  a float of timber,</P>
    <P>(d)  any other article except an aircraft,</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;former owner&rdquo; means, in relation to an obstruction, a former owner of the obstruction as respects whom it can be shown that he relinquished or transferred his interest therein after, in the case of a vessel, the vessel was laid up or became wrecked or derelict or, in the case of any other obstruction, it was found to be within the limits of the relevant harbour.</P>
    <P>This is a redraft of Section 55 which <Col N="836" /> relates to the removal of wrecks laid up and other obstructions in a harbour. The changes which are being made by this amendment are, (1), the power to remove an obstruction is being taken from the harbour master and given to the harbour authority, and (2), power is being given to the harbour authority to claim the expenses incurred in connection with the removal of wreck from a former owner who is defined as the person who relinquished his interest in the vessel after it was wrecked, or after it was laid up, or who relinquished his interest in any other obstruction that the harbour authority found within the limits of the harbour.  It also gives the harbour authority power to sell a part, as well as the whole, of the wreck or other obstruction.</P>

      <P>In page 34, before Section 65 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever any delay occurs in loading or discharging a cargo of a vessel within the limits of a harbour and the harbour master of the harbour considers the delay unreasonable, the harbour master may require the master of the vessel to load or discharge the cargo within a specified period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  If the master of a vessel refuses or fails to comply with a requirement made on him by the harbour master of a harbour and authorised <Col N="837" /> by this section or if the harbour master of a harbour cannot find the master of a vessel in relation to which the harbour master wishes to make a requirement authorised by this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the harbour master may carry out the requirement and do all things necessary for or incidental to that purpose,</P>
    <P>(b)  the expenses incurred in so carrying out the requirement shall be paid by the master of the vessel to the harbour authority for the harbour and, in default of payment, may be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>This is a redrafting of Section 81 which I am proposing, subsequently, should be deleted.  The amendment is designed to give power to a harbour master to undertake the loading or discharge of a vessel where he considers there is an unreasonable delay.  It was the Wexford County Council which pointed out that the giving of that power to the harbour authority might involve delay as the exercise of the power would necessitate a meeting of the harbour authority, and that it was more appropriate that the power should be possessed by the harbour master which is the present position in Dublin.  The amended section also provides that the harbour master must first require the master of the vessel, or the owner of the goods, to discharge the cargo within a specified time before he undertakes the work himself.</P>

      <P>In page 68, before Section 164, line 27, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  A harbour authority may as part of their working and establishment <Col N="843" /> expenses make reasonable payments for or in connection with&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the reception of and extending of hospitality to members, directors or officers of other port or harbour authorities or of any public authority or body or any company having interests of a professional or business character similar to the interests of the harbour authority or with whom the harbour authority have or contemplate having professional or business relations, and</P>
    <P>(b)  visits by way of official courtesy by or on behalf of the harbour authority to any such authority, body or company as aforesaid,</P>
    <P>including payments for travelling expenses and other expenses reasonably incurred by or on behalf of any member or officer of the harbour authority in connection with any of the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(2)  The total amount which a harbour authority pay under this section in any period shall not exceed the amount sanctioned for the time being in respect of the harbour authority by the Minister for that period.</P>
    <P>This new section would empower a harbour authority to spend sums within certain limits upon hospitality.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 71:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 74, Section 185, before sub-section (3), to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Every Order made by the Minister <Col N="844" /> under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution annulling the Order is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after the Order is laid before it, the Order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>This is a repetition of the question that has been running through this whole Bill.  In so far as Section 185, the Third Schedule, embraces a whole series of enactments which will cease to have effect after the commencement of the operation of this Act, I think it is desirable that in that particular case we should have the safeguard of the tabling of Orders here as we have under certain specific sections.  In so far as this particular section is concerned, I would regard it as perhaps one of the most important where the provision should operate that we should have the Orders tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  I think it is one of the least important.  The power given here is merely a power to adapt the enactments to ensure that the intentions of the Dáil are carried out.  There is no power to alter the principle of the law at all.  There is a similar section in the Local Government Act but that section gives the Minister for Local Government power to declare that certain provisions will no longer be enforced.  I am not taking that power here.  The sole power taken here is to make whatever adaptations of enactments as may be necessary to ensure that this Bill is carried into effect.  I think, therefore, it is the type of thing that should be dealt with by Ministerial Order.  It would not be practicable, I think, to make in the Bill all the provisions which would provide all the safeguards necessary and it is to provide against the possibility that some of the changes which should have been made in other enactments may have been overlooked that this power is given but, in so far as there is nothing which gives the Minister any power to change any matter of principle&mdash;it is merely a power of adaptation <Col N="845" /> that is given&mdash;I do not think it is the type of case where the power of annulment should be asked for by the Dáil.  I have inserted sections to give that power of annulment where questions of policy arise&mdash;where a harbour authority is removed and a commissioner appointed instead or where the powers or the area of administration of a harbour authority are altered.  In that case there is clearly a question of policy and the Dáil may be concerned. But this is purely a matter of administration and I think it would be bad precedent to accept an amendment of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  He will recall that in Committee he gave me an assurance that if he thought there was necessity for scheduling the basis of compensation for quay police he would do so.  I pressed him at the time and I believe, very strongly, that there is a necessity for that for the reasons I gave on that particular occasion&mdash;one, that the men do not know whether they will be kept on or discontinued at any particular time, and two, that while they are uncertain regarding their employment they are in a state of anxiety regarding the method or basis of compensation. I would ask the Minister, if he can see his way, to indicate to the House what the schedule of compensation may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think, having regard to the limited number of individuals concerned, it is necessary to embody in this Bill an elaborate schedule providing for the payment of compensation in all the varying circumstances that must be taken into account when legal measures are being prepared.  What is in the Bill is a general power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prescribe by Order the basis on which compensation may be paid and that power will no doubt be exercised upon the basis of precedents established in other Acts.  I think that is extremely likely. I could not say when the position of these harbour police may be affected. The Minister for Justice is here&mdash;he probably has not given the matter any thought&mdash;but this Bill gives him the power to decide if and when the functions of the harbour police will be transferred to the Gárda Síochána.  I should imagine that no very serious consideration has yet been given to the stage at which that may be practicable and it is probable that it will be some time yet before the Gárda Síochána authorities are likely to be <Col N="847" /> in a position to accept the additional duties that would devolve upon them if the harbour police should be abolished but it will be for the Minister for Justice to decide and when he decides there will be an Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce setting out the basis on which the harbour authority must compensate these harbour constables to whatever extent it is impossible for them to be in fact taken over by the Gárda Síochána for the purpose of that particular duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things to be done in this Bill.  One is to deprive harbour authorities which have never exercised that power of the power.  Certain harbour authorities had this power to appoint harbour police.  They did not use it and they cannot exercise that power in future. It is only in the case of Dublin that there is a problem of any dimensions <Col N="848" /> so far as personnel is concerned.  I assume Deputies will agree that for the one harbour constable in Westport we need not have an elaborate schedule to determine the basis of compensation. It is only in Dublin, and because of the particular nature of the problem in Dublin I think it is there it is least likely that any change in the situation will be made at an early date.  A change in the situation at Westport may be made when the existing constable retires or perhaps earlier but that will not involve any very elaborate arrangements on the part of the Gárda Síochána authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of compensation hanging over their heads makes it difficult for these men and is unfair to them, but it is also difficult for the port authority.  If in the near future they find that a man has come to the retiring age&mdash;or several men&mdash; and in the ordinary way that may happen fairly often&mdash;what are the board going to do in connection with the recruitment of new personnel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>It is not really any different from what it was.  The fact that this change can be made by Order of the Minister for Justice, supplemented by an Order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is no different really in essence, having regard to the possibility that legislation of this kind has been in contemplation since the Ports and Harbours Tribunal reported and since it was known that the tribunal had recommended that this legislative change should be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is compensation and compensation, as the Minister will agree.  How many harbours are maintained by the Government?  There are only 30 men in question here, and it would not have broken any hearts to see that these men were compensated for their years of service under the existing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just the difficulty of working out what would be an elaborate schedule to deal with a very limited number of individuals.  I do not think that is necessary.  We must not deal with this Bill as if it was concerned with the Dublin Port and Docks only.  There are certain other ports which exercise this right, but where <Col N="850" /> the circumstances may be different.  In fact, some of these men are not whole-time employees, so that you could not have a provision to cover Dublin to suit elsewhere.  What is in the Bill is that there must be compensation by the harbour authorities, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce can make an Order which shall be binding on harbour authorities to pay compensation on the basis laid down by him. When the compensation is being paid by some other authority, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no reason for not being generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very little about harbours but I know the position of the average man's domestic affairs. While provision for 30 harbour employees in Dublin, and a number of others throughout the country may seem trivial, to the ordinary harbour constable and his family it matters very much.  I press upon Deputies to consider the matter very carefully before deciding to leave hanging in the air the personal rights and anxieties of the individuals concerned.  I see the Minister's difficulty that the preparation of an elaborate schedule for separate cases seems very laborious, but surely between now and the time that the Bill goes to the Seanad, he could ascertain with certainty the number of harbour constables interested. I doubt if information as to their terms of appointment is not already in the Department.  Could he not provide a schedule which would put everybody's mind at rest, one on general lines, inasmuch as it is unlikely that many men would be displaced at all?  If there was a generous plan of compensation for those it was necessary to get rid of, it would relieve their minds and place no unbearable charge upon anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the deficiency from bankruptcy percentages, I want to know from the Minister if, in his opinion, that decrease is due to the general tendency to avoid bankruptcy proceedings in this country, on the ground that bankruptcy law has now become antiquated and out of date, so that virtually nobody avails of it unless there is no other conceivable recourse open to them?  In that connection could he state definitely what action he intends to take?  Has he in mind, for submission to the Dáil at a reasonably early date, a co-relation of bankruptcy law on the lines of the report of a commission set up by his Department 15 years ago, and which has been lying in his office ever since? Is he aware that unless he proposes to take steps along these lines he may expect that bankruptcy percentages will continue to decrease, not as a result of any improvement in the mercantile life of the country, but because people who ought to have access to the bankruptcy court for the clearing of mercantile matters, are prevented from availing of it, because the Oireachtas has allowed the machinery to become so antiquated that it is virtually unworkable?</P>

There was less business done, less credit given, less speculation, and, consequently, less bankruptcy. I am not prepared at this stage to go into the matter.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate for £800 is being taken to enable compensation recovered from the German Government for personal injuries arising out of the Campile bombing on the 26th August, 1940, to be distributed among individual claimants.  The German Government, who accepted responsibility for the Campile incident, were presented with a claim amounting to £15,000, of which £4,893 was in respect of personal injuries and the balance for damage to property.  After <Col N="854" /> negotiations, they accepted the claim at £12,000, of which £4,000 is available to meet payments in respect of personal injuries, and it was agreed that the payments should be met out of moneys made available under the powers conferred by the Emergency Powers (No. 335) Order, 1944. which provided for the collection by the State of debts due by Irish residents to persons in Germany.  The full £12,000 has been recovered in this manner and has been paid into the Exchequer, as provided by Article 6 (c) of that Order.</P>
    <P>As the money has been so paid into the Exchequer, the only method by which payments in respect of compensation can be made is via the Vote for Personal Injuries (Civilians) Compensation. The existing vote provision having been measured without reference to any disbursements of this kind, the authority of the Dáil is now being sought for a Supplementary Estimate to make good the balance of outlay not available by means of savings on the existing Vote.  Payments will be made in individual cases pursuant to Article 34 of the Emergency Powers (Compensation for Personal Injuries) (Civilians) Scheme, 1942.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Local Government Bill, 1945&mdash;Committee (resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment.</P>
    <P>31a.  To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following subsections:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  If, at any time after the rate in the pound of the rate for a local financial year has been determined by a rating authority, it appears to the Minister that such rate at such rate in the pound is likely to be insufficient to meet the part defrayable out of rates of the expenses to be incurred by the rating authority in that financial year in&mdash; (a)  maintaining at a reasonable standard the public services for the maintenance of which the rating authority is responsible, and</P>
    <P>(b)  paying to any other body any sums which the rating authority are bound to supply to that body,</P>
    <P>the Minister, after holding a local inquiry into the sufficiency of such rate, may require the rating authority either to revoke such determination and determine a new rate in the pound for such rate or (if by reason of any steps already taken for the making, levying or collecting of such rate, such a course is more convenient) determine a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate for that local financial year.</P>
    <P>(2)  Within fourteen days after the date of the receipt by the secretary or clerk of a rating authority of notification that a requirement has been made under sub-section (1) of this section, the rating authority shall comply with such requirement.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a rating authority determine pursuant to a requirement under sub-section (1) of this section a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate, it shall be the duty of the rating authority to make, levy, collect and recover such supplementary rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> (4)  Where a rating authority in relation to whom a requirement is made under sub-section (1) of this section determine and make pursuant to the direction either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a new rate in the pound of a rate, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate,</P>
    <P>which in the opinion of the Minister is insufficient, the Minister may by Order remove from office the members of the rating authority.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of Part IV of the Act of 1941, an Order under sub-section (4) of this section shall be deemed to be an Order under Section 44 of that Act, and the removal from office of the members of the rating authority concerned shall be deemed to be a removal from office under that section.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a person or persons has or have been appointed under Part IV of the Act of 1941 to be a commissioner or commissioners for a rating authority whose members have been removed from office, such person or persons may revoke any determination by the rating authority of a rate in the pound of a rate for the current or the next local financial year as had been made before his or their appointment (whether it is the first determination of a rate in the pound, the determination of the rate in the pound of a new rate or the determination of the rate in the pound of a supplementary rate) and may determine the rate in the pound of such rate as if no earlier determination had been made, or may determine a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate for such local financial year, and make, levy, collect and recover such supplementary rate.&rdquo;&mdash;(Aire Rialtais Aitiúil agus Sláinte Poiblí.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who has been at all conversant with local government for the last few years must have known that whatever administrative powers local bodies possessed&mdash;and they were practically nil&mdash;they were stripped of practically every power they possessed in the last seven or eight years.  There <Col N="860" /> were, however, some people who held the erroneous belief that there still remained to these bodies the power of striking a rate and of making provision for what they deemed necessary in local expenditure.  Whatever shadow of doubt anybody had in that respect must have been removed by this amendment.  One wonders why the Minister thought it necessary to bring in the amendment.  He had already power to dissolve local authorities if they hesitated or refused to strike a rate.  He had power even to remove a manager if he stood out against the Minister, but seemingly neither of these powers sufficed.  In a recent speech, or lecture, in the Mansion House, the Minister himself said that the county system was inequitable, and that new administrative territories would have to be devised.  This new administrative territory that is to be devised is the Minister's office in the Custom House. In future, all Orders and regulations relating to the financing and proceedings of local bodies will be issued by the Minister from his office in the Custom House.  In the same speech, the Minister made the remarkable statement that we had a superstructure of local administration as democratic and progressive as any in the world, but the foundations were unsound. The Minister's remedy for this is to throw an atomic bomb into the foundations and blow the foundations, structure and all, sky high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practically all the arguments that could have been directed against this amendment were made in the course of the debate on the last day, but to me one apparent reason for the introduction of the amendment seems to be that the Minister is afraid that local bodies all over the country, and managers as well, will rise against the Minister on this question of the financing of local bodies.  The Minister was afraid of that himself because in the speech to which I have already referred he expressed the opinion that local authorities would find difficulty in discharging their present responsibilities under the law, not to speak of any additional services which the public might be expected to demand. I suppose one could interpret that as meaning any additional services the <Col N="861" /> Minister might demand because there has been gradually, from day to day, a number of services inflicted on local bodies which they might reasonably expect would not be a charge on local rates.  The tendency gradually has been to divert from central funds to local funds charges that should really be met out of the national taxation. One can envisage that in the near future, when there is a general public demand for a reduction of taxation in the country, the Government through the Minister for Local Government and Public Health are going to pass on to local bodies the financing of services which should really be made the subject of a national charge.</P>
    <P>I think every Deputy who has any sense of responsibility will resist this amendment.  No case could possibly be made for the amendment.  The Minister did not make a case for it, and I suppose he cannot make a case when he gets up to reply.  The Minister in his own flowery language, employing the high-sounding phraseology of which he is capable, in that speech to which I have referred, spoke of the foundations and fundamental ideas of local government.  I should like the Minister to give the House his real conception of what local government should be, whether it is to be a system directed, as the Minister seems to think it should be, from a central office in Dublin or whether local government rather should not be, as the name implies, a system under which local bodies will have some real power to control finance or do anything they consider necessary in the interests of the ratepayers.  While we all recognised that local government in this country was dying, it seems to me beyond yea or nay, that this amendment has killed and buried it.</P>
    <P>If the Government and the Minister were honest, they would get rid of the codology and come before the people and say: &ldquo;In future we are going to run and to finance all services in this country, whether local or national services, through the central authority&mdash; the Government&mdash;in Dublin.&rdquo;  Now, <Col N="862" /> people might not like it, but at least they would know where they stood, and would know where to place the blame for anything that might go wrong in the country.  No possible case can be made for this amendment, and I think that every decent Deputy should vote against it.  Mind you, some of the Deputies on the Government Benches have spoken very strongly against the amendment, and I hope that all these Deputies, whether on the Government Benches, these benches, or any other benches, will have the courage of their convictions and vote against it, because I am quite sure that there is not a Deputy in this House who is not satisfied that the Minister, in asking us to pass this amendment, is attempting to inflict a grave injustice on this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point, Sir, that I think nobody has yet made in connection with this amendment.  This, so far as I know, is the first time that an attempt has been made by a Minister for Local Government and Public Health to impose a heavy fine on individual members of a local authority who refuse to do what he orders them to do.  Heretofore, the only sanction the Minister sought against members of a local body, if they were not prepared to fall in with his views, was to dissolve the local body and deprive them of membership, but I suggest that this proposes to impose on individual members of a county council a fine which might very well cripple a small farmer who had undertaken the duties of a county councillor.  Sub-section (1) authorises the Minister</P>
      <P>&ldquo;after holding a local inquiry into the sufficiency of a rate, to require the rating authority either to revoke such determination and determine a new rate in the pound for such rate or (if by reason of any steps already taken for the making, levying or collecting of such rate, such a course is more convenient) determine a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate for that local financial year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So the Minister may stipulate the new rate which has to be made and which, in his opinion, is sufficient.  Now sub-section (2) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" />&ldquo;Within 14 days after the date of the receipt by the secretary or clerk of a rating authority of notification that a requirement has been made under sub-section (1) of this section, the rating authority shall comply with such requirement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there are several alternative courses left open to the Minister if the rating authority makes an insufficient additional assessment.  Supposing that the rating authority sit back and say: &ldquo;We differ from the Minister.  We conscientiously believe that no such rate should be struck at all, and we refuse to comply with his requirement under sub-section (1)&rdquo;, is it not open to him under sub-section (2) to start mandamus proceedings and compel them to do what he asks them?  And if he does so start mandamus proceedings and the members of the authority believe themselves to be right and resist in the course of a High Court action, is it not open to him to recover from them and get back from them the cost of whatever resulted from their original refusal to comply with his requirements? I think that that is quite clear.  What small farmer in this country can in future offer himself for election to a county council if he finds himself faced with this dilemma: that having secured the suffrages of his fellow-ratepayers and having given a solemn undertaking to act on that body and do his duty as he sees it, he now knows that, pursuant to that declaration, the fulfilment of it may involve him in expenses calculated to cripple himself and beggar his family? In future, the only candidates for a local authority must be men who will go on a county council with the mental reservation that they will do their duty up to the point where the Minister makes an Order under sub-section (1) of this section, and that thereafter they will comply with the Minister's directions whether they agree with them or not.</P>
    <P>Now, some Deputies may feel that whatever the expenses of mandamus proceedings might be, when spread over all the members of a county council they could not constitute a very heavy expense on any man, but I think it is open to the auditor of a council to <Col N="864" /> impose the penalty on an individual county councillor, who voted against the surcharge, and to exempt the others who did not vote against it.  Is there any other occasion on which a Minister for Local Government and Public Health has sought power, not only to determine the existence of a local authority, but to impose a heavy fine on the individual members of it, who are doing what they conscientiously believe to be their duty?  I know of no other case heretofore.</P>
    <P>Where a surcharge was due even to manifest misfeasance on the part of members of a local body, where the Minister was satisfied that the misfeasance was due to a mistake and because the members did not understand the issue, he could waive the surcharge. Here, however, the Minister envisages a case of his being in conflict with men on a local authority who clearly understand the issue, who cannot possibly claim subsequently that they did not appreciate the nature of what they were about to do, and who must accept the responsibility of mandamus proceedings and the subsequent surcharge liability.  What malignance inspires the Minister to seek that kind of penal power against persons who, remember, are almost the last class of persons in the public life of this country who undertake to do their work for nothing?  County councillors are now practically the only people in this country who stand for elective office and undertake to do the work of that office without any pay or allowance, good, bad or indifferent. Even as we are whittling down the powers of these local authorities, so we have made it more and more difficult to get the right type of men to offer themselves for election.  If, in addition to the other obstacles we have put in the way of really good men, we are now to add the Sword of Damocles in the way of a heavy fine of this kind, should they find themselves in conflict with the Minister for Local Government, can you imagine any prudent man taking that risk?  If any 10-acre or 15-acre farmer came to the Minister for Local Government in his personal capacity to-morrow, directed his attention to this proposed insertion in the Local Government Bill and said: &ldquo;Having a <Col N="865" /> wife and family, would you consider that I would be justified in taking the risk of going on a county council when I honestly believe that the present rate burden is too heavy, and when I am quite convinced that at a very early date my friends and I are virtually certain to come in conflict with the county manager as to the gross rate which it is legitimate to call upon the ratepayers to pay?&rdquo; Would it not be only right for the Minister to say to that man: &ldquo;Well, then, in my opinion, it would not be right for you to go on the council, because a possible consequence of your doing so might be having to face a fine of £70 or £80 to cover the cost of mandamus proceedings resulting from your doing your duty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That may sound a fantastic picture, but in fact it is merely a description of what took place very recently in this country.  Everyone in County Roscommon knew that, when Clann na Talmhan claimed to get control of the Roscommon County Council, one of their principal objectives was to bring down the rates and that they proposed to fix upon a global sum and say to the Roscommon County Manager: &ldquo;You have got to bring your services within that sum.&rdquo; With certain limitations, the attitude of the men constituting that organisation was that they left it to the discretion of the county manager to make his economies where he thought they would work least hardship on the community as a whole.  Of course, immediately they found themselves in collision with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who took the view that the economies which they demanded would represent too severe an inroad on the appropriation for the maintenance of roads in County Roscommon. He pointed that out to them.  I knew most of the men on the Roscommon County Council and, whether they were right or whether they were wrong, they believed they were all acting in good faith.  They believed that they had a duty to resist an increase in the rates and they believed that that duty was made more binding than it would be ordinarily by their express undertaking to the voters that, if elected, they would insist on a reduction in the rates.  Therefore, <Col N="866" /> when the Minister's remonstrance reached them they calmly and deliberately informed him that they believed it was their duty to reaffirm their original decision and the council was then dissolved and a commissioner put in.</P>
    <P>Had this section been in operation, the Minister could have addressed a requisition to them to strike a supplementary rate.  If the members of Clann na Talmhan on the Roscommon County Council had replied: &ldquo;We cannot conscientiously do that,&rdquo; under sub-section (2) the Minister could start mandamus proceedings.  There are at least two men on that council whom I believe the cost of the mandamus proceedings would have put into bankruptcy. They were poor, hard-working men who could not contemplate such an expense.  Does the House want to give the Custom House, for that is what it means, power to blackmail local representatives into either doing what they are told to do or suffering a heavy financial penalty which they feel their family responsibilities will not permit of?  It is quite unprecedented, and I would be glad to hear from the Minister whether that is his intention.</P>
    <P>This section, in my opinion, would be bad enough if it merely provided for the sanction that, if the council did not do what the Minister required them to do, under sub-section (1) the Minister was free to dissolve the council. It is utterly intolerable if it includes the addition that, without abolishing the council, the Minister can place an insupportable financial burden on the individual members who believe it to be their conscientious duty to differ from him.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Rourke and Allen of the Fianna Fáil Party have declared that this section is one which they could not conscientiously recommend to their supporters.  But they will vote for it. Otherwise all they can do is trot downstairs and sit down at the foot of the stairs and not vote at all.  I suppose if you depend for your political existence on hanging on to the tailboard of a political band-wagon, you have to resort to these kinds of expedients. But it seems rather humiliating to the Minister to see his own supporters <Col N="867" /> being dragged by the hair into the Division Lobby after him, knowing that they are violating their own conscience in submitting to the Party Whip.  The evidence of that alone ought to be enough to make the Minister think twice.  When you have to resort to the deplorable expedient of publicly flogging your own supporters into the Lobby, Parliamentary deliberation has been brought to a very low level.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the powers which he has at present are quite sufficient to meet the unlikely contingency of a local authority which wishes to conspire within itself for the destruction of the services of its own county.  I suppose it is conceivable that a county council or a corporation might try to take steps to destroy its own local services.  I do not think it is probable.  But if that contingency arose, under the law as it stands the Minister can dissolve the local authority and put in a commissioner. Why does he want this alternative power?  Why does he want to go for a mandamus?  Why does he want this right vindictively to fine men who believe they have a conscientious duty and discharge it, unlike his own colleagues in this House who, believing they have a conscientious duty to vote against the Government in the Lobby, sublimate it and work it off at the foot of the stairs.  I admire a councillor who did what he believed was right very much more than I could admire a Fianna Fáil T.D. who, seeing his duty, ran away from it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be a strange standard to set for the country that we should legislate in this House by the procedure of bringing members of the Oireachtas to their feet to say: &ldquo;Voting for this amendment would be a betrayal of my trust, but, inasmuch as I depend for my existence on the Party, I shall of course betray my trust if told to do so.&rdquo; I want to warn the Minister, who is about to drive them into that course, that he is forcing them to be guilty of a breach of trust.  Surely an amendment that brings that situation about must be fundamentally wrong.  I ask the Minister to tell us why he wants the additional power vindictively to fine men who do their duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, at the outset, that I do not think the Minister has made any case whatsoever for this amendment.  Generally speaking, since local authorities were first established in this country, they have carried out the duties imposed upon them by law.  During the emergency they have also carried out some extraordinary obligations placed upon them.  The fact that they are to-day functioning and striking rates which have been increased by 46 per cent. since 1942 does not show any inclination on their part not to carry out the law as passed by this House.  Taking his usual line, the Minister said that, if Deputies wished to see mental and other hospitals maintained and if they wished to see roads maintained, they must vote for this amendment.  That is sheer, utter nonsense&mdash;and no one knows that better than the Minister. He knows that, not only have they struck rates adequate to maintain all the services over the last five or ten years, but in many counties they also had overdrafts running from £10,000 to £150,000 in the banks in order to keep the turf schemes going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This extraordinary amendment, as it has been properly described, is brought in for one purpose alone&mdash;not that there is any fear on the Minister's part that local authorities will refuse to strike a rate to carry out their normal functions, but that he is afraid they will refuse to strike a rate to meet charges, which he is going to <Col N="869" /> place on the local authorities, charges which were never intended to be placed on them.  He is afraid that the local authorities will refuse to meet the very heavy charges which are going to be placed upon them, without their having any say in the matter except to strike the rate, under the Public Health Bill when it becomes law.  May I ask the Minister if he would have it at the back of his mind that he might require an amendment such as this to compel the local authorities to pay out of the local rates all the losses incurred over the turf schemes during the last five or six years and for which at least an implied promise was given in this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing implied about it: there was a firm undertaking, provided that the turf was cut efficiently and not extravagantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, we will talk about how the turf was produced when we come to the Turf Bill and we hope to have something to say then about the efficiency and the extravagance in connection with the production and distribution of turf over the last five or six years.  We may have something to say also about the Minister's estimate as to the rate at which he could produce turf in Clonsast at 10/6 a ton, and a few things like that.  However, I want the Minister to say now that county councils which, in response to the Department's request to meet an emergency situation, took every step that was necessary to produce the turf and went to the banks for heavy overdrafts and paid interest on them, will not be saddled, if this amendment becomes law, with meeting the total amount.  As to whether the turf was produced efficiently and not extravagantly, that did not lie altogether with the county council or even with the local officials.  The Minister may know that certain directions and instructions as to how the turf should be produced, saved and transported were imposed from Dublin on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;We must make certain that the financial conduct of the local authorities will be above criticism&rdquo; and &ldquo;We must see that they <Col N="870" /> budget in the same way to meet their obligations as the Minister for Finance does here in Dáil Éireann.&rdquo; That came very well from a member of the Front Bench opposite, and particularly well from an ex-Minister for Finance, as neither he nor his successors have produced a balanced Budget in the last 13 years.  We are told they must make sufficient provision when striking the rate, that there must be no heel-tapping; and we are told that on the very day that we have five Supplementary Estimates here on the Order Paper.  Of course, the Minister brushed that aside in his speech and said that, in extraordinary circumstances during the emergency, on one or two occasions it was necessary to come to the House for extra money.  I have some little knowledge of the work of local authorities and can say that, if anything, their financial conduct has been on a far higher plane than that of the people charged with the responsibility of looking after the finances in this House.</P>
    <P>As has been said here, it is better to call a spade a spade, and the fact of the matter is that this amendment removes the last and only power left to local authorities.  Deputies who are members of local authorities will recollect the appeal made by the present Minister for Local Government, before the last local elections, that the best people in the country should go forward for election, as he wanted the councils manned by the best men to be found. He went out of his way, at considerable trouble and expense, to prepare a special paper, which was circulated to every member and prospective member of a local authority, setting out clearly that they had powers and functions. Perhaps I am not putting it correctly when I say &ldquo;setting out clearly.&rdquo; He tried, through the medium of that White Paper, to convince them that they had powers and functions they did not know they had.  There are members of local authorities on both sides of the House, and we all know that up to now the only matter in which there was power at all worth talking about was in regard to what the Minister more than once described as the &ldquo;power and control of the purse.&rdquo; That is being <Col N="871" /> completely removed now.  When the Minister has reason to believe that a local authority is not striking a rate adequate to discharge its obligations, he can order the holding of an inquiry &mdash;and we know, of course, what the holding of an inquiry under the present Minister means.</P>
    <P>When the inquiry is held and the Minister is satisfied&mdash;and, mark you, there is nobody to be satisfied but the Minister, and we must presume that the findings of the inquiry will be dealt with in the same way as in connection with the Cork Street Committee&mdash;then the machinery is set going.  It was bad enough to have the powers filched from the local authorities and given to a manager to operate, a manager with whom they had some contact and with whom they could argue and reason on the spot; but the Minister is taking this power from the local authority, not to transfer it to a manager, but to keep it to himself.</P>
    <P>If his new section becomes law, in my opinion it will mark the end of local government and of local authorities in this country, because local authorities will cease to have any function.  It will be merely a waste of time for men who are seriously concerned with local government to attend meetings, and I am afraid you will have local authorities consisting only of people who want to use a meeting for the sole purpose of getting their names into the local papers.  They will have no power good, bad or indifferent, and it will mean the end of local government as we know it.  It will mean that you will have a council with no authority, and the manager completely under the thumb and at the mercy of the Department.</P>
    <P>Why talk, as the Minister talked recently, about democracy in this country?  It is the very negation of all democracy; it is sheer dictation&mdash;the Minister dictating to the local authority.  It is the Minister who will determine the rate in the future, not the local authority.  And the Minister can not only dictate the striking of the rate to the local authority&mdash;I am speaking about the local authority in the sense of the personnel of a county council or a borough council, as the <Col N="872" /> case may be&mdash;but he can dictate the making of the estimates which the manager should prepare.  If the manager, with his local knowledge, prepares the estimates and calculates the rate and submits it to the county council, and if the county council passes that rate or reduces it, the person who will finally decide whether or not that rate is sufficient is the Minister.</P>
    <P>I believe the amendment is introduced, not because the Minister has the slightest fear of local authorities refusing to carry out their normal obligations, the obligations which fall to be carried out by a local authority; the amendment is introduced with an eye to the future.  It means that the Government will expand their policy of shifting to the local authorities the financial responsibility for schemes introduced here, which should be financed out of national taxation.  There is no question about that.  Remember, those schemes will be foisted on the local authorities without their having any say in the matter.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister who will determine under the public health legislation what expenditure the local authorities shall have to undergo.  It is the Minister who will determine what they will have to provide under the terms of that legislation.  The Minister is taking good care in this amendment that they will not have any say in the matter, and that they cannot stop him merely by refusing to strike a rate to meet obligations which they conscientiously believe should not have been placed upon them.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I would be surprised if the Houses pass this amendment. I do not take the view exactly of Deputy O'Rourke or Deputy Allen that has been taken by other members of this House.  I think those Deputies are to be commended for having the courage to express their views and to give the Minister the warning which they gave, arising out of their long experience as members of local authorities. Those of us who are members of Parties recognise that there are certain obligations to Parties.  There are times when it is for a Deputy to decide whether a matter is of sufficient importance for him to put it before his Party. I look upon it as a healthy sign that <Col N="873" /> members of the Government Party should express their disapproval of the Minister's amendment, whether they vote for or against the amendment.  I would welcome it still more if other members of the Party opposite gave expression to the views which they honestly hold and which arise out of their long experience of the working of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Let it be quite clear that there is no use in the Minister talking inside or outside this House about local government if and when this amendment becomes law, because local government will no longer exist except in name; it will be only a sham and no person in this country interested in local or national government, with any shred of self-respect, would allow his name to go forward as a member of a local authority once this becomes law.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to think very seriously whether it is worth it.  He has got evidence, just the same as the Government and members of the House, that local authorities have never yet refused to face up to any responsibility placed upon them to provide whatever money was necessary, and the fact that every local authority to-day is operating a rate that is sufficient to produce a sum 46 per cent. in excess of the sum that had to be produced by the ratepayers before the present Government came into power ought to be ample proof of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I could, under certain circumstances, be sympathetic with the Minister's viewpoint in relation to this amendment because I suppose, in company with other members of the House, I have been anxious at all times to see the provision for social services and various benefits for the masses of the people on a much higher level than we now provide. But I can foresee, in the course of time, that in certain localities the local authorities may have objections to the imposition of a particular burden on the ratepayers.  I can, although it is somewhat doubtful at the moment, picture a situation when the Minister, and indeed the whole Fianna Fáil Administration, might be more progressive in their social outlook than a local authority.  It might be felt that <Col N="874" /> the local authority was not discharging its duties in relation to providing certain essential services and that power should be taken to see that the local authority would meet its obligations. The line of development that we see opening out under this amendment is, in my opinion, one that will not be helpful to the Government or to the Oireachtas in trying to bring into existence not only improved social services, but a new and more businesslike code of local government and a higher sense of responsibility on the part of those constituting the local authorities.</P>
      <P>What the Minister said during his contribution to the debate on the previous day is quite true&mdash;that this House is the supreme authority and that we, in our wisdom or lack of wisdom, at times impose by law certain obligations on local authorities in regard to services which we have decided are essential.  At the same time, we should realise that we have within our community two interlocking machines, if you like&mdash;one based on national representation and having its embodiment in this House, and the other on local representation, having its embodiment in the local authority. Unless we find ways and means of getting these two machines to work harmoniously together, it seems to me that the whole future which we are trying to envisage for the people will be somewhat difficult to realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have during recent months passed a number of important measures which will affect the whole sphere of local government.  We have brought into law the Mental Treatment Act, which many members said was a credit to the Ministry responsible for its introduction, and have opened up a new field and a new approach to this problem, but that Act will, of necessity, impose certain financial burdens on the ratepayers which will have to be considered and embodied in the form of rates by the local authorities.  We are about to approach the debate on the Public Health Bill, a Bill which, in its general tendency, is to be welcomed, but which again will possibly impose additional financial burdens on local ratepayers. Is it not clear that one of the most <Col N="875" /> essential factors in respect of both these pieces of legislation, and factors which are even more essential if we are to develop the whole field of social services, is that we should find a basis on which we can secure the co-operation and willing help of the local authorities?  Surely the approach shown in this amendment will not be helpful in producing that co-operative spirit.</P>
    <P>We have always taken the view that those who are taxed, either by way of State taxation or local rates, are entitled to representation and to control of the moneys they contribute, and it seems to me to be illogical to argue that, merely because we are the national Legislature and because we impose the State taxes, what we say should, in all spheres of social and communal activity, be overriding and should deny to local people any effective control or limitation of the moneys they have raised and their expenditure.  That is what we are setting down in this amendment.  Behind all the legal phrases, the position is as referred to by Deputy Morrissey, that the only safeguard which the local ratepayers and their representatives had under the managerial system, the power to hold the purse strings and to determine the rates is being taken away.  While we are apparently leaving them that power, in substance and in fact, we are taking it away from them.</P>
    <P>It may be argued by the Minister, as it has repeatedly been argued on questions of this kind which came before the House, that it is wrong of us always to impute evil intentions to the Minister, that we should take it for granted that when powers of this character are taken by the Government, the intention is to use them for good and not in any arbitrary fashion; but there is a situation developing already in which, whether the Minister or the Government likes it or not, there is a growing volume of opinion, especially in the sphere of local government, that those who wish to enter that sphere and to take up membership of local authorities will be entering a field which is very <Col N="876" /> largely circumscribed and limited by the powers which now lie to the hand of the Minister, or of the county or city manager, and, in the final resort, the powers in the hands of the commissioners who may be appointed by the Minister.  Because of that, I think it is not incorrect to say that many men and women with a deep interest in public affairs feel that it is to a large extent a waste of effort on their part to devote their time and attention to the welfare of the local community.</P>
    <P>Whether that is correct or not is not the important thing.  The important thing is whether that opinion does exist, and the very fact that various forms of friction have developed between local authorities and the Department is indicative of the fact that it does exist, and it seems to me that, at a time like this, when I consider it the main duty of the Ministry to secure the widest and most extended form of co-operation from local authorities, any effort the Minister might make towards codifying or improving the system of local government should be in the direction of getting rid of that state of mind which is prevalent in the country to-day, and of inducing in the minds of local authorities an understanding and an appreciation that not only is their co-operation desired but the exercise of their initiative and their responsibility for local affairs will be developed and strengthened as far as possible.  I cannot see that happening on the basis of this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that we have reached a point where, in so far as control of local rates is concerned, the final power is taken from local representatives. It may be argued by the Minister that his action is subject to the findings of a local inquiry.  It is scarcely necessary to go into the circumstances surrounding recent local inquiries.  The very fact that the local inquiry is conducted by an inspector of his own Department seems to me clearly to limit its effectiveness. Secondly, the whole force of the Department is available to the Minister, acting through that inquiry, to secure and maintain his point of view, if he has already decided on a point of view, in relation to the particular local rate <Col N="877" /> which is in question.  Against that, there is merely the ability of a group of local ratepayers constituting the local authority to express and maintain their case not only against the Minister and the inspector but against the whole machinery of the Department, which can be very effective.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances, I would not only extend to the Minister certain of the powers he seeks to take but would be even eager to give them to him, if it were a question of the Minister's taking power to maintain certain defined essential services and if limitations were imposed on the powers to be given.  I entirely agree with the Minister that if a local authority adopts an obstructionist attitude and will not provide a rate sufficient to give suitable sanitation, water supplies and house services, there should be power somewhere in the machinery of the State to protect the local inhabitants and to maintain such essential services; but there is a whole field of local expenditure in which there is room for differences of opinion between the Minister and the local authorities, between the national Legislature and the local authority, which is given expression to in many of the Acts we have passed here, in which certain powers are left to a local authority to decide whether or not they will provide a certain service.</P>
    <P>Even where mandatory powers are given to the Minister and obligations placed on the local authority to provide new or extended services, there is still the possibility of a difference of opinion as to the quality and quantity of these services.  They may be asked to provide, in relation to the Mental Treatment Act, certain local clinics, certain improved laboratory facilities for the treatment of mental disease, and there can be very definite and sincere differences of viewpoint.  But, regardless of how sincere or how justifiable the action of a local authority may be with regard to the sums they decide to allocate, we in this amendment are still asked to give an overriding authority to the Minister to enforce his interpretation on this issue.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to go beyond the bounds of reason.  It may be argued that it is necessary in order to ensure <Col N="878" /> the continuity of essential services.  I believe that if the Minister were to reconsider the amendment in the light of trying to keep alive and foster ordinary democratic opinion in this country, on the basis of democratic government, as well as the interest of local ratepayers in their system of local government, while, possibly, at the same time, retaining to himself certain final powers to be used in an emergency, so as to guarantee the continuance of certain defined essential services, subject, of course, to very definite limitations, there would be the possibility of getting an appreciation of his point of view.  Instead, we have the wide stretch of the Minister's hand which we find embodied in the amendment. That is a matter of very grave concern to those of us who are concerned, not merely in the efficient discharge of their duties by the members of local authorities, so far as the striking of the rate is concerned, the carrying out of their definite obligations, and the continuance of the general services provided for the community, but with the much bigger problem of trying to foster ordinary, democratic beliefs and opinions amongst the ratepayers, amongst local men and women of public standing who are interested in the community, and in the particular machine that we are operating in the various areas at the present time.</P>
    <P>In the criticism that Deputy O'Sullivan made in regard to the original draft of the Bill, so far as this section is concerned, he pointed to the possibility of a supplementary rate being struck, and indicated that the loose form of drafting employed in the section was open to very grave objection. We find that practically the same thing is being retained in the Minister's amendment.  There is still the possibility of having a supplementary rate struck.  I am a local ratepayer. Possibly I have not the same difficulty as is experienced by other ratepayers in meeting the demand for rates made on them, although I must say the present rate demand is a fairly high one.  In many cases, however, especially in the case of farmers, small business people and small tradesmen, the possibility of having a second demand for rates made on them in the <Col N="879" /> one year is going to create very great difficulty, especially if it comes unexpectedly on them.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as the Minister has said, that the striking of an insufficient rate and the consequent meeting of financial obligations in the current year by means of overdrafts is objectionable in many ways.  It very often imposes not only an additional burden on the ratepayers in the way of interest charges for that particular year, but burdens that have to be carried over a period of years.  Even so, we should have some regard for men in a small way of business or with a limited income.  Under the present system, when the rate demand is served on them they know the provision they will have to make during the current year to meet their rates.  If, under this amendment, there is the possibility that a second demand for rates may be made on them in the same year, well, that simply will add the straw to the camel's back, and may place them in very great difficulties indeed.  In the case of farmers, I can see that it might place them in a very difficult situation. In order to meet the second demand a small farmer may have to sell some of his stock or to dispose of certain of his produce at a time that does not suit him.  That would be due to the fact that this second demand was made on him at the wrong time of the year. While the position in regard to overdrafts is objectionable, it seems to me that it is the lesser of two evils.  The argument made by the Minister and his reference to the case of the Kerry County Council were not, in my opinion, of sufficient gravity to justify the possibility of the striking of a supplementary rate.</P>
    <P>There is one point in the Minister's amendment which struck me as being peculiar.  The amendment provides that, in a case where the Minister is not satisfied that a proper rate has been struck, he can order the holding of a local inquiry, and that on receiving the inspector's report, he can make an order requiring a new rate to be struck.  Under sub-section (4) of the amendment, if the new rate struck by the local authority is not, in the Minister's opinion, sufficient, he can <Col N="880" /> then remove the members of the rating authority from office.  In the early part of his argument, the Minister pointed out that he could not take action until he held a local inquiry.  He now holds it, and, acting on the inspector's report, makes an order requiring the local authority to strike a supplementary rate.  He then decides that the new rate is still insufficient, and so deciding he can remove the members of the rating authority from office without further inquiry.  It seems to me that that is opening the door too wide altogether. If there is going to be the possibility of a local authority refusing to strike a proper rate, some provision should be inserted in the amendment, if it is going to be passed by the Dáil, to ensure that the new rate to be struck will be indicated in the report of the inquiry, so that the Minister will be confined to that rate, and not be in a position to put forward a fictitious figure on which he may remove the members of the local authority from office.  Otherwise, he can create an entirely different situation from that envisaged under sub-section (1) where he is required to hold a local inquiry before taking action.</P>
    <P>I opened my contribution to the debate in an attitude in which I was fairly sympathetic to the Minister's viewpoint as a whole.  In concluding, I want to urge this point on him: that if we are to try to bring about improvements in our social and local services it is essential that we should try to find means of retaining, not merely the co-operation and sympathy of the members of local authorities, but their willing acceptance of any new burdens that we impose upon them.  There are, of course, certain essential services that cannot be allowed to go by default, but there is still, as between the Minister and the local authorities and between this Assembly and the local authorities as representing the ratepayers, a wide financial field of local government within which we should provide for the possibility of members of local authorities being able to exercise their rights, of ensuring the continuance and maintenance of essential services, and of seeing that they are not allowed <Col N="881" /> to go by default.  Unless we leave some power in the hands of local authorities and realise, as the Minister himself pointed out on a previous occasion in the course of debate, in a public statement outside the House, and by means of special circular, that the final financial control is in the hands of the local representatives of the ratepayers, then I am afraid that the structure of our new local government in this country as well as the future of our social services, are going to be very shaky and very inefficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>For some 21 years I have been a member of local bodies.  I am a member of one of the very few boards of assistance that have been left in this country.  In view of the new social services which are introduced from time to time, I cannot see how a local authority will be able to estimate the exact rate that it should strike.  The Minister's own Department is not able to do it.  In the case of some of the new social services it was not able to give an estimate of what the cost would be, though I must admit that in the past few years there has been an improvement in that respect.  I admit quite frankly that, owing to my attitude at practically every second meeting of the board of assistance of which I am a member, especially during the past few years, I was in danger of coming under this particular amendment and I suppose I have been nearly the cause of the amendment being brought forward.  As a member of this House, I did not object to a number of new services introduced and passed here.  No member of the House objected to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the managerial system and while I admit that certain things happened from time to time which made it practically obligatory on the Minister to bring in that system, still I insist at least on the rights of the representatives of the ratepayers to have this voice, that they shall say how much their people are going to pay.  I insist on their right to be a determining factor to the extent of saying how much their people will pay.  In the manner in which the Minister's Department are carrying <Col N="882" /> out their work, I am not prepared to make any further contribution towards that body.  I have steered near the wind, as near the wind as anyone could go in endeavouring to do my duty by the ratepayers and avoid the danger of having the local authority of which I was a member wiped out.  Only a month ago I had to refuse to strike a rate for a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis patients in Cork county and city.  Why?  Because this sanatorium is situated 28 miles from Cork and the Minister refused the right of the elected representatives of the people to visit that sanatorium and to see what was going on there.  The visiting committee were allowed to go there, but I maintain the right of any elected representative of the ratepayers of any county at least to go and see where the money is being spent and the manner in which it is being spent.  I had to adjourn the meeting for a fortnight.  The meeting was adjourned to the 23rd January.  On the 22nd January a telephone message was received from the Minister's Department saying he was now prepared to pay the expenses of the board in going to the sanatorium.  This is the kind of thing one gets.</P>
    <P>We are at present faced with a series of what may be called new services.  I shall quote figures from the South Cork Board of Assistance:&mdash;Turf for home assistance recipients, £3,750; emergency cash supplementary allowances, £2,772; footwear scheme, £1,890; employment period orders, £547.  All these things are clamped down one after another.  I said at the commencement that I might be the innocent cause of this amendment.  It was decided here that an extra supplemental allowance of 2/6 would be given to old age pensioners, blind pensioners, dependent children of blind pensioners, recipients of disablement benefit, and dependent children of recipients of disablement benefit.  This House decided that 75 per cent. of the cost of this scheme would be borne by the State, 25 per cent. by the local authority, the local authority home assistance officers to investigate all cases.  The Minister's Department cannot say how much the schemes will <Col N="883" /> cost and do not know how much the schemes will cost.  They have not the slightest idea, but they expect the local authority to know it.  I quote portion of a letter issued by the Department to the local authority:&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;...The scheme will take effect from 1st April next, and the public assistance authority will be recouped by the Exchequer to the extent of 75 per cent. of the expenditure incurred. The total recoupment to the public assistance authority in the financial year ending 31st March, 1945, will not exceed £8,317.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Evidently the Local Government Department went very exactly into the figures when they brought it down to the odd £17.</P>
    <P>What happened?  That letter was issued to the South Cork Board of Assistance.  Their home assistance officers had to go and investigate the cases of all applicants.  In April, 1945, there were 360 persons whom the home assistance officers had returned, after full investigation of their cases, as being entitled to this money but they could not get it because the Local Government Department did not know how many cases there would be.  We found on investigation that there were 360 cases.  In April, 1945, we received another letter from the Department of Local Government saying: &ldquo;The maximum grant allocated on these conditions to the South Cork public assistance authority in respect of the year ending 31st March, 1946, is £8,317.&rdquo; We found it quite impossible to keep within that estimate and we raised the matter time after time with the Local Government Department.  We could get nowhere. We were told that it was to be allocated on the terms of the Department's letter.  I asked the county manager what he was going to do in connection with these 360 cases and he had to tell me, &ldquo;They are old people&rdquo;. I asked him, &ldquo;What am I to infer from that?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;They are old people and naturally will die off.&rdquo; That is, Jack should wait until Michael should <Col N="884" /> die.  The old age pensioners of the county should queue up and Jack would have to wait until Michael died to get his 2/6.  I do not think that this House, when it was voting that money, intended that such considerations should arise.  I raised the matter here on the Vote for the Department of Local Government, when we could get no satisfaction from the Department. The Minister&mdash;columns 1205 and 1206, Dáil Debates, 29th May, 1945&mdash;said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to subhead J (5)&mdash; Grants towards the provision of supplemental allowances to certain old age pensioners and to certain blind pensioners&mdash;the position is that we are prepared to pay 75 per cent. of the total amount expended by Cork on the provision of those supplemental allowances, but we do say that the obligation rests on the Cork local authority to satisfy itself, before it grants a supplemental allowance, that the family circumstances justify the payment of that allowance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is fair enough.  We immediately went to the South Cork Board of Public Assistance and we raised a supplementary amount of £1,700 to meet that, and applied to the Minister's Department for £1,300,75 per cent. of what was owing to us.  This statement of the Minister abrogates the statement of his Department of May 16th, 1944, and April 14th, 1945.  The Minister's statement was made in this House on May 29th, 1945.  Our application to the Minister's Department for the 75 per cent. allowance met a definite refusal.  I have all the letters from the Department in connection with the matter here, but I am not going to inflict them on the House now.</P>

      <P>I am explaining that the result is the innocent cause of this amendment.  The following is an extract from the minutes:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Letter from the Department of Local Government, dated 19th September, 1945:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" />&ldquo;Referring to letter of 10th August, forwarding a resolution of the board on the subject of additional expenditure in connection with the supplementary cash allowances, and referring to the first paragraph of the Department's letter of the 30th August, which dealt fully with this matter.  As stated therein, the grant is a definite sum applicable to the whole country.  Its apportionment must necessarily be made on a fixed basis at the commencement of each financial year, and the amounts allocated to each area cannot be varied during the year.</P>
    <P>Note: In reply to Mr. Corry the manager stated that expenditure in excess of the grant plus the board's contribution is at present being incurred. No money is being expended unnecessarily.  Each case is thoroughly investigated by the superintendent assistance officers.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry moved that the extract from the official printed record of the Dáil proceedings (Vote 41, columns 1205 and 1206, 29th May, 1945) containing Mr. MacEntee's statement to the effect that 75 per cent. of all moneys paid by a local authority under this scheme would be recouped to that authority, be cut out and forwarded to Mr. MacEntee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the position in September. We wrote again in October and got no answer.  The estimate came before the local authority for consideration in January.  What did I find then?  I found that the county manager had not taken credit for £1,300 that was to come from the Department.  The county estimate was £13,300 odd for expenses in 1946-47 under this head, but instead of taking credit for 75 per cent. of £13,300, it was for £11,000, leaving us to pay the balance.  The law as settled in this House was that the State was to pay 75 per cent. of the money, and the local authority was to be responsible for the investigation.  It was only when it was wrenched out by questions in this House a fortnight ago that we succeeded in getting a statement from the Minister that the money would be recouped.</P>

It took from May 29th last until February 2nd to do that.

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of the board of assistance, I insisted on reducing the estimate by £1,300, owed us since last year, and £1,700, balance of 75 per cent. of £13,800.  The Minister knows the position I would be in under this new section, and also that of the board of assistance.  The trouble is that this is one of the few boards in the Twentysix Counties that has any anxiety as to the manner in which this matter is administered.  We are faced with all these new social services, costing £8,000 odd last year.  It is practically impossible when you come to administer a new Act to find out the exact sum you have to pay to cover the expenditure. You do not know how many applications there will be.  The Local Government Department in its wisdom was able to fix the amount at £8,317.  That meant that the home assistance official had to go along, as in the case of a sick man, to turn over an applicant three or four times to see whether he was 1/- or 1d. better off than his neighbour.  That was the position of the local assistance officer.  It is an unfair position to leave him in, and it is not carrying out the wishes of this House in regard to our treatment of the poor.  The Minister would be quite entitled under this new section, when we took credit for the amount due by the Department to the South Cork Board of Public Assistance, to come along and say that there would be a new local inquiry.  We know the result <Col N="887" /> of a local inquiry.  I remember telling that to Deputies on the opposite benches when they were going to have a commission on agriculture, and they dropped it. I told them what was going to happen.  A board of inquiry is the same.</P>
      <P>I have a decided objection to this kind of bureaucratic control.  It went so far that they refused to honour the Minister's word here.  They refused to allow the elected representatives of the people to visit an institution on which £15,000 of the ratepayers' money was being spent.  Yesterday, I had to stay at home for a meeting of the sanatorium committee and I landed in here at 6 o'clock this morning to be present for this debate.  The bureaucratic control, as is shown in the minutes of the Department, refused to allow the elected representatives of the people their expenses for going to that meeting. The Minister could say that the members had not carried out their duty, that they had refused to strike the rate necessary to maintain the sanatorium and he could have a court of inquiry held and wipe them out. There would be nothing to stop the Minister from doing that under this proposal.  I ask the Minister to take it back and reconsider it very carefully in view of the information he has gathered here in connection with the kind of control that is sought. This is bureaucracy gone mad. It comes to this&mdash;that officials of the Minister's Department are to ride roughshod over the elected representatives of the people.  I consider it gross impertinence for civil servants or anybody else to come along and tell elected representatives that they are not to visit a sanatorium in which their tuberculosis patients are being treated and for which the people who elected them pay rates.</P>

Under this amendment, the body of which I happened on that date to be chairman could be wiped out of existence.  Our action in insisting on the rights of the elected representatives of the people to visit that institution could have been used as a means to wipe us out of existence.  The position is the same in connection with our refusal to strike the full rate for supplemental allowances&mdash;our refusal to pay not only our own share, which we were paying, but the Minister's share which he was refusing to pay.  That could have been used to wipe us out of existence.  These are the things which I object to in connection with the amendment by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The genesis of this section is to be found in Emergency Powers Order, 321.  This section, with certain safeguards for the local authority, is designed to enable the local authority to do what it was empowered to do under that Emergency Order.  That is to say, where a rate insufficient to maintain essential public services had been struck, the local authority could, under the Order, mend its hand and make adequate provision for the maintenance of those services during the year ahead.  That is what Section 23 proposes to continue.  It gives the local authority an additional power&mdash;a power to mend its hand where it has taken ill-judged and misguided action.  Notwithstanding Deputy Corry's long account to the House of the tribulations he has endured under the bureaucracy of the Custom House, for which I am, of course, responsible, I can assure Deputies that Deputy Corry and his <Col N="889" /> and had nothing to do with the origin of this amendment.  The Deputy is under a misapprehension as to what might have happened to him or his authority if this amendment had been in operation.  I understand that the Deputy is chairman of a tuberculosis committee or a sanatorium committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in certain circumstances. The board of assistance, of which Deputy Corry is chairman, refused to make a demand on the county council for the maintenance of a sanatorium under its control and for which it was responsible because some person in. the Custom House would not allow payment of the expenses incurred by each and every member of that board of assistance when he chose to visit the sanatorium.  That is why this board of assistance, charged with reponsibility for, perhaps, hundreds of patients suffering from tuberculosis, refused to make a demand on the county council.  As the board of assistance is not a rating authority, that is how the matter must have arisen. The board of assistance has the responsibility imposed upon it of making an estimate and making a demand on the Cork County Council.  Let us assume that this demand is properly and legitimately made on Cork County Council.  If the county council, being bound to pay to the board of assistance the moneys necessary to enable the board to function properly, refuses to do so, what is to be the position? Are we to allow the sanatorium to close down?  Deputy Corry might have addressed himself to that aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>Even under this amendment, is there not a statutory obligation on the county council to supply the demands of the various subsidiary bodies and cannot they <Col N="890" /> compel them so do even without the aid of this amendment?</P>

      <P>There is, undoubtedly, a statutory obligation on the county council to meet the demands of those bodies, but suppose Cork County Council refuses to fulfil its statutory obligation.</P>
      <P>That is the problem and the possibility that this section is designed to deal with.  Supposing it does, what is going to happen?  Is the Cork Board of Assistance going to proceed by way of mandamus and compel the county council to raise the money?  If the Cork County Council has not struck a rate, how is it going to raise the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork County Council has not done so but there are other local authorities in this country who have and the purpose of this new section is to enable the position created by that refusal to be clarified and rectified, to enable public services to be maintained and to ensure that the expenses of maintaining these public services will be provided in the year in which they fall due and not be passed on to the shoulders of the ratepayers in the following year or raised by way of loan, which would impose an increased burden upon the ratepayers of that particular area.  That is the sole purpose of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many red herrings &mdash;&mdash;it is a hackneyed phrase but I think it is as good as any&mdash;dragged across the debate.  One Deputy who spoke with some consciousness of what the exact position is was Deputy Bennett.  He spoke against the amendment but he gave his case away when he reminded the House that the Minister has already power to dissolve a local authority after inquiry.  That is not a power which was first given to the Minister for Local Government by the Fianna Fáil Administration That is a power which was conferred on the Minister for Local Government in the Local Government Act of 1923, continued in the Local Government Act of 1925 and confirmed in the Local Government Act of 1941, so that the Minister for Local Government has <Col N="891" /> already the power of dissolution.  Therefore we are not, so far as local authorities are concerned, taking powers for the first time to abolish them.  Let that be quite clear.  Deputy Dillon, I think, had some comprehension of that fact but thinking that other members of the House, particularly members of local authorities, must be at least as well-informed, in regard to the law as Deputy Dillon had shown himself to be, the Deputy proceeded to drag a red herring across the trail. He asked : &ldquo;If this section is passed, cannot the Minister start proceedings for mandamus?&rdquo; as if one of the purposes of this new section was to confer the power of moving for a writ of mandamus upon the Minister for Local Government for the first time.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister for Local Government can always proceed by way of mandamus against a local authority which refuses to strike a rate.  In fact, the Minister for Local Government did proceed against the Dublin County Council and secured a writ against them for refusing to strike a rate.  It is quite true that the members of the council who had voted against the striking of the rate were mulcted in the costs of those mandamus proceedings, very heavily mulcted.  But, so far from this proposed new section making it easy for the Minister to secure a writ of mandamus, it would, I believe, on the contrary make it more difficult and would safeguard men who might be stampeded or coerced into taking up an unjustifiable attitude against finding themselves burdened with heavy costs because if the Minister were to move for such a writ, the courts naturally would have to take cognisance of this section.</P>
    <P>They would see that the Minister had a certain other course open to him under which he had power to dissolve a county council and see that an adequate rate was struck.  So far as Deputy Dillon's argument is concerned, the fact of the matter is that this section in the form in which it is drafted would make it more difficult for the Minister to get a mandamus and to that extent it is a protection and a safeguard for innocent, if you <Col N="892" /> like misguided, members of local authorities who might otherwise be coerced, as some were coerced in the past, to take up an untenable attitude in regard to the duty of providing the finances necessary to maintain public-services. I hope that is an end of the cobwebby fantasy for which Deputy Dillon made himself responsible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked: &ldquo;What is the need for this power; have not the local authorities in general carried out the duties imposed upon them by law? &rdquo; Certainly, they have, but if, in general, they had not done so they would not be there.  The State would have to find some other machinery for administering the local services if local authorities, as at present constituted, did not in general do their duty.  But they have not always, at least all of them have not, invariably done their duty.  Over a considerable number of years, one or other local authority has had to be dissolved from time to time and the very fact that the Minister of the day had to take that action is an indication that on occasion it is necessary to arm the Minister with the powers which the law has already conferred upon him in respect to local authorities which refuse to discharge the responsibilities for which they were constituted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked : have not the local authorities, during the emergency, done their duty?  The answer to that is, in general, yes, but in two cases, no. The House is aware of the fact that the Roscommon County Council and the Kerry County Council were both dissolved during the critical years of the emergency.  I shall refer, perhaps, to the circumstances later, but at any rate, we have this fact : that local authorities, pursuing an independent policy&mdash;a policy of their own, a policy in conflict with the national policy&mdash;have chosen to ignore their responsibilities and their statutory duties and to refuse to carry them out on at least two occasions, even during the emergency.  Deputy Morrissey then went on to outline what I believe is the main motive behind the principal opposition to this Bill.  He referred to the fact that it is possible that the development of the social services&mdash;social services for <Col N="893" /> which members of the main Opposition Party, members of the Labour Party and members of the Clann na Talmhan Party are always clamouring &mdash;may in future impose heavier burdens upon the local authorities.</P>
    <P>These are the very Parties which voted for a motion the other night in this House to provide for a grandiose system of social services which they call social security, and now the members of these Parties are refusing to face the financial obligations which this would impose on local authorities.  Deputy Morrissey even said that the local authorities will refuse to meet the charges imposed on them for the extension of the social services.  Well, if so, if there are additional charges imposed on the local authorities, by whom are these additional charges going to be imposed?  They are not going to be imposed at the arbitary will of the Minister for Local Government. They are not going to be imposed by the arbitrary authority of any individual in this State.  If these additional charges are going to be imposed, they will be imposed by a statute of the Oireachtas.  So that what is quite clear from Deputy Morrissey's speech is that what the Fine Gael Opposition want to do in regard to this is to give to the local authorities power to disobey the law of the State, power to defy, if you like, the will of the Oireachtas, power, by refusing an adequate rate to maintain the public services at a reasonable standard of efficiency, to reduce those local services to chaos, and power to create a state of anarchy in the local administration and, perhaps, to bring the country to the verge of civil war.</P>
    <P>Now, there is nothing new in this attitude of the main Opposition.  They tried to do that in 1934 and 1935, when they persuaded the local authorities to refuse to strike rates or to collect rates, or got them to strike insufficient rates. They were beaten in that campaign, and they were beaten mainly because the recalcitrant authorities were dissolved. That was how they were beaten.  That is how the rates were collected in Kilkenny, in Laoighis, in Tipperary, in Waterford, and in Westmeath. And they were not dissolved. let me remind the House again, under <Col N="894" /> the provisions of Section 23; they were dissolved under the provisions of the Act of 1925.  So that experience has shown that whatever may have been said here in this debate as to how the local authorities in general have discharged their responsibilities&mdash;and I am not saying anything to the contrary &mdash;the fact remains that we have it on record that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health found it necessary to dissolve the county council of Tipperary, South Riding, on the 21st February, 1934; the Kilkenny County Council on 2nd June of that year; the Laoighis County Council on 5th June of that year; the Waterford County Council on the 6th June of that year, and the Westmeath County Council on the 7th June of that year; and I found it necessary to dissolve the Roscommon County Council on the 2nd June, 1944, and the Kerry County Council on the 6th May, 1945. &mdash;two councils dissolved at the very height of the emergency, when the war was coming to a crisis.</P>
    <P>These county councils refused to strike the rate necessary to maintain the roads in a proper condition, roads which might have been essential to the defence of this country.  I did not dissolve the Roscommon County Council lightly, nor the Kerry County Council. So far from acting hastily in that matter, I tried to persuade and induce the Kerry County Council on two occasions to make proper provisions for maintaining their roads, because the roads of that county, in certain circumstances, might have been vital to the security of this State, but they refused to do that.  Deputy Larkin has asked me : Have not the local authorities acted with a sense of responsibility? I am perfectly certain that Deputy Larkin would not suggest for a moment that the Kerry County Council, when it refused to strike an adequate rate for the maintenance of those roads, not in one year, but in successive years, had any proper sense of responsibility; and certainly, when, as a result of their action, hundreds and thousands of road workers were thrown out of employment in 1944 and 1945, they showed very little sense of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Now, there has been, running through the whole course of this debate, <Col N="895" /> a suggestion that there is something inconsistent with the doctrine of financial control that the provisions of this section are in some way incompatible or inconsistent with the power of financial control which the council exercises. Now, let me make this clear : no local authority, and not even the Dáil itself, I would suggest, has the right to exercise the power of the purse in an irrational and arbitrary way.  Local authorities, like every other social organisation or social entity, are bound to discharge the purposes for which they have been instituted, and bound to function according to law.  I pointed out that these local authorities were not established as so many independent legislatures with independent taxing powers.  They have been established to discharge functions which have been delegated to them by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It would be quite possible, if we decided to do it and if it were thought to be feasible, to centralise the administration of local services in Dublin, to appoint every officer from Dublin, and to abolish local authorities altogether. I think it would be very wrong to do that, but it has been done elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, on the contrary. It has been done elsewhere.  There was a system of prefectures in France.  We have other alternative systems to the system of local government which exists here.  I believe very strongly in the maintenance of the present system. But it will be only possible to maintain it so long as Deputies speak with a sense of responsibility and make it quite clear that these local authorities are set up to discharge responsibilities and that they are not entitled to exercise, as I have said, in an arbitrary and irresponsible way the taxing powers which have been conferred upon them by this House.  The main reason why local authorities have been given the power of raising revenues by means of the rates is to ensure that the local services will be maintained, and the House, which has imposed upon the local authorities the duty and the responsibility of maintaining these local services, has also imposed on these <Col N="896" /> local authorities the duty of maintaining these local services at a reasonable standard of efficiency.  The law does not contemplate that the discharge of these responsibilities will be a nominal compliance only with the law.  Not merely must there be an acceptance of these responsibilities by the local authority in name, but there must be an efficient discharge of these responsibilities by the local authority in fact. All that we are asking here is that where a local authority fails to maintain the local services at a reasonable standard, or fails to pay to any other body any sums which a rating authority is bound to supply to that body, the Minister will be given the power, not to abolish that authority&mdash; he has that already; perhaps Deputy Morrissey might not be aware of that fact; he has that already under the Acts dating back to 1923&mdash;but power to direct them to comply, and power if he has to abolish them&mdash;not powers already possessed by him and not powers derived from this section&mdash;to ensure that their successor who will have to administer these local services will be able to raise the revenue necessary to maintain them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I devoted quite a time at the beginning to emphasising to the House the point which has already been made by Deputy Bennett, that the Minister, whoever he may be, has already power to dissolve a local authority if he is satisfied that that local authority is not discharging its functions properly. This proposed new section does three things.  It does not give power to the Minister to dissolve, because that is not necessary; the Minister already has that power.  But it gives the Minister power to afford to the local authority a chance to mend its hand, something which he had not the power to do until this Emergency Powers Order was made.  Secondly, it gives to the successor to that local authority, to the person appointed to administer the affairs of that local authority, if the members of it should be removed from office, power to provide himself with the funds in the ordinary normal way by a rate.  Thirdly, it does this, and this touches the point made by Deputy Larkin.  Deputy Larkin, quite justly and rightly, stated that the members <Col N="897" /> of a local authority might refuse to strike the rate which would be demanded by the estimates presented to them by their officers because they might not be satisfied that the money was being properly expended.  I have in this amendment a provision for the holding of a local inquiry upon a narrow issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a narrow issue as to whether the rate proposed to be struck by the local authority is sufficient or not.  What would be the issue in that instance?  Would not the issue be as to whether the rate which the local authority had struck would be sufficient to maintain these services at a reasonable standard of efficiency if the money is properly administered? Would not the real issue to be tried, therefore, be as to whether the officers of the local authority, who had been responsible for preparing the estimates upon which the rate was to be based had, in fact, prepared proper estimates; and as to whether, if the rate which the local authority proposed to strike was insufficient, it would not be sufficient if the local services were efficiently administered and operated? Is not that the issue which would be raised at this local inquiry?  Is not that the very point which Deputy Larkin made, the very point which this local inquiry is designed to meet, that it was quite possible that members of a local authority might refuse to strike the rate, not because they were unwilling to maintain the local services but because they felt that they were not getting value for their money?  Is not that the very issue that would be tried?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, this section, so far from conferring arbitrary powers upon the Minister and powers which he has not already, is designed to safeguard the local authority in two ways and the ratepayers in all three ways, because it is in fact the ratepayers, the general body of the people, who are concerned <Col N="898" /> in seeing that the local public services are maintained at a proper standard of efficiency.  It would, first of all, as I have said, and as I want to repeat, empower the Minister to afford to the local authority a chance to mend its hand.  Secondly, it affords to that local authority, if it feels that the services which it has to finance are not being properly administered or efficiently discharged, an opportunity to make that case and to prove it at a local inquiry.  Thirdly, in the event of its being necessary for the Minister to dissolve the local authority because it will not avail of the opportunity to mend its hand, it ensures to the ratepayers that, within a very short period after the due date upon which the rates should be made, the successor to the local authority will make proper provision for financing the services of the year and that they will not be faced in a subsequent year with a burden which would be excessive and which might, in fact, be unbearable.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows&mdash;and especially any Kerry man&mdash;what has been the consequence of the failure of the old Kerry County Council to make proper provision for maintaining the roads of the county.  When rates in other counties were going down, the rates in Kerry had to be very seriously increased. When the rates in County Dublin were being drastically reduced, the rates in Kerry had to be raised. Why?  Because in one year, in 1945-46, it will be necessary for the commissioner administering the affairs of the Kerry County Council to make good out of rates the deficiencies which accrued under the county council which was abolished.  That is a very undesirable thing.  I am not going to conceal from the House that the rates are high; they are high, perhaps, more in appearance than in reality, on account of the obsolete valuation upon which they are levied.  They are high enough, anyhow, and when they are high, surely the only way in which the ratepayers can carry on is to see that every year bears its due share and that the council will not, by striking a grossly insufficient and inadequate rate in one year, impose an impossible <Col N="899" /> burden upon the ratepayers in succeeding years.</P>
    <P>That is what this amendment is designed to avoid.  It simply ensures that, either the local authority in that year mends its hand, or, if it does not do so, and then its successor or whoever may be administering its affairs will have the opportunity, after the local inquiry has been held&mdash;and that inquiry will be held very expeditiously in a case like that&mdash;and within three or four weeks after the due date on which the rate should be made, to strike a rate sufficient to maintain the services of the county.  There is the whole purpose of this section.  There is nothing new in it.  It does not give the Minister any fresh power of abolition.</P>

      <P>No. The amendment was designed to ensure that the local inquiry would be concerned with this one question as to the sufficiency of the rate, that all questions as to the efficiency of the public services under the jurisdiction of the local authority could be thrashed out.  There is nothing new in this, there is no additional power of abolition given under this amendment. What is new in it is the safeguard which it affords to the ratepayers and to those members of the local authorities who do not wish to be abolished but would prefer to remain in control of the general administration of the county.</P>

      <P>The less the Minister says about Europe or Russia&mdash;whether it is Russia in Europe or in Asia&mdash;the better for himself.  We are dealing at the moment, not with Russia or Europe, but with this little bit of the world in which we are interested.  Even after 20 years, I find it hard to understand the Minister.  He is always a bit of a child : sometimes he is playful like child, sometimes he is petulant like a child, sometimes he is a wee bit impish and occasionally, though not this afternoon, a little like an ill-mannered child. To-night he covers up reason with playacting. He wants this House to accept that the man sitting in the Custom House is more concerned with the welfare of the ratepayer, has more regard for the wishes of the ratepayers and is closer to the way in which the ratepayers think than the man who is one of themselves and elected out of the heart of their own parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know of what the Minister is afraid.  Why is this amendment brought in?  The Minister said a local authority is elected to carry out the law, to raise sufficient money to meet its obligations.  I said here earlier to-night that they have done that and done it very well.  I said also that there is no local authority to-day which has not struck a rate sufficient to meet its obligations, though that rate is calling for 46 per cent. more from the ratepayers' pockets than when the Minister and his colleagues came into power.  Although it is 46 per cent. more, the rate was struck and is being paid.  Of course, the Minister said the <Col N="901" /> increase was not a real increase, as it was based upon an obsolete valuation. That is the next thing we are to have. We had the Valuation Bill here on the agenda for a long time and it is still not very far from the Minister's mind. He talked about valuations in the Mansion House as well as about the counties.  He says now that he has all the powers he wants to deal with a local authority, that he can dissolve it, that he is not taking any fresh power under this section.  He is, of course.</P>

      <P>The Minister is taking power to remove them from office, under this amendment.  I think the Minister said he was not.  The fact of the matter is that this amendment is brought in to deal, not with the present situation but with a situation which only the Minister knows is going to arise. It is brought in, not because he is afraid that any local authority will refuse to meet its normal obligations and carry out the work for which it was established, but because the Minister knows he is going to place on local authorities, within the next year or so, burdens which it was never intended they should carry.  The Minister knows that he is going to refuse to meet the promise that was made in this House, to compensate local authorities for the tens of thousands of pounds they have lost in supplying the turf of this country for the last five years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister is talking about.  I am a lot longer in the House than the Minister, and I have survived more general elections than the Minister, notwithstanding the best efforts of the Minister directed against me, even in my own constituency and even when he was in better form than he is nowadays. Of course, he is getting a bit mellow. There is one thing I know.  Whatever else the Minister has been able to master since he entered this House, he has never yet been able to understand the first thing about a point of order.  There is no man in the House who has less of a grip on relevancy or order than the Minister.</P>
      <P>However, that is all beside the point. We are coming back to this amendment, and the fact of the matter is&mdash; and there are Deputies on the opposite side who know this as well as I do&mdash; that the Minister went to a great deal of trouble, before the last local elections were held, to show us that there was important work to be done by the people who would come forward and be elected on local authorities&mdash;very important work&mdash;and, in order to secure the best types of men, it was set out that they would have a great many more powers than was commonly thought under the County Management Act, and the power the Minister particularly emphasised that they would have was the power of the purse.  No matter what the Minister may say, this amendment removes that completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard all the Minister's nonsensical talk about the inquiry.  The inquiry is all nonsense.  It will be held only if the Minister has reason to believe certain things.  He then directs the holding of a local inquiry.  He talks about members of local authorities being able to attend before the local inquiry and prove that they are right. How can they prove it and before <Col N="903" /> whom, and how are they to know whether they have proved it or not, because they will not be allowed to listen to the judgment?  They will not know if the inspector has reported to the Minister whether they have proved their case or not.  It is all nonsense.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this amendment seeks only to ensure that local authorities will carry out their functions with reasonable efficiency.  If that is all that is meant, then there is no necessity for the amendment.  Local authorities have shown&mdash;and we have no evidence to the contrary, no evidence that they have any desire other than to continue doing that&mdash;that they are prepared to carry out all the obligations which as local authorities they are supposed to carry out.  You can take it the Minister wants this amendment because it is his intention to put on the shoulders of local authorities financial burdens which they were never meant to carry.  That is the real reason, and if Deputies do not know that to-night they will know it before this night 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Some men have ambition to amass wealth and others have ambition to wield power.  I think the world has witnessed the result of the latter ambition; the debacle and destruction and desolation that occurred in Europe and elsewhere throughout the world within recent years give ample proof of what it has meant. I felt that when the Minister listened to the advice of his own supporters, men whose opinions he might value, men who have had years of experience on local bodies, men who are capable of forming sound opinions as a result of their years of experience, he would have stopped to consider; but the Minister was not to be deterred from his ambition.  He wants to wield, in the Custom House, the power of a Stalin or a Hitler.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the heat and vigour and determination of the Minister to-night, I could quite understand that he will try to force the Fianna Fáil Party to walk behind him in the Division Lobby and give him the power to dictate to this country.  I wonder what has become of the definition of democracy&mdash;government <Col N="904" /> of the people, by the people, for the people?  Local government in this country from this onwards, once this Bill is passed, will be given to the people by the Minister for Local Government, Deputy MacEntee, sitting in the Custom House in Dublin, and it does not matter two damns whether the people are able to pay for the services which he says they must have. He will not worry about the capacity of the people to pay or the matters that the local authority, drawn from the ranks of the people, would be concerned with&mdash;to supply a local service within the capacity of the people financially.</P>
    <P>The Minister has evaded the question put to him by nearly every Deputy who spoke to this amendment.  All are anxious to know what is the need for this specific power.  The Minister suggested that already he has the power of dissolution and he dissolved the Kerry and Roscommon councils.  If that is so, what is the necessity for the power set out in this amendment? When Deputy Dillon was developing a point that the Minister had power to institute mandamus proceedings under sub-section (2), the Minister observed &ldquo;Fantastic&rdquo;, but surely anyone reading sub-section (2) of the amendment will realise that there is specific power with regard to a writ of mandamus.  If the local authority does not provide the rate that, in the opinion of the Minister, is necessary, he will instruct that they shall comply with the requirements. If they do not, they will be deemed to fail in their duty.  The Minister can proceed by writ of mandamus and he can eventually mulct the unfortunate individual who believes in his heart that he is serving the people to the best of his ability by trying to hold the balance between the people who are entitled to the service and those who have to foot the bill for the service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an alternative in that, after a sham local inquiry, he can abolish the local authority.  The Minister told us that it would be quite possible to have the local services centralised in Dublin.  What will we have : We will have the Minister with that power and his creature, the county <Col N="905" /> manager, because he is a creature of the Minister and he will carry out the dictates of the Minister at all times. When this is passed we will have local government centralised in the Custom House, under the authority of one individual who will dictate to the Twenty-Six Counties.  Deputy Corry suggested it was a civil servant who was responsible for this.  It is the Minister for Local Government, and the Minister admitted that it was his responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister and other Deputies here ought to realise that if we are to preserve democratic institutions in this country, if the electors elect a county council and if that county council does not give efficient service to the people, well then let the people suffer for the short period that that council is in power&mdash;at the very most, they cannot be there for more than three years&mdash;and give the people an opportunity of mending their hand at the next local election.  This is not democracy; it is not government by the people; and it shows no respect whatever for the wishes of the people.  The sooner we get away from this sort of thing, the better.  The Minister talked about the evil consequences which might result from the failure of a local authority to fulfil its obligations, but is it not this sort of thing which has given rise to war and to civil war How long will any people of spirit permit one man to dictate what they should do, what they should have and what they should pay?</P>
    <P>The Minister puts this forward as a substitute for Section 23 of the Bill, but, bad as that section is, it is infinitely better than this amendment. The reason for our objection to the section and to the whole system which the section brings about is the provision for a supplementary estimate, which simply means that a manager can say, in relation to an estimate which he brings in : &ldquo;It may or may not do, but we can mend our hand at any time during the year.  I can go to the local authority for a supplementary estimate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Over and over again the Minister, in his defence of the managerial system, stressed the point that the local authority had the power of the purse.  A <Col N="906" /> local authority under this amendment will no longer have the power of the purse.  The Minister will have the power of the purse and will have power to force local authorities to strike a rate which is, in his opinion, a just rate.  Because of the mandamus power in sub-section (2), there may be many members of local authorities who, rather than face mandamus proceedings, will swallow their pride and fall in with his wishes when the dictator speaks.  It is unfortunate that men who are convinced that this proposal and this whole procedure are wrong are to be compelled to vote against their consciences and to give the Minister the dictatorial power he is looking for here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that in this debate, unlike other debates, from both sides of the House there has been a certain amount of criticism of this amendment.  Section 23 of the Bill was, in itself, very objectionable, and, as has been pointed out, this amendment does not tend to improve it, so far as democratic rule and the point of view of the ratepayers are concerned.  It is a funny thing that when we have local bodies elected on a free franchise by the will of the people, these bodies should not be entitled to strike a rate adequate for the services to be provided.  If they do not do it, their term of office is short and they can easily be thrown out by the free will of a free people, and another body elected in its place.  Why the Minister should take it on himself to intervene and to decide that he is the individual to strike the rate and, in doing that, should claim that he is being democratic, I fail to see.  His opinion of the people must be very low or he must think that they are very blind.  If he believes they fail to realise that over the heads of a local body a rate can be struck, whether they like it or not, he must think the people of Ireland are entirely stupid and do not know what politics or democracy is at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We got local government in this country before this century came in and I suppose that if we had not got local government before getting native government, it is doubtful whether the powers which local authorities have <Col N="907" /> to-day would have been given to them. It is doubtful if we would have such bodies elected at all, but it would be better not to have them than to have them on the basis of the false pretence that they have power to do anything and, above all, to do the one thing the ratepayers take most interest in, to strike a rate to raise money. Councillors are elected every three years and the main interest of electors on these occasions is in the rate they will strike, in how they will handle the finances of the area and in how they will use or abuse the people's purse. We realise that we have many social services to maintain and that there have been heavy demands on the rates and on the people's money.</P>
    <P>The people have to provide for extra services, which increases the rates, but when the rates have gone up by leaps and bounds and when everything points to their going up at a much faster pace in the very near future, it is time that people should be taught a lesson or should be made to realise that, over the ratepayers' heads, another individual cannot come along to increase the rates.  I wonder why have local authorities so suddenly become so incompetent; why, after 45 or 46 years, have they become so incompetent that they cannot strike a rate?  Is it because those who form these bodies are inferior and incapable of carrying out their duties and must be dissolved if they try to put a stop to increases in expenditure?  It seems to me that democracy has taken a turn towards hypocrisy, so far as this measure is concerned, because there is no use in any individual&mdash;I do not care who he is, or how intelligent he is&mdash;claiming, in the Custom House or any other house, that he knows more about local affairs than councillors elected by the vote of the people.  I am not surprised that this claim should be made from the other side of the House because it has been a claim of theirs that they have a remedy for every ill and evil that ever came on this little island; but we must talk in a commonsense fashion and must realise that those nearest to the ratepayers are the people who understand the position better than anybody else.  It reminds <Col N="908" /> me of King Louis of old who had a saying: &ldquo;I am the State; I am the law.&rdquo; It is extraordinary that that should be said here in 1946 and that we should still be told that it is democracy, that it is the will of the people.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what may be said here, even if we talked for seven years and seven quarantines, we know well what will happen.  The division bell, some day or other, will decide this issue, but I am glad that members of the Fianna Fáil Party had the courage to stand up like honest men and to speak the minds of honest men.</P>

      <P>When the bell rings for the division, then is their opportunity to show how much sincerity there is in their statements and in their arguments.  On the last day on which this was debated, as well as today, I saw a situation arising which was rather similar to one we heard about recently.  I saw two Fianna Fáil parties&mdash;one dictated to from the Custom House and the other striving to get its head up.  The Party Whip will decide who is the boss, and it may be that the party in the country will have to go under to the party in the Custom House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates, we are told, are high.  It seems that the only way of telling the people that things are going to improve is to make the rates higher: that they are going to be made higher in an effort to safeguard the people.  Where, in the next few years, is this heavy expenditure going to come from?  In the case of my own county we have been asked to strike a rate of 19/10 in the £.  I have no doubt that, if our Party were in a majority, we would not strike that rate, irrespective of what the consequences would be.  We would provide the most essential services: health services, mental hospital and public assistance services.  We would provide for them gladly, but we are certainly not going to strike an estimate of £113,000 for public and trunk roads.  That is where we would put the foot down.  We told the ratepayers when we went before them for election&mdash;other councillors did the same thing&mdash;that we would give the best <Col N="909" /> services and spend the people's money as carefully as possible, that we would see that a 1/- was never spent where 10d. or 11d. would do.  That is what the people want.  An increase of 44 or 45 per cent. in the rates over the past few years is something more than this country can afford.  No member of this House, and no county councillor or member of a local body, would mind if the rates were 35/- in the £ if the country could afford to pay that, but everybody knows that at the present moment, in the circumstances in which this little island finds itself, the rate that is struck in every county is becoming too big a burden, much more than the ratepayers can afford.  There is only one way in which to teach people a lesson, and that way is not by standing up here and talking about an increase in the rates.  South Mayo has taught the lesson which the Minister, his colleagues and his Party should give very close attention to, because they are, as the old saying has it, blind Samsons knocking down the pillars of destruction on top of their own heads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>To use a hackneyed phrase, I think there is not much that I can say about this amendment.  Possibly, I could mention a thing which has not been adverted to by a Deputy from any side of the House so far, and that is the very name&mdash;local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The County Management Act took a good portion out of the name local government.  I think that this amendment, if passed, will take every shred of meaning from the name local government. To me, as I am sure to most Deputies, the words &ldquo;local government&rdquo; mean the administration of local affairs by the local people.  Does the Minister, or any Deputy who sits behind him, imagine that local bodies&mdash; county councils, corporations or other local bodies&mdash;will have any power whatever if this amendment is passed? There has been the tendency for quite a long time to take all power from the local bodies.  Members of the Minister's Party have objected, if not too strongly at least strongly enough, and have asked him to repeal certain sections of the County Management Act.  On this amendment many members of the <Col N="910" /> Minister's Party have spoken, notably prominent members of county councils, such as my fellow Deputy from the County Wexford, Deputy Allen, who has had a large experience of local government.  They have asked the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>What I am surprised at, and what, possibly, I reluctantly admire the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health for, is that he takes such a delight in proving himself such an unpopular person.  A number of Deputies have attacked this amendment, but to my mind they have not made the right approach to it.  That view of mine may be due to the fact that I am a new Deputy, and that, possibly, I do not understand the criticisms that are made here of Ministers or of amendments to Bills.  But we have had Deputies getting up and swearing high and holy about totalitarianism, Hitlerism and dictatorship in trying to get the Minister to withdraw his amendment. To my mind, that certainly is not going to get Minister MacEntee to take back anything which he puts forward. Therefore, I think that the best line for the Minister to adopt on this amendment is to listen to what is being said by members of his own Party if he is not prepared to listen to what Opposition Deputies have to say.  The Minister talked of Deputy Corry, and, I think, accused him of misrepresenting the facts.  I think he went so far as to say that Deputy Corry was not interpreting the amendment properly.  Now, apart from the fact that the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health has not the slightest confidence whatever in local representatives through the country, he is now beginning not to have any faith in the intelligence of members of his own Party.</P>
    <P>The people have elected these local councillors.  The elections occur often enough&mdash;every three years.  Everyone must admit that that is not too long a period of office for any local body.  In the event of a council failing to strike a rate, the remedy, as Deputy Hughes pointed out, is not abolition of the local body but an appeal to the electorate, as sensible people, as the type of people who sent the Minister and his Party into office, to elect a body <Col N="911" /> which will be competent and willing to carry out its duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed grave concern for the road workers of County Kerry.  He may correct me, but I think he described them as &ldquo;these unfortunate few hundred men who were thrown out of work because the Kerry County Council refused to strike a rate&rdquo;.  It is late in the day for the Minister to be concerned about local government officials.  My knowledge and experience of local government officials is that the local bodies are concerned about their officials, but when they send proposals to the Custom House for the improvement of the miserable salaries which the Custom House proposes to give these local officials, the Minister is the very first to cut them down and to refuse them.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has much defence for this amendment.  He has spoken at length, he has risen several times in his attempt to defend the amendment, but what struck me forcibly was that he repeated himself so often and spoke of the advantages of the amendment so often.  He started off by telling us the three important things that were in this amendment and that were for the betterment of the ratepayers and of the local body, but I began to distrust his defence when I heard him protest too much about the advantage of the amendment. I would not accuse him of dictatorship, of totalitarianism, but I would appeal to him to listen, if not to the Opposition, to those experienced local councillors who are members of his own Party.  It seems to me that this is the Minister's own particular amendment.  It does not seem to represent general policy.  It does not seem to be prompted by the broad policy of the Fianna Fáil Party when men like Deputy O'Rourke, Deputy Allen and other prominent Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party are asking the Minister, if not to withdraw the amendment, to modify it.  I would appeal to the Minister to listen to those experienced men and, to some extent, to listen to the Opposition.  I know he is not in the habit of taking suggestions from the Opposition, but <Col N="912" /> possibly, on this occasion, when there is such a big principle involved, when it means such a revolutionary change in local government, if he will not withdraw the amendment, he will at least modify it to some extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering if the Minister, before putting down this amendment, had consulted his followers throughout the country, people such as county councillors, members of borough councils, members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In view of the fact that a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies have attacked this amendment and that a very big volume of public opinion is bitterly opposed to further interference with the work of public men, such as county councillors and borough councillors, I am wondering to what extent, if any, the Minister has consulted anybody outside his immediate associates in the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there were a general movement throughout the country on the part of county councils and borough councils to strike a rate not commensurate with their obligations in respect to social services and other amenities I could understand the <i>raison d'être</i> of this amendment but will the Minister instance for us cases in which borough councils or county councils have refused to strike an adequate rate, especially in respect to social services? Is it because one, two, three, even four public bodies have been remiss in this respect that other public authorities are to be penalised?  I have fairly considerable experience of public bodies.  I have been a member of the Cork Borough Council for a long number of years.  Even in face of hostility from such bodies as ratepayers' associations and some chambers of commerce, notwithstanding their sending deputations to us to keep the rates within a certain figure, we have rigidly adhered to the rate that we had struck except in one or two instances where we were able to do some cheese-paring but which certainly was not to the disadvantage of public or social services.  That is the spirit, I think, that animates most public men in this country.  At the risk of <Col N="913" /> repeating myself I want to ask, is it because one, two, or a few bodies have erred in this direction and have not acted up to their responsibility to the community that other bodies are to be penalised and to be dissolved or that the Minister should take certain powers&mdash;arbitrary powers, in my view?</P>
    <P>I could quite understand it if there were a general movement to create trouble in the country by some outside influence.  Let us assume for one moment that there was some outside influence, some sinister influence, at work in order to bring to an end or to handicap the activities of local bodies and so starve the social services.  Then I would say that the Minister, even at the risk of being called &ldquo;a Hitler&rdquo;, or &ldquo;a Mussolini&rdquo;, or any other term of opprobrium that would be used towards him, would be justified in his efforts, and I would applaud his efforts in the circumstances.  But these circumstances are not present, and I feel that this is an insult to the community of men and women who undertake the responsibility of public representation on these bodies, and who give very valuable service, frequently at considerable expense and considerable inconvenience. I cannot say with any truth that I know of even one man in Cork County or City who has gained anything financially or otherwise by membership of these public bodies.  I hesitate to believe that members of local bodies are so inept, so faulty, or so criminal, if you like, that they would starve the social services simply to show the ratepayers or the disgruntled people in the country who have no public spirit, that they are worthy of support at future elections because they can keep the rates down to the very minimum.</P>
    <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy Corish and Deputy Commons, who pointed to the fact that the Minister is taking power which no Minister at any time in the history of Dáil Eireann ever attempted to take. We have the City Management Act; we have the County Management Act.  I believe the City Management Act was necessary, and that even the County Management Act in many cases was necessary.  County management is one thing; city management is one thing; <Col N="914" /> but taking such powers as these is an approach towards Hitlerism.  A public man in this country was condemned on public platforms and in the Press for certain statements made at an I.L.O. conference abroad, that this country will one of these days become the last outpost of Fascism.  I do not believe it, but this is the writing on the wall. That gentleman was pilloried all over the country for daring to say that.  He said it, at any rate, and now the action which the Minister intends to take in this amendment will lead many people to think that the Minister will drive this country into something like the last bulwark of Fascism.  I say that in all sincerity.  The Minister should get away from that sort of Hitlerite mentality.</P>
    <P>I do not want to use offensive language but I feel that the Minister is outstepping the authority given him by those who elected him.  I wonder if such a policy was ever outlined in the Fianna Fáil plan.  So far as I read it, there was no mention of it. The Minister need not, at all times, consult the Fianna Fáil clubs but I think that the impress he will leave on this measure will be one that will not be shared by his own Cabinet.  We know what happened in another Cabinet when another gentleman, not now a member of the House, took a shilling off the old age pensioners. That brought about the downfall of that Government.  The Minister should seriously consider whether he is not paving the way to the downfall of the Fianna Fáil Government.  That may be one of the things which will force him to lend his ears to the appeals made to him not to drive the people into a pen and treat them as if they were a lot of sheep who have to do as he says.  If this amendment becomes part of the Act, it will be one of the biggest blots of the many that have appeared on the Fianna Fáil plan or programme.  As one who never wants to be offensive, I suggest that the Minister seriously consider the point made by Deputy Corish.  If he does not want to hearken to the advice and criticism of Deputies on opposing benches, he should have some consideration for the feelings of members of his own Party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> When Deputy Commons was speaking and referring to the Fianna Fáil Deputies who had attacked this amendment, I interjected: &ldquo;We will see if they go into the Division Lobby in favour of it.&rdquo; That, I suggest, will strike at the roots of democratic government.  Those Deputies are sounding boards of public opinion in their own areas.  They do not lightly issue the warnings they have given to the Minister.  They have given due consideration to the figure they will cut when they go back to their constituents. Having made speeches against the amendment, having told the Minister of its consequences, having told him of the probity, intelligence and ability of members of the county councils, they will be obliged to answer the question: &ldquo;What did you do on this amendment; did you vote for it or against it?&rdquo; The Minister should consider the humiliating and degrading position in which he will put some of his own followers if he insists on this amendment.</P>
    <P>I ask him to give the matter further consideration.  By changing the words of the amendment, he may make it more acceptable.  I offer this advice sincerely and in the hope that the Minister will not cause numbers of people outside, including some of his own best supporters, to think that we are facing towards Hitlerism and Fascism.  It may be that the Minister himself will get the discredit of hastening the coming of Fascism here.</P>

      <P>When I first read this amendment, I felt that there was something seriously wrong with it. When I had heard the first few speeches against it, I had still some doubts.  But when I had heard many members of the Opposition speak, I was convinced that there was nothing at all wrong with it.  The Opposition alternative would appear to me to be: if there is anything wrong in local affairs, if there is not sufficient money raised to meet the social services, or to maintain the roads, leave them there for three years; if the country agrees to that, they can elect the same county council, and, if they disagree, they can put in a new county council.  That is <Col N="916" /> what I heard Deputy Hughes enunciate. Is that the policy?  Hardly anybody would agree with that policy.  Rates and taxation are difficult to collect. Everybody has an objection to meeting those commitments but the State must be maintained.  If there is one thing we must maintain, in the world we are facing, it is road service.  A Deputy from Mayo objected to maintaining the roads at all.  The policy of his Party is, apparently, to leave them there.  During the six years of war, the roads could not have been properly maintained.  I wonder what it will cost now to do what, in ordinary times, would have been done piecemeal.  If the roads are allowed to fall into disrepair, it will cost enormous sums to restore them.  Did not Fine Gael take all those powers in the Local Government Act of 1925?  Had they not full powers to do everything that can be done under this measure?</P>

We had county councils which objected to doing certain things, and we may have them again.  Deputy Mulcahy had them and the Government that comes after us may have them.  There is no alternative to this course except mulcting the ratepayers in double rates the following year.  That happened in Dublin and other counties which took those peculiar views.  I could understand the argument that the Revenue Commissioners should collect all these charges but I do not think that that would be acceptable.  What the Minister is trying to ensure is that there will be some definite method of securing that the democratic principle of local representation will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, in the opinion of Dáil Eireann, the Government should without delay introduce proposals for legislation enabling the owners of dwellinghouses and business premises in cities, towns and villages, to purchase on equitable terms the ground rents to which such houses and premises are subject.</P>
      <P>This question of the rights of landlords has been raised on many occasions in this House both before and since the present Government came into office.  I raised it by way of Parliamentary Question on more than one occasion, and on October 18th, 1945, columns 389 and 390 of the Parliamentary Debates, I addressed the following question to the Minister for Justice:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Justice if he is aware that many ground landlords have secured increased ground rents since the commencement of the emergency and that ground rents are being created arising out of speculation in house property; and, if so, if he will take immediate steps to stabilise ground rents at their existing figures until such time as he is prepared to introduce legislation giving power to those concerned to purchase ground rents on fair terms.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply, by which I was surprised, was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" />&ldquo;I am not aware of any recent developments which call for a revision of the law relating to ground rents.</P>
    <P>The position in this matter is regulated by the Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1931 to 1943.  Under these Acts, on the termination of a lease under which a ground rent had been reserved, the lessor, who was formerly entitled to take complete possession of the property, is obliged to grant a new lease, the terms of which, in default of agreement between the parties, are settled by the court, within the limits prescribed by the Acts.</P>
    <P>The suggestions contained in the question, and other suggestions of a similar kind, have been carefully considered by the Government and it has been decided not to promote legislation in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on further and in a supplementary reply stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would remind the Deputy that there is a motion on the Order Paper dealing with this matter.  In view of that, we will be able to go into this matter more fully than I could do now when the motion comes up for discussion.  Perhaps we had better wait to debate the matter until the motion comes forward.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the circumstances of the time, and in view of the fact that this motion was then on the Order Paper, I think it was only right to accept the suggestion for the time being.  I am glad to have this opportunity to move this motion, in order to give the Minister an opportunity to tell us in detail the reasons why the Government has refused to take any action.  I was amazed by the Minister's reply, and I was certainly greatly disappointed to learn that the Government had taken a final decision on the lines indicated by him.  I say that because one cannot ignore the many statements made by the Minister's own colleagues on a discussion of this kind in the Dáil as far back as 1931.  I cannot put my finger on any statement made by the Minister, but I am sure he will not repudiate the opinions expressed at that time by his Ministerial colleagues. <Col N="919" /> Speaking on the Landlord and Tenant Bill in the Dáil in 1931, Mr. Little said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A great many landlords in Dublin hold their titles in most dubious fashion.  They were granted leases of enormously valuable property at banquets for trivial sums of money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Little said a good many other things of interest during the same debate.  I ask the Minister to say now if he can now renege the Government's recent decision, as speaking on the same Bill, in reference to ground rents as well as other rents, Mr. Little also said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Bill is very defective, and defective from every point of view. The profit the landlord is getting bears no relation to the money he invested.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass speaking during the same discussion, in dealing with the position of ground landlords, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever increase in the letting value of the land has been created between the period when the original lease was granted and the date of its expiration has been the result of action by the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the position to-day is as it was when ground rents were originally created, as far back as 1800 or earlier.  I cannot remember any earlier date on which I can lay my hand.  The policy of the Government&mdash; and I subscribed to it with qualification&mdash;especially during the emergency, was to use the Emergency Powers Act and the innumerable Orders issued under the Act for the purpose of stabilising the wages of workers, making it extremely difficult for a large section of workers under the machinery of Emergency Powers Orders to get from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues what they were entitled to.  Their trade unions were put to considerable trouble and expense in getting what in the opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce the workers were entitled to get.  Under the Land Act of 1881 and other Acts passed by the British Government, and also by Acts passed by the Irish Government, rents <Col N="920" /> of land have been stabilised as far as those who come within the scope of the various Land Acts are concerned.</P>
    <P>Profits of industrialists and commercial concerns have been regulated, and maximum figures laid down, although in some cases industrialists, I am sure, as a result of their energy and ability have been able to drive a coach and four through some of the Emergency Powers Orders which were made to limit profits.  Farmers have been obliged to put up with guaranteed prices for agricultural produce, but those who know more about the meaning of economic prices of agricultural produce than I do, say that some of these prices are not fair.  Prices of agricultural produce were regulated by Emergency Powers Orders and maximum prices fixed.  The rents of houses coming under the Rent Restrictions Act were also fixed, but ground landlords, nowithstanding anything the Minister might say to the contrary, have been able to carry on, and to make huge profits by increasing ground rents wherever the law entitled them to terminate leases, owing to the conditions laid down by which leases were renewed since the emergency.  Astounding cases can be quoted to show ground landlords have been getting away with that procedure both before this Government came into office, and since it came into office.</P>
    <P>I take off my hat to every member of this House whether he sits on the Ministerial Benches, the Opposition Benches or any other bench, who was prepared to sacrifice his life for the purpose of winning freedom for this country, but if I understood the Minister for Justice in those days he was a democrat and a fearless man, and he surely did not go out to lay down his life so that this country could be free for ground landlords in those dangerous days.  If every other person who produces wealth finds that his income and his profits are limited, surely there is a good case for pegging down the profits of landlords, whether he be an absentee landlord represented here by an agent or a resident landlord.  We have two or three different types of ground landlords.  We have the people who orginally got the land by conquest <Col N="921" />&mdash;I am sure that will not be disputed&mdash; in some cases, at any rate.  We have municipal authorities in some cases receiving a fairly good income from ground rents.  We know perfectly well that a good deal of gambling has been going on in ground rents both before and during the emergency by insurance companies and people who have plenty of money with which to gamble. We have also a new type of ground landlord, the person who was able to get into the building of houses on a more extensive scale, who purchased land at a very low figure in urban and municipal areas and who was able to get, as all ground landlords have been getting, valuable services from the local authorities without paying anything in return.  Such people have taken advantage of the opportunity, even during the emergency, to buy land and to build houses, to get the local authority to develop the land for nothing, to sell the houses at a considerable profit and to create ground rents for the period of a lifetime.  I do not know what the Minister, as a man who was prepared to make the supreme sacrifice for his country, has to say in defence of a policy of allowing ground landlords to get away with all these profits and with increased ground rents and to lay down conditions in many cases&mdash;I shall quote some of them&mdash;with which it is entirely impossible for ordinary tenants in municipal areas or provincial towns to comply.</P>
    <P>I have heard a good deal about the position of ground landlords in and around the City of Dublin.  I have lived in the Dun Laoghaire borough area for a period of 22 or 23 years. There is one well-known ground landlord in that area.  The agent for that ground landlord, in giving evidence before the Town Tenants Tribunal in 1927 admitted, I presume on oath, that the income from ground rents of these two lords&mdash;he was agent for two lords &mdash;in 1804 was £17,641, in 1886 it was £83,000, and at the date he was giving evidence before the tribunal it had risen to the very high figure of £150,000.  There was increased building activity in the area which was accountable for portion of the increase, <Col N="922" /> but the major portion of the increase, as far as I could find out&mdash;I do not say I am infallible on this&mdash;was brought about by the action of the landlord in increasing, doubling and trebling, rents when the leases under his jurisdiction expired.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister defending that position, especially in view of the fact that the two ground landlords concerned do not spend any money as far as I know in this country.  The local authority, the Dun Laoghaire Borough Corporation or its predecessors, created the letting value of the property from which these ground rents were collected and they made it possible for the two ground landlords concerned to get this huge income.  They improved facilities in the area by providing water supplies and other amenities and as a result of the community effort which was made in this area&mdash; and other cases can be quoted&mdash;these two landlords are in receipt of a yearly income from ground rents of £150,000 a year in the borough area whereas the total rates collected by the corporation do not exceed £100,000&mdash;£150,000 for the ground landlords and £100,000 for the people who created the letting value of the property, the corporation.  If the ground landlord, any ground landlord, is going to continue to get facilities from this Government and if the Minister is prepared to defend the existing position, surely he will agree that where a ground landlord is entitled by law to increase the ground rent and to impose very severe conditions, whenever and wherever that ground landlord is given that facility, he should make some contribution to the local authority out of the increased ground rent.  I put that to the Minister as a reasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>When I raised this question some time ago, some time previous to the 18th October, I stated at the time that I did so for the purpose of imploring the Minister to stabilise ground rents at their existing level during the period of the emergency. I do not think that was an unfair proposal. I stated that there are numerous <Col N="923" /> glaring cases to show that ground landlords&mdash;and I shall quote some cases, the details of which I know to be absolutely correct&mdash;have imposed impossible conditions, so impossible in some cases that the existing tenants were obliged either to surrender their houses on the expiration of the lease or in some cases were actually evicted.  I have correspondence in connection with the case of one old person, a widow from a certain date, a lady named Mrs. Johanna Cummins, who owned 12 cottages at Magenta Place, Dun Laoghaire.  The facts are these and I shall produce some correspondence in the handwriting of the lady concerned to prove them.  These 12 houses were built by Patrick Aird, the lady's father, in the year 1862.  The total ground rent at that time was £1 but when the lease expired the landlord refused to renew the lease unless the owner agreed to put a second storey on each cottage and to expend altogether about £2,000.  Mrs. Cummins' rents from these cottages was then about £112.  She was unable to meet the estate demand and I think the Minister will agree that it was an unreasonable demand.  The cottages were then taken over and the estate are collecting the rents without any further expenditure and without putting up the two storeys on the houses on which Mrs. Cummins was called upon to put these two storeys.  It is understood that the total rent from these cottages now amounts to more than £200 per year.</P>

      <P>The Minister, if he has been reading up the files in his Department, will find a number of cases that have been cited in correspondence by a certain organisation that has been in direct communication with the Minister.  I understand the Minister received a deputation some time ago <Col N="924" /> from the Leaseholders' Association and this is one, I think, of the many cases quoted at that interview as not an uncommon case and it was subsequently confirmed in writing.  That is regarded as a very bad type of case.  Another case arose recently in Blackrock where a tram driver on the expiry of his lease was informed that before he would be granted a renewal of his tenancy the landlord would require him to pay a rent increased from £3 to £8 and to expend £150 on improvements on his house, a small house which when built 100 years ago did not cost more than £150 to build.  I could quote innumerable cases in the Dun Laoghaire area on the Longford De Vesci estate where, to my own knowledge, that kind of racketeering in ground rents has been going on for a long period.</P>
      <P>There is another case&mdash;the owner can give the address of this one&mdash;of eight small houses in Dun Laoghaire, where the lease would not be renewed unless and until an additional storey were added to the houses.  The landlord is letting these houses, although he has not expended a penny upon them, and of course they remain single-storey houses as in the other case.  The Minister surprised me when he stated in his reply that he had not received any recent cases that would justify action being taken by the Government in connection with racketeering in ground rents.  I have here a copy of a letter which was sent to the Minister and to all the Deputies in North-West Dublin, to myself and other Deputies. This is a most glaring case, and refers to a large number of tenants of the middle-class type, with limited incomes, living on the North Circular Road.  It is dated 11th May, 1945, and is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On behalf of some of my neighbours as well as on my own account, I am writing to you and the other Deputies for this constituency to draw attention to a serious injustice with which we are threatened in respect of the renewal of our leases, due to expire September next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our landlord, the late Miss Reigh, died some years ago and the property is now in the hands of her executors, who reside in England <Col N="925" /> and are represented here by Messrs. J. Walsh &amp; Company, Solicitors, Ormond Quay.  The leases are for 99 years from 1946; the present ground rent being £4 on each house. Under the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, we are entitled to new leases, but the terms we are offered for these renewals are little short of confiscatory.</P>
    <P>My own case will serve as an illustration.  My house is situated with the others in a terrace at the Phoenix Park end of the North Circular Road; a quiet district of no present or potential importance.  It is a three-storey building of the basement type on a plot of about one-eighth of an acre, poor law valuation, £23.  I bought it in 1934 for £575, but it was then a wreck, and I had to spend £400 on essential repairs.  It has now a letting value of £100 per annum, partly because of this expenditure and partly as a consequence of the housing famine. The ground rent of £4 is, however, barely equitable by comparison with the general level in the district.  I can instance some houses of a better class, with a poor law valuation of £37, in the immediate neighbourhood, which are held in perpetuity at £6 per annum.  I was, nevertheless, prepared to meet a reasonable demand for an increased rental, but on approaching the landlord's solicitors I was quoted the staggering figure of £25 per annum for my new lease.  Furthermore, I discovered to my dismay that Section 48 of the 1931 Act sanctions this imposition. Under this section the landlord is entitled to assess the new ground rent at one-quarter of the letting value of the premises so that, in effect, I am to be compelled to pay him a substantial annual premium on my life savings which I have spent on the property.  Surely such a glaring injustice was never envisaged by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure he is right there.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The factual position is that the sites and the sites only belong to the landlord; the houses and out-offices were built and are maintained at <Col N="926" /> the sole expense of the tenant.  The value of the site, and only that, should, therefore, be the determining factor in assessing the ground rent; to base the assessment on the value of the tenant's property is unsound both morally and socially.</P>
    <P>It is said that the Government are contemplating fresh legislation, but there is grave danger it will come too late to afford any relief to us, and probably hundreds of other leaseholders similarly affected.  For this reason we would ask that you urge the Minister for Justice to deal with Section 48 of the 1931 Act specially and at once or, if this is not feasible, to impose a standstill Order in respect of all ground rents pending the introduction of an amending Bill.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that we seek only the right to renew our leases on terms which will be fair alike to the landlord and ourselves.  Our case will, I feel, have your wholehearted sympathy, your constituents will be grateful for your assistance in bringing it to a successful issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I think that the Minister and Deputies of this House will admit, from the conciliatory and moderate tone of that letter, that the writer and those for whom he is acting are not Communists or Bolshies or anything of that kind.  Is the Minister prepared to stand up here and defend the action of the ground landlord in that case?  I suggest that if he is not defending the action of a ground landlord of that type, who is endeavouring to use the machinery of the law as it exists for the purpose of increasing the existing ground rent of £4 to £25 to tenants whose wages or salaries are stabilised under the Emergency Powers standstill Order, he should take some definite action to prevent that kind of thing happening.  I am not charging the Minister with being prepared to sit down there and defend ground-rent racketeers of that kind.  I wonder has the Minister really got information about the activities of that particular type of ground landlord, that particular type of citizen&mdash;I would not like to describe them as good citizens, because they seem to be able to get away with <Col N="927" /> racketeering activities more than any other section of the community.  Of course, I know that the Minister will get up and quote the 1931 Act and show that the landlord will have to renew the leases, but on what conditions?  If, as a result of an appeal to the court by the landlord, the court should decide that the tenant must go out, then he must go out and leave in the possession of the landlord a house of this type for which he paid £575 and upon which the tenant himself has expended £400, in the hope that his family and his descendants for all time would be happy in the possession of that house.</P>
    <P>I could quote a number of other cases, but what I am asking the Minister to do is what I asked him to do two years ago, and that is that until such time as this whole question has been carefully examined by the Minister and his advisers there should be a stand-still Order in regard to ground rents, just as there is a stand-still Order applying to every other section of the community that I know of.  I think that that is reasonable.  In any case, the claim made by the Leaseholders' Association, who represent a large proportion of the leaseholders, particularly in the municipality, is fair and just, that there should be some guarantee for the leaseholders of fair ground rents, by prohibiting the creation of new ground rents and unfair ground rent renewals.  Is the Minister prepared to defend the case that a landlord should be entitled under the existing law to compel the tenant concerned to expend more on the reconstruction or repair of the house, when the lease expires, than the amount which was originally paid for that house, and is he defending the action of ground landlords&mdash;with the permission of the court in some cases, but without going to court at all in very many cases&mdash;to add four times to the ground rent on the expiration of the lease?  If the Minister is not prepared to defend these people, then the only thing he can say is that these cases are worthy of more careful and full consideration than has been given by him and his advisers up to the present time.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, as the result of an appeal to the courts by a tenant on the <Col N="928" /> expiration of a lease, the court, in its wisdom, decides, for good reasons given by the ground landlord, that the tenant must get out, surely there is a case for the payment of some reasonable compensation to the tenant who bought the house at the full market value at a particular period, who expended a particular amount on its repair, and who has to hand over that property with an enhanced value to the ground landlord.  I think there is a clear case for a renewal of the lease without any of the impossible conditions which have been applied by these ground landlords in recent times. Conditions should also be laid down by the Minister in an Emergency Powers Order for fixing a fair rent and not allowing these racketeering landlords to treble or quadruple the rent after having their property considerably improved, in some cases by money borrowed by the tenant.</P>
    <P>So far as I know the City of Dublin &mdash;I do not know too much about some of the other cities, but I know some of the provincial towns&mdash;leaseholders generally are a body of thrifty people who have saved money to purchase the houses which they occupy or very often borrowed it to purchase these houses at the market value.  Every thrifty person of that type regards it as an obligation upon him to keep the house in a proper state of repair.  The house is the castle of the average citizen who thinks fit to buy his house and to put all his life savings into it or to borrow money for the purpose.  This democratic State should not give the right to a ground landlord to put these people out of possession by enabling them to get away with impossible conditions for the renewal of the lease. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this whole matter, not on the basis of the information I have given in this brief statement, but on the basis of the much more reliable and detailed information that I know he has in his Departmental files.  I ask him to consider the matter sympathetically and seriously at the earliest possible date and to make an emergency standstill Order fixing ground rents at their existing level until such time as he is able to introduce detailed legislation dealing with the whole matter.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to the speech of my friend, Deputy Davin, but, while he was making the speech, I searched through the Order Paper, as I understood this was motion No. 2 on it. Certainly, I cannot connect Deputy Davin's speech with motion No. 2, which requests the Government to introduce proposals for legislation enabling owners of dwellinghouses and business premises to purchase ground rents, that is, to bring ground rents to an end.  But the whole speech of Deputy Davin seemed to me to deal with a different subject altogether.  He seemed to me to be dealing with the rights of lessees or tenants to obtain renewals of their leases and with fixing the rents for such renewals.  So far as I could ascertain, he did not even attempt to make a case for purchasing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the Deputy's speech.  I imagine that what has happened to this motion is that someone, perhaps my friend, Deputy Norton, must have worn out a few blue pencils on it before it finally got into the Clerk's office.  It is about the most mild and tame proposal in regard to ground rents that I have ever heard of.  No one can object to a proposal to enable tenants to purchase ground rents on equitable terms; that means terms favourable both to the man who pays the ground rent and the man who receives it.  That is a proposal we would all approve of.  Most of us, I think, will be specially touched by it, as most of us are in the position of having to pay ground rents, and we can have a special sympathy for any proposal which would enable us to purchase those rents on equitable terms.  But Deputy Davin dealt almost entirely in his speech with the position that exists when a lease expires, and he quoted several cases.  He did not deal with the point that, when premises are sold, the number of years that the lease has yet to run is a very vital factor in determining the price. <Col N="930" /> Very often a man gets a house or other premises at much less than the market value because the lease has only a few years to run.  He knows that the position is uncertain as to what will happen when the lease expires. He knows it is uncertain as to the conditions which may be imposed.  He knows it is uncertain as to the rent that may be imposed by the landlord.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin mentioned the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931, Section 48.  That section deals with the position that will arise when a building lease expires.  Under that section, the owner of a rent is entitled to increase the rent to not more than one-fourth of the letting value of the house. I am in complete agreement with Deputy Davin's views in regard to that section.  I think that the limit is much too high.  Whilst giving the landlord an increase, there should be some middle course in regard to the increase to one-fourth, particularly in the case of a building lease.  In a building lease we can be satisfied that the owner of the premises did not expend the money on the building.  He merely gave a lease of the ground and got rent for it, and the building was put up by some other person and not the owner of the rent.  That is a matter which, I suggest, might be considered; that is, to modify in some respects the amount of rent that may be charged.</P>
      <P>With regard to the conditions as to expenditure on a house, I think that the provision where the landlord insists upon money being spent on a house if giving a long lease is just as much for the benefit of the tenant as for the landlord.  Deputy Davin mentioned a house built 100 years ago.  I should imagine that there must definitely be an urgent necessity to spend money on a house built that number of years ago.  If the tenant or the lessee expends the money, he gets the benefit of it in having the ownership of the house.  So much for Deputy Davin's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now speak about the motion, which is different completely, as I have mentioned, from the speech made by Deputy Davin.  I would be in complete sympathy with any proposals by which the owners of houses&mdash;dwelling-houses, particularly&mdash;would be enabled <Col N="931" /> to purchase their rents on equitable terms.  I would not be so worried about the owners of business premises, because it is a well known fact that business premises are generally held on short leases at high rents.  Generally, people in business prefer to be paying a rent and, if given the right to buy, they would prefer to take a lease, even at a high rent, than buy out.  For that reason, I am not much concerned in regard to enabling the owners of business premises to buy out the rents. The first point I see that would arise on any proposals regarding ground rents would be to find out exactly what is meant by the term &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo;. Which of the several rents that may be payable in different circumstances out of premises do you mean when you say &ldquo;ground rent?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The popular notion of ground rent is where the owner of land gives a lease, with the condition that the lessee will build premises on it, and he fixes the rent by reference to the value of the premises that will eventually be put on the land.  We have several cases, particularly in country towns, where landlords built houses and rented them or leased them at low rents, but in those cases we will still call those rents &ldquo;ground rents&rdquo;.  The Dublin Corporation receives a huge income in rents, but it would be difficult to get information as to how much of those rents are ground rents, as you cannot clearly define what is meant by a ground rent. When the builder of a house, having got a lease at a small rent himself, gives another lease at a greater rent, which of those rents can you call the ground rent?  The Leaseholders' Association referred generally to leasehold rents, but that is not the term used here.  I suggest there will be considerable difficulty in arriving at a definition which will explain or cover exactly &ldquo;ground rents&rdquo; In fact, it would be necessary to consider every circumstance under which a leasehold could arise and to make out separate provisions for each such case.</P>
    <P>With regard to &ldquo;equitable terms&rdquo;, that phrase suggests to me that not only would the payer of a rent be satisfied with the amount he would have to pay to redeem it, but that the <Col N="932" /> landlord must be satisfied with the amount he will get.  The law does not contain any obstacle in the way of purchase and sale of rent on such terms. There is no need for any legislation to enable that to be carried out, if the parties are agreed regarding the price, and there is no need to make any other legislative provision.  However, when you get down to the basic principles of the purchase of ground rents, it is obvious that some compulsion will be necessary.  It would be impossible to carry out the proposals to purchase all the ground rents in the country without at least compulsion on one side, that is, compelling the owner of the rent to sell.  Whether you would compel also the buyer of the rent to purchase, if he did not want to do so, I do not know, but it would definitely be necessary to bring in these provisions with regard to the owner of the rent.</P>
    <P>The next consideration is that it would be necessary to provide financial assistance to enable most of the buyers of these rents to buy out on any terms.  I submit that it would be futile and unfair to make simple provisions regulating the price, or regulating it so that these provisions would be available only to the more wealthy tenants or lessees who could afford the money needed to pay off the amount. The second great difficulty we come to is the complete absence of statistics in regard to ground rents.  I think my friend, Deputy Davin, was endeavouring to get statistics some time last year, when he thought it would be quite an easy matter to find out how much rent was paid in a certain class of case; but he was assured by the Minister for Finance that it would involve a considerable amount of administrative work on the part of the Department and that it could not be done.</P>

It seems to me, that from the administrative side alone, you would need a Department as big as the Land Commission and the Board of Works put together.  I do not want to frighten anybody by suggesting that we could possibly have another Land Commission, but I do not know how the proposals would be carried out otherwise, without a Department to work on the same lines as the Land Commission; and I cannot form any idea whatever of the cost of the administration of that Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Land purchase has been going on for a long time, but the Land Commission was established as a temporary Department.  I think it has almost come to be regarded as a permanent Department.  The idea that it will at some time complete land purchase seems to have gone out of our minds completely.  In the absence of definite and precise information on all those subjects, I could not possibly support this motion.  I am certain the Deputy proposing it thought of these arguments against the motion. They are matters of common sense, which would have been kept in mind, but I think they were nicely and skilfully ignored, so as to get an opportunity here to talk about ground rents, in the pretence that the Party was putting forward a proposal to help the people who paid those rents.  That is not the case.  They merely put in a motion suggesting that the owners should be enabled to purchase on equitable terms, without giving any details, without making any provision for the items I have mentioned, which must necessarily be dealt with before this question even can be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin made some remarks regarding the more modern ground rents, that is, those collected by people <Col N="934" /> who build and develop land.  He says the local authorities give the valuable service of developing the land and then allow the builder to take it over and charge a rent.  Deputy Davin can scarcely believe that.  He must know that, when land is taken over for development, the builders have to provide roads, sewers and street lighting.  They have even to pay for the name plates put at the end of each street.  The only service that is provided free that I know of is water.  If Deputy Davin knows of any provision whereby those services may be obtained free and the owner able to get them without having to spend any money, I would be glad to have more details from him, as I would be very interested.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin mentioned the inevitable &ldquo;absentee landlord&rdquo; and the name of a certain estate in Dún Laoghaire.  A part of the agitation dealing with ground rents has been that most of the rents are payable to people who do not live in the country There, again, we are completely without statistics.  But I would say, as far as I can ascertain, in a rough way, that it is a very small percentage of our ground rents that goes to people outside the country.  In the City of Dublin, so far as I can ascertain, the biggest ground rent owner is the Dublin Corporation.  It is well known that ground rents are owned extensively by religious and cultural organisations of all denominations throughout the country, and it is well known also that in recent years many people have invested their money in ground rents so as to provide them with an income.  Practically all that was carried out by people who live amongst us, and not by foreigners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin mentioned the gamble in ground rents.  The two subjects do not go together.  The man who has money to invest, if he is a gambler, will invest it in some industrial security or some ordinary shares likely to increase in value.  He certainly will not invest in ground rents.  An investment in ground rents is the opposite of gambling.  It is an investment made by a person who wishes to be sure of a reasonable income, and the income obtained from an investment in ground rents is <Col N="935" /> generally very small, only a little more than might be obtained by an investment in Government securities. On the whole, it could scarcely be described as a gamble.</P>
    <P>To carry out the proposals suggested in this motion would create a good deal of disruption, first, to the Dublin Corporation and its financial arrangements; secondly, to the State, which is also a large owner of ground rents, and it would also affect many religious and cultural organisations that are in receipt of ground rents throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot see where the urgent necessity to do what is proposed arises at this particular stage.  The people with leases are the most fortunate people in the country to-day.  They have leases and the law protects them.  The law provides that they can hold their premises for the balance of the term indicated in their leases against all comers, and if anyone tries to dispossess them the law will take a hand and put them back into possession. The law allows them to sell their leasehold interest and the law does not put any restriction upon the price they may ask for that interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin did not suggest it would be an equitable thing that such a restriction should be made.  It is well-known that the price of houses has increased to a great extent.  It has more than doubled, particularly in Dublin City within the last few years, but I have not heard any suggestion, nor would I be in favour of it, that there should be any restriction on the price that the leaseholder may ask for his house if he wants to sell it.  We have had suggestions that there should be restrictions in regard to ground rents but the ground rents that the leaseholders speak of are fixed; they are all long leases and the landlord can never, under any circumstances, increase the rent throughout the term of the lease.</P>
    <P>That is the great value of the lease &mdash;the protection the law gives to it. The law compels the landlord to accept the same rent throughout the entire term and prevents him increasing it or imposing any conditions on the lessee <Col N="936" /> which are not contained in the lease. In the last century or so, the law has developed so as to prevent the landlord doing anything of a harsh nature, even through the lease may allow for it.  The law prevents the landlord from unreasonably refusing to allow the lessee to assign.  All the legislation since, I think, the year 1860, has been putting brakes on the landlords and preventing them from doing anything harsh against the tenant.</P>
    <P>There, again, I am afraid I am copying Deputy Davin in speaking away from the motion.  I am speaking about the rights of the lessees on the expiration of their leases and that does not come within the terms of this motion.</P>
    <P>It is well-known that at the present time the attention of the Government must be very fully occupied with immense problems in relation to houses.  There is the immense problem of slum clearance and the problem of providing houses for the people to live in, particularly the urgent need in the city to provide houses for young married people.  There is also the problem of the increase of our public health services and the building of a large number of hospitals.  I do not think the Government would be justified in by-passing any of these problems in favour of this proposal to enable the owners of houses to purchase ground rents.</P>
    <P>I suggest that before we get to that stage, putting first things first, we should endeavour to create more and more owners of houses, to give houses to the thousands of families in the city who are looking for them.  Whether they are to get leases and pay ground rents or pay ordinary rents does not matter so much; the main thing is to put the people into the houses.  Taking first things first, I would not be prepared to support a proposal that the Government should now embark on the setting up of the huge organisation that would be required to carry out the purchase of ground rents, and for the reasons I have given, even if the motion contained the sensible and vital proposals that it should contain if it was seriously intended, I still could not support it.</P>

      <P>It is from the Official Report of 12th July, 1932, column 762. It is a statement made in reply to me during an Adjournment Debate on ground rents in Cobh.  This is the statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Deputy can rest assured that the grievances of the tenants in Cobh will receive the earnest attention of my Department, the earnest attention of my colleagues as a Government as soon, and just as soon as they can devote attention to it.  I will not feed the people of Cobh up with false fancies by saying to them that &lsquo;you will have in the autumn of this year a Bill&rsquo; of this kind.  I will not do that.  I tell the tenants of Cobh and elsewhere something that they can absolutely rely on&mdash;that the Government drawn from the Party that espoused their cause so warmly in Opposition will not forget them on these benches and that everything in reason that can be done for the tenants of Cobh and the tenants in the other towns of this country to remedy substantial grievances and to restore all the equities as between two parties will be done at the earliest opportunity by this Government, but that this Government while weighing the many pressing needs of our community will see that the more grievously laden will be relieved first and that in the fullness of time we hope to give the community a programme which will, perhaps, not merely adjust contractual liabilities as between people in Cobh but may and will, I hope, lead to such better times as will lessen the gulf between what the tenant is able to pay in Cobh and what the landlords should exact.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>That is the statement made by the first Minister for Justice of our Government <Col N="938" /> on 12th July, 1932.  This is February, 1945.</P>

      <P>Later still, and it is high time for every Deputy here to ask the present Minister for Justice when is he going to implement that.  It is about time we got down to business here.  I lost faith completely in them when they were doing nothing some years after and I had to go to the town of Cobh myself and I had to do what the Minister failed to do.  With my colleague, Deputy Broderick, I had to go down to Cobh, and, for a couple of years, we were judge, jury and executioner. As a result, we got the rents of the town tenants of Cobh reduced by 33? per cent.</P>
      <P>My attention was very forcibly drawn to this matter by the condition of affairs which arose in Midleton, a town in my constituency, during the past month, and my only regret to-night is that my esteemed colleague from Cork City, Deputy William Dwyer, is not here.  The ground landlord of Cobh, Lord Midleton, an absentee gentleman, offered 25 years' purchase to all his tenants.  There were nine acres of land with a house attached on the outskirts of the town, held by Major Watt when he was master of the United Hunt, at £100 per annum.  It was idle for some years, and during the Emergency the Army took it over at £80 a year. Lately, an opportunity arose of having an industry started in the town.  Deputy Dwyer went down to look for a site, and, after careful examination, came to the conclusion that these nine acres would be a suitable site.  He offered the 25 years' purchase which the ground landlord was demanding, in hard cash, a sum of £2,500.  The ground landlord immediately demanded £5,000. He was offered £3,000 and he again refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This ground landlord who lives in Britain and who derives his money out of the unfortunate town tenants of Midleton was quite satisfied to see the young men and women of that town leaving this country to get employment elsewhere.  He was not going to <Col N="939" /> give the nine acres required for that industry in Midleton.  When that condition of affairs is allowed to continue, a condition of affairs in which an absentee landlord can refuse facilities for starting an industry in any town, can refuse to give the ground because he or someone belonging to him got it from Cromwell in other days, there is something wrong with the Government which allows it.  We had to put in three or four days' hard work before we were able to find an alternative site, but the fact remains that if that alternative site had been in the hands of a ground landlord, the young men and women of Midleton would still have to go abroad to seek the employment denied to them at home.  I have read a statement by the Minister for Justice 14 years ago and it is time the present Minister implemented the promise then made by his predecessor.</P>
    <P>I will quote a few of the causes which gave rise to this position.  If I had known this debate was to come on, I could keep quoting them for a month.  I certainly could quote sufficient cases to occupy the entire three and a half hours allotted to this motion.  In the case of 25 holdings in the town of Cobh, when the first lease expired, the landlord claimed the property and raised the rents on the holdings from £100 to £1,862 and compelled the tenants at their own expense to rebuild according to the specifications of his architect.  In another case, the land was leased at £12 10s. per year.  The people who took it erected buildings at a cost of £12,000, of which they had to borrow £5,000 from the bank.  When the lease expired in 1902, the landlord refused to renew the lease, either to the tenants or the bank, and the premises were let to other tenants at a rent of £415.  In one case, the ground rent was raised from £100 to £1,862, and in the other from £12 10s. to £415.  As I say, we succeeded in getting this reduction of 33? per cent. and we put a clause in the arbitration agreement by which those who got the reduction were required to hand it over to the occupying tenant.</P>
    <P>I had the case of one hero who had <Col N="940" /> something like 120 houses in an area known as the Naval Dwellings, Cobh. He refused to look for or to accept the 33? per cent. reduction which his ground landlord had to give him and refused, therefore, to reduce the rent to the tenants.  The tenants were dragged into court and the district justice gave a decree, but, luckily enough, we had then a Circuit Court judge in Cork whose memory will be revered for many years in Cork, the late Judge Tom O'Donnell.  He sent the landlord out to settle, with the result that we got that 33? per cent. reduction from the landlord and were able to get the settlement made a rule of court which that landlord is at present trying to upset under one of the Rent Restrictions Acts, God save us, passed here.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thing which we are allowing to continue&mdash;this draining of life blood, for I can call it nothing else, because of this power which no individual should have.  I hold that no man should have, in this year of 1946, the power to say of any town: &ldquo;You shall not get here any site for one of these factories in which to employ young men and women whose only other outlet is emigration.&rdquo; That condition of affairs must end in fairness to the people of this country who, from 1916 onwards, fought to end it.  I wonder, if you were to ask anyone who went through the Black and Tan trouble, if he ever dreamed that, in 1946, an absentee ground landlord would have power to tell the people of Midleton: &ldquo;You shall not have a factory in your town,&rdquo; what would he say?</P>
    <P>What would they say to the Governments that we have had here if they allowed that state of affairs to continue? I appeal to the Minister to bring in a Bill to deal with this question. He is not so rushed now and has plenty of time to do it.  He has no Blueshirts, Blackshirts or Brownshirts to deal with, and can put his back into the work and bring in a Bill that will put an end to the present condition of affairs.  Since 1934 the tenants in Cobh are, I grant you, paying reduced rents.  That has been the position since Deputy Broderick and myself got them fixed, but while that is the <Col N="941" /> position in Cobh there are people in plenty of other towns in the TwentySix Counties that have not a Deputy Broderick or a Deputy Corry to look after them, and they are still groaning under the payment of full rents. They have got no 33? per cent. off their rents.  I suggest to the Minister that Deputies should not be put in the position of endeavouring to upset what, I suppose, he would call the law of the land.  The remedy that I am suggesting should come under laws passed here in this House and Deputies should not be obliged to take other methods to have grievances remedied.  I am suggesting to the Minister now that he should get his legions around him and bring in a Bill to deal with ground rents and town tenants that will be a credit to a national Government and a national Party.</P>
    <P>Why should any individual have the power to let a piece of rock and get a ground rent out of it?  We know that is the position in Cobh, where you have nothing but rock.  People there had to quarry out a site for a house, go to the bank and borrow money to build and then, when the leases fell in, you had in the two cases I mentioned an increase in one case of from £100 to £1,800, and in the other from £12 10s. to £400.  These are just two isolated instances in that town which reveal the present condition of affairs there.  In the case of another individual, who owns a town, he is in the position of being able to say: &ldquo;There shall not be any industry started in this town and there shall not be anything done in this town&rdquo;, his idea, I suppose, being that it shall be reserved as a sort of refuge for the Army and the Navy of another nation in a time of emergency. As I have said, it is time that that kind of thing should be put an end to. The Government that allows that sort of thing to continue is not, I submit, facing up to its responsibilities to the people.  Finally, I appeal to the Minister to get to work now.  He is not very busy at present and it will not take him long to prepare the Bill. He has not any particular organisation to watch at the present time, so that he can put his back into this job.  As I have already pointed out, his predecessor gave me a guarantee in this <Col N="942" /> House in July, 1932, that he was going to look after the interests not only of the town tenants in Cobh but in other parts of the country.  It is time, I think, that the present Minister carried out that guarantee that was given to me 14 years ago.</P>

      <P>After listening to Deputy Corry's rather eloquent speech, I suppose it seems hardly fair to throw a little cold water on the proposal in this motion, in view of the rather nice case that he has made for it.  But, in all seriousness, the point before the House is this: what exactly is the proposal in the motion?  It does, on the face of it, express sympathy with leaseholders who have to pay ground rents, and with the people in that category who may, in some instances, be suffering certain injustices, a thing that undoubtedly has happened.  But if the motion were merely a matter of sympathy, and if a division were taken on it I am sure we would find that one Lobby would be full and the other empty, because I feel certain there is not a single Deputy who would not sympathise with the people in the category that this motion is aimed to better.  But, it is one thing to express sympathy and another thing to do something, and if you look at this motion from the point of view of doing something I am afraid that its content is nil.  It says that the Government should, without delay, introduce proposals for legislation to purchase on equitable terms the ground rents, etc. Well, I think it would be just as reasonable if I were to bring forward a motion suggesting that the Government should introduce legislation with the object of abolishing all the diseases to which the people of this country are susceptible. That, I say, would be just as reasonable, because, of course, we would all sympathise with the aim in view.  It would be a very laudable thing to do if we could abolish all diseases, but the trouble is how to do it.</P>

There was a promise of sympathetic consideration, yes, but a promise to do something, no.  In so far as the motion is an attempt to clarify the issue and an expression of sympathy with the difficulties of certain classes of people, we are all with you, but then we come back to the movers of the motion and say: &ldquo;All right, we are with you as far as you have gone, but how are you going to do it?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says: &ldquo;That is the Government's job&rdquo;. That is a very easy attitude for the Opposition to adopt.  It is, unfortunately, the attitude adopted by certain Parties in the House.  I am not going to be specific on that point, but I do say that I am afraid it is a little weakness to which all Opposition Parties are subject.  They have no responsibility, and it is very easy for them to point out a difficulty and say what should be done, but it is a totally different thing to show how to do it.  That is the problem.</P>
      <P>In regard to ground rents and having sympathy with leaseholders, if it is a question of what the intentions of the Legislature are on these matters, Deputies, of course, are aware that a good deal of legislation has already been passed dealing with rents, so that one can say that something practical has been done in pursuance of that sympathy.  Where as I might agree, and would agree, that if a proper course could be adopted it should be adopted, my difficulty is to see what the course is.  It is no answer to say that the Government should do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, to come back to my first simile, the House is in this position: that suppose I were to come in with a motion proposing that the Government should introduce legislation to abolish all disease, I would be laughed out of the House.  It would be no answer for me to tell the people who were criticising <Col N="944" /> me for bringing it in that it is the Government's business.  That is no answer at all.</P>
    <P>To get back to the content of the motion.  First&mdash;&ldquo;should introduce proposals&rdquo;&mdash;perfectly indefinite; and then &ldquo;enabling people to purchase on equitable terms&rdquo;.  What are &ldquo;equitable terms&rdquo;?   There precisely the whole difficulty originates if it does not lie completely along that line.  I think I heard Deputy O'Connor say that there were other rights involved as well as the rights of leaseholders. My friend, Deputy Corry, used the phrase &ldquo;got from Cromwell&rdquo;.  The problem would be relatively simple if it was a case of paying ground rents to the direct successors and immediate assignees of Cromwell, but the trouble is that so many years have elapsed from whatever time the plantation was or the gift was that may be objectionable on those grounds and perfectly innocent people, people belonging to the class that Deputies would wish to help, have acquired as an investment a large proportion of the rents in question here.  That is only one point. You have, therefore, a difficulty in defining what specific thing you mean by &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo;.  It is very easy to say that there is an absentee landlord, that he is no good to the country, that he is getting rents here at the expense of good useful citizens of the State.  It is easy to say that; it is easy to show it and, when the case is shown to us, we all sympathise and all agree that perhaps there is something that we should do something about.  On the other hand, somebody else may come along and say, &ldquo;Yes, but there is Johnny So-and So&rdquo; or worse still&mdash;it often happens this way&mdash;&ldquo;There is that poor widow woman: her husband, who was a hard-working industrious man, made a few hundred pounds; he invested that money in such and such a property; she is solely dependent on the revenue from that source&rdquo;.  In other words, when you come to framing a legislative proposal to deal with it, you must be able to draft it in such a form that it will cater for the evil you are aiming to eradicate and, at the same time will not injure innocent parties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> I say to the movers of this motion: &ldquo;Yes, there is a large element of sympathy, but there are very great difficulties.&rdquo; I am too young a member of this House to be able to say from experience or knowledge gained elsewhere whether this problem has been examined or not but I would be very much surprised to hear that legislation in regard to housing and other things of that nature was passed through this House without the Department in question giving at least some cursory consideration to this particular problem of ground rents.  I would ask the movers of this motion to consider that it does cause great difficulty when you have a situation such as I have envisaged, when you cannot get a clear cut problem for which to legislate.</P>
    <P>The motion is, perhaps, excellent in intention.  I do not say that it is a motion that should not be brought before this House.  It is a good thing to have such problems brought before us and I do not criticise the movers of the motion from that point of view. But, on the other hand, I think it only right, when such a motion is brought up, that the vagueness of it should be commented on, and not from the point of view of attacking or criticising the movers of the motion, but rather from the point of view of grasping the fact that inherent in the problem there is a difficulty of definition, as is proved by the very terms of the motion.  I do not know whether it is the proposal merely to go no further than to discuss it but, as far as I am concerned with the motion, I recommend it; let us discuss it but, until somebody brings into the House definite, positive suggestions on a matter like this, it is hardly competent for us to go much further than discussion.</P>
    <P>There are further problems in it.  For instance, are you going to apply a motion of that nature for the benefit of leaseholders who are in possession and also for the benefit of leaseholders who are out of possession?  Straightway, if I am a man occupying a house and paying ground rent to an absentee landlord, <i>prima facie</i> there is a case for enabling me to purchase my ground rent but, look at the other side: supposing I have a lease and I am not <Col N="946" /> resident, I am an absentee, is there any particular equity in depriving one absentee for the benefit of the other?</P>
    <P>There is another problem that arises. There is the question of compulsory acquisition.  If you are going to have compulsory acquisition of ground rents, it is perfectly obvious it will have to be done on the basis of paying.  We are not going to the extent of saying: &ldquo;I am just going to acquire somebody's right and extinguish it.&rdquo; That is justified only in the very extreme of necessity.  In other words, it must necessitate in normal conditions a purchase system.  Somebody has to buy out the ground landlord.  It will not be the leaseholder&mdash;that is just what he is talking about; he is not prepared to put down a lump sum. Look at the history of the Land Acts and land purchase and see what is involved in that.  For our purpose here it is sufficient to know that what is involved is the raising of certain capital moneys to finance the scheme. What would be the proposal of the movers of this motion in regard to the capitalisation of such a scheme? Not only have they not defined to us precisely what the scope of their motion is but they have not defined what is involved in the capitalisation of the scheme.  If you have compulsory purchase from the landlord on the one hand, are you going to compel the leaseholder to buy on the other? Remember, there is a number of leaseholders who will be very anxious to have ground rents bought out from the landlord but if you should say to them: &ldquo;Yes, but you must, at such and such a rate, buy out that ground rent,&rdquo; you will hear a very different tune.  That is just another difficulty that arises.</P>
    <P>The question of urban land, of course, is a difficulty, admittedly. There are places in Dublin that do require attention.  The subject of ground rents is one that has given most people who are interested in public matters considerable room for discussion.  I sum up what I have been trying to say, in this way: There is a large amount of sympathy with the ideas that lie behind this motion but <Col N="947" /> the difficulty is, how are you going to do it?  What are the concrete proposals? Let us see what is proposed to be done.  Let us have it in a form that you can say, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to it.  What is the concrete proposal? Then we can talk about it.</P>
