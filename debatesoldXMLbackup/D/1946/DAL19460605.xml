      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that considerable dissatisfaction exists arising out of the inadequate train service between Waterford and Wexford; and whether, in view of the general improvement in the transport situation, he will direct Córas Iompair Éireann to arrange for the running of a train daily leaving Waterford for Wexford in the morning, and returning on the afternoon of the same day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that, as a consequence of a recent reconstruction of the salary and wage scales operating in the transport services, a number of railwaymen who have been insured persons under the Unemployment Insurance Acts for very many years will shortly become exempt persons, on the grounds that their earnings exceed the insurable maximum; that these men will therefore cease to have any claim to benefit under these Acts and that, if for any reason they again become insurable, they will be required to re-enter insurance as new entrants; and <Col N="1304" /> whether, in these circumstances, he will take steps to raise the limits of the wages and salary scales operating to entitle workers to exemption from these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the matter of the existing remuneration limit for unemployment insurance under examination. The Deputy's question refers to railwaymen, but I must point out that the remuneration limit for insurability under the Unemployment Insurance Acts applies only to non-manual workers.  As regards non-manual workers, I have no evidence of a general desire amongst such workers remunerated at a rate in excess of £250 per annum to be brought within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  This matter must be considered generally and not in relation to a particular group of workers.  Non-manual workers who, by virtue of increases in remuneration, cease to be insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, will retain all their benefit rights until a whole insurance year from October to October during which no contribution is paid has elapsed.  This period may extend to almost two years when the last contribution is paid in the first or an early week of an insurance year.  It is only when no contribution is paid during a period of five insurance years that the contributions previously paid cease to be available for benefit.  If, at any time during these five years, 12 contributions are paid all the contributions to credit become available for the contributor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that, arising out of a revision of wage and salary scales in the transport services, a number of railwaymen will shortly cease to be in insurable employment for the purposes of the National Health and Widows' and Orphans' Insurance Acts; that, in many cases, these men have a considerable number of contributions to their credit, and that, in the event of a downgrading of their status in the future, it is likely that in many cases these men will again become insurable, but will derive no advantages from <Col N="1305" /> their previous contributions; that in the latter case much hardship will be inflicted, not only on themselves, but on their dependents; and whether, in the circumstances, he will consider raising the exemption limit for insurability under the Acts to, say, £450, so as to preserve the continuity of insurance for the vast majority of salaried employees and wage earners likely to be affected by variations in annual earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a somewhat similar question asked by Deputy Norton on 13th February last.</P>
      <P>I may add that the income exemption limit of £250 does not apply to manual workers, who remain compulsorily insurable irrespective of the amount of their remuneration.  Non-manual workers, on reaching that limit, have the option of continuing their insurance on a voluntary basis.  Leaflets explaining in detail the voluntary contributor scheme are supplied to inquirers by my Department or by the National Health Insurance Society.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state whether a special Committee has examined and reported on the position of the pig, pork and bacon industry and made recommendations; if so, if he will state by whom the Committee was set up, its terms of reference, the names and qualifications of its members, the date upon which it commenced its examinations and the date of its report; and if he will publish the report of the Committee, including the recommendations made, with information as to the persons who were invited to give evidence and those who gave evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Departmental Committee was set up by me to examine the position in the pig, pork and bacon industries and to advise me in regard to the measures which might be taken to regulate the production and marketing of pigs and pig products.  The circumstances in <Col N="1306" /> which the Committee was set up and its terms of reference are given in paragraphs 19 and 20 of the recently issued White Paper on the Re-organisation of the Pig and Bacon Industries.</P>
      <P>The names of the members of the Committee, all of whom are officers of the Department are: J. Mahony, agricultural inspector; J. Duffy, agricultural inspector; P.A. Rogan, senior inspector; J.C. Nagle, assistant principal officer.</P>
      <P>It is contrary to established practice to publish the contents of Departmental memoranda or reports, and I do not propose to furnish particulars other than those which appear in the White Paper.  Before submitting to me the results of its examination, the Committee had discussions with persons concerned with various aspects of the pig and bacon industries and also had the advantage of being able to study previous reports on the matter, as well as the memoranda and minutes of evidence on the subject submitted to the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy. The Committee also had regard to schemes in relation to the pig and bacon industries in operation elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Witnesses who had given oral evidence before the Commission on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy <Col N="1307" /> included representatives of the Irish Bacon Curers' Association and of five individual curing firms.  All that evidence was passed on.</P>

      <P>A number of pig producers and farmers, as well as pig dealers, gave evidence.  There were in all 133 witnesses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Dáil is to be asked intelligently to discuss the recommendations contained in the White Paper, why has the Minister chosen to depart from the normal procedure in connection with commissions which have considered specific proposals, that is, that the report of the commission should be published, as well as the minutes of evidence tendered before it, so that Dáil Éireann might consider the evidence and possibly reach conclusions not in every particular identical with those of the commissioners who sat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not propose to depart from established practice in this matter.  No Minister would be expected to publish a memorandum submitted to him by his own officers on any particular subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking for that. A number of interested parties in the pigs and bacon trade were invited to give evidence before this commission, if they wished to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before a variety of committees whose joint results have been brought together for the purpose of the preparation of the White Paper.  An <Col N="1308" /> amount of evidence was given.  Is there any reason why the Minister should not, at his convenience, give Deputies access to the evidence, so that they might persue it themselves and form their judgments in the light of the evidence given by the various interested parties who presumably spoke as experts or quasi-experts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give any thought to that particular aspect.  The evidence of the witnesses who gave evidence on the dairying industry, on the question of tillage, on maize and so on, has not been published, but that is a matter which could be considered separately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether this Departmental Committee, about whose work we are to be allowed to know nothing, is the kind of machinery the Minister has set up to take the place of the Pig Products Council recommended by the Commission on Vocational Organisation, on the one hand, and the Agricultural Inquiry and Advisory Council recommended by the Commission on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy on the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee set up was not exactly what was recommended by the Commission on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy.  They recommend a permanent commission, as it were, to advise them on agriculture and agricultural subjects.  Now that recommendation was not adopted.  What was adopted was a committee of officers of the Department to submit reports on the various tag-ends that had been passed over, or which the committee had not time to examine themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state (1) the titles, reference numbers, etc., of the several sets of Prison Rules now effective in relation to (a) ordinary prisons, and (b) convict prisons; (2) the date on which each such body of rules was made and by whom made, and (3) the place in this country at which a copy of each such rules may be inspected; further, whether he will cause copies of all Prison Rules now in force to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>A list of Prison Rules, with their dates and their serial numbers as Statutory Rules and Orders, will be circulated with this reply.  Except for one rule made in 1925, all rules were made by the former General Prisons Board.  I regret that there are not in the Department of Justice any spare copies which could be placed in the Oireachtas Library, but I understand that the volumes of Statutory Rules and Orders are available for inspection in the National Library.  A reprint, in consolidated form, of all the rules has been prepared in the Department and is at present with the parliamentary draftsmen for revision from the drafting point of view.  I hope to lay the result before the Dáil within a month or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that some of the most important features of prison life are not dealt with in the rules or are dealt with only in outline, the details being left to the discretion of the administrative authority.  It has thus been possible, by administrative action, within <Col N="1310" /> the framework of the existing rules to improve conditions as regards such important matters as food and hours of recreation.  I made a statement on these matters last week: the report will be found in columns 1113 to 1115 of the Debates for Wednesday, 29th May (Volume 101, No. 9).</P>
    <P>The following are the particulars:&mdash;</P>
    <P>List of Statutory Rules and Orders, each being indicated by the year and the serial number of the Order.</P>
    <P>Rules for Ordinary Prisons: 1902 (No. 590); 1908 (No. 279); 1911 (No. 297); 1915 (No. 347); 1917 (No. 1302); 1920 (No. 1361).</P>

      <P>Mr. Hartnett, speaking at a recent political meeting, defamed the Government of his own country by calling them &ldquo;Belsen Camp gaolers&rdquo;. If Mr. Hartnett were retained as compere, that defamation could be circulated abroad as having the authority of the Irish Tourist Association. In the circumstances, there was no alternative to the course taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a well-known rule in the Civil Service that State employees shall not participate in political activities. Announcers being State employees are governed by this rule.  As regards comperes and lecturers, the same restrictions do not, of course, apply. But it is obvious that if Radio Éireann is to serve the interests of the country and of its listening public, persons engaging in violent controversy likely to arouse widespread hostility should not be employed.  Mr. Hartnett's defamatory and subversive remarks <Col N="1312" /> have aroused bitter and widespread resentment.</P>

Is that right?  I submit, with respect, Sir, that the Minister is under an obligation to answer the query&mdash;is that in conformity with the moral law, or with the minimum of civil liberty, to which a citizen of this country is entitled no matter how strongly we may condemn that citizen's views and political activities?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The manner and circumstances of his dismissal were such as to give the impression that he must have been guilty of serious misconduct, and, accordingly, there has been much local rumour and comment.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of those who do not know my brother, I should say that he is a well-known man&mdash;perhaps one of the best-known men&mdash;in County Monaghan.  He has an excellent record in both Irish wars; is an office-holder in the principal Fianna Fáil organisations in Monaghan, being vice-president of the North Monaghan Comhairle Ceanntair and joint treasurer of the Comhairle Dáil Ceanntair; has acted as Fianna Fáil election agent at all elections in Monaghan since 1932, including the Presidential Election of 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So as to discover, without prejudice, all the facts, I have submitted to Mr. Darach Connolly, solicitor, the company's <Col N="1321" /> accounts, balance sheets, much correspondence, and memoranda, etc., for report and legal opinion.  I attach herewith a copy of his report, and the astonishing disclosures therein require no comment, though I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance to paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of the report.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable for anyone to ask why my brother was dismissed, if it is true that he managed the company well.  I have gone very closely into the question myself, and the reason appears to be as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Last January, when Dr. Ward took the first steps in this unwarrantable action, he was hoping in a very short time to be promoted to a Ministry in which case, I understand, he would have been compelled to resign his managing-directorship of the company. From Mr. Connolly's report it is obvious that Dr. Ward would thus have been at a serious financial loss, so he had to find some means of recouping himself.  His son, an undergraduate in the commerce faculty in University College, Dublin, has already some experience of the business, acquired during the holiday periods at Clover Meats, Limited, Bacon Curers, Waterford.  This young man, before there was any question of dismissal, stated to a reliable witness that he would be going to Monaghan to take my brother's position, and this was later confirmed by Mr. Corr, deputy managing director of the company.  The managing directorship and the managership would have been merged, and a new plan adopted for profit-sharing, as the old one would no longer suit.  My brother was an obstacle, so he must go, the only reason given being that it was &lsquo;in the best interests of the shareholders&rsquo;&mdash;a genuine enough reason when one remembers that 5/8 of the shares are held by Dr. Ward, and how better could the &lsquo;interests&rsquo; of at least the majority of &lsquo;the shareholders&rsquo; be served than by installing one of his own family.</P>
    <P>This explanation seems more than reasonable, for it corresponds very <Col N="1322" /> closely with Dr. Ward's action some three or four years ago in ordering the dismissal of Mr. Matt Fitzsimons, an excellent agent of the company.  The only reason in that case was to make room for Mrs. K. Ward, the lady mentioned in Mr. Connolly's report, as chief agent in the carrying out of undisclosed cash sales.</P>
    <P>On a parallel with the system of conducting undisclosed cash sales in the curing company, is the method adopted by Dr. Ward for drawing by another hidden system, some 50 per cent. of the salary and emoluments attaching to the position of medical officer of the Monaghan Dispensary District.  The system is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A temporary medical officer is appointed by the Monaghan Board of Health to discharge Dr. Ward's duties, at the same salary to which Dr. Ward would be entitled if he were still dispensary officer there. (This rate is important from Dr. Ward's point of view, not only because of what he draws yearly from it, as shown hereafter, but also, by keeping up over the past 14 years, the higher rate of salary with the periodic increments, he has now reached his maximum salary, and therefore, as the pensionable officer, gets the benefit of it).  The temporary medical officer appointed by the board of health is recommended for the appointment by Dr. Ward, who then lays down his conditions, namely; that all cheques for salary and emoluments paid to the temporary, medical officer must be endorsed by the medical officer and delivered uncashed to Dr. Ward, who then pays the temporary medical officer at a rate which has varied thus:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1st temporary medical officer who acted from March 1932, to September 1935, at £4 4s per week.</P>
    <P>2nd temporary medical officer who has acted from 1935 to the present date, at £5 5s per week from 1935 to 1943, but increasing since 1943 to the present figure of £29 per month.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> As the salaries and emoluments have varied from, roughly, £450 per annum to £575 per annum, it means that Dr. Ward has drawn and continues to draw an annual sum of not less than £200-£250, while to all appearances the temporary medical officer is getting the entire amount. He is not ungenerous, however, for in return for the payment of this enforced tribute, he allows the temporary medical officer, after the first year, to keep the private fees earned in the district&mdash;where Dr. Ward himself has not practised for 15 years. During the first year he exacted half the private fees as well.</P>
    <P>Dr. J.F. McGeough, Monaghan Street, Newry, filled the position for the first three and a half years.  He was dispossessed in September, 1935, for lodging, in June of that year, the cheques for the April-June quarter to his own account, and informing Dr. Ward that he expected the terms of his appointment as temporary medical officer by the board of health to be fulfilled.  Dr. Ward dispossessed him by the simple expedient of himself asking permission from the board of health to take up duty again.  The permission was granted, and he did, nominally, take up duty (although he was then whole-time Parliamentary Secretary), until he found another doctor to consent to his conditions.</P>
    <P>At least one doctor, named Murray, at the time refused the conditions, and this man I am trying to trace so that he may testify to the conditions submitted to him.</P>
    <P>Dr. McGeough, who is now beyond Dr. Ward's <i>ex-officio</i> reprisals, is quite willing to prove, on oath if necessary, the facts governing the period 1932 to 1935.  I could invite Dr. M.P. O'Gorman, the occupant of the position since 1935, to submit confirmatory evidence only if the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will guarantee him immunity against Dr. Ward's vengeance, for, in addition to acting as Dr. Ward's deputy, he has recently been appointed to a neighbouring rural dispensary district, and feels <Col N="1324" /> that if Dr. Ward had still official power over him, it would not be safe to disclose the position.</P>
    <P>I hope that some means will be devised to ensure that restitution will be made to these two doctors. Until my brother sought my advice regarding his summary dismissal, I was unaware that the Monaghan Curing Company had been conducted in the manner disclosed.</P>
    <P>Since 1932 there had been persistent rumours, widespread among the medical profession, that Dr. Ward was continuing to draw part of the salary of the Monaghan Dispensary District.  I was aware that Deputies Dillon and O'Higgins had tried to get evidence of this, but it is only now that I fully understand why they did not succeed.</P>
    <P>When the curing company affair came to my notice I decided to make a thorough and impartial investigation, for the reason that I felt that I was in a particularly favourable position to get reliable information. Having got it, supported by documentary and personal evidence, I now feel that it is my duty, before advising or taking any other steps, to submit it to the Government in the interests of the Government itself, and the country generally, especially my native county.</P>
    <P>Amongst other matters which might profitably form the subject of inquiry, but about which I would find it difficult to get conclusive evidence, is the taking of funds&mdash;it is said some hundreds of pounds &mdash; from the Monaghan Public Utility Building Society to erect a Fianna Fáil Hall at Carrickroe, on land rented by Dr. Ward himself.  I am told that it is known locally as the Ward Hall, and that he exercises the authority of a landlord over it.  The funds were not returned to the society, nor any offer made to do so.  This is my unconfirmed information.</P>
    <P>I have dissuaded my brother from taking any action until the matters disclosed herein have been considered by the Government.  Mr. Darach Connolly, solicitor, has custody of all the available documents concerning the curing company, and is authorised <Col N="1325" /> to submit them for inspection, if required.  Dr. McGeough is prepared to submit evidence by way of affidavit or in person, if deemed necessary, and Dr. O'Gorman's supporting proof will be forthcoming, immediately he is assured of protection.</P>

    <P>The other letter is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Darach Connolly,</P>
    <P>Solicitor.  21 Parliament Street,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Dublin.</P>
    <P Just="Right">17th May, 1946.</P>
    <P>Dr. Patrick MacCarvill,</P>
    <P>8 Fitzwilliam Square,</P>
    <P>Dublin.</P>
    <P>Dear Dr. MacCarvill,</P>
    <P>In accordance with your instructions, I have carefully examined the audited accounts and balance sheets, correspondence and memoranda relating to the Monaghan Curing Company Limited, placed at my disposal.</P>
    <P>Since 1938, the company has had a share capital of £8,000, divided between the three directors, who are also officials of the company, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Managing director, Dr. F. C. Ward, £5,000; deputy managing director, Mr. Joseph Corr, £2,250; manager and secretary, Mr. J. MacCarvill, £750&mdash;£8,000.</P>
    <P>The audited accounts for the years 1938 to 1944 show that the company, on the average, has made extremely good profits, especially when considered in relation to the amount of the capital invested.  I should perhaps, point out that the company has never paid any dividends as such, but the directors drew from the company, by way of salary and otherwise, in exact ratio to the amount of capital held by each.  Since you expressly ask for a statement of the amounts drawn by Dr. Ward, the following is a summary of the amounts drawn by him in salaries during the periods stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>During ten months of 1938, £916 13s. 4d.; during the year 1939, £1,000; during the year 1940, £1,750; <Col N="1326" /> during the year 1941, £2,000; during the year 1942, £2,000; during the year 1943, £1,000; during three months of 1944, £250; total salaries during six years and one month, £8,916 13s. 4d.</P>
    <P>In addition to the profits shown by the properly audited accounts, it is quite clear from the documents furnished, that a well organised system of undisclosed cash sales was in operation during most of the period under review.  It does not appear how the bacon was made available for these &lsquo;unofficial&rsquo; sales, while the company was working on a quota basis, but it is obvious that some method must have been adopted whereby the extraction of bacon, and offal, from the pigs killed was not disclosed in full to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  If you should require specific details in respect of this practice, I could furnish dates and names of consignees in respect of some of these undisclosed cash sales, from the records to hand.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the proceeds of these sales were not passed through the accounts of the company, nor included in the audited accounts. From this you will understand that moneys derived from this source were not returned for taxation purposes by the company to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>It must be assumed from this, that the directors profiting by these undisclosed cash sales have not included them in their personal income-tax returns, since by doing so they would have to disclose to the Revenue Commissioners the source of this income, thereby involving the company of which they were the directors and officials.  As requested, I have summarised&mdash;I think accurately&mdash;the total amounts drawn by Dr. Ward out of these undisclosed cash sales during the period under review, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>During the year 1939, £106 14s. 4d.; 1940, £12 19s. 5d.; 1941, £173 0s. 1d.; 1942, £368 10s. 9d.; 1943, £522 19s. 0d.; 1944, £1,027 9s. 9d.; 1945, £753 3s. 5d. Total during the seven years, £2,964 16s. 9d.</P>
    <P>During the period 1938 to 1945, inclusive, therefore, Dr. Ward <Col N="1327" /> appears to have drawn from the company almost £12,000 exclusive of any salary which he may have drawn for the year 1945 and the nine months of the year 1944.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear from the records to hand that Dr. Ward directed and ordered the carrying out of these cash sales.  One of the letters sent by him to the deputy managing director, and apparently handed over to the manager and secretary for attention, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>You might have two tons of Wiltshire sides dispatched to Mrs. K. Ward at Amiens Street.  The consignment need not be entered up, but send her a note that you are sending her a certain quantity on a certain day.  If you have more on hands than can conveniently be disposed of, you could send three tons.  In calculating the quantity available you may assume that Pidgeon will not require any from us this month.  I shall explain in detail when I go down. Please have these matters dealt with without delay.</P>
    <P>I hope the stocktaking as on the 11th instant has been carried out.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Sincerely yours,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Conn Ward.</P>
    <P>Mr. Joe Corr,</P>
    <P>Church Square,</P>
    <P>Monaghan.</P>
    <P>P.S.  The commission on this transaction can be paid in cash.</P>
    <P Just="Right">C.W.</P>
    <P>(The underlining is not mine, but is in the letter, and the P.S. is written, not typed).</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Mrs. K. Ward (Dr. Ward's sister-in-law) mentioned in this letter was one of the principal, if not the principal agent here, outside the local area, for carrying out these undisclosed cash sales.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> An original memorandum, written by your brother as manager and secretary and dated the 7th September, 1942, shows that he raised objections to this practice of undisclosed cash sales.  In spite of the views expressed by him, however, he was at fault in allowing himself to be overruled, and in carrying out the policy adopted, in this matter.  I have discussed with your brother this matter, and its significance from his point of view, and he has intimated to me his intention of paying to the Revenue Commissioners such amount as may be due to them by him in respect of moneys thus received (which amount cannot be too great in view of his small share therein).</P>
    <P>In this connection I would draw your attention to the fact that, in spite of the very large profits which the company paid, relative to the amount of capital therein, your brother received, as manager and secretary, a wage of £5 per week, reduced to £4 per week in October, 1945.  The nature and extent of his work, and the moneys involved therein make this figure appear unusually low, though his co-directors may have considered it adequate when his small proportionate share in the profit-salaries and out of the undisclosed cash sales was added thereto.  Although I am not perhaps the best judge thereof, his management of the affairs of the company seems to have been efficient and successful, if the returns obtained by the directors and the completeness of the complicated records kept by him are any indication. With reference to one of your queries, there is, in fact, no suggestion in any of these records, even in the somewhat offensive letters written to him by Dr. Ward subsequent to his purported dismissal, that he misapplied or misappropriated any moneys whatsoever belonging to the company.</P>
    <P>With regard to his purported dismissal, the circumstances seem to be as follows:&mdash;On January 12th last, Dr. Ward telegraphed to Mr. Corr instructing him to give the manager four weeks' leave of absence with pay (your brother was then in hospital).</P>

      <P>&ldquo;On January 26th Dr. Ward wrote to your brother purporting to terminate his employment as manager and secretary as from the 9th February, &lsquo;in the best interests of the shareholders&rsquo;, no other reason being stated.  In this letter Dr. Ward offered your brother alternative employment as an account-collecting agent for the Counties Cavan and Monaghan, on the basis of a 2½ per cent. commission on all accounts collected within 14 days, a 1½ per cent. commission on all accounts collected within 28 days of the issue of invoice. Accounts not collected within 28 days were to be collected in any event, but no commission was to be paid thereon.  He was also to ensure a steady supply of pigs to the factory. Remuneration was to be on the basis of this commission alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the legal point of view, I am of the opinion that the articles and <Col N="1330" /> memorandum of association of the company do not confer on the managing director, Dr. Ward, power or authority to remove from office a person in the position your brother held. In my view, a decision of the board of directors would be necessary to dismiss the manager and secretary. This view is supported by the counsel's opinion which I have obtained from Mr. Cecil Lavery, S.C., and I would therefore advise that your brother has grounds for legal action on foot of a claim that his employment has not been properly terminated. Arrears of salary would be due to him from the company.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reasons later given by Dr. Ward for the purported dismissal, apparently under pressure from your brother, his allegations of &lsquo;culpable negligence&rsquo; and lack of &lsquo;sense of responsibility&rsquo; etc., in the discharge of his duties, would, perhaps in the usual way, be clear and sufficient grounds for an action for libel.  In this case, however, the obvious difficulty of proving any &lsquo;publication&rsquo; and the probability that these communications and the occasions thereof would be held to be &lsquo;privileged&rsquo; rule out any such proceedings.  The fact that there appears to be no evidence in the records to hand that such statements were warranted, would not be sufficient grounds to sustain an action for defamation in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should point out that nothing that has occurred affects in any way your brother's position as a director of the company. He is still entitled to notice of meetings, and in this connection, any deliberate omission to notify him of such meetings would, in my opinion, render the proceedings thereat invalid.  He is entitled to arrears of salary up to such time as his employment as manager and secretary is properly terminated, which could be done by his co-directors at any board meeting.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at length with the matters upon which you have asked for my opinion and advice.  If there should be any further points upon which you desire advice or any matters <Col N="1331" /> in the foregoing which you would like to have clarified, I will be glad to be of any assistance.</P>

      <P Just="Right">4adh Meitheamh, 1946.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Taoiseach,</P>
      <P>I thank you for letter with enclosures received on the 1st instant.  I regard the charges made in a very serious light and I cannot adequately deal with them until I have had an opportunity of examining minutes, correspondence and records of the Monaghan Curing Company. This will take some time and I shall require to go to Monaghan for the purpose.  In the meantime, from the knowledge and information at my disposal, I can with confidence assure you that I have not been a party to any business, political, or professional transaction that cannot stand the fullest public examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way a satisfactory investigation can be secured is through the machinery of the courts of justice.  If I should satisfy you and the members of the Government as to the propriety of my conduct by submission of evidence that cannot be refuted I could still remain the victim of the charges and you could be accused of having hushed up a scandal.  I have, therefore, decided <Col N="1333" /> to obtain legal advice with a view to providing myself with the opportunity of publicly exposing what I regard as a malicious libel.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if you would be good enough to inform the members of the Government that I know my confidence is well founded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have a further letter of the same date:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Taoiseach,</P>
    <P>Further to my letter of even date and following the most careful consideration of Dr. MacCarvill's allegations, I would urge that the whole matter be made the subject of a judicial inquiry with the least possible delay.  The charges as to my conduct as Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the appointment of a deputy medical officer of Monaghan Dispensary District are of a most serious nature and the fullest investigation becomes in the circumstances a matter of great urgency.</P>
    <P>Pending the setting up of the tribunal and consideration of the report, I should be glad if the Government would permit me to abstain from the exercise of my functions as Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">F.C. Ward.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are what I regard as the documents necessary to enable the House to consider whether it is not proper that this tribunal should be set up.  I could not take it upon myself to make extracts or to generalise the allegations made, so I felt compelled to read the letters, although there are, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, quite a number of matters which would seem to be matters which could be investigated otherwise.  Dr. Ward occupies the position of Parliamentary Secretary and there is a considerable amount of work to be done in that office, and it would not be right that we should keep the position in suspense until long-protracted actions in the courts which might result from libel actions or anything of the sort had been completed.</P>
    <P>If the House agrees with me in setting up this tribunal, we ought to be able to get a report quickly.  My idea <Col N="1334" /> would be a tribunal of three judges, so that the facts could be found and then the Government and the House would be in a position to decide what further action is required, if any should be required.  If court proceedings are to follow, it does not seem to me that the setting up of this tribunal, and, it being a fact-finding tribunal, its finding of the facts will in any way prevent any further actions it may be necessary or desirable to take in the courts.  I feel that it should be done in the public interest in this particular way, so as to ensure speed in getting a determination of the facts, and that, in all the circumstances, this is the most appropriate method.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the leader of the Opposition if I appear to speak before him, but I submit that Dr. Ward is my colleague in the constituency of Monaghan and I feel certain that he would do as much for me as I would hope to do for him in similar circumstances. If the Taoiseach and Dr. Ward are of opinion that his conduct as Parliamentary Secretary has been gravely impugned in this document, I admit that the propriety of some special tribunal appointed by this House can be acknowledged, but unless Dr. Ward, who is at present the injured person, in that allegations are made against him which have not been proved, desires that a commission set up by this House should embark on a general inquiry into all the matters referred to in that correspondence, I think the House should be very slow to anticipate the procedure laid down by the courts of law for the settling of disputes of that character between individual citizens.  Even if Dr. Ward did press for that, in his anxiety to have his name cleared at the earliest possible moment, and while sympathising with that anxiety, I think the House should still think long and well before inviting even a judicial tribunal of the kind envisaged by the Taoiseach to anticipate the work of the ordinary courts of law, which are established with all their precedents and panoply to settle such matters between individual citizens of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very grave issues, I agree, are involved, if the Taoiseach's interpretation <Col N="1335" /> of the allegations about the Deputy's conduct as Parliamentary Secretary is correct.  Let our tribunal dispose of that, but let us not usurp, even through a special tribunal, the function of the court of attending to the other matters, unless it is the very urgent and pressing desire of the injured party in the matter to resort to that procedure.  Let us above all remember that, while the charges contained in this correspondence are of the gravest possible character in regard to Dr. Ward's private affairs, it is easy to make charges, but that justice in this country establishes that no man is guilty of a charge until it has been proved true, that, on the contrary, the presumption is that all are innocent until proved guilty.  Dr. Ward's honour is untarnished unless and until such time as these charges can be proved before a competent court capable of investigating them satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any need for me at present to say anything but that we approve of the setting up of the tribunal the Taoiseach asks for.  As I indicated, the leaders of the Parties whom we consulted at 12 o'clock to-day had no opportunity or were given no opportunity of knowing what was the nature of the statement the Taoiseach intended to make to the House.  I do not want to canvass in any way what the position of the House would be in relation to its privileges, if any of the various matters discussed in these letters actually became matters to be dealt with in the courts without an inquiry here.  I think that, considering only Parliament and Parliament's work and the atmosphere in which we are carrying out that work, it may be the more appropriate procedure from the point of view of Parliament to adopt the proposal the Government has put up.  Whether any other matter arises out of it later on is another matter, but I think the statement of the Taoiseach indicates that this tribunal is necessary and we intend to support the Government in that application.  I suggest that the tribunal be got under way and be given the earliest opportunity <Col N="1336" /> of examining and reporting on the matters put before it.  I therefore want to say that I support the Government's motion to set up this tribunal, but I would ask the Taoiseach to indicate to the House at the earliest possible moment the members of the tribunal. I would ask him also whether the work of the tribunal will be carried on under the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, that is, that it will have complete power to send for persons, papers and documents, that it will have complete privilege and that its proceedings will be held in public.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise very fully with the Deputy.  Every thought he has given expression to here passed through my own mind.  The point is that I am faced with an impossible task in attempting to segregate portions of a letter of that sort, one from another, and to confine it to any particular portion.  We shall have to depend upon the wisdom of the tribunal which was set up to examine into this particular matter.  It is clear that this is a matter in which all of us in this House are interested.  I am particularly interested as head of the Government in the aspect of that matter which casts any reflection upon Dr. Ward or upon his conduct as Parliamentary Secretary. <Col N="1337" /> That is to me a prime anxiety.  I am also naturally anxious about anything which would reflect on him as being a person not proper to hold such a position. I fully agree with the Deputy that we may find ourselves in an impossible position.  If a person sends me a letter making all sorts of allegations about a member of the House&mdash;I do not now want to refer back and I take it that the Deputy does not wish me to do so&mdash;but this was one of the considerations which I had in mind when allegations were made against another Deputy of this House and where the possibility is that there may ultimately be no substance or no foundations for the allegations that are made; at the same time a certain amount of damage is done.  I assure the Deputy that nobody is more keenly alive to the grave danger of an injustice being done to an individual by allegations which may be broadcast to the entire country. But I had no other way of dealing with the situation other than by giving the letters because I dare not make extracts from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my point. If allegations are made against any one of us of acting in his capacity as a Deputy, in a manner dishonourable or wrong, I entirely agree with the Taoiseach that he must come here and ask for an inquiry on that indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But if somebody comes to the Taoiseach and says that anyone is acting dishonestly in his business or shamefully in his personal conduct then the Taoiseach is in quite a different position because he must then ask himself how does this relate to the Deputy in his public capacity: &ldquo;If it is his private life I will not publish a letter in the paper; write me a letter and I will send it to the Deputy; then let the Deputy issue a writ for libel.&rdquo;  If he is not prepared to have the matter thrashed out in the courts of justice then the Taoiseach must take up his stand.  But Dr. Ward said: &ldquo;I will sue this man for libel; I will put the matter in the hands of the court and I shall have it thrashed out there.&rdquo;  Are we to come in here, before Dr. Ward <Col N="1338" /> has time to vindicate himself, and are we to pre-judge the issue by establishing an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal of God knows what individuals.  The courts are there and Dr. Ward is doing everything possible to set the law in motion.  Surely, the House is entitled to say: &ldquo;We decline to act in this matter until the courts have disposed of the writ for libel which Dr. Ward is about to issue.&rdquo; If Dr. Ward decides that he is entitled to remain in office until the action is disposed of that is a matter for himself; but if he decides to retire temporarily until these disgusting charges are disposed of I am sure that most of us in this House would applaud such an action on his part.  But, surely, we ought not to act in this matter until Dr. Ward has issued his writ for libel, gone into the courts of the country and had the matter thrashed out there.  Suppose we set up a commission and that commission, rightly or wrongly, makes some adverse criticism of something Dr. Ward has done in connection with say a dispensary doctor in Monaghan, which might be very trivial and one of which we would not take a very grave view even though we might rebuke him, surely that is going to prejudice any jury of 12 men in regard to the other matters raised in this rigmarole. Surely, what we should do is to await the verdict of the courts of the land; if Dr. Ward is not cleared before those courts then we should consider what our position is.  If he is cleared and any residue remains, which is obscure, we can provide then the appropriate tribunal to treat with such residue.  Surely, it is unjust for us to act as between Dr. Ward and the established courts of the country, whither he wants to go himself as quickly as he possibly can to get this thrashed out as exhaustively as it can be thrashed out; and surely it would positively injure him in the defence of his character, his personal honour and his reputation if we were to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal to deal with this matter now.  No question of expedition or expediency could induce us to put in jeopardy his minimum right to justice. I urge the House most strenuously not to set up such a commission on this occasion having been given the <Col N="1339" /> Taoiseach's word that Dr. Ward is issuing the appropriate writ to bring these matters before a court of law. Until such time as that is done we should suspend any action in this matter. I think in that event Dr. Ward will wish temporarily to withdraw, as he has stated in his letter to the Taoiseach, until such time as his vindication is complete.  I repeat that that is the graceful and prudent course to adopt if he likes to adopt it; but we in this House have no right to ask him to adopt that course because he is at this moment as innocent as anyone else in this House and has as much right to carry on as any one of us has until such court of law finds these allegations are well-founded and he has acted as no honourable man should act.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel as strongly in this matter as Deputy Dillon does. The main consideration before me is that there is important public work to be done and it is in the public interest that this should be disposed of with all possible speed.  We all know that ordinary court procedure is slow.  I do not know how long it would take to have this libel action disposed of. Consequently I think the best course would be for the House to give me permission to ask Dr. Ward the specific questions contained in the letter here. I would prefer to put it to him again and postpone a final decision until I hear from him.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit that it is not fair to ask Dr. Ward that because if we ask Dr. Ward that question in public and he is advised by his legal advisers to say that he would prefer to have no tribunal pending the trial of his action in a court of law there are simple people in the country who would immediately take scandal at that and it might be misrepresented throughout the country that he was <Col N="1340" /> endeavouring to avoid bringing the matter to investigation at the earliest possible moment.  We know that he is taking every step any reasonable man can take to bring this matter to issue at the earliest possible moment.  I submit we should not shoulder the responsibility of doing anything which might anticipate the courts.</P>
      <P>If when the action is disposed of there is any residue left then we can deal with that and then we can consider what we should do.  I believe the country will understand and approve of that course.  If we depart from that course I submit that we are establishing a precedent in this House which may prove a bitter injustice to a member of the House.  The Taoiseach has spoken of the necessity of getting work done.  Dr. Ward stands at the head of a splendid family.  Whatever expedition may be required in business, the rights of that family are far more important, far superior and far more enduring; and the honour and integrity of the head of that family has been put in issue.  This House should do nothing to deprive him of his right to vindicate himself and protect the good name of his family and I urge the House most strenuously not to ask him and to take on its own shoulders before the country the responsibility for saying that Dr. Ward is going to the courts. Again, I say when that is disposed of if anything is left we will deal with it here.  Dr. Ward is entitled to rights the same as everyone else; we shall see that he gets no preference, but we shall insist that he gets the same rights that the millionaire and the postman have, as guaranteed under the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Having heard the contents of the various documents which the Taoiseach has put before the House to-day I find myself in complete agreement with Deputy Dillon in this matter. I go further than Deputy Dillon has done and say that the Parliamentary Secretary should continue to carry out his duties on the ground that any citizen of this State is innocent until he is proved guilty.  The ordinary machinery of the courts is there to deal with this matter.  Very serious charges have been made against him in his private capacity.  I think the charges <Col N="1341" /> made against him in his capacity as Parliamentary Secretary are somewhat trivial but I am afraid that it is charges like that which are sometimes held out by people who do not give proper weight to them or do not appreciate what they are doing.  I do not say that that is so in this particular instance.  But I do say that Dr. Ward should take the case into the ordinary courts and have the matter thrashed out there to its logical conclusion.  Furthermore, I think he ought to retain his duties as Parliamentary Secretary until he is proved either innocent or guilty of these charges and that he be allowed a chance to clear the air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the niceties of the legal position may be, as have been represented by Deputy Dillon, the fact that the correspondence has been read to-day makes it impossible for the House, having had letters read which constitute charges against Dr. Ward, two letters from him indicating that he can meet these charges with confidence, simply to leave the matter in that unsatisfactory position.  Before the publication of the correspondence, if the House had been aware of it, it might have been able to give some consideration to the question whether this tribunal or the courts was the preferable procedure.  But we have gone now to the stage where correspondence has been read and the charges will occupy the main pages of the papers to-morrow.  There has been just an expression from Dr. Ward that he is confident that he can meet these charges, and nothing more is going to happen until the machinery of law, with all its slothfulness, is put into operation to unravel the facts and at some date in the future give us a verdict on the question whether Dr. Ward's reputation is beyond reproach. As we have gone this distance of reading the correspondence, we are simply in the position of a man who has gone half way up a ladder, the lower rungs, of which have been taken away and he cannot get back.  Having read the correspondence, there is no alternative to going ahead with the tribunal.  In any case, if Dr. Ward feels he can meet these charges with confidence, <Col N="1342" /> the tribunal is the procedure that I would prefer, if I were in his place. First of all, there would be assurance of adherence to the law of evidence, assurance of trial by three people competent to weigh, sift and evaluate evidence; secondly, there would be an assurance to him of a speedy trial of issues upon which the court feel it desirable to express an opinion.  When we get the report of that tribunal, as a House, we can decide what Dr. Ward's position is to be in relation to his duties as Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>The other aspects of a private company in which he is concerned can be dealt with in the court but I think the tribunal can at least give us a verdict at an early date on the question as to whether his actions in the matter in any way constitute an infraction of that code of conduct which we have a right to expect from persons holding a position as Parliamentary Secretary or Minister in this House.  From Dr. Ward's own point of view, a speedy inquiry into the matter is much to be desired, much preferable to the tedious course of ordinary litigation through the courts, which may result in appearing in one court and an appeal possibly to two other courts, with all the hiatus of delay that is possible once one resorts to legal proceedings on a basis such as is contemplated here.  Therefore, the Taoiseach would be well advised, in all the circumstances, particularly as the correspondence has now been disclosed, to proceed with this tribunal and to ask the tribunal to endeavour to give the House a verdict as soon as possible so that we will know where we are in relation to Dr. Ward's public activities as Parliamentary Secretary. His other private activities can be a matter for litigation in the courts, if Dr. Ward desires to take that course.</P>

      <P>I want to say on this matter that I am completely perplexed by the attitude taken in this case.  Dr. Ward is a citizen of this country with no more rights than the humblest citizen of this State and certain very serious criminal allegations have been made against him.  Conversion of moneys not his own property for the purpose of building a Fianna Fáil hall <Col N="1343" /> in Carrickroe, County Monaghan&mdash;that is the least of it; undisclosed sales which, according to the auditor's reports, amount to considerable figures. We all know what these undisclosed sales mean.  It means the illicit production of bacon, if this allegation is true, in the Monaghan factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put my point of view.  I want to mention these specific matters.  These allegations partake of a criminal nature.  There are three of them, very, very serious, one involving these undisclosed sales, one involving the misappropriation of these funds, and a third relating to income-tax.  I want to say that if it was alleged against an ordinary citizen of this State that he had done any of these things, the proper procedure would be to report the facts to the Attorney General's Department and have these matters investigated by the various authorities concerned.  The solicitor in reporting to Dr. MacCar-will suggested that these matters be reported to the Minister for Agriculture, who is involved in the case of the bacon, and the Minister for Finance, who is involved in the other matters. I have no prejudice in these matters but, if we set up a precedent of this kind that because Dr. Ward is a Deputy or a Parliamentary Secretary of this House, he can choose the tribunal before which he is to appear, it would be setting up a precedent which, in my opinion, would be shocking, shocking both to the civil law and to the criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> Dr. Ward quite explicitly states in this matter he has no fear of the courts, and I suggest that in Dr. Ward's own interests these matters be investigated in the normal way, that the normal procedure be followed and that no such tribunal, as is suggested here, be set up.  What do we get from this tribunal?  Assuming that certain facts are found against Dr. Ward, we must begin all over again in the criminal court or the special tribunal.  I suggest in all seriousness that the resources of the Government are not so exhausted that they could not arrange to have an early sitting either of the special tribunal or of a special court to hear these matters and to have them disposed of once and for all.  But if we proceed on the lines that we are proposing now, it will appear to the country that we are going to give Dr. Ward his choice of tribunal.  The other aspect has been adequately dealt with by Deputy Dillon.  Assuming that there is no foundation for these charges against Dr. Ward, then we are holding up Dr. Ward indefinitely, at least for a considerable time, from exercising his civil rights against the writers of these letters.  I have no doubt about it that when this tribunal is set up witnesses will have to come here from Monaghan and all over the map, and the procedure before the tribunal will be equally as involved and equally as prolonged as any sitting of our courts would be.  I suggest in all seriousness that the proper course to take is to leave it to the ordinary courts of the land and the Attorney-General's Department to take the normal procedure.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the idea that it should be left to the courts.  Assuming for the moment that this tribunal is set up that the Taoiseach suggests, of three judges, they are only going to find the facts, and, having found the facts, where does it get us or where does it get them? Who is going to decide whether or not you will go on then with the ordinary procedure which Deputy Coogan has spoken about?  Remember also there are evilly disposed people who, in spite of the facts being investigated by three judges, will think that there is something <Col N="1345" /> peculiar about the procedure adopted in this case.  I should like to suggest that Dr. Ward has the right of every citizen of this country.  There is a case, apparently, which ought to go before the courts and I should like to suggest to the Taoiseach that the best service he could do to a member of this House and the people of this country is to show them that the ordinary machinery of justice is adequate for dealing with any case that arises.  That is the attitude in which we ought to approach it.  Some people will think that it is because Dr. Ward is a Parliamentary Secretary that the procedure was shortened or more favourable. I take it that everybody here would like to facilitate the trial of these charges at the earliest possible moment before the court in which anybody else in the land would be arraigned on a similar charge.  Therefore, I would ask the Taoiseach to reconsider this motion which he has proposed.</P>

The probability is that it may be stated afterwards that any tribunal set up by this House was specially selected to give a favourable or an unfavourable decision as regards Dr. Ward.  That is why I think there should not be a tribunal.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider that very seriously, because in this country public men are very often held up by people who are not well informed; public men are despised by a section of the people of this country who love to get a chance to despise public representatives.  There is the danger, no matter who selects the tribunal&mdash;this House has got to select it and the Government have got to select it, and the Taoiseach has got to select it&mdash;that it will be said afterwards that the tribunal was set up in order to whitewash the case or otherwise.

      <P>I should like to say in reference to the conflicting views and opinions that have been given expression to, from Deputy Dillon to Deputy Norton, that all these considerations have been before my mind and the mind of the Government in connection with this matter.  We found ourselves in a case of extreme difficulty.  Suppose we proceeded by the ordinary courts, as suggested by Deputy Coogan, who said it is a case where we ought to proceed by the criminal law or something of that sort, the prosecution and so on will take place at the instance of the Attorney-General or somebody else.  There will always be suggestions, and it is possible that the three judges would be regarded as suspect and surely the others would be regarded as suspect also.  We found ourselves in a position of extreme difficulty in this particular matter from the public point of view.  I finally came down myself on the side of the same sort of consideration as Deputy Norton, except that the letters were not read when I had to make up my mind about it.  I think that, all the circumstances being taken into account, the advisable thing is to get this investigated with all possible speed.  If three judges are chosen, I do not think anybody here or in the country is likely to suggest that these three judges, who are independent of us, are going to make any report other than in accordance with the facts as they find them, that there will be a genuine and fair investigation that will be fair to Dr. Ward and to the public and to everybody concerned.  We cannot leave out the fact that Dr. Ward is not <Col N="1347" /> an ordinary citizen.  He is a Parliamentary Secretary.  There are certain suggestions made here and we cannot carry on.  I think Deputy Blowick suggested that Dr. Ward should carry on his functions until this is decided. We cannot do that.</P>
      <P>This is a wide sort of thing for which I do not think there have been any precedents elsewhere.  But there are precedents in which allegations have been made and examined by means of a special tribunal.  I think, despite every other argument which may be put forward or has been put forward, that the balance in the public interest lies with setting up this tribunal and getting the facts in this matter.</P>

There is the case of Sir Charles Dilke who was precisely in the same position as Dr. Ward finds himself in at the present time, except that he was found guilty, as I have no doubt Dr. Ward will not be.  Sir Charles Dilke was charged with conduct in his purely personal capacity and, incidentally, the question was raised in Parliament as to whether Parliament should take action and the reply was: &ldquo;Certainly not; this is a matter relating to Sir Charles Dilke's personal affairs and must be settled by the civil court&rdquo;, and it was so settled. Then you had the case of the Parnell Commission.  But in that case the charge against Parnell was that, as the leader of a political Party, he incited people to commit murder.  Parliament was forced ultimately to admit that he was impugned as a member of Parliament and a commission of three judges was set up.  The British Government wriggled and twisted for a long time and the basis of their wriggling was that this was a personal charge against Parnell and that if he wanted to meet it he should sue <i>The Times.</i>  They knew that Parnell was poor and was not in the position to do that.  Parnell maintained that he was charged as a member of Parliament and had the right to a special Parliamentary tribunal and got it.  It is all very well <Col N="1348" /> to say that we want to have this thing done quickly.  We are taking from Dr. Ward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He has the protection of the courts certainly.  Anything that is done by this tribunal will not prevent him.  Deputy Dillon's point was that it might prejudice him. We cannot have it every way. In this particular case it is Dr. Ward as Parliamentary Secretary who is impugned.  I would not have got the letter and the Government would not have got the letter except it related to a Parliamentary Secretary who was appointed by the members of the Government on my nomination.  I take it that is the real reason why it was addressed to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to pronounce any judgment of any kind on the matters arising here.  I take it that writing me this letter and writing to the members of the Government a letter such as that, is impugning Dr. Ward as a Parliamentary Secretary and making allegations against him as such.  That is my immediate interest in it.  Consequently I see no way of bringing this matter to a head and doing my duty both to the public and Dr. Ward, no way in which I can dispose of this letter once I have received it, except by doing what I am doing now.  I can see there will be other lines, but each of these will be open to objections at least as strong as the objections raised against this.  I do not want to say I make light at all&mdash;I do not&mdash;of any of the arguments made by Deputy Coogan, Deputy Dillon or other Deputies.  I do not make light of these arguments.  I have been worried about them and I have been trying to see a clear way out of the position in which I am placed by the receipt of this <Col N="1349" /> letter.  We have come to a decision. I think, in the public interest, the best thing to do is to proceed with the type of tribunal that is proposed.</P>

      <P>There is the suggestion that you are putting this tribunal between the Parliamentary Secretary and the ordinary courts.  This is going to be a fact-finding tribunal.  Let us say that they find against Dr. Ward. What is his position then?  You have to consider also the position of Dr. MacCarvill, who has his civil rights to protect and who will be faced probably with a civil action as a result of this disclosure.  I think that in interfering with the ordinary processes of law, we are going completely to complicate the whole issue.  It would be much better in the interests of Dr. Ward and Dr. MacCarvill that the ordinary processes of law should take their course.</P>

I listened to the Minister's rather long and monotonous speech yesterday evening and I was interested, too, in the address he gave to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce recently.  I am forced to the conclusion that, so far as a policy of expanding production is concerned, the Minister has no plans, and, I am afraid, is not very concerned about our potentialities in that respect.</P>

    <P>The Minister in his address to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce clapped himself on the back in regard to achievements in recent years and he stressed the attention given to, and the importance of, the home market.  It was rather significant that, in dealing with that matter, the Minister dealt with values and not volume, because with the very steep rise in the value of food commodities, it is not so easy to assess what occurred here during the emergency.  The Minister indicated that our net production had gone up, that there was a very substantial increase in output, so far as value is concerned, and a substantial increase in consumption and in the value of the home market.  He indicated that we <Col N="1356" /> had captured that home market.  In the matter of net output, we are given in the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure the value of agricultural output in terms of 1938 values. In 1938, it was £41.1 millions, and in 1943, it was £43.2 millions, while the gross output fell from £50.8 millions to £47.3 millions.  I am afraid that I cannot agree with the Minister in the satisfaction he expressed regarding our progress in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to anyone interested in this question of production from our primary industry that the big problem we have to face is stagnation, and that our achievement during the most favourable period for food production was ignominious.  I do not think that is any reflection on the individual farmer. It is due to the fact that we made no attempt to organise agriculture, to organise the industry and to harness it to production.  The outlook of the Minister was not satisfactory and one could not refrain from comparing his outlook, as expressed in the speeches referred to, with the outlook of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the plans he has adumbrated and the opportunity he sees for industry. As a matter of fact, he envisages a future in which we may have an export trade in industry, but I think that Minister is overlooking one fundamental matter which is essential if we are to have that expansion, that is, that an expanding industry must come as a natural corollary to an expanding agriculture, and that, before we can achieve any expansion in industry, we must have, as a precursor, an expanding agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>I think it is obvious from what the Minister told us yesterday and from the White Papers he has issued on some aspects of our agricultural economy that there are no plans which would lead one to hope that that expansion will materialise.  The Minister completely lacks appreciation of our problems and requirements.  I do not think he has the vision, the broad national outlook, necessary to achieve an expansion in agricultural production. I do not think he has shown the capacity to plan for full productive employment for all our people and full <Col N="1357" /> productive employment for all our people ought to be the aim.</P>
    <P>The Minister stresses the advantages of the home market.  It has been made pre-eminently clear by economists that agriculture in other countries is capable of maintaining as many as three industrial workers to one engaged in agriculture.  Here we have approximately 600,000 workers engaged in agriculture and approximately the same number engaged in industry so that we have here a ratio of 50-50.  Denmark has 2½ individuals employed in industry to every one engaged in agriculture and she, in fact, looks for 1½ outside the country&mdash;that is, 4 individuals who can be maintained out of the total agricultural output.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the Minister in that he did not give the House any idea of our potential here or how that potential could be developed.  In his very long speech he completely neglected to make any reference to our export trade and our export interests; the same is true of the White Paper which has been circulated to the House.  Considering the interest that has been taken all over the world in the various food conferences which have taken place it is rather an extraordinary situation here to find our Minister for Agriculture ignoring all reference to those conferences; we had the agricultural organisation at Quebec and the more recent conference of farmers of 31 nations in London. Yet the Minister has made no reference whatever to their deliberations, or to their plans, or to the aims and objects which they were anxious to achieve.  It appeared quite clearly to me that the Minister has learned very little in his long experience as Minister and that he is still a firm believer in the policy of the home market and self-sufficiency. He made it clear that was our prime aim and that we need not be too concerned about expanding production beyond its present level.  I feel that if that is the policy of the Government we can have very little hope of achieving full productive employment for all our people and we shall have to continue to export a substantial number of our young men to seek employment abroad because, in <Col N="1358" /> the last analysis, I submit that we must export either men or goods.  I think our policy should be to export goods and keep our young men at home by giving them an opportunity of earning a decent income and settling down in life.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to take no interest whatever in the important new issues which have arisen in regard to nutrition.  New knowledge has been adduced in recent years on nutritional requirements and there is a growing appreciation of the costly burden arising from ill-health and disease due to malnutrition.  I do not know what the Minister's opinions are in regard to the deliberations and the results of the conference held at Hot Springs and the other conferences which have been established to implement the recommendation of freedom from want and an adequate standard of diet and to ensure a good standard of health and a sound physical condition for all the people of the world.</P>
    <P>It has not been made clear either by the Minister or in the White Paper whether the recommendations of the majority report or the minority report are the ones upon which the Minister will act.  Are we going to have a maximum production from the land or are we going to have a restricted output?  Are we going to concern ourselves merely with the production of our own requirements regardless of whether our soil, climate and circumstances are suitable to the production or those requirements; or is it to be our aim to achieve a higher level of production from the land and, at the same time, to preserve and, if possible, improve the fertility of the soil?  I think that that is very important, because when one analyses the type of agricultural community we have here we realise that we have a very high percentage of small farmers.  The first thing we must examine and satisfy ourselves upon is whether we are going to have economy to help the small farmer and what particular type of agriculture is best suited to his needs and his condition.  Agricultural output has been divided into two categories&mdash;the calories and the protective foods.  We now know as a result <Col N="1359" /> of estimates that calories will have to be increased by 40 per cent. and the protective foods by anything from 100 to 200 per cent.  While pre-war the calories were nearly adequate for the requirements of the world, the protective foods&mdash;that is, animal and animal products which produce the proteins and the vitamins&mdash;were not nearly sufficient for requirements.  As a matter of fact, a very high percentage of the people of the world did not get sufficient protective foods because such foods were not available.  So far as the small farmer is concerned, the measure of his prosperity lies in the opportunities provided for him to produce protective foods.  He cannot hope to compete with the big farmer in the matter of cereal production and he cannot expect that a price will be fixed for cereals which will give him a fair margin for himself and his family out of a small holding.  For that reason he must fall back on the protective foods.  His principal opportunity lies in the production of eggs, poultry and pigs.  In anything that has been put before this House up to this I can find no evidence of any great ambition to expand production in that respect in the small farmer's interest.</P>
    <P>I wonder has the Minister any confidence in the resolutions and aims of the conferences to which I have referred and as to the likelihood of their being implemented.  We all appreciate that because we were attached for so many years to a highly industrialised country whose policy was to exchange manufactured goods for cheap food we had to sell at a very low price level with a narrow margin of profit.  Does the Minister think that that position is likely to remain unchanged? Surely, the Minister ought to appreciate that in nearly every country in the world the experts, the economists, the technicians and statesmen have awakened to the fact that they should not have a position where some members of the population enjoy an income out of all proportion to the contribution they make to the national pool while the primary producer is not receiving a fair margin.  Even if we <Col N="1360" /> look at our own particular circumstances here and examine this White Paper on national income we must realise that of the total income of this country before the war the agricultural community were enjoying only 25 per cent. of that while contributing substantially more than 50 per cent.  Even now, when there is a very steep rise in the value of goods, particularly food, we receive, under what are supposed to be very favourable circumstances, only 37 per cent. of the national income.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that two out of every three people in the world are engaged in agriculture or food production. The prosperity of the world and the prosperity of industry depend upon the prosperity of the primary producer and his capacity to purchase.  If his prosperity is assured, then the natural corollary is a prosperous industry. Yesterday, a White Paper was circulated on crops, pastures, fertilisers and feeding stuffs.  Some days before that a White Paper was issued on the reorganisation of the pig and bacon industries.  It appears to me extraordinary that the Minister and his Department, having had at least six months to consider the report on agricultural policy by the post-war planning committee, should have thought it necessary to rush this House into making a decision on the recommendations contained in the White Paper in 24 hours.  I do not think the system that the Minister adopted in regard to making decisions on the recommendations in the majority report and two minority reports of the Agricultural Committee, was the proper one.  Some of the civil servants of his own Department that submitted the first minority report were scarcely the right people to make decisions and to select from the three reports particular items of policy that the civil servants felt were the best in our circumstances.  Individuals who had submitted a minority report, naturally, were biased.  They had not an open mind.  They could not take a detached view of the recommendations. I do not think that those who subscribed their names to the majority report intended the committee to be composed of three officers of the Department.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister has decided to present this to the House piecemeal.  I think it would be clearer if we got a complete picture of the plan for agricultural production. One peculiarity that strikes me is that the White Paper ignores the foundation of the plan.  On what foundation does the whole plan of production lie?  Is it to be live stock or is our aim to be the production of crops from the arable land that we are going to put under compulsory tillage?  When lea farming is recommended and adopted by the Minister, what are the Minister's overriding aims?  The Minister made the point yesterday that some people feel that lea farming is a means of producing better pasture for the purpose of producing better live stock while other people feel that the better pasture that is provided by the operation of a lea farming system is for the purpose of producing better crops.  The Minister merely pointed that out but he did not make it clear to the House what exactly is the foundation, what is the basis of this policy, what is our aim, what are we concerned with. In other words, is our aim to be an expansionist policy to achieve the maximum potential of the soil with a view to raising the standard of our people and keeping all our people at home in full productive employment, or are we merely concerned with the production <Col N="1362" /> of our own requirements and not so vitally concerned with our surpluses and how we place those surpluses? It makes a very fundamental difference, as I feel that our maximum production would give us an exportable surplus, at the very least, of 50 per cent. and possibly of 60 per cent. of our total production, that 40 per cent. of our maximum potential would be sufficient for our own requirements. If that is so, and if we achieve that level of production, surely then the prices that we receive in an export market are of vital importance.  I regret, therefore, that the Minister in dealing with this matter did not start with the foundation of our whole economy.  The very keystone of our economy is live stock and livestock products.  I regret that he did not set out clearly our aims in that respect or set out a plan, not merely to produce to the maximum, but to sell to the best advantage.  The day has come when the primary producer all over the world is not satisfied with producing and gambling on the chance of a fair margin of profit.  It is very obvious from the conference of the farmers from 31 countries, which sat in London last week, that they are demanding stability and security.  They set up a federation there to ensure that that can be achieved, to eliminate cutthroat competition, to help the food and agricultural organisation to lay plans, not merely for production, but to ensure that that production is properly allocated; that there is a fair margin for the primary producer; that that fair margin will remain stable and that it will eliminate the element of speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister bases this White Paper, so far as prices are concerned, on guaranteed prices for a limited amount of produce.  Why has not the Minister attempted to fix prices over the whole gamut of agricultural production? The Minister might answer that he has no control over the prices that we are to receive in an export market.  That will present very little difficulty when we remember that the British farmer is guaranteed prices for all his agricultural produce and that we are keenly interested, so far as our <Col N="1363" /> surplus production is concerned, in the prices he receives.  I think there is no reason why the Minister should not be able to have our prices for exports related to British farming prices.  The Minister knows that the present Minister of Agriculture in Great Britain, Mr. T. Williams, last November announced that the object of their agricultural policy will be</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to promote a healthy and efficient agriculture capable of producing that part of the nation's food which is required from home sources at the lowest price consistent with the provision of adequate remuneration and decent living conditions for farmers and workers with a reasonable return on capital invested.  To this end the Government propose to establish as an essential and permanent feature of their policy for food and agriculture a system of assured markets and guaranteed prices for the principal agricultural products, namely, milk, fat live stock, eggs, cereals, potatoes and sugar beet&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to have a complete picture, if our agricultural policy is to be based on live stock, and if our aim is to be an expanding agriculture with the final goal of maximum production, we must have a complete set of prices for agricultural production for a couple of years ahead.  I think the Minister is not satisfying the requirements of the agricultural community by merely fixing guaranteed prices for our requirements at home and neglecting to make any effort to integrate our live-stock economy here with British conditions.  Up to the present I think the Minister has neglected to avail of opportunities that were there.</P>
    <P>The Minister realises that Great Britain has been reorganising her livestock economy.  I submit that the livestock of these islands here should be treated as one unit.  The British farmer is interested in the type of stock we produce and we ought to know what his requirements are and regulate and stabilise supplies to that market.  I think that must be done and that the Minister must take up that matter with the responsible Minister at the other side.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> So far as this idea of compulsory tillage is concerned, I am very strongly opposed to compulsion.  The fact that the Minister has now decided on compulsory tillage is an indication that he has no confidence in his own policy. That, I think, is the greatest censure that could be passed on his plans and on his policy&mdash;that he cannot convince the people of the country that the policy he has adumbrated and operated in recent years is the best policy for the country.  If any plan it to be successful and is to bear fruit, surely the people who are going to operate that plan ought to be convinced that it is the best plan in their particular interests. While I admit that the tendency all over the world is to regiment people and that individual interests are being subverted to a very much greater extent than heretofore in the interests of the masses, I think that in this Catholic country we should be very slow to follow the lead given by other countries in the matter of regimentation, and in conflict with the rights and liberties of the individual.</P>
    <P>When you take our next-door neighbour, the Socialist Government which has stood very strongly for nationalisation are not attempting a compulsory tillage policy, post-war.  In the British Minister of Agriculture's Journal for December, 1945, it is stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The world food shortage is extremely serious.  For the time being, therefore, compulsory directions to grow sugar beet and potatoes must be served and supervision exercised where necessary over the laying down of grass so that this process keeps in step with the anticipated increase in live stock, with the requirements of home-grown feeding stuffs, and with the continued need for a large tillage acreage.  As the world shortage of food passes, the Government intend to leave farmers normally to grow the crops which their experience, supplemented by guidance from the advisory services, indicates are most suited to their own land. They intend, however, to seek permanent powers to serve compulsory directions on any farmer whenever necessary in the national interest, but those powers will normally be <Col N="1365" /> used only in exercising control over farms under supervision or to supplement the methods of steering production already described, should an overriding need in national food supplies or national diet render this necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a country which has to import 60 per cent. of her requirements.  They were able by a supreme effort during the emergency to reduce that deficiency in food requirements by about 40 per cent.  Notwithstanding that great effort, they still have a substantial deficit, but they do not intend to have compulsion. Here in this country we have a surplus of about 30 per cent and we have a potential 60 per cent. of surplus if we were properly organised and using our land efficiently.  Yet we think that compulsion is necessary.  Does the Minister think that the people of this country will stand for regimentation, that they will co-operate willingly in a plan under which a civil servant will walk into the farmyard and tell them what to do?  It is a reflection on the intelligence of the farmer.  I think that any farmer of standing with any knowledge of agriculture would bitterly resent any civil servant telling him what he is to do.  That is definitely implied.  The Minister may say that they do not intend to do that, but this White Paper says in paragraph 24:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to compliance with the obligation to cultivate such quota as may, from time to time, be prescribed, occupiers to whom the proposed legislation would apply would have freedom of choice as to the crops they would grow.  They would, of course, be expected to follow some sound system of crop rotation, and in the administration of the Act steps would have to be taken to safeguard soil fertility by ensuring that an occupier would not, in a spirit of mere perfunctory compliance, exhaust the soil on any particular part of his holding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put this aspect of the problem to the Minister in another place, that if we are to have compulsory tillage we would have to give the Minister very great powers to decide whether a man was carrying out a system of good husbandry <Col N="1366" /> or not and, if he was not, the Minister should have power to hoof him out of his holding.  If we are to have compulsory tillage, and a number of individuals are not prepared properly to comply with the regulations and have respect for a very precious thing, the fertility of the land&mdash;and that fertility does not belong to the individual who occupies the holding; it belongs to posterity&mdash;there is a certain responsibility on us because we must see that that fertility will be handed down unimpaired to the people who will come after us.</P>
    <P>Once you take compulsory powers to make people till land, you must see that it is properly done.  An individual might attempt to fulfil a compulsory Order by letting conacre, or he may decide, on a big holding, to till a small portion at a particular end and not worry how he was affecting fertility, being interested merely in the remaining part of his holding; that man would be doing an injury that the State could not tolerate.  I think it is a very small percentage of the farmers that the Minister is after.  I do not think the arguments advanced here are in favour of compulsion at all.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 19 we see:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In many instances, the effect of compulsory tillage has been to bring back to production land which had come to be regarded as derelict and useless.  There have been cases where crops grown under the pressure of tillage Orders have enabled occupiers to throw off burdens of debt which had been crippling them, and to make a fresh start.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am all for mixed farming.  I do not believe it was merely because individuals started to till that they got out of debt.  We have to consider the times, and the high prices at a particular time enabled some people to pay off their debts and get on their feet.  In paragraph 22 we see:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Many occupiers who had not been in the habit of tilling before the emergency and who have since provided themselves with tillage equipment and have come to appreciate the advantages of tillage will now find it no hardship to maintain a <Col N="1367" /> reasonable proportion of their land under cultivation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is true.  I think people who bought tractors and equipment and complied with the tillage Orders found they had fodder for stock during the winter period in quantities they never experienced before and they realised the advantage of mixed farming.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is the right way to put a mixed farming policy across the country.  You must convince the people it is sound and, if you are capable of convincing the people, they will have no hesitation in adopting and operating it.  Certain principles are essential to secure that.  You need a price policy that is attractive and that will stimulate people to maintain a certain amount of land under cultivation. Then you must have a proper advisory service.  I am not at all satisfied that the existing advisory service is adequate to our requirements.  I think the new ideas that are being gained in a small way here, and in a bigger way in other countries, are not being properly disseminated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has argued that compulsory tillage will not be any great hardship.  It may not be, and I do not think it will be, but there may be certain people who would like to go in for specialised farming.  They are entitled to do so.  I think compulsion can only be justified under emergency conditions.  Under normal conditions we should endeavour, by demonstration, to convince the people that mixed farming is our best policy.  Only when that method fails should we have recourse to compulsion.  It is highly objectionable to attempt to regiment our people.  There is too great a tendency on the part of the Government to provide this type of machinery.  They are inclined to order every section of the community, to regulate and regiment the people.  That may be justified under emergency conditions, but it is unnecessary and unjustifiable under normal conditions.</P>
    <P>The three reports are unanimous in one respect, and that is with reference to increasing the standard of fertility and basing our agriculture on live stock. <Col N="1368" /> Where they differ profoundly is in the ultimate aim of our production.  The majority report is all for maximum production, and for producing the type of commodity suitable to our conditions.</P>
    <P>The minority report is for producing our requirements and catering for the home market.  Lea farming is based on animal production and increasing the fertility of the soil.  It is based on a combination of clover, nutritious grasses, animal dung and urine.  That is a combination which science has established as the most effective means of stepping up fertility.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister's policy based on experiments carried out in other countries, such as Great Britain and New Zealand, or is it based on our own experience?  It is some years since I mentioned lea farming in this House, and the Minister told us that there was nothing new in it, as we had been operating a lea farming policy.  In the White Paper he now stands for a lea farming policy and he is going to compel farmers to till their land so that there will be new lea and rich and nutritious grasses and that that will step up the fertility of the soil.  That is what Great Britain has been trying to put into operation and in which she has achieved a substantial measure of success.  Is our policy based on the results of experiments carried out in Great Britain and other countries or on the results of experiments carried out here?  The only experiment I can trace, as far as lea farming is concerned, is reported in the journal of the Department of Agriculture of March, 1945, which deals with the reseeding of pastures on the Department's farms.  There were three centres selected for trials of the policy of producing young lea and observing how live stock did on it and how it improved in appearance and increased in weight.  At Athenry, in the season 1941, half a field of nine acres was ploughed and put under young lea and in due course live stock was put on. The primary result was that the reseeded plot only increased the live weight over 5.3 cwt. and that on the old pasture the increase was 2.4 cwt. during the first year.  The reseeded plot was better than the old pasture by a substantial amount.  The following <Col N="1369" /> year the reseeded plot increased the live weight by 1.92 cwt. and the old pasture plot by 2.38 cwt., so that it was better than the reseeded plot that year. In the third year the reseeded plot increased live weight by 2.59 cwt. and the old plot by 2.97 cwt., so that the old pasture plot was better than the reseeded plot.  The observation made that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in each of the three seasons of the experiment the reseeded plot provided the greater number of grazing days, but only in the first season did it give a higher live-weight increase than the old pasture plot&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that the cattle</P>
    <P>&ldquo;scoured rather severely and the majority of them lost weight though they improved in appearance during the two weeks on the new pasture&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is hard to reconcile how they improved in appearance when they lost weight.  At Ballyhaise, an old plot was reseeded over three years.  In the first year, live weight increased by 1.4 cwt. and in the second year, by 3.20 cwt. In the second year, on the reseeded plot, live weight increased by 2.16 cwt. and on the old pasture plot by 3.15 cwt. In the third year, on the reseeded plot, the net live weight increase was 2.18 cwt. and on the old pasture plot 3.94 cwt.  The following observation is made:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the period on the reseeded pasture the cattle scoured a good deal and as a result showed a drop in weight at the end of the period despite which they were much improved in appearance.  As in the previous seasons there was throughout the season a considerable amount of scouring among the cattle grazing on the reseeded pasture which in all probability depressed the live weight gain.  The difference in both the live weight increase and the number of grazing days is, however, significant. Apart from this, it was noticed that from the second period onward the the cattle on the reseeded plot did a lot of selective grazing as a result of which the pasture became tufted and although grazed longer than was perhaps desirable the tufts were not eaten down.  The old pasture was <Col N="1370" /> grazed much more evenly and the cattle appeared more contented while on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a final experiment at Clonakilty. During the three years the live weight increase was greater on the old pasture plot than on the reseeded plot. That was the position there and that is the policy we are basing the White Paper on.  It is a compulsory policy of lea farming and that is the only proof the Minister can produce as far as production of young lea on farms controlled and directed by the Department. The only demonstrations they had after reseeding and applying the necessary lime and artificial manures show that they gave a worse result as far as an increase in weight of live stock is concerned than was secured from old pasture.</P>
    <P>In the Department's journal for September there is an article by Dr. Lafferty on wild white clover and a reference to an experiment carried out abroad and in Great Britain by Dr. Roberts.  In No. 1 plot it gave 25 per cent. more live weight increase than that from which it was omitted.  In No. 2 plot during the four grazing years the temporary pasture with wild white clover gave 40 per cent. more live weight increase than the permanent pasture.  The superior live weight increase from the wild white plot was due to its greater stock carrying capacity and gave 40 per cent. more live weight increase than the old pasture.</P>

      <P>In page 8, at the end of Section 14, line 55, the following new sub-section inserted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where, in the course of the hearing of an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal under any section contained in this Part, any party to the appeal requests the Appeal Tribunal to refer a question of law arising on the appeal to the Supreme Court by way of case stated for the determination of the Supreme Court, the Appeal Tribunal shall refer the question to the Supreme Court accordingly, and adjourn its decision on the appeal pending the determination of such case stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court from the Appeal Tribunal.  When the Bill was under consideration in this House consideration was given to an amendment which proposed that the decisions of the Appeal Tribunal on matters coming before them by way of appeal from the Lay Commissioners under Part III of the Bill should be appealable to the High Court.  The position is that the Appeal Tribunal is presided over by a <Col N="1372" /> judge of the High Court and it was considered by the Minister that the appeal should not go to a court of which that judge was a member.  In the Seanad, it was put to the Minister that there should be some appeal on a question of law from the Appeal Tribunal, if a case were stated, and he agreed to provide the appeal to the Supreme Court, which this amendment provides.</P>

      <P>(b)  Where the Lay Commissioners or the Appeal Tribunal direct, under paragraph (a) of this sub-section, that the costs and expenses of any party to proceedings heard and determined by them shall be paid by any other party thereto, the said costs and expenses shall be taxed by a Taxing Master of the High Court, unless both the said parties agree that the said costs and expenses should be measured by the Lay Commissioners or the Appeal Tribunal, as the case may be, in which case the said costs and expenses shall be so measured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 16 deals with the award of costs by the Lay Commissioners or the Appeal Tribunal in proceedings <Col N="1373" /> before them under the Bill. The sub-section in the Bill as it left this House provided that, where costs were so awarded, the Lay Commissioners or Appeal Tribunal would measure the costs, unless they deemed it more proper to have them taxed by a taxing master of the High Court. The new sub-section (1) inserted in the Bill by this amendment provides that costs so awarded will be taxed by a taxing master of the High Court unless both the parties to the proceedings elect to have them measured by the Lay Commissioners or the Appeal Tribunal. The amendment is not important; it merely transfers from the Lay Commissioners or Appeal Tribunal to the parties to proceedings the right of decision as to the body to measure or tax the costs.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported, I was dealing with an article in the Minister's journal of September, 1945, on wild white clover by Dr. Lafferty and with an experiment carried out by Dr. Roberts which showed that, on a wild white clover plot, there was an average increase of 40 per cent. in live weight over the control plot, the ordinary pasture, and that when both plots were cultivated later, the wild white clover plot gave a yield of 28½ cwt. of grain to the statute acre as against a yield of 21 cwt. from the control plot.  The Minister was absent while I was reading the details of the experiments from the journal of March, 1945.  A series of three experiments was carried out at the three stations, Athenry, Ballyhaise and Clonakilty, where young lea was laid down and a comparison made between that young lea which was laid on half a field, the other half being old pasture, both of which have been stocked.  In all three experiments the live-weight increase on the young lea was less than the live-weight increase on the old pasture.  I also gave the remarks made on the experiment that young leas rapidly depreciated and became infested with weeds and that lots of tufts showed all over the field, even when it was grazed bare and that the cattle did not relish the feeding. There was a rapid depreciation on the lea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his White Paper, advocates a lea farming policy and we <Col N="1376" /> have all read and talked a good deal about it, but have we no convincing experiments carried out here?  The Minister is aware of the experiments carried out in Northern Ireland which showed a substantial increase in live weight on young lea as against the control plot.  Is it the Minister's idea that he should come to the House to advocate a compulsory tillage policy based on lea farming when we have no proof of its advantages, except from outside?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>A few years ago, the Deputy's colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, had no interest in lea farming.  He did not think there was anything in it.  He thought we were operating a lea farming policy which was just as good as that in other countries.  Evidently he has changed, because he advocates in this White Paper compulsory tillage based on lea farming.  He has talked about sending the plough around the farm for the purpose of establishing young leas and thereby stepping up fertility.  If the Deputy wants any information on the young lea idea, I can tell him&mdash;and it brings me to another point in relation to this question of lea farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scientists, who have examined into this problem of grass cultivation, have established conditions such as will produce the type of lea that is envisaged and planned.  If there is a high degree of acidity in the soil clovers cannot be grown and one cannot establish a clover matt at all.  As a matter of fact, if there is acidity, one cannot produce the highly nutritious grasses and the highly nutritious grasses will not persist for any length of time. Grasses of poor quality and low nutritional value will dominate the pasture in a very short time.  I wonder is that what happened at those centres where we attempted to establish a lea of the type they were trying to establish in Great Britain.  How are we going to <Col N="1377" /> operate a policy of that sort in this country if we have not got the proper soil service?  The Minister gave us some information yesterday as to the type of soil service we have at Johnstown Castle and we have a number of technicians centralised there to whom soil samples can be sent for analysis. That system cannot possibly work.  One cannot centralise a service like that and one cannot expect any scientist to give accurate information as to the soil condition by merely testing a sample of the soil.  The scientist requires much more data than that.  He must know something of the history of the field from which the sample is taken and how it has been treated for some years prior to the taking of the sample.  Taking all such circumstances into consideration he can in conjunction with laboratory analysis, give accurate information to the farmer as to the condition of the soil and its requirements. If the Minister, therefore, is thinking of providing a soil service in this country he must provide an efficient soil service.  If we continue to operate the sort of service at Johnstown Castle at the moment we shall find people, who will avail of that service and who get wrong results, shaking their heads and saying: &ldquo;Well, the advice I got from Johnstown Castle was all wrong and the soil service there is not reliable.&rdquo;  You cannot centralise an efficient soil service.  I think the provision of an efficient soil service is the first problem we have got to tackle in this country because the farmers generally all over the country want accurate information about the condition of the soil.  If we are going to launch out into a lea farming policy then that policy must be properly based and the services which are both necessary and essential to the efficient operation of that policy ought to be provided by the State.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say last night that we require a lot more lime.  It is about time the Minister woke up to a realisation of the situation. Even when the Minister says we want ten times more than we are using at present he is still far below the amount required to correct the existing evil.  This problem of lime deficiency <Col N="1378" /> is the growth of many years and it is a very big national problem now.  It must be measured accurately and the amount of the corrective necessary must be properly calculated; and it must be provided at the right price.  In order to do that the Minister must examine this question of providing calcium carbonate at the cheapest possible price.  Our chief difficulty is that those areas most in need of lime are most remote from the sources of supply.  The present system of lime subsidy is all wrong and it is not related to the problem as it exists.</P>
    <P>On a couple of occasions I have asked the Minister for Agriculture parliamentary questions and the answers given to those questions would indicate that the lime subsidy is greatest in County Dublin where the problem is least.  There is any amount of alkaline land in County Dublin which does not require any lime.  The Deputy who has the honour to represent Wexford probably knows how big the problem is in that county and he also knows that the sources from which the farmers of Wexford obtain their lime are remote from those highly acid areas.  The system will have to be operated by delivering to farmers in this country lime at a certain minimum price.  The present system is a grave hardship to those farmers in acid districts who are remote from supplies.  I suggest that the Minister should thoroughly investigate this whole question now.</P>
    <P>I was glad, too, to hear the Minister say yesterday evening that he was now convinced that ground limestone is the proper medium in which to find this essential corrective.  Huge plants have been established in Great Britain for the purpose of producing ground limestone; if we follow what has been done there we shall be following a very good example.  No experiments have been carried out in respect of ground limestone and caustic lime in this country. Recently I was looking at the results of some experiments carried out in Scotland and those experiments all go to show that ground limestone gives better results than burnt limestone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The results were published.  Experiments were carried out in the use of lime, and on ground limestone and burnt lime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>But no experiments have been carried out to compare ground limestone and caustic lime. There have been such detailed experiments carried out in Scotland and the results of the experiments have been published.  The results all go to show that ground limestone has advantages over caustic ground lime.  The Minister is slow to appreciate the advantages of having experiments such as these carried out.  He has taken a considerable time to appreciate the magnitude of the acid problem in this country, and how essential it is to have accurate and up-to-date scientific information available to the farmer who is operating the land in the national interest.  I think the stagnation in our production and the low output per man per acre is something which must be faced up to in a realistic way.  Technical knowledge and modern equipment are necessary if we are to step up production.  No effort has been made to help the farmer in that respect.  We have relied on individual efforts so far as production is concerned, but there has been no attempt to provide definite technical assistance and modern equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us in the White Paper that he is going to set up an authority to purchase maize and surplus barley.  That may be all right and there may be no difficulty about it while the price of maize is high.  For the next four or five years, say, the price of maize will be high and there will be little or no margin to make up between the price of maize and the price of barley.  But, if there is a substantial fall in the price of maize at any time and if barley is maintained at a fairly high level, a substantial contribution will have to be made by those who are using maize to those who are producing barley.  However, <Col N="1380" /> that will not present any great problem for four or five years but it may not prove a sound policy for all time and I do not think we should commit ourselves to that as a definite policy.  We must have a policy that will help the small farmer in the matter of producing poultry, eggs and pigs and, if it is possible, ensure a market for those products.  Running through one of these White Papers there is very grave doubt expressed as to the possibility of developing an export market in pig products to any extent.  I do not think that the gluts and slumps that were characteristic of the period between the two wars will return.  The primary producers all over the world are alive to their interests and statesmen are alive to the necessity of ensuring that there will not be erosion or the abuse of nature because the primary producers were forced to sell below the actual cost of production and had to cash in on the most valuable asset that they possessed&mdash;the fertility of the soil.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister does not propose to implement the recommendations of the Post-war Planning Committee so far as fertilisers are concerned, that he hopes to allow the farmers to cash in on the credit notes they got for their wheat, next year, and that it is not likely that the credit policy will continue after this year.  I do not think that is a wise decision because there has been, as the result of the emergency, a substantial reduction in the fertility of this country and our concern should be to adjust that at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>Whatever assistance may be given for the purchase of fertilisers, by way of subsidy, is a national investment and a very wise investment.  The Minister and the Government ought not to be anxious to curtail that.  We were advised by the Minister, yesterday, that with our climate we should get exceptionally good results from the use of fertilisers but, as a matter of fact, the Minister is aware that we have been among the lowest users of fertilisers in the world.</P>
    <P>In connection with the farm improvements scheme referred to in the White Paper, I want to give this advice to the Minister: I am opposed to <Col N="1381" /> bringing in farm buildings under this scheme.  We ought to have a separate scheme for farm buildings, if it is necessary, and I believe it is.  The farm improvements scheme was introduced for the purpose of improving the land, by way of reclamation. There are certain provisions for liquid manure tanks, and that sort of thing. That is all right because it is helpful to the policy behind the farm improvements scheme.  Whatever moneys are voted under this scheme ought to be kept definitely for the particular purpose of improving the land.  If we widen the scheme and include farm buildings, eventually, one would find that a substantial portion of the money would be directed to the farmyard rather than to the land.  I think we can even increase the amount of money that is being spent on farm improvement and that there is very wide scope for farm improvement.</P>
    <P>In connection with the last paragraph of the White Paper, I take exception to the type of committee&mdash;this brains trust&mdash;that the Minister has set up to deal with the few remaining problems that have not been dealt with by the Post-war Planning Committee. I do not think that three officials of the Minister's Department are the right people to determine what sort of agricultural education service we want in this country.  Under that system, the public have no machinery by which they can submit views and memorands.  Such commission should be detached altogether from the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I believe that those who signed the majority report did not intend the Minister to set up a committee of civil servants to deal with these matters.  It would be very unfortunate if policies concerning very important aspects of our agricultural life were to be decided inside the Department, without consultation, or without an opportunity being given to the public, and that section of the public that are vitally concerned, of presenting their views and submitting evidence.</P>
    <P>In connection with the White Paper on the reorganisation of the pigs and bacon industry, I regret that the Minister has decided to have three officials of his Department examine this problem. <Col N="1382" /> I have no objections to the recommendations that have been made by this particular committee, but I do say that we are entitled to the report and memoranda that were submitted to the Minister by that committee and to the evidence that was submitted to the committee.  It is very difficult for the House to make up its mind on these matters if we are not in a position to review the evidence.</P>
    <P>So far as the report itself is concerned and the recommendations on page 9, I am in agreement with the recommendations made.  I think that we must have a standard article, particularly if we hope to have an export trade, and I can see no reason why we should not have an export trade.  I think the opportunities are there.  The Minister, in his address to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, mentioned Canada as a very serious competitor. That may be.  But I believe that we have something in this country to sell to Great Britain in the matter of bacon and bacon products that Canada cannot give.  We can produce a first quality bacon second to none.  Our bacon has a flavour which no other country's bacon has which we should exploit.  If our aim is to produce a first-class article for the British breakfast table, I think we can beat the Canadians in that respect.  But it wants organisation and possibly the curing end wants rationalisation.</P>
    <P>Whether the method of implementing the recommendations is the best method, is a different question.  Paragraph (1) of the recommendations is:&mdash;&ldquo;Provision of effective machinery for prompt expansion or reduction of output as circumstances may require.&rdquo;  If that is the sort of industry that we are contemplating, to have some sort of machinery that will contract or expand production according to the market requirements, then the people who prepared this have no faith whatever in the plans of the conference at Quebec or the farmers' conference in London last week.  They have no confidence whatever in the success and in the aims and motives of these conferences.  The White Paper, at page 6 says, &ldquo;if an export market is available to absorb surplus pigs and bacon at a price which will give an <Col N="1383" /> economic return to pig producers.&rdquo; Again, at paragraph 15, it says:&mdash;&ldquo;What the respective shares of bacon, pork and live pigs in future exports may be it is not possible to predict, but it would seem advisable that export should be so managed that the most profitable item or items receive the greatest encouragement.&rdquo;  Running through this whole White Paper there is a doubt expressed as to the possibility of getting an export market for bacon pigs or pig products of any sort. Because of the substantial increase in protective foods that is necessary to implement these proposals and resolutions I referred to, I think we ought not to have any doubt as to the possibilities of securing a market for the surplus pigs in this country.  For that reason I agree with the committee in their recommendations, except that in sub-paragraph (1).</P>
    <P>So far as the implementing of the recommendations that have been made by the committee is concerned, I do not think that the setting up of a board of the type suggested in this White Paper is the right type.  I think it will make for no end of corruption.  The Minister did not tell us how he proposes to select the board, whether it is to be an elected or a selected board. One of the cures who made observations on the proposals appeared to take it that the board was to be constituted on a vocational basis.  I do not think that the Minister can claim that this board is to be constituted on a vocational basis.</P>
    <P>How is the Minister going to constitute the board?  Are the members of the board to be hand-picked?  Is it to become an absolute dictator board? If it is to be hand-picked, will there not be a lot of political wire-pulling? I am afraid the type of farmer-producers the Minister selected to place on former pig boards did not show their capacity to sit on a board of that type. Neither have we the machinery for the producers' and the curers' interests, the producers' interests anyway, to elect members to a board of this sort.  If the curers are to be given an opportunity of electing representatives to this board, will there not be a lot of wangling about it?  Will they not be elected <Col N="1384" /> on the basis of the curers who are to be left in and of the curers whose interests are to be bought out?  Surely a board set up in that atmosphere will not make for confidence so far as the producers are concerned.  I agree that the industry is over capitalised and is too great a charge on the industry.  It is essential to see that the profits that accrue in the business are fairly divided and that the producer will get his fair share of the profits.  I believe that was reported on by a commission set up in 1932 or 1933.  After all the commissions that have investigated this matter from time to time, the 1938 commission which is referred to in this White Paper, the Vocational Commission, which recommended certain definite things, and even the Second Minority Report of the Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy Commission, none of their recommendations have been adopted.  The Vocational Commission at page 383 of its Report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is obvious from our description of this industry that such planning and reorganisation will have to be done by a functional council representative of all the sections concerned. More especially is this true in a time of emergency such as the present.  The present practice of establishing advisory committees and consulting them on rare occasions only at the convenience of a Department is not an effective substitute for expert democratic control.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, propose and recommend that a pig products council be established, consisting of a chairman and representatives of the following interests: pig producers (selected by the National Agricultural Conference), curers (representing large, medium and small factories), pork butchers, operatives, retailers, State or community, and consumers.  The number of producer members should be at least equal to the number of curer members, and the number of representatives of these two interests should be greater than the number representing all the other sections, because their interests are more substantial and more direct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Second Minority Report, Dr. Kennedy makes certain definite recommendations. I cannot understand why <Col N="1385" /> the Minister said that that commission did not get time to go into this question of the pig industry.  Dr. Kennedy definitely states that evidence was taken.  If evidence was taken by that commission, why was the commission not allowed to make recommendations regarding this particular industry?  So far as Dr. Kennedy is concerned, he recommends rationalisation, the taking over of the whole industry and running it co-operatively.  Three definite commissions have considered this question of the pig industry&mdash;the 1938 commission set up by the Minister immediately before the war, which made certain definite recommendations, the Vocational Commission, and those who signed the Minority Report (No. 2) of the Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy Commission.  None of them has recommended anything like what the Minister has now produced in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the Minister has departed so completely from the recommendations of the commissions that took evidence and were in a position to arrive at definite decisions, and why we are now to have three civil servants from the Minister's Department to decide what policy shall be operated in the pig and bacon-curing industry.  I think there is no justification for the method adopted by the Minister.  He proposes to set up a brains trust in his Department where it will sit in secret session.  Opportunities were not given to people vitally interested to put forward their views. Civil servants ought not to be on commissions of this sort.  The members of such commissions should be free and independent of the Minister or the Government.  Officials in the Minister's Department are not free agents; they are not free to criticise or to depart from a policy that would please the Minister and that he believes in. For that reason, it is bad policy to set up within the Minister's Department a commission of this sort.  It is not good for the agricultural industry.  I do not think its work will command confidence.</P>
    <P>The Minister attempts to implement the recommendations of this committee by the machinery which he proposes on page 10.  He proposes to set up a board <Col N="1386" /> with an independent chairman and representatives of pig producers and bacon curers.  They will be given power to acquire and operate or close any bacon-curing factory that may be offered for sale; to negotiate and, with the prior consent of the Minister for Agriculture and both Houses of the Oireachtas, to compel, if necessary, the amalgamation in any town or district of existing bacon-curing firms; to close factories which, as a result of amalgamation, may have become redundant; to erect new factories where, in the opinion of the board, they are needed; to regulate the marketing and export of pigs, bacon, pork and other pig products; to purchase and allocate all pigs offered for slaughter; to require bacon-curing firms to improve the layout, equipment, and management of their factories.</P>
    <P>If this board is to be hand-picked, and if the members are to decide what type of machinery is necessary in a particular factory, that would be a very dangerous power to give them.</P>
    <P>For instance, if the board wanted to put an individual out of business, they could insist on that individual installing a particular type of machinery and claim that his methods and equipment were not sufficiently modern.  I am opposed to a set-up of this sort.  It will make for any amount of corruption and it will fail to command the confidence of the pig producers.  The machinery we require is machinery that will command the confidence and approval of the people interested in this industry.  You must have their co-operation; you must convince them that the machinery you provide is the best that can be provided, and that it will be operated in their interest.  I do not think that is the position, and I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole matter in the light of the recommendations made by various commissions. There were at least three independent commissions.  So far as the tag-ends, as the Minister described them to-day, are concerned, they have yet to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is highly objectionable that three civil servants should be charged with so much responsibility.  They are not in a position to deal impartially and in <Col N="1387" /> a detached way with this subject.  They are too much influenced by the very atmosphere of the Department.  It is not in the interest of our primary industry that that should be so.  We need not be pessimistic about the future.  If we go about this job with a proper outlook we have no reason to be pessimistic. With the opportunities that are likely to present themselves to this food-producing country, with the plans envisaged by the conferences that are dealing with food production and the allocation of food in various parts of the world, we ought not to have any doubt about the ability of this country to expand its production to the maximum. We can do a lot through education and demonstration.  Whatever hope there is of convincing our younger people that if you do a certain thing you get a certain result, the adult is in a different position, and you must demonstrate to the adult that a certain process will give you a certain result.  In that connection we must provide a more efficient advisory service.  The existing service does not reach the people who require it most. The people whom it does reach need it least; those who require it most derive no benefit from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture as the principal one that takes place in this House.  Everybody admits that agriculture is the basis of our national wealth, and that in the final analysis all wealth comes from the land.  For that reason, it is only proper that we should devote the greatest possible attention to the Vote for this Department, and give the Minister every possible help in its administration. Two White Papers have been issued, the principal object of which is to indicate that the Minister proposes to introduce a permanent system of compulsion for tillage.  Let me say at the outset that this Party wants tillage but that we will not stand for compulsion.  The Minister advanced many arguments in favour of increased tillage, thereby presumably giving himself authority to impose compulsion.  In my opinion there is an argument against compulsion in <Col N="1388" /> paragraph 22 of one White Paper.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Many occupiers who had not been in the habit of tilling before the emergency and who have since provided themselves with tillage equipment and have come to appreciate the advantages of tillage, will now find it no hardship to maintain a reasonable proportion of their land under cultivation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the emergency has done that, it should bring home to some farmers the advantages gained from a policy of mixed farming.  While farmers did not object to compulsion during the emergency, even if the quota was higher than 37½ per cent., there would not be any outcry as long as they understood that that policy was absolutely necessary.  In my opinion farmers have done a very good job in producing food and fodder as well as a great quantity of fuel.  They did more to preserve our neutrality than any other section, as neutrality could not have been observed if we had not sufficient food and firing.  Otherwise the tune would have been altogether different.</P>
      <P>The aim of the Government seems to be towards more and more regimentation, more and more compulsion. I assure the Minister that compulsion in the case of tillage will defeat its own end.  The average farmer tills even more than the Minister proposes to impose on him by compulsion.  The trouble with most of my neighbours in the West of Ireland, where they till about 50 per cent. of their holdings, is that they have not enough land for that purpose.  As a race our people will not take kindly to compulsion unless they know that some grave national emergency calls for it.  The Minister has deliberately gone against the Majority Report, and against one of the Minority Reports of the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy.  Neither of these reports advocated compulsion.  I think Dr. Kennedy put the position well in paragraph 133 where he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Agriculture in this country is based on individual ownership of farms.  It can be made efficient only by the joint efforts of farmers and <Col N="1389" /> technical advisers.  So long as that system of ownership is maintained efficiency cannot be achieved by legislative enactments.  Compulsory tillage is justifiable only in times of great emergency.  In peace time it does not necessarily lead to higher or more economical output per acre.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole question is summed up in that paragraph.  I suggest to the Minister that as far as compulsion is concerned we are definitely at crossroads. One road is pointing towards the protection of private ownership, and allowing farmers to develop their own industry, while the other is leading to collectivism and to communism. We had a recent example of that in a Land Bill that was before this House. The Minister stated that the purpose of that Bill was to deal with certain people who got a gift of land from the State, which they were expected to work but had not done so.</P>
    <P>It is strange that in connection with agriculture we have two Ministers, directly concerned with farming and each of them steering more and more towards regimentation and compulsion. I can tell the Government straight that we will not have it.  I go further and defy the Minister to put such a policy into operation.  In his statement the Minister did not mention the few prosecutions that have taken place against farmers who refused to till their quota during the emergency.  The number was astonishingly small.  Amongst the farming community, as amongst other sections, there are people who will not pull their weight.  There are people who will not do their part, either through laziness or through a spirit of prevarication.  It is necessary to have law for such cases.  That was all right during the emergency.</P>
    <P>There is now no need to trouble about tillage if farmers are paid reasonable prices for their produce; prices that will give them the cost of production and a small margin of profit.  That would also enable them to pay their workers a decent wage, which they are unable to do at present.  There will then be no need for compulsion.  The average farmer from Cork, Mayo, Donegal or Dublin is anxious to make most of his land.  He is anxious  <Col N="1390" /> and to get down to his work.  I am not referring to slackers or to lazy fellows whose holdings are a disgrace.  There are occasionally a few of these in every county.  If the Minister thinks that he will force compulsion on this country in peace time I am afraid he has a lesson to learn.  The fact is that in regard to compulsion in tillage we are at crossroads. We have to respect the rights of private owners, or otherwise to go a step further towards the Russian model.  As far as I can see, that is where the Government is going.  The Minister for lands went a step along that road and the Minister for Agriculture proposes to follow him.  I can assure both Ministers that farmers will not follow along that road.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister could give the total numbers of prosecutions for non-compliance with tillage Orders during the emergency.  The information will be an indication that farmers were sufficiently public spirited to comply with the regulations when it was pointed out to them that our neutrality was at stake.  I think the Minister's statement was poor recompense for the most important section of our people, who, after Providence, preserved our neutrality.  It is poor recompense to come along now and propose to make permanent Emergency Powers Orders which he found it necessary to impose during the emergency.  The emergency has gone and emergency conditions will go bit by bit.</P>
    <P>Before I leave that subject, I want to say that wheat is an all-important factor and will remain so.  In that respect, I think the findings of the Commission whose report I have here sum up the situation neatly.  Let us by no means lose the knowledge and technique we have gained during the emergency in regard to wheat-growing. If necessary, I would impose compulsion in respect of a small area of wheat to keep up the necessary knowledge and technique because many farmers who were not familiar with wheat-growing, or had not land suitable for wheat-growing, were not able to grow wheat with the same success as that with which they grew oats, barley or any other crops they were accustomed to producing.  The farmer's <Col N="1391" /> trade or profession&mdash;whatever you like to call it&mdash;requires a very long apprenticeship. I can personally vouch for this, that it requires an apprenticeship of 20 years, at the very least, and, even after that period, the farmer has a lot to learn.  In case we should have to face another emergency, I think we should grow a certain amount of wheat, so that we would always have a stock of seed to meet that emergency. We got over the last emergency safely enough, but we do not know what the next three, four or perhaps ten years may hold for us.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the land on the average holding has been gone over in tillage and we have had to change from one field to another, with the result that, in many cases, through lack of fertilisers and proper equipment, we have plundered the land of its fertility. The result is that a good deal of land is not in the state of fertility in which we should like to see it.  That is a very serious situation in case we have to meet an emergency such as that through which we have passed. The Minister and the Government should see to it that every inducement is held out to farmers to restock the land with the fertility of which it was robbed in order to provide the food necessary during the emergency.  That is the next big step.</P>
    <P>It was wonderful that we had it there to call upon for the growing of wheat, of potatoes and of the other necessaries of life.  We surrendered that fertility and converted it into food cheerfully, but the big task in front of many of us now is to bring back the land to its original state of fertility and production, so that, first, the land of the country will go into full production as soon as possible and, secondly, to provide that, if there is any need to call on the reserve of fertility, that reserve will be there.  We want fertilisers made available as soon as possible and at the lowest possible price to all farmers.  During the war, we had to struggle along as best we could with a scarcity of farmyard manure and  other handicaps.  Now that things are coming back slowly.  We should have fertilisers in abundance and at  cheap price, because the  <Col N="1392" /> fertilisers is the first step towards restoring fertility and bringing the land back again into full production.</P>
    <P>Lime is also a very important factor in the farmer's economy.  It would appear that, over 100 years ago, more lime was used than was judicious, with the result that the land became depleted of fertility.  What happened in certain districts&mdash;and I am sure it was pretty widespread&mdash;was that farmers, through not being educated properly in the use of lime, came to regard it as a very dangerous article to handle and so we find in every farm old lime kilns which have been out of use for many years.  This has resulted in the pendulum swinging to the other extreme, to acidity, about which Deputy Hughes spoke.  It is doing great damage in many parts of the country.  It is definitely lowering the quality of grass and is reducing and has reduced the production of wheat in many cases.  It has done damage to many other crops and I suggest that, in addition to the present output of lime from lime kilns, steps should be taken to provide, on a pretty large scale, machinery for turning out ground limestone at fairly reasonable prices and to make that available to the farmers on the terms suggested in the report of the Commission on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>They recommended, with regard to fertilisers, a subsidy of 25 per cent. of the cost of phosphatic fertilisers and in the case of lime, a subsidy of one-third of the cost of ground or burned limestone, delivered to the nearest railway station, to be payable only in respect of land certified as likely to benefit by an application of lime.  The latter part of that, I am afraid, will be very difficult to work.  That is the big problem before us if we are to face up to our responsibilities.  The Minister has not taken account of the recommendations of this commission in many instances.  In the case of tillage, he has deliberately opposed the recommendations of the Majority Report and one Minority Report, and he does not propose to accept their recommendations in respect of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>The farm improvement scheme is definitely a good scheme.  It is a scheme which has produced wonderful <Col N="1393" /> results and which is fully availed of in practically every part of the country. The trouble in that respect is that enough money is not voted each year for it, and I am sure that large numbers of applications have to be turned down annually because there is not money to meet them.  We have done very good work in land reclamation, the improvement of houses, buildings and so on I think Deputy Hughes said that he was opposed to giving farm improvement grants for the erection of out-offices. Out offices are a very important part of farm management, and, in every farm I know, there are not sufficient out-offices. The blame for that cannot be laid on the Department&mdash;it is a direct result of an old system handed down from the British days whereby out-offices are rated the moment they are built.  If there is a loan or grant made in respect of them, there is freedom from rates for seven years, but eventually they are rated, and this has frightened farmers and has compelled them to refrain from adding to their responsibilities by putting up further out-offices.</P>
    <P>In some cases, farmers, in order to reduce their rates, have had to pull down valuable buildings, unroofing them and selling the roof.  I know of one case&mdash;I think, in Kerry&mdash;where a man unroofed a shed 45 feet long by 20 feet wide which he needed for stock and farm implements.  There should be a complete overhaul of the whole matter of farm buildings.  The annual loss of farm equipment alone: tools, tractors, ploughs, machinery of all kinds, horse carts and so on, must come to a very tidy figure by reason of farmers' inability to house them, and the loss through lack of sufficient buildings to house stock and thereby have an increased output of farmyard manure must stand at a very high figure also. We intend to take that matter up with the Minister for Finance at a later stage in regard to the rating question on the ground that it is deliberately upsetting farming economy and deliberately holding back the farmers. Apart from loss in crops because of the insufficiency of farmyard manure, the loss in tools and equipment, which are part and parcel of the farm economy, is very great.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> Now, I come to the question of the crops themselves.  All hay and corn crops should be under the roof in every homestead.  It is all very well to say that the careful farmer will house his crops.  It is quite true that the careful farmer will, but there are many farmers who, through inability and because of their not having sufficient help on the farm, cannot thatch, and the loss in crops because of that is enormous.  I speak from experience here because I myself spent many years on the roads on threshing sets and I know what happens in most farms.  Grain is damaged and destroyed. All during the war years valuable grain was damaged; rats may damage it; and, even where you had thatched haggards, the rain came in and losses ensued there.  Some attempt should be made to rectify that situation.</P>
    <P>The next important item is the insufficiency of farmyard manure.  Very few farms have sufficient out-office accommodation to house enough stock to supply adequately the land with farmyard manure; that was particularly true during the emergency years.  If we had had a sufficiency of farmyard manure we would not have had the same urgent necessity for fertilisers. The result was that we were trying to carry a huge tillage policy with a totally inadequate supply of farmyard manure because of insufficiency of housing accommodation.  Unlike the last speaker, I do want to see the farm buildings brought in under the farm improvements scheme; if that is not done then I want to see a definite section set up in the Department of Agriculture with an adequate supply of capital at its disposal to enable the farmers to build out-offices, repair and enlarge their existing dwellings, and provide suitable shelter for storing grain, etc.</P>
    <P>I come then to the question of pigs. In regard to pigs we find that there is still a further effort going to be made now to do something about the pig trade.  In the past what do we find? We find in the agricultural statistics that the pig population has fallen from 1931 to 1940.  In 1931 it was 1¼ million approximately; in 1935 it had fallen to <Col N="1395" /> 1,087,000; in 1936 it was 1,000,000; the year after it was 134,000, 958,000, 930,000 and then up again to 1,049,000. I shall not speak of the drop during the emergency years, but according to the latest available statistics which we have&mdash;that is for 1945&mdash;we find the pig population is down to 380,000.  In the past we have had a Pigs and Bacon Board in operation.  They reminded me of the fable in Irish history of Balor of the Evil Eye who withered everything he looked upon; everything they touched they blighted it.  They have done that with the pigs and pig trade in this country.  There is too much regimentation and too much interference and they have proved definitely detrimental in this particular aspect of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Commissions and boards have been set up and not in one single instance have I ever heard of producers&mdash;the people who should be there to cooperate and give their advice and pull their weight on such boards&mdash;being invited to do so.  Once again, they are not going to be requested to help.  In Northern Ireland the pig trade went through pretty much the same phases and with the same ups and downs; finally, they were forced there to go back to the point where they set up boards on which the producers were given a voice.  Until the producers here have their say and give the benefit of their experience to such a board or council we cannot expect the best results. You cannot get results from a board constituted purely of civil servants. They probably mean well and do the best they can, but they lack the practical experience which the man on the farm has.  Day by day we are moving closer to a situation where the farmers and producers are being deliberately cold-shouldered and we see the results of that policy.  The present policy is leading us nowhere.</P>
    <P>We would all like to see the time when this country will have every farmer and every holding producing to full capacity.  We are not going anywhere near that at the present time. In the most recent statistics we get some astonishing figures in regard to land.  The total number of land-holders <Col N="1396" /> is round about 384,000; of that number we find 305,000 living on holdings of under 50 acres and 79,000 on holdings of over 50 acres.  We find the total amount of land held in this country under 30 acres is only 2,600,000 while that held by those over 30 acres is 1,200,000.  In effect that means that roughly 18 per cent. of the holdings are under 30 acres; 72 per cent. of the land holders have only 18 per cent. of the land between them.  The fact is that the land problem is really the root cause of all our troubles.  Too many people are living on wretchedly small holdings and there is not a fair or equitable distribution of land.</P>
    <P>To sum up then, we must have cheap and abundant fertilisers.  We must have some scheme for a complete overhaul and rebuilding of out-offices all over the country in order to provide accommodation for crops principally, and also for the housing of stock with a view to the production of farmyard manure, and the housing of farm implements, the losses on which must run into a very considerable figure each year.  We will not have compulsion in regard to tillage; we will not have regimentation.  We have the tillage and we will stick to it.  If the Government and the Minister will give the farmer a reasonable price for his crops and a price which will leave him the cost of production plus a small margin of profit and which will enable him to pay a decent wage to his workers then till  age will be continued.  The wage of the agricultural worker is low but despite that fact the farmer in many instances is unable to pay that wage.  That is a state of affairs which should not obtain in this country.  We want then a foundation stock of wheat in order to retain the experience and technique for the successful and efficient production of this crop and also in order to ensure that in any future emergency we shall have our own stock of seed and shall not be put to the necessity of hunting all over the world for seed at a time when shipping will be engaged in warlike occupations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this Vote to which I wish to direct my brief remarks, that is, the plight of the large masses of people who make such <Col N="1397" /> a contribution to our agricultural activity, the agricultural workers.  Pleas have been made in this House from time to time on behalf of agricultural workers.  It has been pointed out that during the past six years they made a magnificent contribution to the production of food, on which the nation depended for its very existence.  They have had to endure the mockery of everybody paying tribute to their magnificent efforts while looking on with cynical indifference to the poverty which was rapidly making still greater inroads on their standard of life.</P>
      <P>We have been prone to say to the agricultural worker: &ldquo;You have done a magnificent job; you have given of your best to produce the food which the nation required and could not get elsewhere,&rdquo; and then, with cruel cynicism, we have simply declined as a Legislature to take the necessary steps to ensure that these workers were paid a wage commensurate with the valuable services they rendered to the community. I am sorry to say that I see no evidence that this Government has any intention of abandoning the poverty-stricken mentality which continues to associate agriculture and agricultural labour with the lowest standard of life in the country.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows how seriously the value of the £ has shrunk since 1939. It is true to say, even taking the Government's figures, that the £ to-day is worth approximately 10/-.  On that basis, we are paying the agricultural worker, a maximum, throughout the greater portion of the country, of £2, but what we are really giving him in wages is £1 a week compared with 1939 standards.  Does not every Deputy who is honest with himself know perfectly well that neither he nor any member of his family could live on £1 per week?  Does not every Deputy know that it is impossible for an agricultural worker to enjoy even a tolerable standard of living on a wage twice as high as 40/- a week is to-day? Does not everybody know that it is impossible for the agricultural worker, unless he subjects himself almost to an animal standard of living, to subsist on 40/- per week to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine what it means.  The families of agricultural workers are <Col N="1398" /> usually large.  Take it that the average agricultural family consists of a man, a wife and four children.  A wage of 40/- a week means that each member of the family gets 6/8d. on which to live for seven days.  You could not keep a prisoner in Mountjoy or Portlaoighise for 6/8d. a week.  You could not even keep a prisoner on hunger strike on 6/8d. a week in Portlaoighise or Mountjoy. It costs three and four times that to maintain persons in county homes. 6/8d. a week is less than 1/- per day. Is not it a nice commentary on the Government's agricultural policy that, having been in office for 14 years, we have reached a stage, so far as agricultural prosperity is concerned, when the best we could give an agricultural worker, even during the past six years, is a wage standard equal to 1/- per head of his family per day?</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that Deputy Corry in the debate on a Bill to provide holidays for agricultural workers, painted for us a grim and bleak picture of the plight of the agricultural workers? When we were discussing the Bill, the object of which was to provide that agricultural workers would get holidays the same as every other section of the community, Deputy Corry said: &ldquo;What is the use of giving them holidays, sure the poor fellows never have 5/- in their pockets; they have not a decent suit of clothes to wear on Sunday and, if you give them holidays, the only place they can go to is the workhouse.&rdquo;  That was Deputy Corry's contribution to the debate on that occasion and that was the picture he drew of agricultural life in this country.  After 14 years in office, Deputy Corry says his Government is responsible now for an agricultural position which takes the form of less than 1/- a day for those engaged is agriculture, that the agricultural workers have not a decent suit of clothes and that there is no use in giving them holidays because they have no place to go except the county home. Deputy Corry is a farmer.  I think he talks a lot of nonsense in many other respects, but I am perfectly prepared to concede that in respect of agriculture he knows a considerable amount and he probably knows what he is talking about.  It is a fair picture of the plight of the agricultural worker to-day to <Col N="1399" /> say that that description by Deputy Corry generally represents the plight in which they find themselves, but it is not a very high tribute to the Government and is not a great reflection on the intelligence they have brought to bear on the problem of the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister, is he going to do anything to raise the standard of agricultural workers?  They are the most exploited class in the community to-day.  They are engaged in the production of commodities without which the nation cannot exist and they are paid a lower rate of wages than any other class in the community. I do not think the Government can continue to ignore a situation of that kind.  It is bad for agriculture.  It is bad for the country generally.  It is no wonder that agricultural workers in all parts of the country are yearning for the day when the ports will be opened so that they can get away to where work is available at rates of wages which will enable them to lead a better life and to maintain their families in better circumstances than they endure to-day.</P>
    <P>Agricultural workers are paid £4 10s. a week in Britain to-day, regular employment being guaranteed.  Here, they get £2 with, in many instances, broken time.  In many other respects employment in Britain offers for agricultural workers a higher rate of wages for toil not as vigorous or as fatiguing as toil in agriculture in this country is.  But, because we regard the agricultural worker as essential, we clamp him down on the land, we will not give him the same opportunity of getting away as the industrial worker gets.  Freedom is given to the industrial worker to go away, if he so desires, while we say to the agricultural worker: &ldquo;You will not be permitted to enjoy that freedom; we insist on you remaining on the land but we will not insist on your getting a decent rate of wages while we compel you to remain on the land.&rdquo;  The Government has a moral responsibility in this matter, to promote by positive action an increase in wages for agricultural workers so as to rescue them <Col N="1400" /> from the impoverished conditions in which large numbers of them have to exist.</P>
    <P>We have the Agricultural Wages Board.  Frankly, I do not know what its functions are.  So far as agricultural workers are concerned, it might as well never exist.  But we had a statement from the Minister recently that he was contemplating asking that board at least to meet.  If a meeting of the board could produce an El Dorado for agricultural workers, they would have been in it long ago. But the board meets and meets and meets, and the agricultural worker is as poor as ever.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought now to tell the board to meet, to recognise frankly that agricultural workers are grossly underpaid, and to submit recommendations whereby the standard of wages of agricultural workers can be lifted to a level that will take them out of their present poverty-stricken plight and enable them to enjoy a standard of living something higher than they enjoy to-day.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate part of this whole business so far as agricultural workers are concerned is that it is not as easy to organise them as it is to organise industrial workers.  The industrial worker has been able to win for himself a tolerable standard of living by trade union organisation.  It has not been possible to organise the agricultural workers with the same ease as the industrial workers.  I think, however, that agricultural workers are beginning to realise that it is not by reliance on this Government or on the Agricultural Wages Board that their standard of living will be improved, and that, in the long run, it will probably be only satisfactorily improved when they decide to rely on the same weapon of organisation that has lifted the standard of living of the industrial workers.  But the fact that they have not so far embraced in any comprehensive way trade union organisation is no reason why the Government should ride away from their responsibility to lift the standard of living of the agricultural workers.  I hope that when the Minister is replying we will hear something from him as to the positive proposals of the Government in respect <Col N="1401" /> to raising the wages of agricultural workers to a higher level than exists to-day.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in respect of holidays, we had a statement from the Minister recently that he would ask the Agricultural Wages Board to examine this matter of giving the agricultural workers a fortnight's holidays with pay, as is guaranteed by legislation to practically every other class of worker in the community.  I do not know whether the Minister has taken any action since in that matter, but I do not know how a Minister can justify the granting of holidays with pay to every class of industrial worker, to every class of commercial worker, to every class of shop worker, and to domestic servants, and yet say to agricultural workers: &ldquo;You are the one class in the community that is not going to get holidays with pay; we introduced legislation and provided for holidays for every class of industrial workers, but we decline to provide them for agricultural workers who are responsible for producing the foodstuffs on which the nation depends for its existence.&rdquo;  It seems to me that, both in respect to wages and holidays, we treat agricultural workers worse than we ever dared to treat industrial workers.</P>
    <P>While, as I said, I think that probably the best weapon which the agricultural workers can rely upon is the weapon of trade union organisation, the fact that they have not so far embraced that type of organisation, with the same enthusiasm as industrial workers is no excuse for the Government not making a positive contribution to raising the standard of living of the agricultural workers.  In Great Britain they recognised the necessity for doing so, and the results are there for everyone to see.  In other countries, in conditions somewhat comparable to ours, similar positive steps have been taken to raise the level of wages in agriculture, because they realise how vital it is to have a well-balanced agricultural position, and how necessary it is to have prosperity in agriculture. You can never get prosperity in agriculture by paying the unfortunate agricultural worker a sweated rate of wages <Col N="1402" /> and by paying the farmer a price for his produce which is less than the cost of production and which does not give him an adequate return.</P>
    <P>If we are to have real prosperity in this country we can only get it when we recognise that agriculture, being our basic industry and likely to be our main industry for many years to come, is the one in which we ought to endeavour to promote a high measure of prosperity. You can only do that when you give the farmer a decent price for his produce and when you give the agricultural worker a decent price for his labour. In that way you will create wealth in the rural areas, and wealth in the rural areas will demand from the towns and cities manufactured goods and services which, in turn, will provide employment in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>When you create employment and new services in the towns and cities, you create a demand for agricultural produce which cannot be bought at present because of unemployment and the low wage standards in towns and cities.  But, if you bring prosperity to the rural areas, you start an endless chain of prosperity from the rural areas to the towns and cities and back to the rural areas again.  So long as we allow agriculture to be a depressed industry, the farmer to be uncertain as to the price he will get for his produce, the agricultural worker to be ground down to a life of low wages, we will never have prosperity in the rural areas, and we are not likely ever to be able to set up any enduring measure of prosperity in the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I think the Government, therefore, ought to direct their attention to recognising that it is only by stability in price levels, and price levels that will ensure a fair return to the farmer, and, at the same time, a wage standard which will attract workers to remain on the land, that we will have any prospect of lifting agriculture from its present position, and, instead of our bleak agricultural history in the past, placing it in a position which will ensure stability to the farmer in regard to prices, a decent living for the <Col N="1403" /> worker, and an enduring prosperity for the industry as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that if this White Paper issued yesterday morning is to be taken as representing the Government's long distance view of agriculture, then I think the House is entitled to say that it is most disappointing.  We have this rather flimsy looking document of a few pages which purports to deal with the report of a commission, three reports as a matter of fact, a majority report and two minority reports, and to give the Government policy for every aspect of Irish agriculture for the future.  That is the document which is supposed to be the guide and lead for the farmers of the country for the period in which we are living, the particular conditions under which we are living and, what is of very direct importance and has a very direct bearing on this, the conditions in the world generally so far as certain products are concerned.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, this is merely tinkering with this whole question of agriculture. However, I daresay there will be another opportunity provided for dealing in a fuller and more detailed way with this White Paper.  If the Government will not provide the opportunity for that fuller discussion, then I think other Parties in the House will have to take the opportunity of doing it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with the existing situation, there are certain aspects of agriculture upon which I should like to touch.  Let me express again my disappointment at the vagueness and the incompleteness of this White Paper in so far as it deals with what is perhaps the most urgent need of agriculture at the moment, and that is fertilisers.  It is very vague.  I readily admit that there are circumstances completely outside our control and outside the control of the Minister which may influence very much the position with regard to fertilisers.  I am afraid that the vagueness, apart from the incompleteness of this wording, dealing with the provision, the price and the distribution of fertilisers, and the vagueness as to how and when the vouchers which were issued are to <Col N="1404" /> be cashed-in, is deliberate.  If fertilisers are to become available in anything like the quantities that are necessary, there will have to be a complete recasting of the whole method of handling fertilisers before they reach the farmers.  We should have from the Government some indication that close, detailed attention has been given to that very important matter.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with fertilisers I might refer to a matter&mdash;indeed, I am not by any means the first to refer to it&mdash;which, because of its importance, cannot be over-emphasised.  We have been clamouring for fertilisers and bemoaning the way in which the fertility of the soil was exhausted during the last six or seven years.  We were bemoaning the fact that neither artificial manure nor ordinary farmyard manure was available in sufficient quantities.  At the same time, we were deliberately allowing a criminal waste of the most valuable manure of all, liquid manure.  It was flowing into every drain, gully and stream and no attempt was made, either in an individual or national way, to trap that liquid manure and see that it was spread on the land.</P>
    <P>Until such time as steps are taken to put an end to the waste of that invaluable manure and see that it is spread on the land, we are not looking after the restoration of the fertility of our soil in the way in which we should. Have any of the Minister's commissions or committees given the attention to that matter which it deserves? Have they made any recommendations about it?  If they have, I should like to know whether the Minister proposes to take any steps to see that something effective will be done with regard to it.</P>
    <P>I do not want at the moment to deal with lime.  Deputy Blowick referred to it.  He said that in the West of Ireland the complaint was that more lime than was judicious was used.  I think the Deputy would probably be more correct if he said that the lime which was used was not judiciously used.  The probability is that lime was applied to soil which did not require a lime application.</P>
    <P>Next to fertilisers the two greatest <Col N="1405" /> needs of farming, if we are to step-up production and stop the very considerable waste that takes place in relation to what we produce, are the provision of suitable farm buildings and the provision, as soon as it is possible to do so, of proper farm equipment.  I can speak only from personal experience in my own county.  There, perhaps, you will see as good farming as in any average county; I suppose our buildings are not much better or much worse, and I suppose our equipment is the same as will be found in an average county.  Not 10 per cent. of the farmers of this country have sufficient storage for the cereals they produce.  If it had not been for the fact, particularly in the principal wheat-growing areas, that we were able to bring the wheat away from the threshing machine, a considerable quantity of the wheat we produced would have been a dead loss, especially if there was a bad, wet harvest.  It was no use saying to a farmer: &ldquo;Put it into the barn or on the loft,&rdquo; because in nine cases out of ten he had not a loft which would store any corn other than the limited quantity he was keeping for his own requirements.</P>
    <P>I will not deny&mdash;it would be not only untrue but stupid&mdash;that there has been a considerable improvement made in farm buildings during the last 25 years, but that improvement, to a large extent, has been so far as the residence is concerned.  Of course, it is very proper that human beings would be properly housed, but if you are to have proper, economical farming, and cut out a considerable amount of waste, you must have suitable farm buildings.  I am not in any way critical of farmers or their methods. They know far more about their business than I could ever learn.  At the same time, one cannot help observing things, particularly when one is dealing with farmers as closely as I have been for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The way in which corn is stooked in the fields and put into the haggards is not conducive to turning out a first-class article.  I do not say that is true of all farmers, but it is true of certain farmers.  One of the reasons for that is that in later years, and particularly during the war, there was no test <Col N="1406" /> of the quality of the grain.  The same price was paid for the grain, whether it was first-class, second-class or third-class. There was a difference of perhaps half-a-crown a barrel for wheat very well saved.  It is likely that what I am saying may be misrepresented, but this discussion is not likely to be of any use, unless we say about this very important matter what we honestly believe to be the truth.  I am saying this mainly in the hope that steps will be taken to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to barley, which is referred to in various reports and in the White Paper, apparently we are going to have a difference between what is called barley for industrial purposes and barley for feeding purposes, and that it is the intention of the Government to fix prices for industrial barley, in other words, barley required for malting, brewing and distilling, and barley required for feeding. That is going to be done on the assumption that barley sold for other than industrial purposes will necessarily be inferior to barley sold for malting.  That does not always happen.  Take the case of a farmer living in a backward area, in a district where when they are finished everywhere else threshing machines make their way.  That farmer may get anything from 5/- to 15/- per barrel less for his barley&mdash;which is probably not inferior to other barley&mdash;than another farmer who got 35/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of that happening.  It happened because the market for malting barley was filled before the man was able to get his crop threshed.  Although his barley was superior to much of the other barley which was bought for malting, because the market was filled he had to take anything up to 15/- a barrel less than other farmers.  I take it that we will have an opportunity of going into that matter before the Minister puts that part of his policy into operation.</P>
    <P>So far as wheat is concerned, many aspects of that cereal might be discussed. I hope we have now come to the end of this policy of forcing farmers to sow seed on land that will only grow as much wheat as could be grown if it were sown in the middle of Kildare Street. <Col N="1407" /> It is not only grossly unfair to farmers whose land is unfitted to grow wheat, but it is a definite loss of useful labour and of good seed.  The other matter I want to touch upon concerns the handling of pedigree seed.  The present machinery is not by any means the best machinery for the distribution of pedigree seed.  I do not think it is the fairest or the most effective way to deal with it.  I should like to see that matter gone into later.  I am merely referring to it now as there will be another occasion for discussion.  One of the greatest sources of waste and loss to farmers who grew cereals, during the last eight or nine years, was due to the threshing mills that were in operation in many districts.  It is true to say that in a number of cases there was more grain going into the chaff than into the bags, very much to the loss of the farmers and the nation.  I hope some steps will be taken to see that there will be a test of threshing mills and their efficiency, so that there will not be such waste of farmers' hard-won harvest.</P>
    <P>As far as farm equipment is concerned, there are great arrears to be made up, and the capital expenditure that would have to be undertaken by many farmers in order to re-equip their plant will be very large.  We know that many of them have only been able to carry on by improvisations of a most extraordinary kind.  How some of them were able to keep farm machinery working is a mystery.  That is an aspect that also requires the attention of the Government.  I think the Government, in fairness to those employed on the land, ought to see that machinery and equipment is provided at the lowest possible price.</P>
    <P>We passed through this House recently a Bill dealing with turf production on a big scale.  That scheme will cost something in the nature of £4,000,000.  Half of that cost would go to ensure that when the turf is cut what was left behind would be useful soil.  We have a considerable number of unemployed persons in this State, and anybody who travels to the south, either by road or rail, can see hundreds and hundreds of acres of <Col N="1408" /> land growing furze and scrub.  I have made inquiries from people, who are more competent to give an opinion on the subject than I am, and they say that these large areas could be reclaimed in the same way as smaller areas have been reclaimed by farmers, and put into useful production.  That would provide work for many people who, at certain periods, are now drawing unemployment assistance in rural areas, and land which is now wasteful would be made useful.  As far as the policy set out in the White Paper is concerned, I do not think it could be adequately discussed now.  I hope the Minister will provide an occasion for doing so at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>During the past few years I have repeatedly looked forward on this Estimate for the same treatment for the agricultural industry that has been shown towards other industries. On this Vote last year the Minister gave us a guarantee as to the fixation of prices.  He told us he would have some board set up by 31st March this year.  The board has not been set up. I read every word of the Minister's speech which appeared in the public Press to-day&mdash;in every paper&mdash;and I read it eagerly for one purpose, namely, to find out when the Minister responsible for agriculture was going to put the agricultural industry on the same footing as other Irish industries. We want neither subsidies nor doles. We agriculturists want our cost of production, plus a profit, the same as every other industry in the State and the same as we have to pay, as agriculturists, to every other industry, and through the nose at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For every bag of artificial manure that I, as a farmer, put on my land, I have to pay for the wages and the bonus of Messrs.  Goulding's employees and for their fortnight's holidays as well and, in addition, I have to pay for the wages and bonus of the Córas Iompair Eireann employees and their holidays as well.  The whole lot is thrown down in one lump on the man who cannot pass it on, the man who has nobody to pass it on to, and the man who is deprived of the right which every other industrialist is entitled to <Col N="1409" /> and gets, namely, the right to go before a tribunal to put his case for his cost of production, plus a profit.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's statement as to the future of tillage.  There was set up here a few years ago a commission to inquíre into post-war agriculture, a commission composed of over-paid and over-fed professors, men with no knowledge of their subject.  If they are the people who are teaching and educating our young men, our young instructors on agriculture to-day, may God help the country, so far as agriculture is concerned.  I find that the greater number of their recommendations are being implemented here by the Minister. The Minister says we are to have only 150,000 acres of wheat now as against 642,000 acres last year.  I wonder has the Minister got any guarantee from Messrs. Joseph Stalin and Company that they will give him 12 months' notice of the next war, so that he will be able to expand his 150,000 acres to 300,000 in the one year?  Will he get 12 months' notice?  I had hoped that the bread of the people of this country would never again be jeopardised. In 1939, we had some 275,000 acres of wheat.  This acreage of 150,000 is 125,000 acres less than the acreage we started with in 1939.</P>

    <P>I am glad to hear that the statement is wrong.  I certainly would feel very doubtful about subscribing to any policy that would have the effect of jeopardising the bread needed for the sustenance of the women and children <Col N="1410" /> of this country.  Since it is to be 250,000 acres instead of 150,000 acres, I take it that the conditions as regards the price of wheat will be practically the same as pre-war.  I should like to hear definitely from the Minister whether it is his intention to set up some costings tribunal before which the farmer can go and put up his case for the cost of production, plus a profit, for what he has to sell.</P>
    <P>The Minister, if the <i>Irish Press</i> is correct, made the further statement that he would need 40,000 acres of sugar beet, which could be expanded to 80,000 acres.  Does that mean that the four sugar factories are to work on a 50 per cent. reduction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that the beet factories are to work half time, or we are to import cane sugar.  The Minister, of course, is aware that the farmer is entitled to a home market for what he <Col N="1411" /> can produce and that he will not stand for the wiping out by anybody of that home market.  During the years in which the people of this nation had to be fed and in which we could not go abroad for materials to feed them, we were very glad to have the agricultural community to produce 600,000 acres of wheat and from 85,000 to 90,000 acres of beet per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I claim on behalf of the agricultural community of this country that we are entitled to the home market for our produce since we are compelled to buy in the home market the products of other industries.  If we have to go to Messrs.  Gouldings for our bag of manure there and pay a price for it so that our Irish workers may be employed in the production of that sack of manure, we are equally entitled to the home market for our agricultural produce and those Irish workers should be compelled to eat the produce of the Irish farmers and Irish agricultural labourers combined.  The same holds equally true of other commodities that are produced here.  There should be a protected home market for the Irish farmer.  We shall tolerate no quibbling on that issue.  In that home market we claim the cost of production plus a certain margin of profit.  Our position has been too long deferred on that issue.  Only to-day I saw that the wages of agricultural labourers have been increased by something in the region of 8/- per week.  The price of beet was fixed three years ago.  Since then agricultural labour has received an increase of 5/- per week.  The cost of artificial manures went up.  The cost of farm machinery rose rather steeply. The price of beet remained at the same level at which it was fixed three years ago.  The moment that a Bill was passed through this House for holidays for industrial workers every industrial firm in the country went to the Department of Industry and Commerce and there obtained permission to add on to the cost of the commodities, which we have to buy, the cost of the holidays for their workers.  We claim the same right on behalf of the agricultural community. We claim that the agricultural worker should be placed on as good a <Col N="1412" /> level as regards wages and other conditions as the industrial workers.</P>
    <P>The agricultural community of this country had to carry this country on its back for the last six years.  They did it.  They did it nobly and well. There was no growl; there was no complaint. I have seen men working in the fields for 15 and 16 hours a day endeavouring to save the harvest so that the people might be fed.  When we come then to examine agriculture and to examine the condition of affairs under which 495,000 agricultural workers have to work at a wage which is laid down by statute somewhere in the region of £2 per week and compare that with the wage of their comrades in industry, then the Minister need not trouble very much about the reclamation of land, about which Deputy Morrissey is so anxious, because there will be nobody there to do it.  The man who continues to hold land to-day is, in my opinion, an idiot.</P>
    <P>I happened to look over some particulars with regard to Irish industry and I saw that there are from 15 to 16 industries each one of which is paying anything from 6 to 10 per cent. on the money invested in them. Where is the farmer going to get his 6 to 10 per cent?  Deputy Morrissey mentioned barley.  The price of barley was held at 35/- per barrel in this country during the emergency.  During the 1914-18 war the price of barley was 52/- per barrel. I know because that was the price I got.  Messrs. Guinness can pay 12 per cent. per half-year on their shares &mdash;that is, 24 per cent. altogether.  These are matters which, in my opinion, have waited too long for rectification. The sum total of the Minister's proposals in regard to agriculture would mean a reduction of some 20 million odd pounds in the farmers' gross income.  That is a reduction on wheat, beet, and the opening of the free market for maize and feeding stuffs which would wipe out our oats and barley completely.  All those things would mean a total reduction of some £20,000,000.  I suggest to the Minister that an alternative market to give the farmer back that £20,000,000 simply does not <Col N="1413" /> exist.  The home market is going to be wiped out and replaced by foreign imports.  If that is the position then I suggest to the Minister that the time has arrived when the Irish farmer will no longer be able to buy bar iron for his horse shoes at £38 per ton in the home market when he can get the same material from Britain at £17 a ton.  If the farmers' home market is to be sacrificed and if the market we have here is to go, then I certainly should not be asked to help to protect Irish industry and to pay more for what I have to buy here than the price in the world market.  If it is sauce for the goose then it is sauce for the gander.  I suggest to the Minister now that he should set up another post-war commission on agriculture and that he should put on it practical farmers, either from this House or outside of it, who know something about agriculture and who will be able to advise the Minister as to what is necessary for the future of agriculture in this country.  Is all the work that has been done in this country in the last few years in order to put agriculture on its feet now to be sacrificed to the schemes of a few free-trade professors who were placed in a position of some power by being put on a commission inquiring into agricultural policy?  If that is so, then I say God help the country and God help the agricultural community in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that in 1939, when the war came, he found that in certain districts the technique of tillage had been lost and that there was also a loss of skilled labour.  How long does the Minister expect the skilled labour&mdash; the farmer, the farmer's son, the agricultural labourer&mdash;will remain on the land under present conditions?  A month ago I was on a deputation to the Minister in regard to the price of winter-produced milk supplied to the City of Cork.  I gave him costings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not believe the costings that have been given and that are the result of the work of six farmers during the past 12 months, let him ask some of the 12 farms that this State is paying for to produce costings for him.  Let him take, for instance, the 20 or 25 cows of the University farm in Cork and let him find how much per gallon it is costing to produce milk there.  Let him either accept the costings that have been offered or produce some costings to refute them, prepared by some of those farms for which the taxpayers are paying. It may surprise him to learn that one set of those costings was compiled at his University farm and that the only change in it is the change in the price of the feeding stuffs to-day as compared with the price in 1936.  If the expert who is in charge of that farm, and who succeeds in running it at a loss of £1,200 a year, was considered wise enough to be put on a commission, to tell us what to do with our land in future, and the Minister tells us now that he does not believe these costings, it is rather an extraordinary position. That is the situation as I look at it.</P>
      <P>There is no use in the Minister talking about skilled labour on the land or the technique of tillage, if we have a condition of affairs in which we will not get the cost of production for what we produce on the land.  A year ago, the Minister told us that he was in favour of fixed price and that prices should be fixed for everything in the home market.  That was on the 24th May, 1945.  May, 1946, has come and gone and we have got no statement yet as to what tribunal the farmers are to go to to present their costs of production and to have prices fixed on a profit basis. I must say that the statement made by the Minister yesterday has given me a feeling of very deep disappointment. I do not think the present condition of affairs in agriculture can continue.  I do not see any hope of a future in agriculture unless the agricultural industry is put on the same basis as every other industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey alluded to pedigree seed and pedigree wheat.  A rather extraordinary position has arisen in that connection this year.  We succeeded <Col N="1415" /> in getting an offer of seed wheat from Sweden.  We got as far as having it lying on the quayside in Sweden.  It was stopped by the Minister's Department.  When I was travelling to Dublin in the train to-day I met a farmer who had eight acres of that wheat sown.  The wheat that was not allowed to come in to the farmers of Cork was allowed in to Dr. Kennedy and distributed by him among certain co-operative societies in Tipperary. He has 200 barrels of Progress wheat, an improved Atle, that the Minister's officials refused, by telephone, to allow to be brought in to Messrs.  Suttons of Cork.  As I have said, I met a farmer to-day from Tipperary who has eight acres of it sown, under contract, of course, to a monopoly, who will see that the produce of that seed goes back to be resold to the unfortunate farmer again, next year, at 96/- per barrel.  The seed was grown by a farmer in Holycross, Thurles, County Tipperary, who got it from Ballyduff Co-operative.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I should like to touch on.  It is in connection with the small holders of the West.  Some Deputies were angry with me some time ago when I made certain allusions to them.  I suggest that the Minister's Department should hand over the growing of small seeds to those small holders of under £10 valuation. These are crops with a very big labour content.  They are crops that can easily yield a gross income of roughly £80 to £100 per acre.  They are crops for the small farmer.  One might say that £80 of the £100 is labour content.  They are ideal crops for small holders, on which they can employ their young people at home, and their family, and which will bring in an income on small holdings on which otherwise they cannot exist.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that those monopolies which have been set up in connection with turnip and mangold seed, etc. should, instead of having those seeds grown on 150 and 200-acre farms, have the growing of them reserved for the small holders.  The same thing should apply to the Sugar Beet Company and beet seed.  That would undoubtedly relieve these small <Col N="1416" /> holders to a large extent and would help them out in endeavouring to exist on their small holdings.  I put that suggestion to the Minister.  I consider that the step the Minister is taking in regard to the future of agriculture in following the advice of professors who know nothing about land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I consider that, if there is any further delay in setting up some tribunal to fix the prices of agricultural produce on an economic basis, that will fail also.  In 12 months' time, in my opinion, you will neither have a farmer's son nor an agricultural labourer working on the land here under the present conditions of agriculture as I know them.</P>

      <P>Last year we debated this particular Estimate under a certain disadvantage, inasmuch as the Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy Commission had completed its work at that time, but its report was not before the country.  This year, our discussion should be of very great importance, because we have now had the reports of the Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy Commission and we have had, in addition, the White Papers setting out the Government's policy based on these reports.  First of all, I want to say that the reports of the Agricultural Commission were particularly disappointing in this respect, that the members of the commission were unable to reach any broad basis of agreement in regard to agricultural policy.  I would say, without casting any reflection on the gentlemen who constituted that commission, that they fell down completely on their job. Their job was to present to this House and to the Government the broad outline of a sound agricultural policy.  Instead of doing so, they presented three conflicting reports, three conflicting policies, and left the Minister to pick and choose between them, as he joyfully did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> I agree with Deputy Corry that it was a mistake to put professors and theorists on a job of this kind.  It is very easy to farm on paper.  The crops that you grow never fail; they never get lodged or damaged by the weather. The pigs that you rear never get any sickness and the cows that you keep never go wrong.  But it certainly is an unsound basis upon which to shape agricultural policy.  A few practical men who have had to rough it in agriculture for the past 20 years, to bear all the ups and downs of price fluctuations and all the difficulties which arise from failing crops and diseases in livestock, would have been able to put up a much more practical policy to the Minister than the learned professors who knew all about statistics, who knew all about average figures, but who never had to go out in the rain and sleet and endure the hardships, the difficulties, the anxieties and the joys of practical farming.  With three conflicting reports before him, the Minister was starting off on an unsound foundation to shape agricultural policy.  He had, I might say, no sound, solid guide by which to direct his planning. Therefore, taking the line of least resistance, he picked from the conflicting reports whatever particular lines he thought it would be possible to put across on the country.  Therefore, we have three reports submitted to us and three unsatisfactory White Papers suggesting the lines on which agricultural policy should be shaped&mdash;first, for dairying, secondly, for the pig and bacon industry and, thirdly, for crops and pasture.</P>
    <P>In regard to dairying, I intend only to touch upon it very lightly because I am not a dairying farmer.  I am more concerned with the type of mixed farming which we conduct in the Leinster counties.  I feel, however, that a fundamental mistake was made in this plan for the dairying industry, inasmuch as the Minister, instead of finding out, first of all, what would be just and fair prices for dairy produce and guaranteeing these prices to the producer, took the rough and ready plan of assuming that the prices for 1935 were fair and basing future prices upon that basic year.  We all know that the dairying industry, through its various <Col N="1418" /> organisations, has brought it home very forcibly to the Minister that the prices fixed for 1935 were not fair and just. But, in addition to that, we have the fact that the fluctuations which are to take place in the prices for the future are to be based on the rising or falling of costs of certain foodstuffs required in the industry.  The Minister admitted last night that the most important factor in costs of production is not to be taken into consideration in future; that is the wages of workers in the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not admit that it was the most important factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that it is a fundamental factor which has got to be considered, because fair prices for the farmer must be based on some foundation and, unless they are based on a fair wage for those engaged in the industry, they have no significance at all.  You can give the farmer a fair price based on costs of feeding-stuffs, rents, rates, and other costs, but, if you leave out the labour factor, the remuneration for labour, you are leaving out the foundation upon which costs should be based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this Party put forward a motion some time last year demanding guaranteed prices for a considerable number of the products of agriculture. In that motion we suggested that those prices should be based on fair remuneration for the workers in the industry; that that should be the fundamental basis upon which fair prices should be planned, because unless you do that there is no use in talking about fair prices at all.  You can always claim that a price of 4d., 5d. or 6d. a gallon for milk is fair provided it is based on a very low wage for the farm worker, the farmer and the members of his family.  The most important matter in fixing fair prices for agricultural products is the remuneration of the workers engaged. If we consider the subject in its broadest aspects, we must admit that the one thing wrong with agriculture for the past 100 years&mdash;and I am not holding the Minister responsible for such a prolonged period&mdash;has been <Col N="1419" /> that the wages of those engaged in the industry, not only the employed workers but the farmers and their families, have been very low in proportion to the remuneration paid in ordinary industries.</P>
    <P>To-day, Deputy Norton, stressing the fact that remuneration in agriculture is still low, pointed out what everybody knows, that it was through the organisation of industries that the standard of remuneration in industry was raised.  We have a position in which the income of those engaged in industry is 100 per cent. higher than in agriculture.  That has been so for a very long period.  We hear a lot about stabilised prices, guaranteed prices and fair prices in the dairying industry, the pig and bacon industry and in other branches of agriculture, but those who talk omit a most important factor, and that is that the people working in the industry should be reasonably paid.  If you overlook that aspect you completely by-pass the foundation upon which agricultural prosperity must be based.</P>
    <P>There are people who hold that agricultural prices should be regulated by the ordinary law of supply and demand.  That might be fair enough provided all other prices were so fixed, but we know that does not operate. Even before we had protective tariffs for industries, we know that the standard of remuneration in industry was 100 per cent. higher than in agriculture. As Deputy Norton pointed out, the industrial workers were organised. Therefore, the law of supply and demand did not operate in fixing the prices of industrial products; they were fixed by political action, by trade union action, or by some other method outside the ordinary economic laws of business.  Farmers and farm workers, unfortunately, were left to bear the effects of the law of supply and demand and to bear, in addition, the higher cost of industrial products secured through organised action on the part of those engaged in industry.</P>
    <P>On top of that, our own Government, during the past ten or 15 years, proceeded to protect our manufacturing concerns and that still further increased <Col N="1420" /> the disparity between industrial and agricultural remuneration. The time has now come, in planning our future agricultural policy, to remedy that state of affairs and bring the remuneration of farmers and their workers up to the average standard enjoyed in industry.  I am not suggesting that everybody engaged in agriculture should have the same income as those in industry.  We know there are certain amenities in the country, certain commodities which are cheaper than in the cities and larger centres of population, but at least the income of those engaged in agriculture should bear relation to the income of those engaged in industry.  That is the fundamental basis upon which agricultural policy for the future must be calculated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry bombards the Minister from a Government bench, but never have I known him to go into the division lobbies to support our Party when we challenged Government policy and sought to change it.  We submitted the motion demanding guaranteed prices based on a fair remuneration for those engaged in agriculture, but Deputy Corry did not appear in the division lobby to support it.  I hope he will some time have the courage of his convictions and not only attack the Minister orally but will also emphasise his words by direct action by coming into the division lobby and supporting the demands made by this Party.</P>
    <P>When we advocated guaranteed prices the Minister gave us a vague promise that he would implement our wishes.  Those three White Papers appear to be his attempt to implement that promise.  I think every farmer will agree that they are hopelessly disappointing and gloomy documents on which to base the future of agriculture. As far as the document issued yesterday with regard to compulsory tillage is concerned, I think the proposals contained in the report stand completely condemned.  The majority report and one of the minority reports of the Post-Emergency Agricultural Commission strongly condemn compulsory tillage in normal times.  I hold that the grounds upon which they condemn that policy are sound and reasonable. It was suggested in one of the <Col N="1421" /> first minority reports, and it was stated by the Minister yesterday, that it is desirable to fix a minimum which the farmer must be compelled to till in order to maintain the technique of tillage in all areas and in order to induce the farmer to take the plough around all parts of his farm.  I think it was also stated in the White Paper that compulsory tillage would tend to increase the fertility of the more inferior pastures.  I do not think there is any substance in that statement.  Compulsory tillage will not improve the fertility of inferior pastures.  I have stated in this House, and candidly admit, that there are large areas of pasture which are very inferior and that yield a very small return.  It is those thousands of acres of poor pasture land that, to a great extent, are bringing down the level of production in the total of the agricultural industry.  What effect will compulsory tillage have on poor pasture land?  It will mean that farmers will be compelled to plough up more inferior land, to put a grain crop into it, and then, probably with inadequate farmyard manure, to let that land out again.  If they put grass seed into it, the land being so poor, the seed will die within a year, and the land will go back to moss and herbage.  What poor pastures urgently require is careful nursing back into fertility.</P>
    <P>That can only be brought about by a better system of husbandry.  It will not be brought about by any form of compulsion.  What inferior pasture land requires in most cases is plenty of organic and chemical manures and lime.  It is the deficiency of humus and other chemical ingredients in the soil that makes it so impoverished. Until these necessary ingredients are put back into the soil, it is not going to be productive, no matter how it is ploughed or cultivated.  The Minister talks about the desirability of taking the plough around the farm.  I agree that it is desirable to take the plough around that portion of the farm that is arable.  There again there is no guarantee that that is going to be achieved by compulsion.  Inducement and encouragement will lead the farmer to cultivate his land.  I mean by fair and reasonable inducement, <Col N="1422" /> fair prices for produce, which will encourage farmers to carry on a good system of mixed tillage farming. Compulsion will not affect the average farmer who, in the ordinary course, would be tilling much more than any quota that might be fixed by the State in normal times.  As far as the other type of farmer is concerned, the man who does not carry on a fair system of mixed tillage, if he is forced to till, in all probability he will concentrate on a very inferior type of tillage, which would only tend to deteriorate the land, and add nothing to the sum total of the production of the farm.</P>
    <P>In 1944 this Party introduced a motion having for its object the promotion of tillage.  We based that policy of promoting tillage on the policy adopted in Great Britain prior to and during the war years, that of paying a bounty on land under tillage.  I think we put forward a well-reasoned case for that motion.  We pointed out that there were two ways of getting increased tillage and increased production from the soil, one by compulsion, and the other by inducement.  We stated that the method of inducement in normal times and in a normal community is by far the best method.  We pointed out that the method of compulsion, as Deputy Blowick pointed out, leads to the setting up of absolutism or communism. The method proposed by the Minister for Agriculture in the White Paper will mean that farmers will be compelled to till a certain portion of their land.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that they are not merely complying with the wording of the regulation, but with the spirit of it, that they are tilling the land properly, it will be necessary to have an army of inspectors going through the country to enforce it.  A farmer will be in the position of having one inspector telling him what to do, another inspector standing telling him how to do it, and a third inspector behind him telling him that if he does not carry out the order other steps will be taken.  That condition of affairs is not going to make for a prosperous and contented agricultural community. It will be heading straight for a position in which farmers will become <Col N="1423" /> serfs; in which they will step down to the position now occupied by slave peasantry in Eastern Europe and in Siberia.</P>
    <P>Great celebrations have been held throughout this State in memory of a man named Michael Davitt.  The main achievement of Michael Davitt was the winning of freedom for farmers, freedom from rack-renting landlords, and freedom from dictation.  Now we are to have a new system of tyranny imposed on us.  The tyranny of the landlord is dead and gone, but the tyranny of the bureaucrat is going to be substituted. The bureaucrat will send down an agent to see how the farmer is carrying out his operations, and to insist upon his doing so in accordance with certain rules and regulations that have been set down on paper.  That is a condition which no man who understands agriculture, or who understands the necessity of maintaining a free, social and economic population here, will tolerate.  There is no use in pretending to build a democratic State here if it is to be based upon a peasantry that is slave driven.  If we acknowledge the right of the State to slave drive farmers in this particular direction, we will have to accept its right to slave drive the farmer in every other direction.  As far as the position envisaged by the Compulsory Tillage Order is concerned, the view of it expressed to me by a farmer was, that he would not be able to throw out a forkful of manure without hitting an inspector of some kind in the face.</P>
    <P>In planning agricultural policy, we ought to put a certain amount of confidence in the farmer, to rely upon his intelligence and to seek his co-operation. There are people who say there should be no subsidies and no State aids of any kind for agriculture. The farmer does not want subsidies or State aids of any kind, but he does want justice, and he does want fair remuneration, a fair return for his work, and if that return is not ensured by the ordinary laws of supply and demand, it is right that the State should guarantee such a return, and that is the basis upon which agricultural policy should rest.  That is why <Col N="1424" /> I say that, in connection with the dairying industry, the farmer should be guaranteed a fair price based on his cost of production, based again on fair wages.</P>
    <P>In regard to pig production, exactly the same rules should apply.  Pig production is a very important industry and it is particularly important for the smaller farmers and the farmers on the inferior land.  It is particularly important for those farmers who cannot derive much profit from growing wheat, beet or other such cash crops.  The farmer on the poorer land will find it more profitable to grow whatever crops he can on his land, to feed them to his pigs, poultry and other live stock and to sell that produce as a finished animal.  That is why we should go all out to encourage pig production, but again is it necessary to nationalise completely the pig and bacon industry as is envisaged in the Minister's White Paper?  Is it necessary to put every pig buyer off the road and to replace him by a Government official?  Is it necessary to take complete control of the bacon factories throughout the length and breadth of the country?  I do not believe for one moment that it is.</P>
    <P>All the farmer wants in regard to pig production is the guarantee of a fair minimum price and then the factories can collect their pigs by whatever methods they think best.  Give the maximum amount of freedom not only to the farmer but to the industrialist and businessman.  Give them all the maximum amount of freedom, because the more we regulate and the more we introduce politics into business, the further we get away from the sound, clean traditions of business and industrial transactions.</P>
    <P>The oil of politics does not mix well with the water of commerce and industry, and we ought to proceed very cautiously in regard to taking complete control of the bacon-curing industry. If it is necessary in regard to the sale of our surplus bacon produce, I would be agreeable to the setting up of an expert organisation, a board of some kind, but I think it is not necessary completely to nationalise the industry as is envisaged in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> It is difficult to know in accordance with what guiding principles the Minister has shaped his policy in regard to tillage products&mdash;wheat, sugar beet, barley and oats.  I have on frequent occasions advocated that the farmer should be guaranteed a reasonable price for wheat based again on the cost of production and on fair remuneration for the worker.  What is the future policy of the Government in regard to wheat?  The policy is to force down the acreage to something less than half what it is at present.  The Minister did not say by what method he proposes to force down the acreage of wheat, but we are led to infer from his statement that the method will be by a reduction in price.  By reducing the price of wheat, the farmer will be discouraged from growing the acreage he is growing at present, and thus the acreage will be brought down to what the Minister thinks is sufficient; but here the Minister is departing completely from the guiding principle of fair prices.  There is no question of fair prices here at all.  It is simply a matter of such reduction as will bring about the reduction in the acreage.  The same applies to sugar beet.  We know that at present something in the neighbourhood of 80,000 acres of sugar beet are grown.  It is proposed to bring that down to 40,000 acres.  How do you propose to bring it down?  Do you propose to go to each farmer and say: &ldquo;You must not grow any more than a certain acreage,&rdquo; or is it proposed to discourage the farmers by reducing the price?  I think these are matters in regard to which the farmers will have a good deal to say in the near future. The price of beet has been very unsatisfactory, as other Deputies have pointed out, for the last three or four years, owing to the fact that costs have increased very much, whereas the price remained stationary during that period.</P>
    <P>With regard to barley, the Minister is making a very peculiar arrangement. He proposes to set up an organisation, another board.  The Minister seems to have a great love for these boards, in common with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I think it was the late Mr. Tim Healy <Col N="1426" /> who said of the British Government that they had given Ireland enough boards to make her coffin.  I think the Minister for Agriculture has given agriculture many more boards than would make a coffin for the entire industry, and I think we ought to view these newly established boards, with all their regulations and controlling powers, with great suspicion and caution.  This proposed board will purchase all the barley produced, both malting barley and feeding barley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the malting barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the barley required for feeding.  It will also purchase all the maize required as a feeding stuff, and, whatever is required to supplement the price of barley, will be added to the price of maize and thereby to the people engaged in the feeding of pigs and poultry.  Thus, we shall have the position in which those who are engaged in the production of pigs and poultry will be called upon to subsidise those who are engaged in the growing of barley.  Now, I do not think that that is a sound proposition.  I am not one of those people who are fundamentally or rigidly opposed to subsidies in every shape and form but I do not think that the pig and poultry industries are the industries which should bear the cost of this particular subsidy. Before I go any further I would like to revert for a moment to pig production and to point out that, notwithstanding all the nationalisation and all the communisation and all the socialisation proposed in regard to the pig and bacon industry, the Minister was unable to give any definite guarantee that the price to the producer would be fair and just.  In fact he expressed grave doubts with regard to the future.  What is all this sacrifice of the rights of private ownership in the bacon curing industry and in the production of pigs and so on being made for when the producer cannot be given a guarantee of a fair price ultimately for his produce?  That is the position in regard to pig production. The pig producer, nothwithstanding all these grandiose schemes, will still have to undertake grave risks in regard to the future and at the same time he will have to subsidise the <Col N="1427" /> barley grower to any extent the Minister may consider desirable.</P>
      <P>I think that proposition is altogether wrong.  I have never stood for purely destructive criticism.  Any time I have come into this House to speak on agriculture I have always tried to be constructive. I think the best policy to adopt in regard to the growing of barley would be to organise the growers into one big co-operative organisation. There is a strange tendency in recent years on the part of the Government to keep away from agricultural cooperation and to go more and more towards bureaucratic control.  The Department of Agriculture does not appear to trust co-operative societies or co-operative organisations.  The Minister has more confidence in regulation and control and all the other methods carried into effect directly by the officials of his Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be patient.  I am coming to it.  I hold that such a co-operative organisation should purchase all the barley grown in this country.  It should have nothing to do with maize.  It should purchase both the malting barley and the barley required for feeding stuffs and it should then make its bargain with the maltsters, supply them with whatever barley they require, and sell the surplus to the mills.  This particular organisation should adjust the price fairly between feeding barley and malting barley.  I am not one of those who hold that feeding barley should carry <Col N="1428" /> exactly the same price, or very near it, as malting barley.  I think it would be better if there were some little margin between the two because one of the main objectives of agricultural policy should be to encourage the farmer to use the maximum amount of barley on his own farm and not to encourage him by means of a high price for feeding barley to put his produce into a sack and send if off his farm.</P>
      <P>That is neither the best nor the soundest agricultural policy.  I think that such an organisation, handling both the malting barley and the feeding barley, would deal with the barley situation much more efficiently and in a much fairer manner than it would be dealt with if there were a combined organisation dealing with both maize and feeding barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now another aspect of this question which would be covered by my suggestion of a co-operative organisation.  In the past it has been a long-standing grievance in the barley-growing areas that before the price of barley was fixed&mdash;I am speaking now of the normal pre-war years&mdash; the barley was placed in the stores of the maltsters.  That was always an unsatisfactory position.  I think that the co-operative organisation which I envisage would be in a position to collect the barley from the farmer and store it; that organisation could then make their bargain with the maltsters. They would be in a stronger position to make such a bargain than the position in which the farmer is when his barley is already in the maltster's loft. I think that along those lines the question of growing barley in a satisfactory manner would be solved.  I also hold that the barley should be grown for this co-operative organisation by contract.  This organisation would be in a position to know long in advance what approximate tonnage of barley they would receive at the end of the year and they would be able to make their plans accordingly.  In the working out of such a scheme it might be found desirable to have those who grow barley for malting contract separately from those who grow it for feeding-stuffs. These are all matters of detail which could be worked out.  I think <Col N="1429" /> that would be a sounder scheme than the proposal to put an additional burden upon those already engaged in poultry and pig production by making them bear the cost of subsidising barley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean they will have to take what they get for the barley?  They will have to take the bargain price&mdash;whatever that is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out that in this connection we should be concerned, first of all, with malting barley and I would be inclined to put the growers of malting barley on a separate contract and to distribute the acreage of malting barley equitably over all the barley growers in the same way as you have the beet growing acreage distributed equitably over the different areas.  In that way the barley grower would be assured, at any rate, that he would get a decent price for his barley required for malting; I think in having got that he would be in a position then to take his chance in regard to the feeding barley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my submission in regard to barley, that the farmer would get a fair price and the organisation would see that he gets a fair price for his malting barley.  I would not be so much inclined to bolster up the price of feeding barley.  Neither would I be so much inclined to bolster up the price of feeding oats.  Policy should be directed towards encouraging the utilisation of feeding oats and feeding barley on the farmer's own farm, rather than to encourage him, by some artificial inflation of price, to sell that produce and send it on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy believes in that, it is all right&mdash;that the farmer need not be encouraged to produce feeding barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>For sale, unless there is an urgent demand for it.  I think the price of feeding barley, as it is a raw material for the agricultural industry, should be governed by the ordinary economic laws.  The same, of course, applies to that percentage of oats, which is the larger portion of the oat crop, which is required as a feeding stuff.  I would not be inclined to bolster up the price of feeding oats. That should take its chance in the open market.  Here also it should be possible to guarantee a section of oat growers a fair price for their oats. That is, people who grow oats for industrial purposes, for distilling, malting, oat milling.  These farmers should be guaranteed a fair price, provided, of course, that they grow under contract in the same way as the beet crop is grown at present.  I think that can be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to emphasise is that we ought to have a range of agricultural products guaranteed a reasonable price and that this range should be sufficiently wide to take in all types of farmers.  There are large areas in this country which cannot grow wheat or beet.  These areas should be assured of a guaranteed fair price for pigs and pig products and, possibly, for a <Col N="1431" /> limited acreage of oats and, possibly also, for a limited acreage of potatoes grown for seed purposes.</P>
    <P>These are the lines which we of this Party have consistently advocated.  If you want to do what the Minister sets out in his White Paper, that is, to get as big an acreage of tillage as possible, and to take the plough over the entire farm, the Minister should go back to the proposal which we laid before this House two years ago, that is, the proposal for a tillage bounty.  A tillage bounty has many advantages.  It benefits the farmer who tills his land but who uses his entire tillage produce as feeding stuff on his own farm.  That man will be induced and encouraged to till.  It benefits also the farmer who wants to replenish and freshen up his old, inferior pastures by tillage and to reseed it with fresh grass-seeds. It will encourage such a farmer to undertake that work.</P>
    <P>Again, as I pointed out when introducing that motion, a tillage bounty does not impose greater cost upon the general community than would the proposal which Deputy Corry has outlined, namely, the proposal for fair prices for the farmer.  If you set out to give the farmer fair prices for his produce, you can take the tillage bounty into account in estimating costings.  You can regard the tillage bounty as a reduction in the farmer's costs of production, and it will not be necessary then to fix as high a price as would otherwise be necessary.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of costings.  Here again, our Party suggested to the Government, by way of motion, that costings in agriculture should be accurately ascertained.  We suggested that the only way accurately to ascertain costings in agriculture would be to have experimental farms owned and run by the Department of Agriculture in every agricultural district. It is only in that way that the Department can find out definitely, once and for all, what it costs to grow an acre of wheat, to produce a gallon of milk or a dozen eggs.  If the Department had their own farms in every agricultural district, operated according <Col N="1432" /> to the ordinary commercial rules of farming, not specialised farms concentrating on certain lines for which there would be only a limited market, but carried on in the same way as the ordinary farmer must carry on his farm, then we could have what Deputy Corry advocates, a fair system of costings upon which fair prices could be based.  But, until the Department is prepared to take its courage in its hands and run such farms in every county in the State, we cannot have fair costings that the Department can stand over and that everybody must accept.  The Minister, in interrupting Deputy Corry, said that he did not accept the costings submitted by Deputy Corry, a few weeks ago, in regard to milk production.  He said he did not believe those costings.  That state of affairs will always continue until you have official costings which cannot be disputed or gainsaid.  Costings based upon a fairly substantial number of agricultural holdings run by the Department throughout the State would be fair and just and could be accepted, not only by the Department but by the farming community.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that in the White Papers the Minister has made no reference to the admirable suggestion put forward, I think, in all the reports of the Post-War Committee, that is, that fertilisers should be subsidised to the extent of 25 per cent., and lime, I think, to the extent of one-third.  It is a strange thing that the Minister seems to have passed over that suggestion.  He seems to have overlooked it in his haste to get out this last White Paper in time for this Estimate.  It is a pity, because there is nothing more important or more essential at the present time than the ploughing into the soil of adequate supplies of chemical fertilisers and of lime.  Until that problem is tackled in a business like way no amount of compulsory tillage, no amount of regimentation of those engaged in agriculture will achieve any lasting result. The fertility of the soil must definitely be stepped up and deficiencies which are in the soil at present must be supplied. That is essential and it must be the first step to prosperity and productivity in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> I have tried to deal with the policy outlined by the Minister in the proposals which he has put before us and with the suggested legislation which he has outlined in these reports and I have endeavoured to be constructive.  I hope that in framing agricultural policy the Minister will be guided by the advice which he has obtained from this Party and from farmer Deputies of other Parties.  Agriculture is too important to be made a purely Party issue.  It is too important to the nation's future development to have one Party in this House advocating one line of policy and another Party advocating another line.  I think that condition of affairs should not obtain during the coming years.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Post-Emergency Agricultural Commission did not set a good headline by seeking to coordinate their conflicting reports.  I think we in this House can seek to coordinate our views and our various impressions of what constitutes a sound agricultural policy and that the united wisdom of all Parties should be pooled in shaping a permanent agricultural policy which will achieve what we all desire, namely, that the maximum amount of productivity will be obtained from the soil while maintaining its fertility and, at the same time, that those engaged in the industry should have at least as good a standard of living as those engaged in commerce and industry.  If we approach those problems and approach future agricultural policy along these lines, I think we can succeed in overcoming the difficulties that face agriculture.  I do not hold that the position is hopeless or gloomy. I think that world conditions at the present time make for a better standard of remuneration for those engaged in agriculture and for better prices for agricultural produce generally.  I think that these conditions will last for some time.  We must take whatever measures are necessary to guard against a depression in agriculture, but we ought not to face the future with any gloomy or hopeless outlook.</P>
    <P>We agriculturists advocate and recommend the closest possible cooperation between this agricultural <Col N="1434" /> country and other countries which are complementary to our agricultural economy.  We strongly recommend that there should be closer co-operation with those who represent industry and agriculture in Great Britain.  It is by fitting our agricultural policy into the needs of the British farmer and the British industrialist that we can ensure that whatever surplus we have over and above the requirements of our home market will command the best possible price.  No matter what view we may take in regard to the protection of the agricultural industry in the home market, we must all acknowledge that it is sound agricultural policy and sound national policy to obtain the best possible price that can be obtained in our external markets.</P>
    <P>In order to get that price we must be prepared to co-operate with those who will purchase our produce.  We must be prepared to supply them with produce of the highest possible quality, with live stock that is suitable for the requirements of the British farmer and the British market.  We must be prepared to produce other produce, such as poultry, eggs, butter, bacon and so on, of a uniformly high quality and of the standard and conditions that the British market requires.</P>
    <P>If we follow these lines of developing intelligently our external markets, while at the same time safeguarding the home market to the farmer, we will be building on a sound and sure foundation. We will be ensuring that intelligent young men and women will choose agriculture as a profession and that people who go to agricultural schools will not go with the intention of getting jobs, as the Minister for Agriculture pointed out yesterday they now go, but will go to these schools with the intention of settling down in a sound progressive agricultural industry in which there will be a future for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody, I think, will object to this whole question of the agricultural labourers being discussed, even though it revives to some extent issues which have been discussed here on former occasions.  I do not think it can be said too often that any tribute we can pay to the agricultural workers <Col N="1435" /> is well deserved.  I do not think it can be emphasised too often that for very many years they have been amongst the most forgotten and abandoned section of our community.  I hope, therefore, that at the conclusion of this debate the Minister will be able to indicate what further steps are likely to be taken to secure or what prospect there is in the immediate future of securing better wages and conditions for the agricultural workers.  I also hope that other matters such as holidays for agricultural workers may come in for some attention.  I think it is quite right to face the fact frankly that giving to agricultural workers the conditions that they are entitled to as one of the most important sections of the population involves corresponding obligations to the farmers.  I believe that if we are to make a permanent improvement in the conditions of the agricultural workers we must have a secure prospect for the farmers for a number of years in the way of guaranteed prices for what they produce.</P>
      <P>If that involves increased costs for other sections of the community, I think nobody in this country will grudge the agricultural labourers the benefits that they will get even at the cost of paying more for certain things. I hope the Minister will be able to make a definite announcement on this matter.  I hope also that the rising discontent amongst the agricultural workers will be, to some extent, assuaged by whatever proposals the Minister is able to indicate for their improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observe that a paragraph in the White Paper has been devoted to the growing of a crop that is considered a very important one in my county.  I refer to the growth of flax.  It is probably the only county in the South of Ireland where there has been extensive flax cultivation.  That is not a recent development.  There is a tradition in West Cork of successful flax growing for a number of years and, while it is true the only boom there has been in the industry has been associated with war periods, I think the possibilities in the way of employment and prosperity for the agricultural community, both <Col N="1436" /> farmers and labourers, in the growth and development of the flax industry, are very great.  Last year in Cork County 6,000 acres were put under flax. This year, I understand from the reply given to a question of mine by the Minister last week, the acreage under flax is likely to be very heavily reduced. Local opinion puts the figure at half the acreage of last year, and there are many people who think, having regard to the amount of flax seed sold, that there will be a much heavier reduction than half.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the results that have followed from the growth of flax in the areas in West Cork where the land is suitable for that crop and amongst the people who could not, by reason of the nature of their land, produce crops like wheat and beet.  For them, in view of the nature of their land, flax must remain the only crop. It has been the only crop in recent years for which they could get any reasonable reward for their labour.  It is a crop that involves a good deal of trouble and difficulty for the growers. It is a crop in which a good deal of labour is utilised and, therefore, it requires to be a crop that will pay reasonably.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the growth of flax in Cork County, a large number of scutching mills have been set up in recent years.  I hope the Minister will be more informative, when concluding this debate, than the paragraph in the White Paper, as to what the prospects are for the future.  I admit&mdash;and it is an important factor&mdash;that world conditions have a great bearing on the future of the industry.  I sincerely hope the alternative suggested by the Minister will afford a possibility of the retention of flax-growing in the districts I have mentioned for the purpose of giving some reasonable return to the growers and to the workers employed, not only on the land but in the scutching mills.  There should be some stability secured for that industry in the shape of prices and a decent return to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I know the effect of the development of the flax industry within the last few years in County Cork has been to enable very many people to overcome <Col N="1437" /> financial difficulties of many years standing.  I think that is the highest test of the success of that policy.  In the new situation it is clear the prices and conditions will be altered considerably, but I think there are possibilities in the industry and prospects in connection with it that ought to be an incentive to the devising of a scheme that will enable the growth of flax to remain a permanent feature of agricultural industry in the areas to which it is peculiarly appropriate. It seems to me that, with the retention of flax-growing and with some other possibilities in the direction of development, the problem of rural unemployment in an area like West Cork would be completely solved.  I have seen figures&mdash;I cannot recall them now&mdash;that were furnished some years ago by somebody who was an authority on the subject and who went into it very closely relating to the acreage of land now lying waste and that was capable of cultivation.</P>
    <P>I want heartily to support what Deputy Morrissey said this evening.  I think the reclamation of land on a very big scale would afford great possibilities of employment, not only employment and good wages in return, but it would enrich tremendously the nation. I urge that should be done, if necessary, through the agency of the local authorities.  The county councils could be utilised for the purpose of framing and executing schemes of this kind along lines of broad development and as a natural extension to what has been very successfully done in the operation of the farm improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>I think much more attention will have to be given to the very serious problem that arises in ordinary times for the smallholder.  There are many suggestions that could be made, but I think the suggestion made by one speaker with regard to the partial utilisation of the holdings of small farmers for other purposes than that to which they have been already devoted &mdash;the growing of seeds and other things &mdash;might be very usefully adopted.</P>
    <P>This is not alone an urgent problem for the interests concerned, but it is bound up with possibilities of permanent independence for a very deserving <Col N="1438" /> section of our people.  In addition to that, and in addition to any improvements in wages that may be offered in the immediate future for the agricultural labourers, I should like the Minister to examine as far as possible the framing and developing of a number of additional schemes for the purpose of assisting the agricultural labourer through other agencies. Schemes that were formerly devised for the advantage of agricultural labourers residing in labourers' cottages are inadequate to secure what I think everybody desires to secure, and that is the independence of the agricultural labourer, not alone through his own efforts to earn wages, but through whatever other agencies could be employed for the purpose of making his wife, his household and his family as independent as they can be made.  I think there are opportunities in that direction that could be usefully exploited by the Department of Agriculture and passed on to the agricultural labourers through the agencies of the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I venture to intrude on ground of that kind, and to speak of things of which I cannot profess to have any special knowledge, simply because I think the time has come when we must make up our minds that, for the future, we are going to advocate a policy for the people on certain lines.  My view is that we should endeavour to enable the agricultural labourer and his family, and people who are unemployed, to find employment as a result of national development along the lines I mentioned, so as to enable them to set their faces against any situation that only offers them a bare means of existence.  I think the most degrading thing in recent years is a condition that compels a large number of people to look for State charity or assistance in one form or another.  We will have to decide definitely in a short time in favour of a policy of more employment and wages, as against the policy of vouchers and poverty which we have now.  It is for that reason I make a plea that every effort should be made to enable the agricultural labourer to become as independent as possible.  His wife through the rearing of poultry and pigs on a small scale, or through other <Col N="1439" /> schemes devised by the Department might be able to share in that enterprise. In ways of that kind it is possible to lay a foundation for self-respect and independence for a progressive rural population, and I think the Minister would be in a position to make a very useful contribution towards that very laudable work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the dairying industry, because it is the bedrock of our agricultural economy.  In view of the reduction in milk and dairy products last year, it looks as if there has been a serious decline in the industry.  The dairy cow and the dairying industry is the stronghold of other side-lines in agriculture. I am of opinion that much more must be done to encourage dairy farming, in the first place in respect to price, and in the second place to make financial provision so that dairying conditions will be much more pleasant than they are to-day.  We know that from dairying comes the live-stock industry.  Everybody knows what a valuable asset that is to the country.  In order to maintain our industries, the raw materials they require can only be obtained by the wealth we procure from our agricultural surplus.  Naturally every industry started here has a bearing on agriculture.  It is from the produce of agriculture and what we are able to export that other industries here depend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the position of bacon and live stock.  We know that during the last six or seven years, because of the way the bacon industry was handled, there was not enough bacon to meet the demands of our own people.  We know also that when bacon was exported it realised a large amount of money for the nation and the farmers. When talking of wheat growing, it must be remembered that the best wheat we can produce comes from land on which there are plenty of cows and pigs.  Where there are live stock there is plenty of farmyard manure and the land produces wheat of first-class quality.  One problem that concerns farmers to-day is the supply of labour.  That has a bearing on dairying. <Col N="1440" /> Deputy Murphy referred to the discontent that prevails amongst rural workers, and stated that that was due to the miserable wage they received.  I do not blame workers when they try to clear away from the land, because they see other workers in adjacent towns being paid £3/10/0 or £4 per week in comparison with their £2.  It is hard to expect workers on the land to be content with their lot when they see their pals in the towns getting much better wages. The wage paid to agricultural workers should be, at least, equal to that paid to workers in other industries.  I think that would not be an unfair standard to set for those engaged in agriculture.  However, the position is that farmers cannot pay a wage equal to that obtaining in the towns, when the prices they receive for their produce are not able to bear it.</P>
    <P>That is why I consider that there is a demand for the setting up of a commission to inquire into conditions prevailing in rural Ireland.  Deputy Corry pointed out the need of ascertaining the costs of production.  County committees of agriculture as well as representatives of labour and the Government should be represented on that commission. Such a commission would be able to arrive at a fair figure of costings which would satisfy rural workers and farmers.  There is no use in setting up a commission representative of county committees of agriculture and the Government unless there are on it representatives of the workers.  It is high time that such a commission was set up to base prices of agricultural produce and consider other conditions that apply to farmers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the question of having milling offals returned to the farmers.  I find that I cannot get a bag of bran.  I have been agitating so that farmers would be in a position to get back offals from the mills. Nobody is more entitled to wheat offals than those who responded to the call of the Government to provide food during the emergency.  Having produced the wheat farmers are entitled to the offals. I think it is not an unreasonable request that farmers, having complied with the tillage regulations, should get <Col N="1441" /> the offals for the feeding of live stock.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister to see that wheat offals will be provided for the farmer who wishes to have them from the miller the same as pulp from the beet factories.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision with regard to compulsory wheat growing will be welcomed in certain areas, because the growing of wheat by certain farmers, particularly those in the mountain areas, on land which was unsuitable for wheat growing was an uneconomic proposition.  I hope, however, that the decision to abandon compulsion will not mean a reduction in price, and that those farmers who went into the production of wheat and grain during the emergency and who went to the expense of getting machinery will not find, next year or the year after, that the price has gone down to such an extent that it is not profitable to grow wheat.  I hope there will be a price inducement and that farmers who went into the campaign will be compensated for the work they put into it and will not be compelled to grow it at a loss.</P>
    <P>We know that during the early part of the emergency the growing of wheat at 25/- or 27/- a barrel was not economic and I hope that a real price inducement will be held out to the farmer.  We were able to grow as good wheat here as anywhere, and when we had white bread from our own wheat, it was as good as the bread anywhere else, and I hope the tillage farmer will be compensated and will get an economic price in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>With regard to machinery, Deputy Morrissey referred to threshing machines and spoke of the waste which took place on many farmsteads.  Much of the machinery we have to-day is in a very bad state of repair, but I can say that a lot of the waste is due to the farmers themselves.  As a machine owner, I know that sometimes, when one went into a haggard, the farmer would throw his whole rick through the machine in order to get rid of it.  The farmer considers it too much to pay the threshing machine owner for another <Col N="1442" /> day or half day, which is a very unwise course for the farmer to adopt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He will have to pay for the threshing again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is his own fault in many cases and I do not think the machine owners should be blamed all the time.  If the machine owner gets reasonable time, he will do his best to do good work.  There may be an odd owner who will do bad work, due to carelessness, but some of the machines are in bad repair.  However, much of the waste is brought about by the farmers themselves in being too anxious to get rid of the job and then the threshing machine owner is blamed. I should like the Minister to encourage the importation of more threshers.  I know many men in my own area, and outside of it, who are prepared to buy new machinery, but who are unable to get it, and I suggest that the Minister might examine the possibility of making some bargain with the authorities across the water or in the United States, with a view to importing more machinery for the coming season.  The farmers of the country generally do not intend to give up tillage as quickly as some people might be inclined to think. They have put in a lot of machinery during the emergency and have got into the tillage technique, and a very big percentage of them are inclined to stay at it.  For that reason, the Minister should try to arrange for the importation of more machinery.  As a matter of fact, I have tried for myself and for three others to get machines but there is no hope of getting them, even when paying cash down.  A lot of grain is lost or damaged in ricks through having to wait for machines and I hope the Minister will do his best to arrange for the importation of more machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the farm improvements scheme, I hope the Minister will be able to include in the scheme for the coming year repairs to farm buildings and the erection of farm buildings. Many farmers throughout the country are unable to hold over a stock of wheat for seed because they have no suitable buildings, and if the Minister would go as far as putting up a small fraction of the cost, it <Col N="1443" /> would meet the requirements of most cases.  The erection of a small house with a loft would not be very expensive. Men who go in for grain growing in a big way have suitable housing and equipment, but the small farmer is always caught out.  In the case of oats, I knew of many cases last year in which, due to the bad prices obtaining in the area, many small farmers were unable to thresh, and I hope that the Minister for the coming year will include in the scheme the erection of buildings for the storage of grain for seed purposes.</P>
    <P>I also asked previously if there was any possibility of including also in this scheme the provision of water schemes or the sinking of pumps.  A water supply is very essential on the farm.  Water is needed for live stock and domestic purposes generally, and I think such a provision would meet with the general approval of the farming community.  Some areas, I admit, have too much water, but, in others, there is a great scarcity, and a lot of time is lost and a lot of labour involved in drawing water for live stock and other purposes on the farm.  I understand that the difficulty in this respect lay in the ascertaining of engineering costs and so on, but the inclusion of such schemes in the farm improvements scheme would be of great benefit to the farming community. Certainly this scheme is very welcome and we hope that it will be maintained for all time.  Going through the countryside to-day you can see the improvements that have been wrought.  Instead of seeing an old bush, or a spar, in a gap as heretofore, the majority of the people now have built piers and gates into their holdings and into their fields.  In the long run that brings about a saving in labour.  It also adds a pleasant touch of neatness to the countryside as a whole.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on that scheme.  It is, as I said before, a good scheme.  I hope that it will be maintained and extended even further on the lines I have suggested.  It is one of the best schemes that has ever been introduced.  The rural improvements <Col N="1444" /> scheme is a good scheme too, but there are snags in it.  Under the farm improvements scheme, I think that greater provision should be made for roads.  I think the inspectors who deal with this matter should not make quite such heavy demands as they do upon the individuals concerned in this scheme.  All the farmers want is a fair road to enable them to cart their stuff.  A rough type of road will meet the requirements there and I trust that the Minister will examine into the points I have raised in this connection.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to sugar beet, I am afraid that the price will ultimately force the people out of production. The price has been fixed and maintained over the last three or four years; yet the prices of production, labour, farming implements, and transport have all increased during the same period.  I consider that the present price of beet is causing quite a number of producers to go out of production.  Taking into consideration the factories which have been erected and the transport which has been provided to cope with the beet traffic, it would be rather a pity now if the beet industry should fail because of lack of production.  Side by side with the growing of beet, you have the by-products which have proved a valuable asset to the farmers generally for the feeding of livestock. I would be very sorry to see the growers discouraged in any way.  I hope that the present price will be maintained, or an even better price offered in the future in order that the production and cultivation of sugar beet will be maintained in this country.  A reasonable price is all the inducement that is required to encourage the farmers to go into production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine he would have a big say in the matter.  I understand, too, in connection with beet, that the cottage plot holders will no <Col N="1445" /> longer be allowed to grow beet.  I think that is unfair.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has pointed out that this may not be a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and I suppose the Minister may not have much influence in it, but I do think the Minister should have some say.  The people who during the emergency stepped into the breech and stood, perhaps, in the front-line trenches in the production of food should be allowed to continue in production if they so desire.  Even though the cottier may produce in a small way he should receive as much encouragement as anybody engaged in any other type of industry.  The beet brought in some money to him at a very lean time of the year.  I trust that he is not now going to be forgotten by the beet companies and I hope the Minister will use all the influence he has in that direction in order to ensure that the cottier will remain in the field of production.</P>
      <P>There is one matter which is a cause for concern, particularly to people living in mountainous regions, and that is the price of wool.  I believe it is the Department of Industry and Commerce which deals with that, but I think there, too, the Minister for Agriculture should use his influence with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There are a number of people engaged in the breeding of sheep in this country.  They have not sufficient land to grow either beet or wheat.  They have to eke out and existence on the mountainside and for that existence they depend in large measure on the production of wool. They suffer considerable losses during the year.  I think it is only reasonable that the Minister should use his influence with the Department concerned in order to ensure that a reasonable price will be paid for the wool to the people who produce it.</P>
      <P>I hold, with Deputy Corry, that a commission should be set up composed of men from the various county committees of agriculture.  When the county committees are selecting their members they put in the most practical men and the most suitable men.

      <P>It may be according to the colour of their shirts or the colour of their jackets.  I maintain that it is the men who form those county committees of agriculture who should be appointed on an agricultural commission because they are the men who all their lives are dealing with agriculture. They have had the essential practical experience and they know the costings intimately.  I trust that the Minister will see his way now to the setting up of such a commission as that and I can assure the Minister that such a commission would give full satisfaction to the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>I must say, first and foremost, that I am very disappointed with the White Paper which has been issued, particularly in relation to tillage and pigs.  I can foresee nothing but trouble for the farming community because we are rapidly approaching the point where there will be too many inspectors and too little freedom of enterprise.  I am not myself opposed to tillage.  All my life I have gone in for tillage and all my life I have advocated mixed farming.  I hold that the farmer will never succeed unless he goes in for a certain amount of tillage.  At the same time I think the whole idea of compulsory tillage is fundamentally and intrinsically wrong. I have an idea myself that where compulsory tillage is concerned there is at the back of the Minister's mind this new-fangled idea of lea farming.  I maintain that lea farming is inherently wrong.  One farmer in my area has practised this lea farming for the last five or six years.  If the weather is wet he has to take his cattle off it immediately.  That is the fact.  I know that Deputy Hughes approves of it.  I know that in the agricultural college down in Athenry the old pastures were superior to the new lea farming system in the raising of cattle.  Reading the English agricultural journals one can see that there they are gradually coming back to the former system and getting away from the lea farming altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> If we had adopted a system of lea farming in this country where should we have found ourselves in the last three months of drought?  Where would our grand soft pastures be if we adopted a system of lea farming? The entire country would eventually starve.  I warn the Minister and his Department not to adopt this policy. It is a wrong policy.  There will be no return from it.  By such a system you will do away with our lovely pastures down in Westmeath of which we are all so proud.  We have done our tillage down there voluntarily.  We have always gone in for tillage. Compulsory tillage will not work.  It is a wrong system in itself and its only result will be to impoverish the land still further.  In the last three or four years a lot of bad tillage was done. If people do not like tillage then you cannot compel them to till still more. These people are being compelled to till further.  There should be some way of having tillage that heretofore has been done badly carried out on proper lines.  In my opinion compulsory tillage will be harmful.  If you want compulsory tillage, set up some system where the owners of good rank land, which is not suitable for tillage, would pay a subsidy to the people who have land that is suitable for tillage. I am sure the owners of that land will be willing to pay a man to till the land that is suitable for tillage.  It is altogether wrong to have a flat rate of compulsory tillage.  That is my private opinion and I am not one of those who are against tillage.  I have always tilled.  I have always had a mixed farm and I am ready to invite anyone to come to my farm to see that it is as well tilled as any farm in Ireland.  It would be better, instead of compulsory tillage, to fix minimum prices for tillage products.  There should be a minimum price for oats. Deputy Cogan wants to do away with this, I think.  He wants the farmer to use his oats as feeding-stuff.  What is the farmer to do who has a big acreage of oats and cannot feed it all? There is a certain sale of oats to stud farms.  If there were a fixed minimum price for oats and barley the farmers <Col N="1448" /> would produce them.  If you are going to depress the price of agricultural products to a very low degree, it would have the effect of discouraging tillage. If there is a good price for tillage products, the farmers will till and the farmers have come into the way of tilling. In my county they did not love tillage&mdash;I admit that&mdash;but they have got into tillage and they like tillage now and they like to be encouraged.  I say that the way is not by compulsion but by having fixed minimum prices and a market for their tillage.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is a surplus of potatoes in County Westmeath. I know of one man who has 100 tons of potatoes and he cannot sell them. He went to the Department of Agriculture six weeks ago and they would not help him or give him a licence to export.  That happened six weeks ago, while the people in Europe are starving. Is that encouragement to grow potatoes?  Everywhere in County Westmeath there are pits of potatoes for which there is no market.  That is the position.  If there is a guaranteed market and guaranteed price, you will not need compulsory tillage.</P>
    <P>As regards pigs, the fixing of the price of pigs is all wrong.  Five or six years ago we were discussing in this House the fixing of the price of pigs at 120/- a cwt.  The Minister fixed the price, the price of bacon in the shops being so much.  The fixed price for pigs was discontinued; the price of bacon is the same, but the price of pigs is 160/- or 170/- What was wrong there?  The same thing is going to happen again. Let the pig trade alone.  Do not bind it at all.  Give it a free market.  Do not fix the price and appoint one buyer to fix the price that the farmer must take.  That is what happens in the case of the canning factories.  When old cows go to a certain price on the Dublin market, three or four factories pay a normal price, but when they go above a normal price gradually the buyers will retire.  Then the farmers will be told that they will buy so many cows the next week and the next week the market is flooded.  A few of them will get together and get out and leave the market to one.  The very same <Col N="1449" /> thing will happen with the pigs.  Once you put the dead meat trade in the hands of one person, the price will be fixed, there will be a monopoly, and the farmer will be at a loss.  I warn this House that if they carry out the policy of the proposed Pigs Board pig production will go out of being in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he was glad to see that the export of heifers was going down.  Does he know why that is?  One of the reasons is that most of the heifers are killed at home for home consumption and also that the people are getting out of the breeding of shorthorns.  I warn the Minister that the day is fast coming when we will be short of shorthorns in this country, no matter what he says.  The farmer is at present getting a subsidy in the price to breed a black heifer because that is the only animal he can sell.  He will not send the cow to the shorthorn bull because he runs a big chance of having a bull calf.  If he has a heifer calf he is all right.  But the ordinary small farmer&mdash;and I do not blame him&mdash;is sending his cow to the white-headed bull and the black bull, because the white-headed animal will mature six to ten months earlier than the shorthorn. A one-and-a-half year or two year old white-headed beast is equal to a shorthorn at two-and-a-half years.  The Department are doing a great deal, I agree, in the matter of subsidies for bulls but a great deal more will have to be done to encourage the farmer to breed shorthorns.  The Minister <Col N="1450" /> should bring in some scheme to enable farmers to buy shorthorn heifers, subsidised in some way, and should also increase the subsidy for a shorthorn bull to be kept in every county.  It was only after one or two of us made a big fight in County Westmeath that we got a shorthorn bull.  Only shorthorn bulls should be subsidised.  Why are we subsidising what everyone wants?  Why do we subsidise the white or the black bull?  There would be enough of them if there were no subsidy.  Subsidise only the shorthorn bull and then you will have shorthorn heifers being bred in every county.</P>
    <P>We are not encouraged to grow beet in County Westmeath.  Freight charges are a great disadvantage.  I have to pay 17/5 a ton freight; neighbours who are seven or eight miles from the station pay up to 24/- a ton.  We like to grow beet because it is a good rotation crop, but we are put out of beet-growing.  There should be a flat rate for beet and some encouragement should be given to the farmer in the Midlands to remain in tillage.  I would ask the Minister to encourage us to grow beet.  I would warn him against compulsory tillage and I would ask him to take a note of the points I have made.</P>

      <P>During the period in question the work of taking verbatim notes in connection with criminal <Col N="1319" /> trials in the Circuit Court in Dublin was performed by three stenographers. The same persons were also employed in the Central Criminal Court and, when available, in criminal trials in the Circuit Court outside Dublin. Since 1st January, 1944, they have been paid at the rate of £430, £380, and £320 per annum, inclusive.  Prior to that date the salaries were £400, £350, and £310.  Provision was also made for the employment and payment of assistants, in connection with the preparation of transcripts, as required. The three stenographers were appointed by the Minister for Justice. Originally they were paid by fees but in 1927 they were offered and accepted annual salaries.</P>
      <P>Outside Dublin local reporters were employed, when required, by the county registrars on the authority of the Minister for Justice at fees of two guineas a day (one guinea for a period of three hours or less) plus 8d. per folio for transcripts.</P>
      <P>None of the stenographers is an established civil servant.</P>
