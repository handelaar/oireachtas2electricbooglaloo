      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="2576" /> Industry and Commerce if there has been an increase in coal imports sufficient to enable an increased allocation to be made to owners of steam threshing machines, as turf is not a suitable fuel for the operation of those machines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  A slight improvement in the supply of coal in recent months has made it possible to increase for this season the allowance of coal to owners of registered threshing sets from 5 tons to 10 tons.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the amount of petrol at present allocated to three-ton and five-ton lorries operated by Córas Iompair Éireann; and if he will be prepared to make similar allocations of petrol to private haulage contractors.</P>

    <P>If the allowances of petrol granted to other hauliers holding licences under the Transport Act for the carriage of goods were related to the average monthly allowance of petrol used in vehicles operated by Córas Iompair <Col N="2577" /> Éireann it would involve a reduction of the present allowances to private hauliers.

The utilisation of these lands to the best advantage is conditional on the acquisition of certain adjoining sites which are included in the Compulsory Purchase Order referred to.  The council have a scheme of eight labourers' cottages in progress at Bohernabreena, which is nearing completion.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been drawn to a statement, made by the Assistant Manager for Dublin City and County, at a meeting of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee, that the salaries offered to nurses (£42 a year) were not attractive; that alongside an advertisement in a Dublin newspaper recently offering positions to nurses at this salary, there appeared an advertisement from an English mental hospital offering salaries of £70 a year to probationer nurses; and if so, what action, if any, he proposes to take to make the Irish standard of salaries and pensions offered to nurses at least as attractive as the English standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to by the Deputy. The figure of £42 a year mentioned is the initial rate of salary paid to a female on recruitment as an attendant in the Grangegorman District Mental Hospital.  The salary scale applicable is £42 a year, increasing by £6 a year to £60 a year.  When qualified in mental nursing, which qualification must be obtained within four years of the date of original appointment, a female mental nurse receives a salary of £91 8s. 0d. a year.  In addition to salary there are emoluments of apartments, full rations, fuel, light, laundry <Col N="2582" /> and clothing.  Emergency bonus is also paid.  Long service pay also is granted at the following rates:&mdash;£12 a year after ten years' service, £22 a year after 15 years' service, £32 a year after 20 years' service.</P>

He has given a review of a situation which is well known and he has given particulars which are well known to every member of this House and of which details can be got at any time by any member of the House in the Library.  I asked him if he was aware that alongside an advertisement in a Dublin newspaper recently offering positions to nurses at £42 a year there appeared an advertisement from an English hospital offering much higher salaries?  I asked him what action he proposes to take to bring the nurses' salaries here into line with the salaries paid there in order to make the situation here at least as attractive to Irish girls as similar posts in England?  That is my question.  I have just repeated it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary is he going to make the post here as attractive as similar situations in English and Scotch institutions.  The commissioner says that he cannot get nurses, because they are getting offers of better employment in England, and more power to them for going there if they do.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary will he take any action to bring the Irish standards up to the standards in operation in England and Scotland.</P>

      <P>I am aware that cream is used for the purpose stated, but the quantity so used is such that its conversion into butter would not materially affect the butter supply position.  I do not propose to impose restrictions on the use of cream at present, especially as a considerable proportion of the quantity sold during the summer comes from non-creamery districts and could not be used to increase the butter ration, which applies only to creamery butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish unduly to prolong the discussion on this amendment.  Last night I made the points that I wished to make in favour of the amendment.  I do not now want to repeat those points again; but I do wish to make a comment upon one remark that the Minister rather dramatically made last night in the House when he made his oral testimony bequeathing his advice to whatever successor would be in his office in this country during a future war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He stated that he would as his last will and political testament bequeath to that Minister the direction that he should employ drastic methods to deal with black marketeers and completely overlook whatever ordinary courts would be in existence at that time.  I want, for whatever portion of posterity may take any interest in any remarks I have to make, to register my strong disagreement with the sentiments expounded in the Minister's last will and political testament.  I think it is a very bad thing for any country to cast aspersions upon the administration of <Col N="2588" /> justice through the ordinary courts. Last night I stated that the Minister, in my view, in the remarks he made really passed a vote of censure on the ordinary courts of this country, and he censured in particular a very large number of people who were appointed to judicial office by his own Government in the last six years.</P>
    <P>I take the opposite view.  I take the view, and express it again strongly, that our courts have operated well and efficiently and impartially in the last five or six years.  I have protested again and again in this House against the policy of appointing temporary district justices.  But, even in reference to these, I will say here publicly that, although I take objection in principle to the appointment of these temporary district justices, they have to the best of my belief acted impartially, properly and efficiently.  I find no evidence whatever that, during the period of six years, our courts, in reference to the enforcement of the Orders of the Government or of any Minister made under the Emergency Powers Act, have not acted in the way they ought to have acted.  Implicit in the statements of the Minister is the suggestion that, because a Department or an official thinks that an individual has committed an offence, every judicial tribunal must give effect to that whether the evidence justified conviction or not.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister wants some tribunal which will in all cases convict irrespective of what the evidence may be.  They want somebody who will do the job and do it not in the way of the ordinary process of law. I object to that principle, whether it is stated expressly or nakedly, as I have stated it, or whether it is stated in the words the Minister has stated it, carrying that implied suggestion.  It is an extremely bad principle for any Government to pass over the administration of justice carried out by the constitutional courts.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said last night, that the courts of justice in this country, in reference to all ordinary matters, have been in the last six years and still are effectively working.  There is no evidence from which it can be stated that <Col N="2589" /> the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in reference to Orders under the Emergency Powers Act.  The Minister agreed with me last night that not more than 1 per cent. of all cases under the Emergency Powers Orders came before these Military Tribunals, but he drew from that amazing set of facts an ordinary deduction: that were it not for the Special Military Courts administering criminal cases brought before them under the Emergency Powers Orders it would not have been possible for him to carry out his rationing scheme. I totally fail to follow that argument. Ninety-nine per cent. at least of all cases under the Emergency Powers Act, including black-marketing cases, came before the ordinary courts.  Only 1 per cent. at the outside came before the Military Tribunal.  How can it be suggested from that state of facts, particularly in view of the Minister's perhaps justifiable boast that this country had the best record for rationing of any country in the world, that the ordinary courts have failed effectively to administer justice and preserve public peace and order?</P>
    <P>The setting up of extraordinary tribunals should only be resorted to in the very last resort.  During the time when the administration of justice in this country was brought to a standstill in reference to one particular aspect only of the activities of certain illegal bodies, it was necessary to set up a particular type of court, but only for that purpose.  I said last night that these courts have a value.  Their value is strictly confined in my view, and I submit to the House it is the proper view, to hearing cases of, and I hope deterring, the commission of crimes of violence against the State by armed bodies or by illegal organisations subversive to the State.  That is the only value of these extraordinary courts.  If other cases that could properly be heard by the ordinary courts are brought before these tribunals, I repeat what I said last night, that the effect will be to create a spurious sympathy in the public mind with the victims of the decisions of these courts or the persons brought before them, and the <Col N="2590" /> value of these courts for the purpose for which they ought to exist solely will be undermined.</P>
    <P>I do submit to the Minister in all seriousness that he ought to resolve firmly that he will not come to an understanding with the Attorney-General like the understanding, which in my view was an illegal understanding, with the Attorney-General of the time during the last six years in reference to offences under the Emergency Powers Acts; but that he will at least exercise the greatest possible control over cases that will be sent under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, to any court other than the ordinary courts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to accept the amendment.  I am influenced very largely in appealing to the Minister to do that by his own statement last night.  I am satisfied that the Minister was justified in taking all the necessary steps during the emergency period to see that black marketing would not become rife in this country to the disadvantage of the citizens as a whole.  But the experience he has gained indicates, as stated by Deputy Costello, that 99 per cent. of the cases were dealt with by the ordinary courts of the country.  Yet we are able to say that we had the most satisfactory results of any country in the world in administering a rationing scheme.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the Minister talk about half-crown fines imposed by district justices.  I have never heard or read of any such fines in these cases. Throughout the country, district justices have imposed salutary fines in very small cases.  I can recollect of fines of £3 and £4 being imposed for charging an excessive price for a packet of Woodbines.  That does not seem to square with the half-crown cases that the Minister has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking it by and large, the Minister must admit that the scheme was administered successfully although 99 per cent. of the cases were heard in the ordinary courts.  Out of the 1 per cent. which went to the Special Court, a certain percentage was appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I think that the Minister might rest easy in his mind <Col N="2591" /> that the courts are competent to deal with this particular class of offence. There is no general sympathy amongst the public with people who try to black market goods and no case has been established for sending these cases to the Special Court.  I do not think that the Minister, or any of the Deputies on his side of the House, any more than Deputies on other sides of the House, ought to have any special leaning towards the establishment of this Special Court to the exclusion of the legitimate courts.  I think we should all look for as much freedom as we can and for providing the best services we can possibly get for the public.  In medical difficulties we look for specialists and we should also look for specialists in legal cases.</P>
    <P>Nobody has confidence in the military courts and they should be resorted to only in extreme cases.  If they can possibly be avoided, they should be avoided.  They are not competent, in the opinion of the ordinary man in the street.  In my opinion, they are not competent.  They should not be resorted to except in extreme circumstances. In view of the Minister's statement that 99 per cent. of the cases were dealt with by the ordinary courts and 1 per cent. was not satisfactorily dealt with by the other court, seeing that the decisions were upset on appeal, there is no case left now for the existence of this court.  The emergency has practically passed and the Minister would be perfectly safe in entrusting these cases to the ordinary courts and leaving them to the sense of justice of the citizens.  Jurymen have not failed, except in very grave and exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>It would be a gracious gesture, and an indication of confidence in the courts and in citizens, if the Minister would accept the amendment.  We have passed out of the emergency.  We have come through it satisfactorily and I think we can confidently rely on the ordinary courts to give everyone justice. If black market cases are brought before the ordinary courts, the citizens acting on juries there will deal with them on their merits.  It would be a gracious gesture on the Minister's part, and a mark of gratitude for satisfactory <Col N="2592" /> services rendered during the period of the emergency, if he would say that the Government will not use these Special Courts in the types of cases that have been under discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree with Deputy Costello's statement that special tribunals should be used for the trial of offences against Emergency Powers Orders only as a last resort. The House is aware that when rationing and other forms of control necessitated by the development of scarcities were instituted the trial of offenders against the regulations was always taken to the ordinary courts.  The position developed in which we had to have serious regard to the ineffectiveness of the ordinary courts in disposing of these offences.  Not merely were the members of the Government and the officers responsible for the enforcement of the regulations seriously perturbed at the consequences of the very nominal penalties imposed by the courts, but equal perturbation was expressed by many members of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keyes said he never heard of half-crown fines in a case of this kind.  Perhaps he will allow me to quote an authority he will not dispute. On the 13th November, 1941, Deputy Norton, the Leader of Deputy Keyes' Party, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Having issued a Maximum Price Order, it is the Minister's duty to endeavour to secure compliance with that Order, respect for his authority and for the authority of the Government. The trader should be made aware that if he charges prices in excess of those fixed, his action will be punishable by severe penalties.  Fines imposed in cases where proceedings were instituted have been perfectly farcical and have not acted as a deterrent to traders against the exploiting the needs of consumers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton went so far as to suggest that some of the district justices should be interned.  His speech on that occasion was similar to speeches made by a number of other Deputies who were equally perturbed, as I was perturbed, at the manner in which these black market offences were being treated by the District Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true the decision of the Government <Col N="2593" /> to schedule these offences under the Offences against the State Act did not mean that all of them were transferred to the Military Court; but the mere fact that some such cases were disposed of by the Military Court and salutary penalties were imposed there had a very beneficial effect and did more than anything else to secure respect for rationing and price control Orders.  I am quite certain there is no Deputy who was not asked to make representations on behalf of some constituent detected in a black marketing offence to urge that his case would not be sent to the Military Court.</P>
    <P>There were two main factors which helped to secure the position in which there was general compliance with rationing and price control Orders. First was the trial of the more important cases by the Military Court and the salutary penalties imposed there and, secondly, there was the withdrawal of trading licences following convictions for such offences in any court.  These two factors ultimately secured a general compliance with the regulations and every Deputy knows, as I know, that traders, when detected in these offences, were far more concerned to avoid trial before the Military Court or the subsequent cancellation of licences than they were by the possibility of the penalties which might be imposed by the ordinary courts.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that we can afford to place ourselves in the position that the same procedure cannot be followed in the future.  I think Deputy Keyes is fundamentally wrong in his belief that the emergency is practically over.  So far as supplies are concerned, it might be far nearer the truth to say that the emergency is now beginning.  I do not know in what world some Deputies are living.  They must have seen the newspapers and they must be aware that in Great Britain, the country closest to us, many rations have recently been reduced and a scheme for the rationing of bread is being prepared.  These facts do not indicate that the emergency is over, so far as supplies are concerned.</P>
    <P>We had to withdraw the margarine ration recently.  We may have difficulty in maintaining the soap ration. The position is safe for some months ahead, but I could not guarantee it for <Col N="2594" /> more than some months.  The situation may well develop in which supplies of wheat from abroad will be conditional on our imposing certain restrictions on its consumption here.  In other directions future supply difficulties are to be anticipated and, as I stated yesterday, it may be necessary not merely to strengthen existing rationing schemes but to extend rationing to commodities not now rationed.</P>
    <P>If these circumstances arise, we will have in the future precisely the same problem in the initial stages of each new rationing scheme, in securing the compliance of the traders and the public with the regulations involved, as we had in connection with existing rationing schemes.  It may be necessary that exceptional methods will have to be adopted in order to get that compliance generally and expeditiously.  I am not attempting to forecast the decision of the Government under this Bill, whether it will schedule under the Offences Against the State Act offences committed against regulations made under this Bill; but I am anxious that the Government should retain that power so that it can be used if the public interest requires it, or if it should prove to be the case that the ordinary courts are not effective in securing the proper administration of justice in respect of these matters.</P>
    <P>I would not at all agree that there is any more serious crime against the community than the withdrawal from trade of essential supplies with a view to their disposal on the black market at exceptional prices.  The special types of crimes for which the Offences Against the State Act was passed are serious.  Crimes of this kind are equally serious and would, in certain circumstances, produce far more widespread consequences for the people than crimes of the other type.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the supply situation will improve considerably, that many of the difficulties we foresee now will not, in fact, emerge.  If so, the powers given to the Government in this Bill will not be utilised and many of the existing regulations can be withdrawn; but nobody examining the conditions throughout the world and <Col N="2595" /> noting the problems facing other countries can be certain that we will not have in the next 12 months to face difficulties of supply as serious or more serious than any we faced during the war.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it would be in my view bad policy to withdraw from the Government the powers which were used during the emergency, used sparingly but nevertheless effectively, in stamping out serious black-marketing activities here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that all I have said last night and to-day has not brought home to the Minister the real point of all this matter.  He says it will be a serious thing to deprive the Government of a power to send cases to a Military Tribunal.  That is not the point.  The point is, will the courts break down in the administration of the law, because it is only when the ordinary courts break down in their duty of administering the law that the Government is justified in scheduling these offences.  Underlying the Minister's whole attitude in this matter is that the Government can do this at any time they like in order to create what can only be described as a terror court.  That is what the Minister says helped to avoid offences against rationing in the last five or six years&mdash;the threat of being brought to the Military Tribunal.  I say that is a bad principle because it is not the threat that ought to be used for the purpose of administering the law; the law ought to be administered by the constitutional courts, and it is only when these courts break down that these special courts should be invoked.  The very fact that that is a sort of threat is in itself a denunciation of these terror courts because it means this: the judicial people who are appointed, who are made by the Constitution independent in the exercise of their functions so that they will do justice between the community and the individual charged, are, according to the Minister, being subjected to censure here for what they have done and there is the suggestion that that court&mdash;the terror court&mdash;will do what it is told.  That is why it will impose what is called a &ldquo;salutary&rdquo;<Col N="2596" /> fine&mdash;an outrageous fine I would call it &mdash;as against what a district justice would do.  Why is it to be assumed that a district justice or a circuit judge or a High Court judge, for that matter, will not do his duty in these matters?  I cannot see it.</P>
      <P>There has been rather an emphasis upon the operations of the District Court in this matter.  Most of the cases where what the Minister calls &ldquo;salutary&rdquo;&mdash;and I put that in inverted commas&mdash;punishment has been inflicted by the Military Tribunal have been tried on indictment.  They have not come before the Military Tribunal, as it is popularly called, as a case that would have been tried by a district justice.  They have been tried on indictment, as a case would be that would be tried by a judge and jury. What I pleaded for last night was that trial by jury should be tried in serious cases and there has never been an effort made to see if a jury in this country would convict in black market cases.  I believe juries throughout the country would convict in black market cases and I believe, as I said last night, that one conviction by a jury in a black market case is worth 40,000 convictions by the terror court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I had some responsibility for the administration of the criminal law in this country it was frequently put up to me by responsible people that juries throughout the country, in country districts, were not convicting in cases where they should convict and my attitude invariably was, during the six years I was charged with that responsibility, &ldquo;I do not care; it is not my duty; it is the responsibility of the people represented by the juries.  Leave these cases with them and ultimately it will become known to the community that it is the local community themselves that will suffer and when that is brought home to them then the local people, through their juries, will see that those people are not let at large. It would be far better in the public interest that that could be achieved rather than have the cases brought to Dublin.&rdquo;  I am glad to say that that policy was amply justified because, throughout the country, juries are now doing what is called their &ldquo;duty&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, they are fulfilling the <Col N="2597" /> oaths that they take to try the case in accordance with the evidence.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why that should not have been tried in black market cases. Why should a case be brought before three military gentlemen and not brought before a local jury?  If there is any trouble about the local jury, then it can be brought before a Dublin jury.  Is there any suggestion that a Dublin jury will not be equally astute to get after black marketeers as the three military gentlemen who constitute the Military Tribunal?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that if a proper case was brought, properly presented, on proper evidence and conducted in accordance with the law and in accordance with the justice which even accused persons are entitled to get, that there would be as ample justice meted out by a Dublin jury or by a country jury as is supposed to be meted out by the Military Tribunal.</P>
    <P>In England; as I think was pointed out last night, the rationing system worked well.  English juries had no difficulty whatever in bringing in verdicts in black marketing cases. English judges had no difficulty in handing out severe sentences in these <Col N="2598" /> cases.  Why should it be suggested that our Irish juries will not do the same and our Irish judges will not carry out the oath that they have taken under the Constitution?  I do think that the whole of this discussion on the part of the Minister is a serious blot upon the attitude of the Government towards the judiciary in this country, a serious vote of censure by the Government on the judicial system of this country and the judicial personages administering it&mdash;quite undeserved, in my opinion.  I do again say&mdash;I hope for the last time&mdash; certainly on this amendment I do not propose to speak any more&mdash;that so far as I am concerned I will endeavour by my voice and whatever influence I may have, to protest against increasing the jurisdiction of the Military Tribunal over what I believe was their proper function.  I do that for reasons of principle.  Whatever value this tribunal has for the work it was intended to do will be completely undermined by the policy of the Government in reference to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 19, to delete the words &ldquo;and every direction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The principle embodied in Section 9 is one with regard to which I shall have a few words to say on the section.  It goes very far indeed to dispense with proof in criminal matters, as well as other matters, of all Orders made under this Act.  They are supposed to be judicially noticed.  I do not know how a direction is to be judicially noticed. A direction can be given orally and how a judge is to know, out of his own bosom, that a direction has been given by a Minister passes my comprehension; but, under this section as it stands, every judge is presumed to know every oral direction given by a Minister, official or inspector under the authority of all Orders made under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it will be necessary to amend the section to make it quite clear that it does not apply to oral directions.  An oral direction could not be judicially noticed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Or even a written direction.  Perhaps I had better say on the amendment what I would say on the section.  The section deals with Orders and instruments of every kind made under this Bill when it becomes an Act, and every judge is presumed to know that all these Orders, instruments and directions have been given, without any proof.</P>
      <P>No proof is brought before him at all, but he is presumed to know all about it.  Of course that is an extremely bad principle.  It is both bad and impracticable.  The ordinary statutes of this Parliament are, to use the phrase in this section, which is a technical phrase, &ldquo;judicially noticed&rdquo;.  In other words, every judge is supposed to know the contents of the statute law of the Parliament by a polite fiction, and his memory is refreshed by bringing before him a particular type of copy of the Act.</P>
      <P>The basic reason for that rule of evidence was due to the fact that public statutes were supposed to be notorious, because of public discussion of them while they were being enacted through Parliament.  That is the whole basis of judicial notice being taken of the statute law of a country.  There is no precedent for Orders made by virtue of statute, Statutory Rules and Orders, as they are called, being given the same status from the point of view of value as these statutes, because these Rules and Orders are multitudinous in modern circumstances.  They pass the wit of man to keep track of them even in this country.  Now, everyone is supposed to know all about Statutory Rules, Statutory Orders and directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to press this section at all.  The origin of this section arose from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal setting aside a decision of our old friend, the Military Court.  The prosecution in that case failed to prove the Order under which a person was being prosecuted, and the Court of Criminal Appeal held that it was a fundamental principle of the administration of criminal justice that every fact necessary to establish the guilt of the accused person had necessarily to be proved by the prosecution. That had not been done and, therefore, the prosecution had failed. I direct the Minister's attention to the basis of the decision in that case, that it was a fundamental principle of the administration of criminal law that every fact necessary to establish the guilt of the accused person should be proved by the prosecution.  Hot-foot on that decision an Order was made by <Col N="2601" /> the Government, under the Emergency Powers Act, providing that all Orders, Rules and so forth should be judicially noticed.</P>
    <P>I put down a motion objecting to that Order and calling for its annulment. The Minister for Justice defended the making of the Order.  The real ground on which he defended the making of the Order was, that if the Government did not make that particular Order a number of other cases in which convictions had been had would be set aside and something in the nature of chaos would ensue.  That defence was a rather reasonable de fence at the time.  Of course, if something had not been done every person who was convicted, in a particular case where the Attorney-General had overlooked the formality of proving these Orders, would have to be released.  It was a reasonable thing at the time to meet existing difficulties.  No such difficulties would arise under this Bill when it becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>All that is required is to have a Stationery Office copy of the Order under which a person is being prosecuted. All the prosecution has to do is to lean about three feet across a table with a 2d.  Order, to put it on the table and to prove it.  It proves itself when produced.  This section is being enacted in order to save the prosecution the trouble of having the necessary Order in court, and handing it to the registrar to have it marked.  I appeal to the Minister to say that it is not worth putting in this section, to abrogate what the Court of Criminal Appeal called a fundamental principle in criminal prosecutions, that the prosecution must prove its case to establish the guilt of the accused.  I appeal to the Minister not to have this unnecessary inroad into that fundamental principle.  It will cause no difficulty in the conduct of prosecutions under these Orders.  It must, inevitably, happen that these Orders are in court.  The court must know under what Order the charge is made.  The prosecution must have the Order in court in order to frame or to state their case.  The charge is based on the Order, which costs only a few pence and is in court.</P>
    <P>All this section is doing is preventing the prosecution having the trouble of <Col N="2602" /> taking it out of the desk in front, handing it to the registrar and saying &ldquo;That is a Stationery Office copy of the Order under which the prosecution is brought.&rdquo;  That may seem trivial but this section, if passed, will be a complete inroad into a very vital and fundamental principle of criminal law and I ask the Minister not to press the section.  It is not worth the trouble. It is eating into a vital principle, and I think that would be a bad thing for this House to do, particularly in cases where there is no real necessity for it.  There was a necessity for the Emergency Powers Order.  I recognised that at the time, although I objected to the Order. I recognised that that defence had some substance.  It has not now.  All it has to do is to produce a copy of the Order costing a few pence and handing it to the court.  It is not worth while abrogating in this small way that vital principle of criminal justice which is, that a man is presumed to be innocent until he is proved by the prosecution to be guilty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess I am unable to see the fundamental and vital principle to which Deputy Costello referred. If there is a principle involved in this matter at all, it seems to arise under Section 10, which provides that Orders and directions will have the force of law.  If Section 10 is passed and Orders and directions are given the force of law I cannot see why they should not be judicially noted.  Deputy Costello is moving an amendment to Section 10.  I had assumed that his amendment to Section 9 was consequential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the trend of his remarks that the Deputy sees them as separate matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that there is any principle involved at all in requiring a court to take judicial notice of Orders and directions which have the force of law.  I agree that the judge may not always remember the details of every Order; but, as the Deputy said, his memory will be refreshed by <Col N="2603" /> the registrar of the court, or whatever court officer is responsible for seeing that all the documents necessary for the trial of a case are before the judge.  How the principle is affected is by no means clear to me.  If the process is as simple as the Deputy has suggested, it can make very little difference to the person who is accused of an offence whether the court reads a document, because it has judicial notice of it, or because the document is submitted to the court by the prosecuting counsel and proven in the ordinary manner which the Deputy mentioned.  Frankly, I am not able to follow the force of the Deputy's argument at all.  I regard it as important that Orders and directions made by Ministers should have the force of law. If they have the force of law, it seems to me to follow, as a natural corollary, that they should be judicially noted. There is no principle involved in that. It is merely a device for ensuring that the effect of Section 10, which gives these Orders and directions the force of law, is reinforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has not been able to follow my remarks.  I tried to make the matter as simple as possible.  Section 9, with which we are dealing, and Section 10 have nothing whatever to do with each other&mdash;nothing whatever. When we come to Section 10 I shall have a few remarks to make which may perhaps illuminate the Minister's outlook on Section 10.  But the Minister may take it from me at the moment, whether these Orders have the force of law or not has nothing whatever to do with what I am talking about now.  Whether these Orders have the force of law or not, they are law.  They are a species of law.  If Section 10 is passed and these are given what is called &ldquo;the force of law,&rdquo; they still get only a little additional legal veneer upon them, but very little further effect by being given the force of law.  I can refer the Minister to a legal decision of the British House of Lords on the effect of a statutory rule getting the force of law; but I am quite sure the Minister does not want to hear a lecture on the <Col N="2604" /> legal aspect as to whether a statutory rule, which is given the force of law, is ultra vires or intra vires.  I might just state, for the Minister's information, the principle laid down in that case&mdash; the title of the case is Yaffe's&mdash;it is a peculiar name&mdash;the Minister may possibly have heard of it.  In that case it was decided that, even though a statutory rule or order made under a Statute was given the force of law, it could still be held to be ultra vires. That has nothing to do with what I am talking about here.  The first fundamental principle of criminal law with which we are concerned here is that a man is presumed to be innocent of an offence until he has been proved guilty by the prosecution and found guilty by a judge, or a judge and jury, as the case may be.  That is a simple proposition to which we all pay lip service, but which quite frequently is more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  But, at least, we all pay lip service to it&mdash;a man is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty.  At all events the Court of Criminal Appeal in this country&mdash;and the Court of Criminal Appeal in this country consists of a Supreme Court judge and two High Court judges&mdash; has laid it down that that principle is abrogated if in any single particular the prosecution fail in their proofs of a particular person's guilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the proofs is the Order under which the offence is supposed to have been created.  If the prosecution fail to prove that Order, they fail to prove their case and they have, therefore, violated one of the fundamental principles of criminal administration.  I think I have stated the decision of that court, not merely accurately but very nearly in the words of the judge who pronounced the judgment of the court. Therefore, what I am saying is not my interpretation of the matter, but the law as laid down by the courts.  Perhaps the Minister would prefer the law as laid down by the Special Criminal Court in this matter.  But that is the law laid down by the ordinary courts.  This section is abrogating that law and overriding the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in this country in a matter, as I suggest to the Minister, of no importance <Col N="2605" /> to the prosecution, or to the Government, or its administration, but of vital importance in connection with the maintenance of that principle. There is no doubt that these Orders will have to be produced in court. Why bring in this statutory provision which eats into that principle, even in a small way, where there is no practical difficulty in the way of the prosecution in proving these matters?  The situation may arise that a prosecuting counsel or solicitor may come into court and say: &ldquo;I have forgotten the Order under which this prosecution is brought; the court knows all about the Order,&rdquo; and the court says &ldquo;Yes, I know all about it.&rdquo;  The unfortunate prisoner says, &ldquo;What on earth am I being prosecuted for?&rdquo;  He is told, &ldquo;It does not matter&mdash;we know all about it.&rdquo;  That may happen.  It has in fact happened that a man was executed in this country on an Order which neither his counsel nor his solicitor could procure and which he himself never saw.  That Order was not procurable and the man was executed on foot of an offence created by that Order.</P>

He was found guilty of the offence.  He appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal and in that court the decision was reversed on the ground, as I understand it, that the Order creating the offence was not proven before the Special Criminal Court.  The Special Criminal Court had the Order before it.  Everybody participating in the trial had a copy of the Order.  It was frequently referred to during the course of the trial, but the formal act of proving the Order did not take place and on that technical point the decision of the Special Criminal Court was reversed by the Court of Criminal Appeal and a man, who had been found guilty of a serious black-marketing offence before the <Col N="2606" /> Special Criminal Court, escaped punishment.</P>

It is a tidier and a simpler method of ensuring that cases of that kind will be determined in relation to the law to have these Orders and directions judicially noted.</P>

      <P>That did not matter. The man could still be executed.  It did not matter to the unfortunate follow.  He was shot.  It does not matter to him that, in fact, at the time when he was charged with the offence under an Order which he never <Col N="2608" /> got&mdash;even during his trial&mdash;it does not matter to him whether that was judicially noted or not.  That is of no importance to him because he never saw it.  I think from the point of view of the administration of justice this is an outrageous section.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11.</P>
      <P>In line 26 to delete the words &ldquo;every direction&rdquo; and to delete all words after the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; to the end of the section.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why it is necessary that every direction shall have the force of law?  Why does he want it to have the force of law?  It is a new principle.  Am I right in saying that this principle was not in the old Emergency Powers Act?  How can a direction over the telephone have the force of law?  Why should it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the direction over the telephone so much as the operations of an inspector to whom power is delegated that is important. In the case of the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;and I speak of that Department because it is the one of which I have most knowledge&mdash;the power to give a direction was used where goods were detected in transit or in store which were obviously associated with black market transactions. A stop Order was given at once to prevent further movement of the goods or their disappearance pending an investigation relating to them, or there might be a further direction for the disposal of the goods to legitimate traders or Government authorities, like the Army.  I mentioned also a direction given to a trader to produce his records and books so that the inspectors can investigate the manner in which the trader is observing the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two things in this amendment. One relates to giving the direction the force of law.  The instrument most commonly used in enforcing rationing regulations is the Ministerial direction.  It is used not merely in relation to the transfer of goods as required from one trader to another in order to ensure equitable distribution of supplies, but it has been adopted also for the control of profits of manufacturers. Originally manufacturers' profits were regulated by means of agreements entered into with the manufacturers, but at a subsequent <Col N="2610" /> stage, when it was found these agreements were not always being observed, the terms of each agreement were embodied in a direction to the manufacturer, which made it an offence for him not to adhere to the agreement.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the direction or Order can supersede any legislation which has a contrary effect.  I will give an illustration why that power is necessary.  One of the devices adopted by the British Government in connection with the bread situation was to reduce the size of the loaf. Possibly we may decide to adopt a similar device for a period.  An Order or direction requiring that reduction would be contrary to the terms of a law concerning the weight and size of the loaf.  There is no power in this Bill to amend a statute.  Effect could not be given to the Order or direction unless it was supported by amending legislation, which it is desired to avoid. It is necessary, in the special circumstances under which this Bill will be operated, to provide that a Ministerial Order or direction will be given effect to, even if it is contrary to an existing Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The only real objection I have to this is that I do not see the necessity for it.  I do not see where it gets the Minister.  If an Order under this Bill enables the Minister to give a direction, that is a lawful direction and has the force of law, why is it necessary to say in the section that it has the force of law?  It is a direction authorised by the law.  I will leave it to the Minister to think that out.</P>

    <P>This is an effort to re-establish the Constitution, which has been invaded &mdash;if I am not mixing up metaphors too much&mdash;for the past six years.  At all events, the Constitution, if it has not been invaded, has been put on the shelf for the past six years.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been appealing to the Minister, in conjunction with other Deputies, for some amelioration of the application of the regulations governing the old age pensions code, having <Col N="2612" /> regard to the hardships of the times and to the fact that the regulations were framed at a time when money had a very much higher value.  It is not possible on this Vote to discuss the question of increasing old age pensions, but at least we are entitled to suggest that the regulations in connection with the very small sum made available for old age pensioners should be applied in some less drastic manner by the pensions officers.  With other Deputies I have to complain that there is no relaxation in this matter.  Quite the contrary.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister whether or not there has been any circular issued by his Department to these pension officers indicating the mind of the Minister and the Department in this connection, instructing them to have regard to the hardships inflicted upon people who are condemned to live on a maximum pension of 10/- with the somewhat illusory bonus that was given through the Local Government Department after the imposition of a further means test.  We know that pensions officers have been unduly rigorous in the application and interpretation of the regulations.  They are dealing with a section of the community who, because of their age and peculiar circumstances, cannot be fully versed in the interpretation of regulations and are easily trapped into making statements against their best interests. In my opinion, it would be in the interests of equity and justice if, at least during the present period, the Minister were to instruct his pensions officers not to be unduly rigorous in the application of these cast-iron regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a case quite recently of an old age pensioner in whose case the grant of pension was objected to by the pension officer.  The pension was granted by the local committee, which is composed of citizens, acting without reward, who try to do their duty as between the State and the applicant.  The pension officer seemed riled when that decision of the committee was upheld in the Department of Local Government and the award sustained.  In less than 12 months he came back again and because the old age pensioner had got a few days' work in an agricultural industry <Col N="2613" /> where he used to work from time to time, he decided to rescind the pension.  The old age pensions committee maintained that the transient benefit accruing to the old age pensioner was not sufficient to warrant interference with their previous decision, and the pension officer brought it again before the Minister for Local Government. I suggest that many of the applications and appeals coming before the Department of Local Government are caused by undue interference of pension officers and by vindictiveness in dealing with applicants.  I think that is altogether against the spirit and the letter of the Act.  I want to know if that is done on instructions from the Minister or is it due to lack of appreciation of the position on the part of the officers who are acting in the Minister's name throughout the country?</P>
    <P>The regulations are very complex. The maximum income allowable is 16/- &mdash;comprising 10/- pension and 6/- private means.  We frequently hear of the time when the Cosgrave Government were responsible for reducing the old age pension by 1/- and we hear whoops of praise of the Fianna Fáil Government who restored that 1/- but there has not been much comment, from one side or the other, on the fact that the income level has been reduced from £47 to £39, in other words from a total of approximately £1 to 16/-. When the 1/- was restored by Fianna Fáil, they did not make a corresponding restoration in this respect.  Therefore, these people have been suffering grave hardship and a very large number of old age pensioners are not entitled to receive the maximum pension of 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked for returns of the number of people in receipt of the various scales of pension.  These returns were given recently in the House.  The figure in regard to those in receipt of maximum pension is much more important than the figure of those receiving a less amount because the rigorous test imposed means that the old age pensioner or blind pensioner who qualifies for a maximum pension must be absolutely without means above a 6/- level.  I <Col N="2614" /> leave it to the imagination of Deputies to determine what 16/- a week is worth at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is not my practice to complain against officials but I want to complain against the inquisition in the case of old and blind people and the discourtesy that is shown in many instances by the pensions officers. Applicants for such pensions are entitled to respect.  They are the parents of this nation.  Recently there were two cases in which I was interested. I had to inquire from the pensions officer about them only to find that they had been lying for 13 weeks unattended to.  The pensions officer, without any apology, asked me if I would be good enough to call on one old age pensioner concerned and ask her to be in her home on a particular evening at a particular time when &ldquo;his majesty&rdquo; would call.  His only explanation for the delay of 13 weeks in each case was that he was harassed in carrying out the functions of investigation officer for old age pensions, widows' pensions, unemployment assistance and had a few other jobs thrown in.  Because of that, those people, who were down and out, and who looked for what this Parliament had given them, had to wait for 13 weeks before the inspector would call.</P>
    <P>I did not feel like being a penny-boy for that gentleman.  I reminded him that I was a Deputy representing my constituency.  When he did call upon that old lady, he cut her 2/- in her pension on the ground that her husband was a docker.  Her husband is 68 years of age and anybody knowing the conditions of dockers at Limerick will realise what he could earn at 68 years of age.  I am glad that I was able to appeal to the humanity of the Local Government Department, who repudiated the action of that officer.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister, frankly, does he think it reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances, to the hardship of the regulations even at the time they were framed, and to the present value of money, that the same rigour&mdash;and increased rigour&mdash;should be used by these officers, in contra-distinction to the kindness shown by the <Col N="2615" /> Department of Local Government. Does the milk of human kindness not flow in the veins of these officers or have they been fed on vitriol or vinegar?</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a pensions committee since 1935.  Such committees have done their best to hold the scales fairly and I say that the Minister's officers are not holding the scales fairly.  I want to know if you are aware of that or is it the result of a special circular on your behalf?  If not, I would ask that you would get in touch with these officers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This country is spending a large sum of money on the maintenance of its old age pensioners and blind pensioners.  We, all of us, regret that certain people should fall on evil days and it is a matter of pity, an unfortunate thing, that the State should have these large numbers of people to whom it has to make payments. We make considerable payments to these persons, but I do not think that the community in general gets anything like the results it should get from that large sum which we expend. Our principal aim, we must remember, is to enable these people who are in their old age or, in the case of <Col N="2616" /> blind persons, who have fallen on evil days, to maintain themselves; but the allowances made to them are manifestly insufficient for that purpose in present circumstances.  I do not think the Minister or any Deputy would attempt to maintain that body and soul can be kept together on 10/- per week &mdash;at least, not on the basis of the present cost of living.</P>
      <P>This matter of pensions is further complicated by the means test, or perhaps I should say by the application of the means test.  In so far as it is defensible, the means test exists as a means of protecting the Exchequer and the community in general against fraud by persons who would wish to obtain pensions when, in fact, they are not really in such necessitous circumstances as to warrant the payment of a pension to them.  That, I take it, is the underlying reason for the means test, and, if the means test were confined to that, I do not think anybody here would have anything to complain of but, unfortunately, through the tortuous machinery of bureaucracy, the means test is carried out in very different ways, the result being that unfortunate people are hounded and ground down to the last penny.</P>
      <P>I remember a case in which I was interested of an elderly woman who appealed to me to get some information for her as to what pension she would be entitled to.  I made inquiries and found that that elderly woman, who was half-crippled, was entitled to a pension of 1/- per week.  When I told her, she said she would not demean herself by collecting 1/- per week, adding that &ldquo;it was too far to walk and it would cost me 3d each way in the bus.&rdquo;  When the means test results in something like that, it is high time that this House inquired into the justice of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large sum of money we spend in helping these people is, in many cases, given out in such paltry amounts that it becomes a waste of public money. If a person gets 5/- a week, it is still 5/- a week to the Exchequer, but it may be worth little or nothing to the person getting it, because it may enable that person to pay only a portion of his rent and it is not much use to enable a person to pay part of the rent <Col N="2617" /> when he has nothing for food and clothes.  We are, on the one hand, wasting money by dribbling it out in small, insignificant sums which, in themselves, are useless, and, on the other hand, failing to attain the object we have in view, namely, to help the aged, infirm and blind.  That, I think, is the net position in which we find ourselves to-day, and I think it all points to the necessity for the coordination of social services.  Until that is done and until a larger amount of money is paid to these persons, we will still have the very sorry picture of aged persons whom we wish to help not getting anything like the help which the community at large would like to give them and which this House would like to see them getting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial amount of public money is devoted to old age pensioners.  It represents the third largest call on the Minister's purse, involving over £3,750,000, but as we can discuss only the amount of money spent and cannot discuss legislation on this Vote, there is not much for Deputies to say.  There are, however, a few features of the Vote to which every Deputy seems to be antagonistic.  One of these is the manner in which investigation officers carry out inquiries.  I do not know whether it is a Government Order that these men should be severe and should go into every detail to find every penny or sixpence which could be classified as income, or whether it is an individual habit on the part of these officers, whether they take a special delight in poking their noses into the most private affairs of people in order to get information, but it is definitely a practice that should be condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a means test, as the previous speaker has said.  It would be wrong if people in very good financial circumstances at 70 years of age could get a pension of 10/- a week in the same way as those who are poverty-stricken or down and out.  But, nevertheless, this means test is administered too harshly.  We all know that people at the age of 70 years are not as sharp or as shrewd as they were, and the <Col N="2618" /> sight of an investigation officer coming along scares them into making admissions which may operate against them in the matter of their pensions. It is a well-known fact, and I think Deputy Cafferky mentioned it last evening, that investigation officers have travelled all over people's small holdings, into their cow houses and barns, and have searched every inch of their haggards and gardens in an effort to find something which could be classified as income.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Byrne gave an instance where in some cottage in County Dublin the fact that the tenant had some hens was taken into account in considering income.  That would automatically bring down the amount of pension payable.  I do not know if I am justified in criticising the administration of this Vote, but if the Minister could in any way ease the arrangements he would definitely be doing something which would be popular in all parts of the House.  He knows, with the increase in the cost of living, how worthless even 10/- is to an old age pensioner, not to mention cases where they are only getting 4/-, 5/- 6/- or 7/- weekly.  Amounts of that kind are no good whatever to pensioners.  As Deputy Dockrell mentioned, it is in many cases waste of money to be paying small pensions of 1/- or 2/- weekly, and expect pensioners to waste their time walking, perhaps, two or three miles to draw them.  The whole system should be altered in some way.  I refer particularly to the means test.  If a person has an income of £39 a year his position now, seeing that the value of the £ has dropped so much, does not compare with what it was ten or 12 years ago.  I do not see why the supplementary allowance issued to old age pensioners could not be paid to them when they draw their pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Eamonn O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The position would be eased if the supplementary allowance and the pension could be paid at the same office.  I know that two Departments are concerned, but if it could be arranged that payments <Col N="2619" /> would be made at the same time, the old people would not have to queue up to get the supplementary allowance from the relieving officer.  Deputy Hughes pointed out that local pension committees, being composed of just men, tried to the best of their ability to deal with the claims that came before them.  I suggest that there should be closer co-operation between local committees and investigation officers.  These committees may decide that certain claimants are entitled to the full pension, while some others are only entitled to 2/-, 3/- or 4/- weekly. Sometimes whatever recommendations the committee make are waived aside at the beck and call of local investigation officers.  I do not think that is right.  If there was closer agreement between the committees and the officers I think the arrangements would work smoother.</P>
      <P>It is objectionable that the income of old people who receive money from children who have left this country should be taken into account when computing the amount of a pension.  It is no pleasure to these old people to see children leaving home to earn money in other countries.  When sons or daughters send home £50, £60 or even £300, to help to repay their parents, that money should not be taken into account when applications are made for the old age pension.  I know that it is hard to please everybody, and that the Minister can point out that it would cost perhaps £8,000,000 or £10,000,000 to give pensions that would satisfy the entire community, and that if he did so there would be a hue-and-cry from the Opposition Parties.  I honestly think that much more could be done for old age pensioners with the £3,225,000 that are now spent on that service in giving pensions to those who are justly entitled to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Political influence of any kind should not be used in such matters.  I understand that an order has been issued which states that Deputies should not approach the Pensions Department at the Custom House.  I agree that it should be left to the investigation officers, but should their decision be considered a harsh one, if the pensioners wish to complain they have no <Col N="2620" /> one to go to but their local representatives. I have in mind the case of an old woman, 70 years of age, whose claim for the full pension was disallowed, and 6/- granted, because her husband, a migratory labourer, who is 68 years of age, sent home money to help in the upkeep of the home.</P>
    <P>That procedure is wrong.  I hope that some different system will be enforced and that there will be more co-operation between investigation officers and pension committees.  When members of old age pension committees are willing to waste a day examining pension claims, investigation officers should not be so harsh or disallow so many claims.</P>
    <P>If there was more co-operation there would not be half the complaints that there are from old age pensioners. These old people deserve more consideration than they are getting.  I consider that they got little sympathy during the last 20 years.  I do not know how soon we will finish with the lip sympathy that they received up to the present.  I am glad to see, even at this stage, that the old age pensioners are organising in an effort to further their interests.  I think that is the only way that they will make any impression and get what they are justly entitled to get.</P>

      <P>One of the things that gets any man's &ldquo;goat&rdquo; is consideration of the position of old age pensioners.  Every man in the country is anxious that the Government should make some little effort to ease the burden placed upon these old people. Some years ago, when the Cosgrave Government was in power and when Mr. Blythe, the then Minister for Finance, reduced the old age pensions by 1/- there was an outcry from the Fianna Fáil Party.  I agree that that was not a good thing to do; but I would point out in this connection that we should not lose sight of the fact that the purchasing power of 9/- in those days was infinitely greater than the purchasing power of a similar amount of money in these days.  North, south, east and west the Fianna Fáil Party made capital out of that reduction of 1/-; they described the Cosgrave <Col N="2621" /> Government as a body of tyrants whose main object was the oppression of the poor.</P>
      <P>At the present time an old age pensioner would need at least 15/- to 18/- to enable him to eke out some kind of existence owing to present-day prices and the high cost of living.  But in the majority of cases, they are not even getting the full 10/- a week; they are getting 3/-, 4/- or 5/- a week and some of them have to walk three miles every week in order to draw that paltry sum.  It is disgraceful that a so-called Christian Government should treat its aged poor in that fashion.  I know that, if we ask for an increase, we shall be told that such an increase would involve too much money.  I say that, no matter how much money is involved, the aged poor of this country are entitled to some little comfort in their declining years and, when they have reached the stage when they shall soon lay down their burdens and pass to their reward, the least we can do is to give them something to ease the last years of their lives.  Surely, the Government ought to be able to give them a temporary bonus of 5/- a week.</P>

      <P>That is as far as I shall go in the matter at the moment. Now, I am entirely opposed to the means test.  In connection with old age pensions I think there should be no means test.  I know that we shall be told that if the means test were abolished old age pensions would involve millions.  I do not believe that they would.  I think that it is the duty of the children to look after their aged parents in their declining years.  I know that the majority of people, if there were no means test, who are living in fairly comfortable circumstances would never think of looking for old age pensions. Their children would not permit them to look for them because their children have a sense of pride and decency; they do not want any help from the State if they can fend for themselves.  We are not such a nation of scroungers that we would jump at any excuse to get a few bob off the Government.  Many people when they <Col N="2622" /> fall upon hard times have too much pride to look for assistance.  They prefer to live their own lives in their own way.  Most of the decent people in the country want nothing from the State.  They want to pay their own way.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there are certain people who must get help from the State when they are in low water or when they are physically incapable of fending for themselves.  Those are the people whom I would like to see the Government helping in a generous way. I think, too, that the cost of carrying out the means test is much too high.  All over the country we have officers investigating these claims for old age pensions. These men are in receipt of good salaries and they have travelling expenses all over the country&mdash;North, South, East and West.  If those investigation officers were abolished their salaries could be devoted towards increasing the old age pensions and they themselves should be left to take up positions as ordinary private individuals instead of spending their time peeking and prying into the intimate affairs of these unfortunate old people.  There is no need for that sort of thing.  If, as I say, those men's salaries were used to augment the present old age pensions, I do not think the increase would amount to such a very great sum.  In most cases the children of aged parents are quite willing to look after them.  It is the duty of their children to look after them. Those parents brought those children into the world and they worked hard to rear them to the best of their ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered, however, that at the present time among a certain section of the community, there is a somewhat bad spirit in regard to Government assistance.  That is due in large measure to the doles and various reliefs which are given solely for the purpose of political propaganda.  That has left the people in the position that some of them now will look for assistance without making any effort to find work or to fend for themselves.  I would like to see that spirit completely wiped out.  It is not a suitable spirit for a nation of freemen.  We are liable to become a nation of scroungers if something is not done.  I know the Government <Col N="2623" /> are proud of that fact because we are compelled then to eat out of their hand or else go across the water in order to earn a living.  That is what our famous Irish Republican Government has done for us; it is trying to make us a nation of State paupers and public scroungers.</P>
    <P>It is sad to think that we have spent five or six years appealing to the Government for a few more shillings for old age pensioners.  In Northern Ireland an old age pensioner gets 22/6 a week.  That is given with a good grace.  Here an unfortunate old age pensioner will hardly get 2/-, 3/-, 4/- or 5/- a week until he is almost on the borders of starvation.  In order to get 10/- he would need to be knocking at the door of the workhouse.  I have been fighting the case of a poor old man in my area for many years.  So far I have met with nothing but failure.  This old man is up to 70 years of age and is completely crippled.  Before he became completely crippled, eight or ten years ago, he was in receipt of 10/6 a week national health.  Some years ago he got a little bit of divided land.  For years that land was a liability to him. He could pay neither the rent, nor the rates, nor the taxes.  At the time when he became eligible for the old age pension he signed his farm over to his niece.  She got married and she, her husband, and a couple of children are now in occupation.  This old man made two or three appeals for the old age pension and on every occasion he was turned down.  There is not enough on the holding to support all the members of that household. The investigation officer said that he was not entitled to anything because he had a little farm. I know myself that he has no farm. Whether he has or not, I think he is fully entitled to the old age pension. Right beside that man there are two or three old age pensioners drawing the full 10/- for the last 15 years. Their lands are stocked; they have 15 or 20 head of cattle and two, three or four cows.  They are able to work their land to the full; yet, some of them are receiving the full 10/- a week. The other man gets nothing.  Due to <Col N="2624" /> his physical incapacity he spends at least ten months in every year in bed; he has to be dressed by his niece; he cannot go to Mass because the district is too hilly.  He cannot fend for himself. His hands are swollen; his legs are swollen.  He has nothing more than a bare existence.  The 10/- a week would at least buy a few ounces of tobacco for him; that is the only consolation he has left to him in this world.  On every occasion his application has been turned down.  I say that the investigation officer who is at fault in this particular case has a heavy burden on his conscience and he will have to account some day for the miserable position in which this poor old man is.  This old man feels that he is a victim.  I myself think he is a victim.  I shall bring this case before the Minister again because I will fight to the last ditch.  Something will have to be done.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal again to the Government to do something for these old people even at this eleventh hour.  If they got 15/- at the present moment that would not be too bad.  That could be done by giving them a temporary emergency bonus of 5/- a week. Again, I would ask the Government and all succeeding Governments to abolish the means test.  Very few more will apply for the old age pension.  The decent sons and daughters will look after their own parents and not look to the State for anything.  I ask the Government to abolish the means test and allow these old people to live in comfort for the few years they have left.</P>
    <P>One thing certain is that the investigation officers all over the country are definitely taking two and three years off the lives of these old people.  They shake from head to foot when an investigation officer calls on them.  He comes in with a lot of pomp and ceremony. He goes around the house and the sheds and out on the land, if there is any land, to find out if they have any hens or an ass and cart.  If he finds that there is an ass and cart there he says, &ldquo;There is comfort in this home.&rdquo;  If he sees a dozen hens he will say that they lay a dozen eggs a day.  He does not know that some of them do not lay at all.  He then calculates <Col N="2625" /> that there is so much money coming into the house.  He knows well that half a dozen eggs or a dozen eggs would not buy an ounce of tobacco.</P>
    <P>The investigation officers should be more humane and charitable instead of acting as spies.  I can say definitely that they are going round acting as spies.  I know they go to neighbours and ask if so-and-so has any means; if he is well off: or if he has any cash. Every second neighbour is nearly always jealous and says: &ldquo;Jack So-and-so is going to get a pension.  If he gets it, it is hard luck that I will not get it.&rdquo;  They will hardly ever do the decent thing and say that the person is entitled to the pension.  You will always meet a mean neighbour who will say: &ldquo;Why should he get it?  I saw him selling a bullock at the fair.&rdquo; An investigation officer has that in his mind when investigating the means of such a person.  No matter what he is told by that person, he will put him down as a liar and will not believe a word he is told.  I am not saying that that is the case with all investigating officers, but I think they are too fond of holding on to their job.  They would like to be in the position that the Department will say they are progressive young men who are saving a good deal for the Government and that they are entitled to more remuneration or a bigger job.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I think that is the case all over the country.  These are the younger officials and they want to step up the ladder.  They are at the bottom rung and they think the best way to get to the highest rung is to do the job very efficiently.  They are certainly doing it very efficiently so far as the Department of Finance is concerned. They are certainly keeping the money in the Exchequer and away from these old people, and they have something to answer for because they are not doing justice.</P>
    <P>I know investigation officers who went down the country and started talking to some old age pensioners. These old age pensioners thought they were jobbers or something like that and told them that they were well off. Generally people do not want to say that they are down and out because they have a sense of pride.  They do not <Col N="2626" /> want to tell anyone who comes in that they are down and out.  After getting a &ldquo;tale&rdquo; from these people the investigating officer will say: &ldquo;You made a mistake; I am not So-and-so; I am an investigating officer for the old age pension.&rdquo; The moment he says that the poor people almost fall to the ground, because they have destroyed their case. People like that want to show that they are better off than they really are.  I think investigation officers should notify old age pensioners as to when they will call on them and not go to them in a deceitful way.  They should be open and above board and allow these people to make their case and believe their word.  We are not a nation of liars and these old people are not liars.  The Government believe that they are, but they are not.  You will turn a lot of people into thieves and rogues if you allow a lot of these prying officials to go around like that in a secret and despicable and mean way. We should get shut of all this nonsense by abolishing the means test and let all these young men go back into private life and earn their living in open competition.</P>
    <P>I am disgusted with the present Government.  They are a lot of impostors. They denounced the Cosgrave Government for taking a 1/- off the old age pension.  They have really taken off 5/- or 6/- because 10/- a week now would not go as far as 4/- in the time of the Cosgrave Government.  They should give the old age pensioners at least 15/- a week and have no quibbling about it.</P>
    <P>I believe they are the most despicable Government in Europe.  They boast about being a Christian Government and want to get headlines in the European papers by saying: &ldquo;We are feeding the people of Europe.&rdquo;  They ought to tell the world that they are starving their own people at home; that they have people at home worse off than the people of Europe through their own mismanagement of affairs. Instead of looking for headlines in European papers it would be better for them to look after their own people.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but to-day I received from the Baltinglass local pensions <Col N="2627" /> committee the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That this sub-committee considers that the maximum pension to those entirely depending on it is hopelessly inadequate and is only a means of prolonging life in sordid conditions.  We appeal to the authorities to increase the amount to such a level as would enable them to spend the closing years of their life in peace and comfort.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, an old age pension committee is not a political body.  It is not confined to any particular Party or class.  It is representative of the various interests in the district in which it operates.  It is particularly representative of the clergy and social workers who have the interests of the nation at heart and, particularly, the interests of the poor and destitute in their district.  A committee of this kind representative of all Parties is not likely to make any unjust or immoderate demand on the State.  From its constitution, it is more likely to be influenced by considerations of justice and fair play.  A committee of this kind not only considers the case of the poor and the destitute but also the claims of the tax paying community and of the State.  It weighs all the issues fairly.  Having weighed these issues fairly, this local committee in my constituency has made this request to the Government.  The Minister may say it is easy for a local committee to make a demand such as this.</P>

      <P>If I am out of order in putting this request before the House, I think I have a good many companions in this debate.  It was very unfair and <Col N="2628" /> altogether wrong to seek to improve the position by imposing an additional burden on the local authorities.  The Minister should take full responsibility for the administration of this service. It is not a local service in any sense of the word.  It is humiliating and degrading upon the old age pensioners to have to go to the relieving officer and claim that they are absolutely destitute. It is degrading, not only on the pensioner, but on the members of his family.  The decent thing in this case would have been to give a small increase on the maximum pension, thus raising the 10/- to 12/6.  That would have been a small relief if it were given in the right way, but, given in the manner in which it has been given, it is an insult to the old age pensioner and an injustice to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>One thing the Minister has to bear in mind is that the value of money has fallen.  He must realise that 10/- to-day would not equal more than half what it was six or seven years ago.  Realising that, he must take the view that the old age pensioners were either too generously treated in pre-war years, or that they are being very unjustly treated to-day.  If the Minister had proposed to reduce old age pensions to 5/- or 6/- in 1938 or 1939 there would have been a tremendous outcry throughout the State, but the same result has been achieved owing to the rising cost of essential commodities.</P>
      <P>It is particularly hard on old age pensioners who are living alone, who have to pay rent for their little houses and who have to provide fuel for heating and cooking.  The Minister should take a fair and reasonable view of the situation.  He ought to be influenced by the unprejudiced and impartial view expressed by all sections of the community, that the allowance to the old age pensioners is unfair and that there ought to be a reasonable increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose while we have the law as it stands, with the means test, we must inevitably have investigation.  That investigation, so far as individual officers are concerned, is not a very nice job and it is inevitable that a considerable amount of criticism of their work is likely to arise.  Hence we have listened to <Col N="2629" /> Deputies criticising the administration of this Act.  I agree with Deputies who have made representations on the matter, about the very low purchasing power of 10/-.  In view of that, it is grossly unfair to have such a rigid interpretation of the Act.  I do not know whether it results from the work of the investigation officers or whether they are directed to be very strict in their interpretation of the income of the home, but it is well known that the value put on the income from very poor land by an investigation officer is out of all proportion to the actual income.  It is grossly unfair and unjust.</P>
      <P>Why is it necessary, if the people who administer this Act know their job, to have so many appeals to the Ministers?  The proof that their decision is wrong and their administration is harsh, unjust and unfair, is to be found in the number of appeals allowed in favour of the applicants. That number forms a very high proportion of the total number of appeals. If this Act were properly administered, I believe very few appeals would be made and, of the appeals made, a very low percentage would be decided in favour of the applicants.  If the investigation officers were doing their job properly, that would be the position.</P>
      <P>When a high percentage of the appeals is decided in favour of the applicants, that is clear proof that the administration generally is unfavourable to applicants and, in view of the very low purchasing power of 10/- &mdash;its value now is approximately 5/&mdash; that is unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very close scrutiny given to the incomes of people, who look forward to those few shillings to bring them a modicum of happiness at the end of their lives, is an objectionable feature. Imagine taking into account the few shillings a mother may get from her son in England.  The money is given as a gift, but yet it is computed as income.  I think the Legislature never intended that it should be regarded as income.  There is no guarantee that it will continue over any definite period. The giver never intended or expected that his mother's old age pension <Col N="2630" /> would be reduced because of the amount he sent her.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether investigation officers are advised by the Department to be rigid in their investigations and in their sense of values in so far as the very small and doubtful incomes on holdings of very low quality land are concerned.  I have often been shocked at the heartless attitude of investigating officers.  The investigating officers ought to be better qualified to arrive at a closer decision.  If the Act were being worked efficiently, the number of decisions by the Minister in favour of applicants would be very small.  That would be a proof that those administering the Act were capable of doing their jobs in an efficient way.  It would reduce the actual cost of administration.  It would reduce the number of appeals that are cluttering up the Department of Local Government, for a decision on which unfortunate people have to wait three or four months.  Surely it reflects on the administration.  I have no doubt the Minister is sympathetic in this matter and I would ask him personally to look into it and to end that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>In connection with the supplementary allowance of 2/6, it is grossly unfair, in the case where a parent is living with a married son who has a family and who finds it very difficult to live, that because there is income other than the pension going into that home, the supplementary allowance will not be granted.  I regard that as positively disgraceful.  If we can afford to be generous, at least we can afford to be generous to the old people who can hope to draw this contribution from the State for only a very short period. There is a good deal of resentment in the country in regard to the manner in which this is being administered and I would ask the Minister to give it his personal attention.</P>

      <P>I want to say, first of all, that there have been no new instructions issued to investigation officers for the last ten years.  The investigation officers carry out their functions under the law, namely, to determine the means of the applicant.  No matter where we set <Col N="2631" /> the limit of means, there will always be border-line cases in connection with which there will be disputes.  As the law stands, there is a means test. Some Deputies favour the retention of the means test and the increasing of the pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on the interpretation of &ldquo;rigidity.&rdquo;  There have been various suggestions made here to-day, as there usually are on Votes of this kind, about increasing the various allowances.  I think the height was touched by Deputy Giles who put forward a slight suggestion of 50/- a week that would cost somewhere between £25,000,000 and £30,000,000. However, many Deputies would be satisfied with something less than that.</P>
      <P>Practically everybody in the country would like to see an increase in the minimum standard of life that is guaranteed to all citizens.  We had a discussion about old age pensioners a couple of months ago.  Certain suggestions were made then which would have cost about £12,500,000.  The question is, can the State afford to provide, in present circumstances, very much more than it is providing for this particular service?  We are spending around £4,000,000 on old age pensions and blind pensioners and if we want to see their standard of living very greatly increased, we have either to increase the volume of goods available for general consumption or these pensioners must get an increase at the expense of somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2632" /> During the last few years there have been a number of improvements in social services, including old age pensions.  The family allowances scheme is costing a fair amount of money, but I do not think anybody would suggest, for instance, that family allowances should be cut off in order to increase old age pensions. Over the last 14 years, a big number of social services have been added and, as the Taoiseach pointed out, the time has arrived when they should all be looked at again with a view to seeing whether they cannot be co-ordinated and whether the expenses of administration cannot be reduced. That work is in the offing and I hope the new Department will soon be set up and that the Minister who will be responsible will take over the whole responsibility for the administration of the old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and the various other social services.  In the meantime, I can only say that if there are any specific allegations made against an official, over which a Deputy can stand, and if he reports the matter to the Revenue Commissioners or to me, they will be investigated.  That invitation is a usual invitation for a Minister for Finance, handling this Estimate, to make and, notwithstanding the eloquence of the Deputies here in denouncing the activities of the investigation officers, very few of them will come forward and give a specific case and make a special charge.</P>
    <P>Deputies usually content themselves with making certain wild allegations, such as Deputy Giles made, that an old person, who has no means, has been refused a pension and that her neighbours all around who are not entitled to them and who have vast sums coming in annually are getting pensions.  That is about as far as a number of Deputies are prepared to go.  If there is any Deputy who has a special case, either where the State is being defrauded by pensions being given where they should not be given according to the law, or where, in his opinion, an applicant is not receiving the benefits to which he is entitled under the law, I am quite prepared to <Col N="2633" /> investigate it, or to get the Revenue Commissioners to investigate it.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suím na raghaidh thar £5,000,000 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfas chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1947, chun an Chiste Fhorbartha Idirlinne (Uimh. 15 de 1946).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate arises out of the Finance Act of this year which was signed by the President to-day.  Section 30 of the Act establishes the Transition Development Fund and provides that, in the current financial year, there shall be paid into the fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas a sum not exceeding £5,000,000.  The Estimate, it will be observed, is for the full amount of £5,000,000 mentioned in the Act and it is proposed to make payments into the fund at such times and of such amounts within that limit <Col N="2634" /> as may be considered necessary from time to time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the purposes to which moneys in the fund may be applied, the Act allows me a wide discretion, subject to the overriding consideration that the purpose must be conducive to the development or improvement of the capital resources of the country, and the further limitation implied in the definition of public moneys as meaning moneys charged on, or issued out of the Central Fund, or provided by the Oireachtas.  On the negative side, accordingly, I am debarred from utilising moneys in the fund for any service which has not already been submitted to and approved by the Dáil and for or towards the cost of which the House has not already authorised some measure of assistance out of the public purse.</P>
    <P>As to the purposes to which the fund will be applied, I have already given some examples to the House both in my Budget statement and on various occasions when the Finance Bill was going through the Dáil.  We are passing through abnormal times at present when materials needed for the carrying out of desirable works of a capital nature, which normally would be fully provided for in the ordinary Departmental Estimates, or as Central Fund services, are costly and difficult to obtain.  My idea is that the extra cost attributable to the exceptional conditions prevailing should be met out of the Transition Development Fund.</P>
    <P>Among the services which are being considered for assistance from the fund is, first of all, housing.  It is proposed to encourage local authorities to go ahead with housing schemes by making supplementary grants available to them out of the Transition Development Fund towards bridging some of the gap between the existing standard subsidies under the Housing Acts and the increased cost of the dwellings. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health explained the administration of the fund by his Department recently, and it is the intention that each application for a supplementary grant by a local authority out of the fund will be considered on its merits and in relation to the reasonableness  <Col N="2635" /> of the tenders.  Grants may be made in respect of houses provided by local authorities since the 1st April, 1945, on the same terms as will apply to houses now being built or which will be started during the current financial year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health a year or two ago asked the local authorities to go ahead with housing, stating that he would see that the subsidies were adjusted afterwards to meet it.  A rough estimate of the cost of these supplementary grants up to the end of the next financial year is £1,100,000.  This will include both the extra subsidies earned this year by local authorities in the building of houses, as well as the extra subsidies that will be given to them on foot of the houses they completed last year.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the farm improvements scheme.  As I indicated in the debate on the Finance Bill, it was considered at the time of framing the Estimates for the current year that a provision of £400,000 would be sufficient to cover all applications for grants under the scheme.  The number of applications received proved, however, to be greater than was expected and if some of them were not to be rejected, additional money would be required to cover the surplus.  Rather than refuse these additional applications, I have agreed to provide out of the Transition Development Fund the extra amount required.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that an extra £60,000 will be required to enable all applications under the 1946-47 scheme to be dealt with.  Another £60,000 may be required to cover works authorised under the 1945-46 scheme, bringing the total extra requirements to £120,000.</P>
    <P>Supplementary grants will also be made available out of the fund to enable local authorities to undertake water supply and sewerage schemes. The additional money is required mainly for the reasons that (1) the cost of these schemes has risen considerably since pre-emergency days; I propose to give grants from the fund to the local authorities to meet part of this increased cost, and (2) owing to shortage <Col N="2636" /> of materials, etc., the undertaking of water and sewerage schemes was retarded during the emergency, and it is intended that such schemes should now be put in hands as soon as possible. This will involve a considerable increase in the normal assistance given annually from State funds towards such schemes and it seems appropriate that this additional temporary charge should be borne on the Transition Development Fund.</P>
    <P>No decision has yet been reached as to the precise basis on which the amount of the supplemental grants to be made available from the fund towards the additional cost of these schemes as compared with pre-emergency days will be determined, and the matter is under active discussion with the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I am sorry I am not in a position at this stage to say what amount exactly will fall to be met out of the fund for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Another purpose which comes into the picture is rural electrification. Expenditure on rural electrification is proceeding on the basis of the 50 per cent. subsidy provided for in the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, but should the actual expenditure disclose justification for a higher subsidy it has been suggested that the extra amount required should be met out of the Transition Development Fund for a period of two years.  It is not possible as yet to say what rate of progress the Electricity Supply Board will make in the carrying out of the rural electrification scheme&mdash;expenditure on which is expected to be spread over many years&mdash;nor is it possible yet to say at what date in the future the Electricity Supply Board will look to the Government to make available the subsidy involved in expenditure already incurred.  An Estimate for subsidy will probably be submitted to the House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1947-48 to make good to the Electricity Supply Board the free grant portion of rural electrification expenditure incurred during the calendar year 1946, and when that Estimate has been settled it should be possible to indicate what amount, if any, will require to be paid from the Transition <Col N="2637" /> Development Fund in addition to the Vote subsidy.</P>
    <P>That is in addition to the 50 per cent. subsidy already authorised in the Act.</P>
    <P>A further purpose to which the fund might be applied is suggested by a proposal I have received from the Minister for Industry and Commerce for a research grant to the Irish Alcohol Company.  This proposal is being examined in my Department and the tentative Estimate submitted indicates that annual expenditure on research would amount to about £2,000 a year for four or five years.  It has yet to be decided whether the fund should be used to finance the work during the first couple of years.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated to the House that I was considering defraying out of this fund the cost of the additional rating relief in respect of agricultural land provided for in this year's Budget. I think the general character of this relief and its temporary duration make it an appropriate charge against the fund, but no final decision will be reached until the terms of the new legislation which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has in hands comes to be settled.</P>
    <P>No doubt as time goes on other schemes for the improvement or development of the capital resources of the country which would qualify for assistance from the fund will suggest themselves and Deputies may be assured that any suggestions they wish to put forward in regard to any schemes that occur to them as worthy of assistance from the fund will receive due consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister was not able to give us some fuller information.  He has announced Estimates of expenditure amounting approximately to one-fourth of the £5,000,000 for which he is now seeking authority from the House.  Practically all of that is for housing.  But the Minister at one stage stated that the relief to be given local authorities in respect of housing from this Transition Development Fund would be approximately the additional cost over pre-war. He then went on to say that it <Col N="2638" /> should be an amount which would help to bridge some of the gap.  We ought to get something more definite than that.  We should like to know to what extent this fund is going to be used, to keep rents of houses built by local authorities somewhere within the capacity of the people who are going to occupy them.</P>
      <P>It will be admitted that the rents which had to be charged for houses built by local authorities, even prior to the war, were certainly at the maximum that the average occupier could afford to pay.  If the houses which it is contemplated will be built in the coming year, are to be built at a cost which will make it necessary to increase pre-war rents, I am afraid these rents can only be met by the people whom we are anxious to see put into decent houses by sacrificing some of the essentials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House is entitled, when there is such a sum as £5,000,000 required, to ask the Minister to state to what extent he proposes to bridge the gap between the present day cost and pre-war cost of houses to be erected by local authorities.  I assume that the figure £5,000,000 is based on some consideration of the various matters.  It was arrived at, I hope, after a search ing inquiry as to how the money could best be spent and allocated out of the £5,000,000 in respect of the various schemes.  I should like some further information as to why we are being asked now for a sum of £5,000,000, when the Minister can only give a rough estimate covering expenditure in the present financial year of £1,250,000 or £1,260,000.  I should like to know whether the Minister proposes, as an inducement to local authorities to go ahead, to give them out of this fund any additional grant towards the development of building sites.  Like the rest of us, the Minister is aware that materials are in short supply, and are likely to be in short supply for a considerable time.  We cannot tackle the housing problem in the way in which local authorities would like to tackle it, but they could be making considerable progress in the development of sites, by making roads, laying water mains, sewerage and so on, thereby being in a position <Col N="2639" /> to take immediate advantage when building materials become available and, incidentally, giving much needed employment.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister, in replying, would deal with that aspect of the housing situation because, so far as I could follow the Minister, this Estimate of £1,100,000 is based upon what is called the &ldquo;all-in&rdquo; cost of a completed house.  I should like to know also whether it has been considered by the Minister, in relation to this £5,000,000, giving increased or supplemental grants to private persons who are building houses for themselves, There are many people in this country to-day who would, I think, be prepared to undertake the building of houses to be occupied by themselves and their families if the Government would be prepared to give them some additional financial help.  I think that citizens who are inclined in that way and who are able to undertake the building of their own homes should be encouraged to the fullest possible extent.  I do not think there is any development, so far as housing is concerned, where we should be prepared to go further and to give the fullest possible encouragement than to encourage people, as I say, to provide their own homes.  In that connection it would be, perhaps, the greatest help that we could give to such persons if, either through their local authorities, or otherwise, sites could be made available at a reasonable price or at a reasonable rent on a long lease to private persons who are anxious to build their own homes; as we all know, if a person wants to build a house for himself one of his greatest &mdash;if not his greatest&mdash;difficulties is to secure a suitable site and to secure it at any sort of reasonable price.  That has been so now for a long period, but it was never more true than it is at the present time.  I would like if the Minister would tell us whether that aspect of the matter has been considered in any way or to any extent. If it has not been considered I certainly think that the Minister should take it into consideration now.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the Minister's statement in regard to providing whatever additional money is required out <Col N="2640" /> of this fund to meet claims under the farm improvements schemes.  That, in my opinion, is one of the really good schemes.  I have stated that on many occasions in this House.  It is perhaps the most fruitful scheme of all the schemes that have been introduced here.</P>
    <P>Not only the individuals concerned, but I think we can safely say that the nation itself has benefited considerably as a result of the expenditure of these moneys.  I trust that we are now in a position, as a result of the Minister's decision in connection with this particular fund, where any person applying, who is prepared to carry out the necessary improvements, will not be turned down merely because there is not a sufficient amount of money available. I think the Minister said that he was restricted in his allocation of this money to schemes which had already been passed or which had secured the approval of the Oireachtas. In one way I regret that because there is a work&mdash;I mentioned it here on a prior occasion although I come from an inland constituency myself&mdash;a very necessary work, in my opinion, which can be done, and which should be done, and which would give considerable employment, particularly in areas where other forms of employment are not readily available.  I refer now to the question of coast erosion.  I think money could be very, very usefully spent in checking coast erosion and I think that such a scheme would give very useful employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that it was proposed to make available out of the fund certain moneys in connection with the provision of sewerage and waterworks.  In that connection I want to say&mdash;I do not know whether this is the experience of other Deputies in this House&mdash;that we are all anxious to see sewerage and waterworks undertaken and we know that a great number of such schemes have been carried out in the last 20 or 23 years.  We know that waterworks and sewerage schemes have been carried out, particularly in the smaller towns and villages; but I would like to know from the Minister whether any inquiry has ever been made by the Department of Local Government and Public Health as to the <Col N="2641" /> extent to which those sewerage and waterworks schemes have been availed of by the inhabitants of the particular towns or villages.  You lay on the water and the main is there.</P>
    <P>In a great many cases the people living in those towns and villages are too poor to afford the additional cost of having the water and sewerage connections made to their own homes. We know that for the average person, particularly nowadays, that is a costly process.  If you go into a house tomorrow which has not been connected with sewerage or with waterworks and you have to undertake the work of connecting up your house to both the sewerage and the waterworks, you will find that the cost of doing so will amount to a considerable sum.  My point is that to a very large extent in the average town or village those connections have not been made and, in so far as that is the case, the waterworks and sewerage schemes are a complete failure and a complete waste of money.  That is an aspect of the matter which ought to be taken into consideration by the appropriate Department.  I think, before the Minister makes this additional money available, he ought to get from the Department of Local Government and Public Health a report on the schemes which have already been carried out, the extent to which those schemes are being availed of, or can be availed of by the citizens living in the particular town or village.  I can speak only from my own experience of the particular cases and schemes which have come under my own notice; but I am sure that what has come under my notice and what has been brought to my notice has probably come under the notice of other Deputies as well. To say the least of it, it does seem to me rather futile to expend thousands and, in some cases tens of thousands, of pounds on sewerage and waterworks schemes in towns and villages and then leave them there, a very big number of householders being unable to meet the cost of having their houses connected up.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer in connection with this Vote is the reference made by the Minister to grants for rural electrification. <Col N="2642" /> The Minister was unable to give us any information on that matter. He intimated, I think, that it was hoped that the Minister for Industry and Commerce during the financial year 1947-48 might be in a position to come to the House and give it information as to the sum required by way of additional financial provision for the Electricity Supply Board in connection with their rural electrification scheme.  However, to sum up, we are being asked here to provide a sum of £5,000,000 for a Development Fund.</P>
    <P>At the moment the Minister, apparently, is unable to give us even an estimate covering more than a quarter of that sum.  I must confess that that does not satisfy me.  There are many useful schemes of work which could be embarked upon even now.  We have more than enough unemployed people, more than we could hope to put on these schemes; but I think that we could make an appreciable mark on the number of unemployed and provide useful work and useful schemes which would give a return that would justify the expenditure of this money.  I must confess that I find it difficult to understand why we should be asked at this period to provide £5,000,000 when, so far as we can see from the Minister's statement, the Minister does not hope to spend more than about one-quarter of that money between now and the next financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>For a Minister for Finance, the Minister was very short of details in explaining this scheme to the House and why it is presented in this form.  The Minister told us that it is a transitional scheme.  Of course the name Transition Development Fund would show that.  But it seems to me as if it is an excuse to save the Government from making up their minds on certain fundamental points upon which they really ought to make up their minds, and the sooner the air is cleared the better.  Years ago I heard that most housewives had in their kitchen a stock-pot out of which they made a whole lot of things. Soup and gravy and various other parts of the meal were enriched out of it. It seems to me as if this Transition <Col N="2643" /> Development Fund is somewhat like the stock-pot of the households of ancient days.  There is to be a little ladled out for housing and a little ladled out for water and sewerage schemes.</P>
      <P>The Minister should try to give us some illustrations of the way this scheme will work.  Most people regard the cost of houses as having risen by anything from 50 to 75 per cent. above pre-emergency days.  I do not know, and I suppose the Minister does not know, how much higher, if anything, costs will go.  The Minister told us that some sort of calculation would be made about the rate at which the money was borrowed, what increased rent they would have to charge the tenants, and certain other factors, and that when these items were made into one bill the Department would tell them what they were to get.  I do not know why the Ministry would not take their courage in their hands and say: &ldquo;We will give so much over 50 per cent.&rdquo; or something like that; in other words, enable the local people to make some calculation in advance.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter with which I am rather disappointed. So far as I can make out, the speculative builder who builds a house for sale&mdash;it is largely for sale now&mdash;is not to get anything.  Does the Minister consider that that individual is a sort of social leper who should be driven out of the community?  I have always felt that anybody who built a house in town or country was contributing to the solution of the housing problem.  One of the things which has really brought the housing problem to a desperate position is that a whole lot of houses that have been vacated by the better class portion of the community are not available, as they were in the past, as a sort of glorified flats or tenements.  Nobody suggests that that is a desirable thing to aim at.  But I suggest to the Minister that it is very desirable during the transition period, and I am sure that the Minister would be the first to make those houses available, if that were possible.  Those houses are not now available and that is one of the factors contributing to the present desperate housing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2644" /> I should like to plead for the speculative builder to be retained in this country.  It is quite possible that some of them, if they find the draught too much at the present time, could pack up their traps and take their experience to a neighbouring country with very great disadvantage to us here and to the solution of the housing problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey complained that the water and sewerage schemes that had been installed had not been availed of to the extent that they should have been.  I think that is very true.  But I suppose that when materials get cheaper a lot of people in rural areas, who have not done it up to the present, will avail themselves of these amenities. In any case, the sewers and the water pipes were installed when they were much cheaper to instal them than at the present time.  Side by side with that, in a whole lot of other districts they did not proceed with sewerage and water schemes to the extent that they might have during the emergency.  I think it is quite true to say that there are whole districts in the country that are desirable for building, where sewerage and water schemes are only in contemplation.  I urge the Minister to try to get back to more normal conditions by treating the problem from a more normal angle, giving grants for the building of houses in such a way that most intelligent people could see where they were before they embarked on house building, and local authorities also could have a better idea as to what their financial position would be.  I think the position of the Minister towards the local authorities is &ldquo;Well, trust me, and I will see you right; I will not let you down.&rdquo;  That is all very fine, but it is an indefinite way of dealing with a very real problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are very reluctant to make a decision on this question of subsidies for housing. This is merely an attempt to postpone a decision as to what subsidy will be paid for housing in the future.  It is all very fine for the Minister to say it is an attempt to bridge the gap between pre-war and present costs. That may be, but we have a very acute shortage of houses.  Many young <Col N="2645" /> people are anxious to get married, but they cannot get a home, and that is a very serious matter.  We have to realize that that policy will not be helpful so far as local authorities are concerned.  Very heavy financial commitments will be necessary for housing over the next ten years and the sooner the Government face their responsibilities the better.  They should let the country know what the financial provisions for housing will be.</P>
      <P>This is merely a tentative proposal to cover a short period.  People interested in housing are asking what subsidy will be provided in the future. I agree with other Deputies that whatever financial assistance will be made out of the sum that is earmarked, it ought not to be confined to local authorities and State housing schemes. There ought to be some extension to private individuals who are prepared to invest money in providing houses for themselves.  The Minister has neglected another important aspect, and that is some method of stimulating private enterprise.  That ought to make a very important contribution to our housing requirements.  If State assistance is to be confined to local authorities, it will mean that the whole problem of housing will have to be solved by the State, and that is a short-sighted policy.  Full examination ought to be given to the possibility of inducing private enterprise to make a substantial contribution to this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given us very meagre information.  He has made no attempt to tell the House over what period he hopes to spend the £1,100,000.  What are the prospects of an immediate start on house building? Surely he is in a position to give the House more information on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the £120,000 for farm improvement schemes is concerned, it is to meet a deficit of £60,000 from last year, and to meet £60,000 for this year, as the sum estimated originally was not sufficient to cover the enormous increase in applications.  I think that at the present time, while conditions are favourable to the farmer, it is sound policy to encourage him to make <Col N="2646" /> all the improvements he can, particularly in relation to drainage, reclamation and farm roads, before any depression occurs.  The moment there is depression, it is inevitable that these improvement schemes will fall off.  Anything we can afford to spend in that way now will be a sound investment.</P>
    <P>In the matter of production, evidently the Minister has not given consideration as to how we could spend a capital sum to stimulate production. I do not know whether he has given any examination to the condition of the arable land, which has stood up to a severe strain in the emergency period in the production of our cereal requirements. Has he given any consideration to the condition of the soil, how far we have depressed fertility, and how far it would be necessary for the State to take responsibility in that connection?</P>
    <P>If, as a result of any depression that has occurred in fertility, production is reduced, it will be a very serious matter for the State.  In the last analysis, we all live out of the national pool of production.  We can have very fine social schemes and we can plan for social improvements, but it is out of the national pool of production that all have to be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are providing £120,000 for farm improvement schemes.  The Minister has earmarked less than half of £5,000,000, and surely he expects some suggestions from the House as to how he might spend that sum.  It would be very peculiar if the Minister went out of the House with the feeling that the House is barren of any ideas.  I am merely stressing how we should spend the sum that is provided for the transition period. <Col N="2647" /> We ought not to overlook one primary consideration, and that is, how we can permanently step up production. If we could do that, it would help the national income and it would have a definite bearing on our capacity to provide social amenities in the matter of housing and other things. I understand the Minister was contemplating the provision of £1,000,000 out of this sum for the relief of rates.  We were definitely given to understand that, because of a surplus likely to accrue from the Budget, £1,000,000 would be provided.  It is obvious the Minister is barren of any constructive ideas.  He is now going to earmark £1,000,000 out of this fund.  Surely it is time for the House to wake up and say that if this is to be a transition fund to help to start housing activities and other State activities, it ought not to be earmarked for that sort of thing when we can make provision out of savings and when the Minister has already informed the House that he has made provision out of savings for that £1,000,000 that he is now providing in the way of relief.  It ought not to be spent for that purpose, and I believe the Minister ought to be able to find other places where he can usefully and beneficially spend the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned water and sewerage, and again he was unable to give the House any information as to the extent to which money is to be provided to help local authorities in their activities in that respect and over what period it is likely to be spent.  The Minister ought to be in a position to give us more detailed information. The question of rural electrification, again, has to be examined.  We all appreciate the difficulties that confront the Electricity Supply Board in the matter of securing supplies of poles and wire for rural electrification but, having regard to the present rationing of electricity and to the fact that consumers who have been connected since 1941 have a very low ration, it is hardly possible to extend the network until our output has considerably increased. The whole situation is very vague and very fluid.  We do not know where we are and the Minister, apparently, is <Col N="2648" /> not in a position to provide us with very much information.</P>
    <P>In regard to the few points that I have raised, I would ask the Minister, when replying, as far as possible to give us the information we are looking for.  I am particularly anxious that something should be done by way of capital provision to ensure that there will be a definite and permanent stepping up of our productive capacity.  I submit that it is a vital and a very important consideration if our commitments and administrative costs are very high.  The question of the real national income ought to be ever present to our minds and the financial provision that can be made for purchasing or helping to purchase substantially increased quantities of artificial manures for the purpose of correcting soil conditions to whatever degree they have been impaired during the emergency.  That matter ought to receive the careful consideration of the Government.  Every effort should be made to secure substantially increased supplies of essential fertilisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present when the Minister was introducing the Vote and as I anticipate that some of the matters which we are discussing now may arise again on the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department next week, I shall be rather brief.  One of the main purposes to which the money allocated under this Vote will be devoted is the provision of additional grants to local authorities for housing, in order to offset increased costs.  That is desirable and will meet with the unanimous approval of the House.  I think a question arises here as to whether we intend, as I hope we do, to bring grants to local authorities to a level which will mean that the State will be paying the same proportion of the costs post-war as they paid pre-war. Then there is a case for reviewing the whole position of housing grants to private individuals.  We all realise that grants to private persons engaged in housing, pre-war, were inadequate and compared very unfavourably with the grants made to local authorities.  I am not suggesting that a private person building a house <Col N="2649" /> should receive the same proportion of the costs from the State as a local authority receives, but such a person is entitled to a higher proportion than was given pre-war.  Certainly, the grants should be reviewed in the light of increasing costs.</P>
      <P>In the pre-war period a £40 grant to a small farmer for reconstruction of a dwelling-house was very beneficial. Advantage was taken of those grants to a great extent and a great deal of useful work was carried out.  It seems to me, however, in view of the increased costs, that increased grants should be given.  Then there is the case of farmers whose valuation was over the maximum that would qualify for a grant.  As there is a special fund now being set up, some part of it should be used for the benefit of those people.  The Minister, when he travels throughout rural Ireland, must be struck by the inadequate and inferior housing accommodation available for a large percentage of farmers.  That applies not merely to small farmers but to farmers up to £50 and £60 valuation. Their housing accommodation is altogether inadequate and the assistance they can receive at present from the State is not sufficient to induce or enable them to provide better accommodation. Something should be done to meet the just claims of these people, particularly as an attempt is being made to meet the difficulties of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of grants to supplement the farm improvements scheme is very desirable.  It is very beneficial that the State should undertake half the cost of works under this scheme. The results have been satisfactory, and I think it a very useful purpose to which to apply this fund.  There are, however, as the Minister must know, big areas of land which require reclamation, drainage and improvement, the owners of which cannot undertake the work, even with a grant of 50 per cent.  An idea which has often occurred to me is that where there are large areas of such land, the State should be prepared to purchase it, to reclaim it and improve it, and then make it available for distribution.  That is a work which, if undertaken, would provide a large amount of employment, and <Col N="2650" /> would add to the total area of land available for agricultural purposes and for distribution to economic holders. A big scheme and a far-reaching scheme is urgently needed in regard to such land, and if the State were prepared to pay a reasonable price for inferior land of that type, to take it over, reclaim it, improve it and drain it, a great deal would be added to the productive capacity of the State.</P>
    <P>As we are providing a large sum of money for what is known as the transitional period, it is no harm to direct the Minister's attention to particular lines of development.  Another matter to which the Minister referred was that of further assistance to local authorities in regard to the provision of sewerage and waterworks.  The same considerations apply there as apply to housing.  Why should the private individual, living in a rural area, who requires to embark on expenditure in order to improve the amenities of his home, not be treated at least as generously as the local authorities are treated with regard to urban sewerage and waterworks?  The main point to which I want to direct the Minister's attention is that, if he is giving additional grants to a particular section of the community, he must be impartial and absolutely fair, and distribute these grants equitably as between one type of citizen and another in respect of similar services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that it is intended to increase the grants to local authorities for housing, but the Minister has not given us any idea of what the rents of these houses are likely to be.  I want to remind him that cottages which cost the municipality £400 to build ten years ago cost £800 to-day, and I express the hope that the grant which he will make towards each house will be commensurate with the increase in the cost of building and of acquiring sites and that he will not be niggardly in the distribution of this £1,000,000 grant to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing position is almost indescribable at present because of the inability of the municipalities to get materials for carrying on their housing schemes.  In addition to encouraging municipal authorities, I ask the Minister <Col N="2651" /> to go a step farther and to extend these grants to public utility societies and to any person who will put a roof on a house.  I ask him to give every encouragement to those who engage in this great national work, because the position, so far as Dublin is concerned, is appalling.  The old houses are falling down and new ones are not going up rapidly enough to take their places. In addition, the increasing population, due to people coming from all parts of Ireland into Dublin, has put the idea of getting a flat or a cottage completely out of the minds of thousands of people who are anxious to set up homes of their own.</P>
    <P>I therefore ask the Minister to do his utmost to encourage not only existing public utility societies but the starting of new public utility societies, and, in this respect, I think the parish councils have lost glorious opportunities. The parish council idea was a splendid idea, but it did not appear to be taken up very seriously in many parts of the country.  I think the feeling was that their powers were too restricted, but I suggest that, where parish councils can put up proposals for housing, they should get every encouragement.</P>
    <P>I should like to know also if the Minister proposes to allow any of this money to be used for a differential renting scheme.  The municipality of Dublin has at present in mind a scheme for the differentiation of rents in cases where men fall sick or become unemployed.  We have a number of people in sanatoria and the Minister for Local Government has urged&mdash;local bodies have agreed, and other authorities have recommended&mdash;that, while a man is in a sanatorium, he should not have to worry about the fear of eviction or the fact that his rent is running up.  Public men in Dublin feel that that differentiation in rents should be made, but it gives rise to a new problem.  When the contract is made and the tenants go into the house at a fixed rent, when that rent has to be reduced to enable the tenant to pay his way, the problem arises: out of what fund is the loss to be met?  I think the Minister might agree that that loss might be met out of this fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2652" /> In cases where a mother becomes a widow or a man becomes a patient in a sanatorium and is unable to pay the full rent, there ought to be a fund at the disposal of the public authority out of which the difference could be made up, so as to avoid imposing further burdens on those who are already in houses in respect of a differentiation of rent.  When a man has to go to hospital, and when the Government has in mind certain social services, that man should not be worried to any extent because he is not able to pay rent while he is away.  This is an opportunity for stating that, out of some of this money, municipalities and local authorities could make up the difference that arises in connection with the renting of houses in such cases.  I put that point to the Minister, so that he may consider it when he comes to make allocations from this fund for houses and flats.</P>
    <P>It is not known to many that old tenements that have fallen into decay have been converted into four flats. I wonder if the Minister is aware that it costs £1,000 to make a tenement habitable for four families.  It represents more than the cost of four cottages on the outskirts of a city.  I want to say that I am in favour of conversion schemes.  I am in favour of flats in cities near people's work and at rents that they can pay.  If they have to travel long distances and pay high transport charges, it is only adding to their burdens, and means taking something off the breakfast table.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to see that the grants he will make to local authorities will be substantial, and that power will be given to take from such grants any loss that would be incurred by the reduction of rents of tenants who are not able to pay what they undertook to pay.  It was appropriately stated by the Minister for Local Government that he proposed to allow £100 for the provision of an additional room in houses where there were tuberculosis patients. Owing to the way tenements are constructed in Dublin it is not possible to put up additional rooms for that purpose. For that reason I hope the <Col N="2653" /> Minister will consider the point I made in reference to a differentiation in rents.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure, but I impress upon the Government the necessity of bearing in mind the increased cost of materials for house building.  That is imposing a burden on the ratepayers that they will not be able to stand much longer.  There is a huge demand for houses in Dublin. They would want to be provided by the wave of a wand.  Meanwhile, people are being evicted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are so many different purposes for which this Transition Development Fund could be sought, that I have some sympathy with the Department of Finance in deciding to what purposes it will be devoted.  It is generally agreed that the most necessary purpose is the provision of houses.  I see the housing problem in this light, that the first responsibility of the State is the provision of houses for those who are unable to provide for themselves, namely, subsidised houses.</P>
      <P>In the past the subsidy for these houses was, in most cases, fairly generous, and considerably assisted local authorities, but since the war the cost of building has risen so steeply, coupled with the scarcity of materials, that it is difficult to forecast what the housing problem will mean for local authorities.  Dublin Corporation floated a loan for housing at a cheap rate.  As the House is aware that will partially meet the problem in the city.  In County Dublin, where the county council proposes to build 1,400 houses, it is essential that they should float a loan due to the substantial increase in the cost of building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that is the position as far as subsidised houses are concerned, the Minister is aware of the fact that before the war a depositor who went to a building society got a loan for the building of a house by putting down an amount in the region of £100.  He was then facilitated by the building society <Col N="2654" /> and secured a fairly decent sized house. The position now is that building societies expect a deposit of about £300 and, with the continued high rate of interest, I cannot see how a depositor, considering the depreciation in the value of money, can afford to pay such a large deposit.  I want to know from the Minister what proposal the Government has to meet the position of a person, who is between the subsidised class in the community and others able to provide for themselves.  I refer to a person who is prepared to pay a deposit, or alternatively prepared to pay a rent, in excess of the rent charged by a local authority but who, as a result of the Rent Restrictions Act, cannot get accommodation.  The effect of the Rent Restrictions Act at present is that no builder will build houses for letting purposes.  It does not pay a builder at the present time to build houses for letting.  All the builders with whom I have come in contact, or about whom I have learned anything, have all decided that the minute they have finished their houses they will put them up for auction.  While that is desirable from the point of view of allowing people to purchase their own houses, it has the obvious disadvantage that the person who is unable to purchase a house for himself and who cannot, in so far as his immediate needs are concerned, put down sufficient money to purchase a house, finds himself faced with the problem that he is ineligible to receive a house from the local authority and is unable to purchase a house, or put down a deposit, to a building society.  I would like to hear what proposals the Government can put forward to meet that situation.</P>
    <P>That situation has been considerably aggravated by the war, on the one hand, and by the depreciation in money and the fact that wages and salaries have not been raised commensurate with the increase in costs and, on the other hand, by the reduced building which has taken place and by the fact that a considerable number of people have got married since the war and are now looking for houses&mdash;people who formerly did not require them.  In other words, there is a vicious circle which prevents quite a large section of the <Col N="2655" /> community, who are unable to provide wholly for themselves, but who would be prepared to make some contribution, becoming entitled to local authority assistance.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear what view the Minister has in regard to that.  I would also like to know if he is now in a position to say whether the Government proposes to tackle the problem of the high rates of interest charged by building societies.  That may be slightly outside the scope of this Transition Development Fund, but it has some bearing on it.  The banks have agreed to facilitate the Government and local authorities and, in most cases, these are being facilitated by a low rate of interest so far as building is concerned.  The only people who are not facilitating the borrowers are the building societies.  I would like to hear the Government's view on it.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the £1,000,000, which is mentioned in the Budget statement in relief of rates, is to come out of savings or out of the Transition Development Fund.  If it is to come out of savings, I take it the £1,000,000 now is additional and there will be altogether £2,000,000 in relief of rates.  I would like to impress upon the Minister that, if rates rise in the next year as they have risen in the past year, particularly in view of the pending enactment of two Bills, the Local Government Bill and the Public Health Bill, it is reasonable to assume a very rapid increase in rates will take place. If the total relief of rates this year amounts to £1,000,000 the Minister might well consider devoting another £1,000,000 from this fund in order to reduce the burden on the ratepayers. I think these are the two principal problems. Certainly, for the next two years the largest problem facing any local authority, or the largest problem facing the country, is the question of housing, and I think no effort should be spared to reduce the burden on the local authority and on private builders in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter which I wish to raise in respect of this fund.  Will any portion of this sum be allocated for the purpose of sanitation <Col N="2656" /> and water schemes to local authorities or will cognisance be taken in that respect of grants that were given previously to local authorities by the Department of Local Government in regard to such schemes?  Formerly, the local authority, who undertook a water or sanitation scheme, received a grant amounting to 40 per cent. of the capital cost.  Will that grant be given in the future, or is it proposed to supplement it out of this fund?  Is the fund merely for the purpose of subsidising or helping to reduce the cost of building?</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the problem in regard to private builders. The problem is there, but it is also there in respect of small holdings to which a reconstruction grant of £25 was hitherto applicable.  There is a huge number of these holdings which are badly in need of reconstruction and improvement.  Every day there are inquiries from these holders as to the possibility of some grant being made available to them for improvements, Perhaps the Minister could make available some portion of the £5,000,000 in this respect.  It would be a very desirable thing to do and it would confer a benefit on a worthy section of the community. It would also be desirable to make some portion of the fund available to the private builder, particularly if the private builder is going to be called upon to help in solving the housing problem.  Like the local authority, he would need a larger grant in the future to encourage him to build. I do not quite understand what Deputy Cosgrave means when he says the Rent Restrictions Act prevents the private builder building at the moment.</P>

In connection with the grants for repairs to farmers' houses, I noticed in the papers in the last few days that the Parnell celebrations are about to take place.  In his native county, Wicklow, there are a number of houses being built for agricultural labourers, together with houses in the urban areas.  It was the idea of Parnell and his colleagues to build cottages for the agricultural workers.  The result of that policy was that it was possible to keep the agricultural labourers on the land.  In my young days I saw them knocking down a good many of those cottages.  If things continue as they are at present there will be nobody left on the land. Everybody is moving to the cities and towns.  Some people say that the cities and towns are becoming top heavy.</P>

      <P>This is mentioned&mdash;<Col N="2658" /> the necessity for water in rural areas. I am speaking on that matter.  We have here water, electricity and drainage.  There was a time when fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale were called the Magna Charta of the Irish farmers.  The present Magna Charta of the Irish farmers&mdash;it is not, perhaps, so alliterative&mdash;is water, electricity and arterial drainage.  They are most important, and I congratulate the Minister on the assistance he proposes to give in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned in this House by a Parliamentary Secretary that £1,750,000 had been spent on regional schemes in three years.  The estimate for Scotland, which. in area and other matters, resembles our country very much, is £8,000,000.  The majority and minority reports of the Agricultural Commission recommended an adequate national survey of the watertables with a view to having an adequate supply of pure water in every rural area.  I do not know that the Government has gone as far as they should in their regional scheme.  A national survey is required.  Where you have a regional survey, you have people living on parallel roads and roads at right angles clamouring out for water.  We have a case in Tipperary like that where the water is coming from the Galtees. There are people on 20 adjoining roads requiring water.  It is Ireland's greatest need at the moment.  The Census returns will reveal that.  Two Deputies, not members of my Party, made a tour of my constituency when travelling to and from a congress in Killarney.  They told me that some Deputies thought I exaggerated this matter, but they had travelled, through 40 miles of my constituency and found that I had not exaggerated.  The regional schemes are very laudable and good.  I am not boasting of it, but I was the first to suggest in this House the provision of a water supply for rural areas.  As a result it was taken up by Lord Beaverbrook and his syndicate of papers and it is being put into operation in Great Britain.  I suggest that the regional survey will not be a success. We need a national survey and we should get it.  I would put the provision of a pure water supply for the rural areas before the rural electricity <Col N="2659" /> scheme and the arterial drainage scheme.  If you give a rural dweller his choice he will elect for a pure water supply and stick to paraffin and candles.</P>
    <P>At present the farm labourers' wage is £114 a year.  That is nothing to boast of.  If a labourer is employed on a farm at drawing water with a horse and cart and barrel for a quarter of a day, that amounts to £28 a year.  The horse, cart and harness, etc., would come to another £28.  If he is at it for half a day it means another £28.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take up very much of the time of the House on this Estimate, but I should like to suggest to the Minister for consideration certain problems that have arisen in or about the City of Dublin which are difficult of solution at the present moment.  The Minister, of course, and everybody else here are aware that there has been a relatively big expansion of the outskirts of the city and, in particular, of areas like Cabra and similar areas on the south side, which grow up relatively quickly. Large numbers of people were transported or transposed into these areas. <Col N="2660" /> A lot of that development took place during the war years and under conditions where schemes for building and developing new areas were seriously handicapped.  The result is that at the present moment you have in these areas virtually new towns, new urban districts, attached to the city.  But these districts are lacking in certain amenities which are more or less necessary to them for normal functioning.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that possibly some of the moneys to be allocated under this Vote could be very usefully spent in dealing with the problems in these areas. Take a place like West Cabra.  It is virtually a new town.  It is far enough from the city to be self-contained, and it must be self-contained in regard to shopping facilities, dispensary facilities, and that kind of thing.  On the other hand, because it is near Dublin and is part of Dublin it will have to be developed as if it were a part of Dublin, not as if it were a country town, so to speak.  One of the difficulties that arises is the provision of sufficient school accommodation.</P>
      <P>I am informed that in some of these areas the question of developing recreational facilities for the children is somewhat urgent.  There is the question of medical facilities, the provision of an adequate number of dispensary centres and child welfare centres and things of that nature.  Then there is the transport problem.  For instance, a large number of workers in these areas have to come into the city or have to go to other out-lying parts to work.  The difficulty is that workers in the south city, say, in the Rathfarnham area, under the present transport arrangements have to come into the centre of the city and then go out again.  It is particularly awkward for workers who have to go from Cabra to the south city.  A more direct route would be better; for instance, a route right across by Manor Street, crossing the river somewhere about the Kingsbridge, and then going into the Crumlin area.  I might be very well asked what this has to do with the scheme.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that under this transitional development scheme there is room for the development of cross-arteries or boulevards.  That is what I am really driving at.  I am suggesting that a certain amount should be spent in Dublin.  We must remember that Dublin is absorbing a large number of people from the country and it is continually growing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to mention, in connection with these transitional development schemes, that there are districts around Dublin which should be considered.  As an example, I am suggesting that schemes to develop transverse communications, which are singularly lacking in this city, would be very desirable.  Up to 20 years ago Dublin was a relatively small city. Because of the addition of Crumlin, Cabra, Killester, Mount Merrion and other areas, not only has it grown in population, but its area has grown. Nevertheless, the old communications exist and the whole tendency is to come to the centre.  It is not sufficient for the city, as it stands, to converge on the centre and diverge out again and I make the plea for the outlying areas of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister cannot do everything we ask.  He has a certain amount at his disposal and his problem is to make the best of it.  We understand that, and we know that he will consider these things sympathetically.  I plead for these areas, just as Deputy O'Donnell is pleading for adequate water supplies throughout the country.</P>

      <P>No matter what may be the type of public development for which a local authority gets a grant from the Exchequer, additional grants can be given in order to cover the abnormal expenses due to the present high cost of materials.  That would apply to the development of roads, sewerage, housing and all other types of development, but, of course, out of this fund we will not give grants to substitute <Col N="2662" /> what local authorities should do themselves&mdash;substitute the money which they should raise and spend themselves.</P>
      <P>I tried to give in the Budget speech, and since, some idea of how this Transition Fund might be used for development purposes.  I pointed out that the reason it was being brought in and that moneys were being provided in this form was because I could not foresee exactly the schemes which might be put forward, on which it would be spent.  I gave some schemes like housing and farm improvements. To-day I give a few more, such as sewerage, waterworks and rural electrification. Deputy Dockrell and others are not satisfied with the examples I gave.  They want me to give in detail an indication of how £5,000,000 will be spent.  I cannot give them that; I cannot even say whether it will be all spent or not.  All I can say is that if public authorities and State and semi-State organisations have schemes which they want to carry out, and which have been held up because of transitional difficulties and the high cost of materials, I am prepared to help them out of this fund in the next couple of years, and this year, to the extent of £5,000,000 out of this particular Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Deputy Dockrell is not satisfied and he wants me to treat the problem in a more normal way, as he says.  If the problem were normal I would treat it in a normal way.  I am reminded of the late Father O'Flanagan's story.  When, with a friend, he was going along a road he saw a man being chased by a bull.  The man was defending himself with a graip.  Father O'Flanagan's friend said to the man: &ldquo;It is a shame for you to use the prongs of the graip on the poor old bull.  Why do you not use the other end of the graip?&rdquo;&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the man in the field, &ldquo;if the bull attacks me with the other end.&rdquo;  If the problems were facing me in a normal fashion, I would tackle them in a normal way, and the normal way for providing funds for various purposes is to give a detailed Estimate to the Dáil in advance as to how it is proposed to spend the money.  It is because I could not give that detailed Estimate, and <Col N="2663" /> because the Departments were not in a position to do it when preparing the Estimate, that I brought it forward in this particular form.</P>
    <P>There were very few additional suggestions made on this Vote as to how we should spend this money.  There were some proposals upon which we could not spend money out of this Vote because at the present time there are no public funds being devoted to the purposes suggested.  Somebody wanted to spend money developing sites for private builders. There is no sum being spent out of public funds for that purpose, so that we could not do anything for it.  We can, however, provide, and always have provided, for development work in relation to schemes of houses for public authorities.  A fair amount of that was done during the war out of the ordinary unemployment schemes Vote and I promised in the Budget speech that if local authorities would carry on building houses, even if they were not in a position to complete them to the point at which they could give them over to tenants, that I would, out of the Transition Fund, carry the capital charges until they were in a position to complete them and have them ready for renting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell wanted me to say that we should give to local authorities a certain percentage of the sums they spend on houses over 50 per cent. addition on pre-war costs.  A 50 per cent. addition on pre-war costs or a percentage above that, if it were a fixed percentage, might have the result of giving too much to certain local authorities and not enough to others.  I think it is more fair to say to local authorities: &ldquo;Get your tenders.  If the tenders are reasonable we are prepared to give you a grant out of the Transition Fund which will so reduce the charges on that house as to bring it within the power of the incoming tenant to pay having regard to the current level of wages.&rdquo;  I have nothing against the speculative builder, as Deputy Dockrell seemed to allege.  All the local authorities, I think, take advantage of the ordinary private builder to get houses built.  Very few local authorities build houses by direct <Col N="2664" /> labour.  Private enterprise is being enlisted in the building of houses for local authorities.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other question of giving additional facilities to speculative builders to build houses for sale, I do not know that this is the time to encourage that over much.  With the shortage of materials, additional grants to private people for the building of houses by themselves or through the speculative builder, will simply have the result of increasing competition for the restricted amount of material and have the effect of increasing the cost of house building.  If, however, materials became freely available it would be a different matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen was not present when I introduced the Estimate.  We do propose to give to local authorities for sewerage and water schemes an additional grant beyond the 40 per cent. up to £40 that has been given heretofore. The Minister for Local Government and I are in consultation about that at the moment and we will be able to make an announcement to the local authorities in regard to it.</P>

      <P>I forget what the figure was.  However, we are considering it and any local authority who has a proposition to put forward should go ahead and have the plans in order.  I will say a word now to Deputy O'Donnell. There is nothing to prevent a local authority going ahead and providing water.  There is nothing in the law that stops them from doing so.  I do not know what grants they get normally from the Department of Local Government for such schemes, but if the normal grant is not sufficient to encourage them to undertake the work and if there are additional costs due to the emergency and they want an extra grant out of the Transition Fund, we will help them out of that fund to go ahead with the work of providing and <Col N="2665" /> extending the water supply, rather than have them waiting and putting it on the long finger.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne talked about differential rents.  The differential rent idea could only be worked by the local authority.  This Transition Fund is to reduce the rents of houses now being built or to be built in future to such a figure as will be reasonable, having regard to the existing level of wages.  If there is a catastrophic decline in the income of some family due to disease or accident or similar cause, the local authority will have to chip in to help. That is what they are there to do. That is one of their functions.</P>

      <P>If the local authority want to subsidise the rent or to pay the rent for some person, they pay it out of their rates.  If the local authority wants to do it I think it is right that they should do it themselves rather than that they should be the agency simply for distributing an unlimited amount of State funds.  We would very soon get rid of all the State funds we had or could collect in that system.</P>
