      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether any of the sugar, sent by Ireland to the International Red Cross, was allocated to France; and if so, whether he is aware that sugar is being offered for sale for export ex Nantes to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 10,000 tons of sugar included in this year's gift for relief in Europe, 1,000 tons were allocated to a well-known French charitable organisation&mdash;Entr'Aide Francaise&mdash;in accordance with the arrangements which I described to the Dáil when moving the Vote in June.  This gift of 1,000 tons of sugar has already been shipped to France.  I am not aware that sugar is being offered for sale for export from France to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While readily assenting to any proposal to send sugar to the hungry people who have none available from any other source, I ask if the Taoiseach is aware that, shortly before the 1,000 tons of sugar in respect of which he got the plaque landed in France, the following letter reached me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says he is not aware.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy could have made me aware, if he had letters to send to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the letter, offering me 6,000 tons of American refined <Col N="480" /> sugar, 95 per cent.  Cuban origin, f.o.b. Nantes, France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had the opportunity to send that to me or my Department and did not avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I could have checked up to see what the position was.  I say that, in so far as I am aware&mdash;and I am absolutely convinced &mdash;this charitable organisation has distributed the sugar as it was intended it should be distributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking what the charitable organisation did.  I am asking the Taoiseach if it is commonsense for us to be sending sugar to France when, in fact, offers are being made to sell 6,000 French tons of 95 per cent Cuban sugar, ex Nantes&mdash;and there is the offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had sent me that, I would have inquired to find out what was the truth in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I now produce an offer, addressed to a sugar importer in this country, offering 6,000 tons of sugar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer this?  If 6,000 tons are available for purchase at Nantes, does he not think that the French Government might purchase that sugar for their own people, if they require 1,000 tons from this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that Irish citizens, born in Northern Ireland, who were not resident there on 1st January, 1940, are required to obtain a residence permit, from the Government of Northern Ireland, before being permitted to resume residence there; and if he will make representations with a view to having this onerous restriction removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that Irish citizens, born in Northern Ireland and permanently resident there, are required, when travelling to England, to procure travel permits from the British Passport Office in Dublin, in cases when they do not wish to avail themselves of the Northern Ireland travel identity cards issued by the Northern Ireland police; if he will state the reasons why such persons cannot be provided with Irish passports, issued by his Department, which afford them the protection of the Irish High Commissioner in London, whereas such protection is not available to holders of British passports or other travel documents; and if he will take steps to arrange that, in future, all Irish citizens travelling abroad, irrespective of their place of abode in Ireland, will be provided on application, by his Department, with Irish passports or travel permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>According to my information, the facts stated in the first part of the Deputy's question are not correct.  Travel permit cards are <Col N="482" /> not issued by the British passport office in Dublin.  The position is that holders of Irish passports and travel permit cards desiring to travel from this country to Great Britain must, in compliance with British regulations, obtain a visa from the British permit office here in Dublin before departure. That requirement applies to holders of Irish passports and travel permit cards living not only in this part of the country but in the Six-County area as well.</P>
      <P>As regards the remainder of the Deputy's question, the position is that Irish citizens born and resident in the Six-County area are entitled to obtain Irish passports or travel permit cards on application, and no such application is rejected on the ground that the applicant was born in the Six Counties or is resident in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can give me no evidence contrary to these facts. That is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has received representations from the Irish Citizens' Union of Birmingham in connection with this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he has (a) sought, and (b) obtained, otherwise than from Press reports, information establishing, to his satisfaction, that the Archbishop of Zagreb and Primate of Yugo-Slavia has received a sentence of imprisonment; if he has not received such information, if he will state where he sought same; and if he has succeeded in obtaining such information, if he will state his intentions on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That the Archbishop of Zagreb received and is serving a sentence of imprisonment is a matter so universally admitted that, beyond Press reports, I have not sought any confirmation of it.  The matters on which I have sought confirmation, and upon which I have received certain confidential reports, are: the general conditions at present obtaining in Yugo-Slavia; the circumstances of the Archbishop's trial; the charges made against him; the evidence adduced and the nature of the court.  From such reports as I have received I am convinced beyond reasonable doubt (a) that, as the result of the war, the conditions in Yugo-Slavia to-day, as in some other European countries, make it extremely unlikely that the Archbishop of Zagreb could have received a fair trial; (b) that, in fact, he did not receive a fair trial, and that actions <Col N="484" /> which flowed naturally from his pastoral duty were misrepresented as partisan political action; (c) that forged evidence was tendered and accepted, and (d) that the court was partisan.</P>
      <P>As I said a fortnight ago, should any practical way present itself in which we can be of any help in bringing effective influence to bear on the situation the opportunity will not be neglected.  It must be obvious to all who desire to secure a lasting peace that religious freedom is a necessary, a vital, part of the foundation.</P>
      <P>The one course open to me at present is to make representation to the States with which we have diplomatic relations, urging that by whatever means are at their disposal, whether through the United Nations Organisation or otherwise, they should use such influence as would result in bringing to an end this campaign of religious persecution of which the imprisonment of Archbishop Stepinac is but an instance.  This I propose to do when I have received the fuller reports which I am awaiting.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say, in view of his statement now, whether, even if he does not accept entirely the phraseology of Deputy Dillon's motion, he would consider putting a motion from the Government before the House that would enable the House to give full expression to the detestation that we have of the actions that the Taoiseach now says he has information about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that owing to the inferior flour now being supplied by the Irish flour millers it is impossible to make satisfactory bread; if he will make representations to the millers on this serious feature of the people's main food, and, if necessary, recommend a lower percentage of extraction to make better bread and eliminate waste; if he will state what percentage of Manitoba (No. 1) hard wheat it will be possible to include in bakers' flour for each of the months from November, 1946, to March, 1947 (inclusive); and if he will instruct the flour millers that the percentage of such <Col N="486" /> hard Manitoba wheat, in any and every particular delivery, shall be clearly stated on the millers' invoices, so that bakers may be able to properly regulate the temperature and water content of their doughs, and thus get the best results from the available grists.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, under present circumstances, it is physically impossible to improve the quality of the bread available for public consumption he will agree to the issue of a joint statement by his Department, in conjunction with the Irish millers and bakers, so that the blame for the poor quality of the bread can be properly apportioned and not thrown altogether on the shoulders of the bakers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to both Questions No. 7 and No. 8 together.  I am aware that there has been some deterioration in the quality of bread recently due to the lower quality of the grain from this year's harvest and the fact that owing to the exhaustion of reserves of grain, the product of this harvest had to be used without delay. Neither millers nor bakers can be held responsible for the quality of the flour and bread now available.  I cannot, however, authorise a lower flour extraction until the position regarding supplies of imported wheat for the whole cereal year is clearer.  It is impossible to say what percentage of Manitoba hard wheat will be included in the millers grists between now and March next as this will depend upon the quantities of such wheat which it will be possible to secure, which is not yet known.</P>
      <P>I understand that it has been arranged that the millers' baker customers will be notified when any change is being made in the strength of bakers' flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is that in respect of each wagon of flour the baker gets he should be told what the grist of that wagon is, because, although he might get a general instruction that they were going to increase the quantity of domestic wheat or Manitoba wheat, the difficulty is that when you get a particular consignment, unless you are notified in respect of that consignment, you may use the baking process appropriate to the previous consignment and you may lose a whole day's baking because you do not get complaints until the bread passes into consumption.  If they would attach it to each consignment then bakers could take some measure of precaution in any case to ensure that the flour would be used to the best advantage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that, at the recent wool sales at Sydney, Australian wool was sold at prices ranging from 10 to 60 per cent. above last year's controlled prices; that in Ireland wool is being sold at from 20 to 40 per cent. below last year's controlled prices; whether he is satisfied that Irish farmers are receiving a fair price for their wool this year; and if not, whether he will permit the export of wool so that it may be sold at competitive prices at home or abroad, wherever the best price is offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Licences are freely given for the export of approximately 75 per cent. of the total Irish wool clip which can be sold wherever the best price is offered.  The balance of the clip comprising the finer types of wool must be retained for home consumption until <Col N="496" /> such time as reasonable supplies of Merino wool are again available.  The realised price for this wool in the Dublin market is higher than the price of imported wool of comparable quality.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Australian wool prices recently increased above last year's level and that the present level of Irish wool prices is below that allowed when prices were controlled. This does not, however, imply that Irish wool could realise a higher price if there was complete freedom of export.  The controlled prices here for the last few years were well above contemporary world prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is true that controlled prices here are well above world prices, what is the necessity for imposing restrictions on exports?  In fact, if you require a person to have a licence in order to export wool, you create a ring of licensed exporters who agree on an unduly low price between them and refuse to offer the Irish farmer who has wool for sale any more than that low price.  If you are paying higher prices here, why not take control off altogether?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are paying a higher price here, as the Minister says, than is ruling in the world market, will not the quantity of wool that this country requires be kept here because the Irish farmer will get a higher price for it at home?  There will be no inducement to send it abroad.  What, in fact, is happening is that the wool dealers are forming a ring, and because they are the only people who can send wool abroad they are apparently in a position to tell the Irish farmer that they will give him so much and no more.  If the Irish farmer refuses to sell to them he may leave the wool in the pack in his store until the maggots eat it.</P>

      <P>The yellowing of foliage of the sugar beet crop which was noticeable in many cases this season as early as the beginning of July was partly due to the disease known as Virus Yellows, but there is little doubt that it was also to some extent due to mineral deficiencies in the soil arising from the scarcity of certain fertilisers. It is not possible at this stage to estimate precisely the effect of the disease on the yield and sugar content of the crops affected or to come to definite conclusions on the points mentioned in the Deputy's question, though the indications are that the incidence of the disease was greater in the immediate neighbourhood of seed crops of beet and mangold.</P>

      <P>In view of the unfavourable weather conditions during this season's harvest, it has been arranged that licensed millers and licensed wheat dealers should give some latitude in the matter and refrain from making deductions unless the moisture content is considerably in excess of 23 per cent.

Does he think that fair to the farmers who grew <Col N="509" /> wheat during the whole emergency?  As one with 24 years' experience of flour milling, I know that wheat must be damped in order to make flour and does he think it fair that the millers should be allowed to make this deduction when the guaranteed price is 55/- per barrel, as we have so often heard announced on the wireless?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Valuation Office sent forms this year to persons in County Mayo whose names the county council had listed as being the occupiers of turf bogs or turf banks which they desired to have valued or revalued for rating purposes.  In accordance with normal procedure, details of income and expenditure in each case for the years 1944, 1945 and 1946 were sought to enable the rateable value to be determined.  Where turbary already has a valuation such valuation may be increased, decreased or left unchanged as a result of the revision, according to the circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that throughout the whole of Mayo a number of small farmers have got forms to fill in showing what capital sums they have made out of turf production during such-and-such a year? Is he also aware that a patriotic appeal was made by the county surveyor of Mayo, and I assume by the county surveyor of every other county, asking small farmers to try to minimise the cartage of fuel by increasing turf production on private bogs?  If these small farmers are asked to fill forms, it inevitably will mean an increase in the valuation of the turf bogs which they got for their own production, but, due to their patriotism and sense of duty, they tried to help to make up the shortage of fuel.  Does the Minister consider that that is fair?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann on behalf of the Irish people places upon public record their detestation of the travesty of judicial process which culminated in the imprisonment of Monsignor Stepinac, Archbishop of Zagreb and Primate of Yugo-Slavia; calls upon all Christian peoples and all those who do not actually hate Christendom to join in repudiating as fraudulent this pseudo-trial and in stigmatising it for what it is&mdash;a crude pantomime of justice, designed for the purpose of defaming Christianity in general and the Catholic Church in particular, so that the international Communist conspiracy <Col N="525" /> against individual liberty everywhere may be relieved of its most formidable and uncompromising challenge, which must always come from Christianity; directs the Ceann Comhairle to communicate the terms of this resolution to the Presiding Officer of every sovereign Parliament sharing with us membership of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</P>
    <P>I submit that that motion might properly be described as a matter of urgent public importance, (1) on the ground that the imprisonment of Monsignor Stepinac continues and (2) that his imprisonment represents part of an international Communist conspiracy which is proceeding and the exposure of which, and the modest contribution towards the defeat of which this House can make, is a matter of urgency in that, with the passage of every day, the conspiracy grows further and its destruction becomes much more difficult.</P>

Monsignor Stepinac's trial and imprisonment by the Government of another State does not come into this category and I must, accordingly, refuse to the Deputy leave to make the motion.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that my ruling has reference only to the process under Standing Order No. 29 which the Deputy has invoked, and is without prejudice to his ordinary right to move the motion already standing in his name, when it is reached.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this measure yesterday, the Minister did not make a convincing case so far as the activities of the company are concerned. The information he gave us regarding their activities, from inception up to date, revealed incompetence and ineptitude&mdash;if the company can be blamed for launching out on a project that could scarcely be made a success.  The Minister rather reluctantly told us yesterday that alcohol is now costing 7/6 per gallon.  The production of the company at any time was far from economic but, even at present, when compared with the prices of imported fuel for motor propulsion, <Col N="528" /> a figure of 7/6 is outrageous.  We imported for the first 12 months of this year 19,000,000 odd gallons of petrol, which cost us £717,000, representing a price of 8.9d. per gallon.  That is the figure at which we can secure motor fuel and we have this type of &ldquo;cod&rdquo; industry producing alcohol at 7/6 per gallon from raw material obtained at a price that is not economical from the point of view of the producers.  Potatoes for this purpose are being purchased at about £4 per ton while the actual market price is over £10 a ton.  That, in itself, is an indication of the success of the project. The Minister asks the House to widen the powers of the company so as to permit them to launch into other activities.  He expects the House to have confidence in the capacity of the company to carry out certain investigations with a view to engaging in other activities.  If the House concerns itself with the record of the company, it cannot agree to the Minister's proposals.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the country know that the project has been an absolute failure and that this is an effort to switch over to other activities so as to save the faces of the company and of the Minister.  When introducing the original Bill, the Minister informed the House that alcohol would be produced at 1/9 per gallon.  It was never produced at anything like that figure.  It was produced at about 3/6.  The figure I mentioned was the estimate given by the company to the Minister of what their product could be sold at&mdash;an estimate that was 100 per cent. wrong. Now, we are asked to provide power through legislation for this &ldquo;dud&rdquo; State company to carry out further investigations with a view to activities in other directions.  It is almost certain that this company will decide that they are capable of producing certain chemicals&mdash;that is, if they want to continue in operation and to draw their salaries.  They should not be charged with the responsibility of investigating those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not make quite clear to the House the extent to which the Scientific Research Bureau will co-operate with the company or the <Col N="529" /> extent to which responsibility will be placed on the bureau to determine the technical methods to be adopted.  If responsibility is to be placed on this company, with its record of ineptitude and failure, I am vigorously opposed to the proposal that it should be empowered to produce sulphate of ammonia.  Before the war we were handicapped by not being in a position to buy certain essential artificial manures for our main industry.  The price of phosphates was higher here than in any other country, because we were pursuing the unsound idea that that industry needed protection.  That had its repercussions.  Relatively speaking, we were, probably, the lowest users of phosphatic manures in the world.</P>
    <P>It is a very essential plant nutrient that the Minister contemplates can be produced by this company.  The Minister referred to the investigation that was carried out by a departmental committee, that he felt was unsatisfactory. I agree that a departmental committee was not the right committee but of the two methods of investigation I would prefer the departmental committee to the method now suggested by the Minister, that this company should investigate the possibilities of producing sulphate of ammonia in this country.  It is generally understood that the production of synthetic sulphate of ammonia would require very big and expensive plant and in order to produce at an economic price it would be necessary to produce much more than our own requirements.  If we have an output in excess of requirements will it be possible to produce so economically that we can sell on the world market in competition with, say, Imperial Chemicals or other companies turning out huge quantities under most favourable conditions?  I warn the Minister that this article is being sold ex-factory by Imperial Chemicals at £9 10s. 0d. per ton.  The pre-war price was about £6 10s. 0d.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to an investigation of the possibility of producing a nitrate in this country but in my opinion the people that the Minister suggests should be the manufacturers are not the people to carry out the <Col N="530" /> investigation.  It ought to be carried out by an independent tribunal.  If this company is to do the job, it ought to give evidence before that tribunal and explain its technical methods and financial requirements, and so on.  It is my opinion that if we charge this company with the responsibility of making a decision in this matter, the decision will be to launch into the production of sulphate of ammonia and we will then find ourselves in the position of having to pay for this very essential raw material for agriculture 50 per cent. more than the price at which we could buy it outside and then the Minister will put a tariff on imported sulphate of ammonia or possibly prohibit its importation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been stressing recently the importance of exports so that we may command foreign exchange which is the means of purchasing essential imports.  The Minister realises that to a very large extent we must look to agriculture to provide those exports.  Therefore, we must get the raw materials for agriculture at the same price at which other countries command them, so that we can compete against these countries in the world market.  The Minister must know that every action of his that raises the price of raw material to agriculture is impeding the possibility of expanding agricultural exports.  I warn the Minister to be extremely careful in this matter of producing sulphate of ammonia and particularly careful in view of the record of this company.  I do not think it is the right type of company for this work.  It is the same story, a State company, manned by civil servants, and the taxpayers' money being put into it.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us an account of the capital, £275,763, returning a profit of £14,000.  That profit is derived, first of all, by asking the farmer to take an uneconomic price for his potatoes and secondly, by selling the product at an exorbitant price which it could not command but for the fact that the petrol people are compelled to admix with the imported fuel a certain percentage of this alcohol at a price far above that at which fuel can be bought. The price of industrial alcohol is 7/6 as against 8.9d. for imported petrol. <Col N="531" /> It is amazing to find the Minister coming in here, merely to save face and to defend this dud industry, seeking other activities for this company.  The Minister has not made a case for it and I think the House, under no circumstances, could agree.  Apart altogether from the important consideration of the capacity of the country and the qualifications of the company there are certain objectionable provisions.  If we are to rely on the record of this company for our prognosis of its future activities, we can have no confidence at all in this company to carry out the work.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 8, if the facilities are granted that the Minister contemplates, before the issue of certain chemicals a licence would have to be issued.  I object to that because I have had experience of a somewhat similar circumstance in regard to the importation of leather.  Calf-hide was not produced in this country in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of boot manufacturers and certain people were allowed to import calf-hide under licence but, when the application for a licence was made, it was sent to a particular tannery and if the tannery could not provide the hide that was required, the tannery recommended the particular applicant for a licence. I am satisfied that the big manufacturers in the boot business were able to secure a licence to buy leather at a cheaper price than the smaller men in the trade and thereby had an advantage in being able to sell their shoes at a lower price.  The same abuse can occur here, if we are going to have the same type of machinery in operation. Certain individuals will be favoured with licences to import chemicals and possibly to import at a financial advantage, and the Minister scarcely can contend that that is desirable.  The moment you set up this sort of thing, it is inevitable that it will be open to abuse.  I suggest that Section 8 of the measure certainly would be open to the abuse of certain individuals being favoured with a licence, to the disadvantage of other people.  The Minister certainly did not make a case for extending the powers of the company to enable them to engage in other <Col N="532" /> activities, and I say that they are not the people to carry out these investigations that the Minister suggests.  On the record of the company, they are not a company which can command the confidence of this House.  So far as this Party is concerned, it could not support the measure.</P>

      <P>Recent declarations by leaders of the Fine Gael Party led some people to expect and their followers to hope that they were going to take a more progressive line in the future on this subject of industrial development here.  I am sure every member of the House, irrespective of Party, is intensely disappointed by the speeches we had on this Bill from Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Hughes. They certainly conveyed that their <Col N="533" /> approach to the Bill was one of uncritical hostility.  They did not discuss even the proposition contained in the Bill, but merely adopted a line of uncompromising and uncritical hostility to any project relating to industrial development with which the Government is associated.  I do not think that my remark is unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider what was said.  Neither Deputy Hughes will contend nor anyone who heard him will agree that he spoke about this Bill.  He spoke about the production of industrial alcohol.  What is the proposition in this Bill?  It is that the powers and functions of the Industrial Alcohol Company be extended.  It is not proposed in this measure to interfere with their industrial alcohol enterprise, it is not proposed to give them any further money, but it is intended merely that they should be used for a purpose which I had thought everybody would have agreed to be desirable.</P>
      <P>We are at the stage now when we can review our war-time experience and consider what action we should take, arising out of that experience, to strengthen the industrial structure of this country.  Our war-time experience showed us that there are many industries here, the operation of which during emergency circumstances is of vital importance to us, but which are dependent for their operation on the provision of a continuous supply of various industrial chemicals.  The quantities of these chemicals may be relatively small, but they are essential to the operation of the industries.  I cannot say&mdash;and, in fact, nobody at this moment could offer a firm opinion&mdash;as to the practicability of producing these industrial chemicals here on an economical basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that some of them could not be produced here on an economic basis, but we think it is desirable that there should <Col N="534" /> be an organisation in existence which will have examined the technical possibilities of their production, which will know precisely what is involved in their production and which could, under future emergency circumstances, be entrusted with the responsibility of their production; and which might, even under normal circumstances, be given a licence to engage in their production as a commercial proposition.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Alcohol Company was established for the purpose of producing power alcohol.  Deputy Hughes compared the cost at which that industrial alcohol is being produced with the cost of imported motor spirit.  It was never suggested that it would be possible to produce power alcohol here at a price comparable to the price of imported petrol spirit.  That fact was clearly recognised when the original Bill was passed and this company was set up.  We had two objects in mind then&mdash;one had ceased to be important before the company began to operate, namely, to establish a method of ensuring a minimum price for potatoes. Deputy Hughes will know better than other Deputies here that there is no effective method of guaranteeing a price for potatoes; but we considered that an effect equivalent to a guarantee could be secured if we could establish an organisation prepared to buy all the potatoes offered to it at a predetermined price.  By that method, it is possible, in effect, to create a situation in which potatoes would not ordinarily be sold below that price.</P>

      <P>I hope I will be allowed to speak without interruptions from Deputy Dillon.  At the time the industrial alcohol project was conceived, the price of potatoes had fallen very low. It was an entirely uneconomic price. Potatoes were sold at that time at as low as 30/- per ton.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, but it was not sufficient.  If that is the Deputy's idea of how such a situation could be handled, we can consider it on its <Col N="535" /> merits, but I do not think it has any merits.  The situation which existed in relation to potato production here had, in fact, considerably improved before the industrial alcohol company came into production.  In fact, production during its earlier years was based, not solely on potatoes, but on the use of molasses purchased either from the Irish Sugar Company or imported.  There was, of course, also the idea to establish here the equipment for the production of power alcohol against the possibility of circumstances arising in which petrol supplies could not be obtained from abroad or in sufficient quantities.  It is quite clear that a factory established either for the purpose of operating in the potato market in the manner I have indicated or to produce power alcohol as an emergency measure, could not plan its production upon the basis of a continuous and regular output every year.  Its production is related to the quantity of potatoes offered to it, and, of course, the production of power alcohol in ordinary times is not essential to the supply of motor fuel in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes said that the company did, in fact, fail during the emergency.  That is completely untrue. This company during the years of the emergency produced about 4,000,000 gallons of motor spirit.  That may have been a small quantity when related to the petrol imports over the same period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It produced motor spirit in the quantities that we decided it should produce it.  The Deputy has lost sight of the important consideration that if the imports of petrol had been curtailed much more seriously than they were, and if the whole economic life of the country had been tied up at any one time by reason of our inability to get motor spirit at all, then by adopting more drastic measures, we could have expanded the production of power alcohol.  It was comforting to have the knowledge that we had the equipment and the organisation there to do it if necessary.</P>

      <P>The price at which alcohol is produced depends entirely on the price the company pays for its materials.  In fact, the effect of the compulsory admixture of power alcohol on the price of motor spirit was this, that the price of petrol had only to be increased&mdash;that is, the total cost of motor fuel to the country&mdash;by about 1/2d. a gallon.  In practice, as the House knows, the price at which petrol was sold to the consumer is very largely determined by the amount of tax that the Government wants to take from it. I merely mention these matters, however, to get the minds of Deputies clear on those points.  It has nothing whatever to do with this Bill.  I do not think anyone suggests that there is not in charge of these distilleries an efficient organisation of chemists and engineers.  They were certainly chosen for their efficiency, and I think that they have done a very good job in keeping the industry going in the difficult circumstances of the war and in adapting its equipment to the production of certain classes of chemicals which we were in urgent need of during the war.  If it were not for it, we would at times have been without ether and formaldehyde and we could not have got for our hospitals and laboratories the undenatured alcohol which they required at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention these matters for the purpose of refuting the suggestion that there was any inefficiency or incompetence in the management of the undertaking.  There is no possible basis for any such suggestion.  The Government, coming towards the end of the war and faced with the knowledge that we had these supply problems during the war, believed that we should now investigate the possibility of avoiding similar supply problems in another emergency, so that there would be a supply of such industrial chemicals as it is possible to produce on an economic basis here.  We have an organisation which is suitable for <Col N="537" /> the purpose of examining these matters. We could have decided to create a new organisation.  If we had produced a Bill to establish a new organisation, it would not be criticised in precisely the manner in which Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Hughes have criticised this Bill.  We decided, however, that it was unnecessary to set up a new organisation because there was already in existence an organisation which could do this work.  It had the staff, the organisation and the experience to enable it to do this work better than anyone else in this country. That is why it was decided to adopt the device of altering the expressed objects and powers of the Industrial Alcohol Company so that it could undertake these further functions which the Government had in mind.</P>
    <P>As I explained, it is not proposed in this Bill to alter the finances of the company.  If, arising out of the investigations undertaken by the company, it is decided that the company should embark upon some new form of manufacture that will involve the provision of substantial capital&mdash;sulphate of ammonia, for example&mdash;further legislation will be required.  We have left the matter in that position deliberately so as to make it clear that the Dáil must, in fact, be consulted before any large-scale project can be proceeded with.  I do not know what Deputy Hughes' fears are concerning the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia here.  I often wished during the war that we had been more vigorous in our efforts to establish the industry before the war.  We might have succeeded in establishing the industry in 1938 or 1939 if we had pursued the task with greater energy.  If we had done so, not merely would we have had adequate supplies of sulphate of ammonia during the war but we would have them now and at a much lower cost than we can import them.  I do not know if the Deputy fully appreciates that the sulphate of ammonia industry is particularly suitable to this country.  The main raw material used in it is gypsum.</P>

      <P>The plans for the establishment of the industry before the war contemplated production on a scale that would be more than adequate for the country's requirements and at a price lower than the commodity was at that time being sold in Great Britain.  When, originally, we contemplated the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia here we approached various foreign firms, including the main supplier of sulphate of ammonia to this country.  That supplier was naturally opposed to the idea of our making sulphate of ammonia for ourselves. When he became convinced that we intended to proceed with the project, he adopted the ordinary device of cutting prices here in order to discourage it.  We feel, however, that if we can get sulphate of ammonia produced by an Irish firm at a price similar to the prices charged for that product in adjacent countries we will have done reasonably well.  Deputy Hughes talked about the manufacture of superphosphate not being possible here unless protected by a tariff.  That is not correct either.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has got it fixed in his Fine Gael mind that no industry can be run in this country as efficiently as elsewhere and that we cannot produce industrial goods as cheaply as elsewhere.  He mentioned leather.  We are arranging at the moment for the import of leather, both finished leather and semi-tanned leather.  Has the Deputy any conception of how the price of that leather compares with the price of leather we are producing at home?  In the case of upper leather, the types we are buying from abroad will be sold at two and a half times the price of similar upper leather produced at home; that is, an increase of 250 per cent. on the home price.  In the case of sole leather, the difference in price is not so great but the price of that leather will be substantially above the price of sole leather produced at home. We are producing leathers at a price from 10 to 20 per cent. below the price of similar leathers produced by British tanners and sold in England.</P>

      <P>That was not always true.  These tanneries were not always in a position to compete efficiently with tanneries elsewhere and to produce as cheaply and efficiently.  They had to learn how.  They had to begin some time.  It is very easy to condemn a new industry which does not in its first year prove to be as efficient or as economical as old-established industries in other countries.  There is no logical or physical reason why we should not have industries in this country as efficient as industries in other countries, but we have got to begin to learn the necessary processes some time.  That is what we contemplate doing in this instance.  We believe it is possible to have certain electro-chemical industries established in this country.  It may not be possible forthwith to produce these materials in the variety in which we can buy them from abroad or perhaps even at the price at which we can get them abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that industries here should not be handicapped by having to pay for essential materials a substantially higher price than similar industries in other countries have to pay for such materials but I think that we should make an attempt to produce necessary materials for our industries.  I think it is essential to the industrial development of the country that we should succeed.  It may also be essential to the safety of the country that we should succeed.  We found ourselves faced with war conditions in this country for the past few years and one of the obligations which confronted us was that of providing for national defence.  One of the essential requirements for national defence was explosives.  There was no private firm engaged in the production of explosives in this country.  We were also faced with the problem of providing for the supply of such commodities as matches, which would be regarded in modern life as essential domestic commodities.  Through collaboration with the Scientific Research Bureau and the co-operation of the Department of Defence, a factory was set up to manufacture explosives for the Army <Col N="541" /> and also to enable the supply of matches for the public to be maintained. It was a Heath Robinson affair but it was established on sound scientific principles and worked.  It not only engaged in the manufacture of explosives for the Army but also supplied explosives for match-making.  The time arrived, however, when the Department of Defence said that they were no longer prepared to run that factory on the existing basis&mdash;having the factory run by soldiers under military conditions. It was completely uneconomic and anyhow its location was unsuitable. It was as Deputies are aware located in the vicinity of the Phoenix Park and was doing a lot of damage in the district because of the fumes given off.  One of the questions we had to examine then was the extent to which these manufacturing processes could be carried on in normal times. That is one of the matters in which this company will be asked to help.  When the Department of Defence asked to be released from the obligation of having to produce these materials, we went to the Industrial Alcohol Company and asked them could they undertake the manufacture of these materials.  The only reply we got, and the only reply they could have given us, was they would like to examine it but under the law as it stood they could not spend a penny even on the examination of the practicability of undertaking manufacture of that kind.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing in this Bill is merely to enable the company to undertake this examination.  We shall empower them by the device proposed in the Bill to undertake the manufacture, if we are satisfied that it is desirable they should undertake it.  If we find on inquiry that private enterprise is not engaged in the same business and does not propose to engage in the same business, if necessary we shall by legislation give the company additional capital.  It may not require additional capital for some processes that may interest it. As I mentioned, there is a limit of half a million under the Act to the amount which the Minister for Finance can invest in shares in the company.  That limit has not been reached.  There is still a substantial balance remaining <Col N="542" /> but if the company were to engage in any new form of manufacture or even wanted to establish a pilot plant as a preliminary to full scale working, then further capital would have to be made available for it.  If the amount required was to bring the demands on the Minister for Finance in excess of the half million limit provided in the principal Act, then the matter would have to come before the Dáil.  The only thing we ask the Dáil to approve of now is, first, the idea of having an efficient commercial organisation to carry on these investigations, an organisation that can be entrusted with the manufacture of these industrial chemicals which I have mentioned if it is shown to be a practicable and desirable course.  If having agreed that there should be such an organisation, is is not a sensible proposition to avail of the existing organisation, the Industrial Alcohol Company, to manufacture these materials?  I am sure Deputies will agree that that is a sensible course.</P>
    <P>There is one other small matter in the Bill.  The provisions of the principal Act appear to confine the Industrial Alcohol Company to the sale of alcohol to petrol distributors. I have mentioned that during the course of the war they produced certain by-products which were essential for various purposes.  One of those by-products was undenatured neutral spirit which is required in various industries and is essential to the operation of hospitals and laboratories.  They produced a spirit which served its purpose during the war but it was not good enough.  They are satisfied, however, that they can produce a very fine neutral spirit which will be readily accepted by hospitals, laboratories and industrial users and they are installing a plant for that purpose.  It is necessary to amend the legislation so as to permit the company without any qualms whatever to sell spirit to persons other than petrol distributors.  They can undertake these activities, either investigation activities or subsequently manufacturing activities, without raising the question of the future of the <Col N="543" /> industrial alcohol undertaking at all. I agree that the future of the undertaking will have to be considered at some stage, but we cannot afford, and do not want to do without the product of these distilleries now.  The time will come, however, when they will be a matter for decision, assuming a full supply of motor spirit from abroad and a situation in which that supply is not likely to be suddenly interrupted. We shall then have to decide whether it is desirable to keep the distilleries in operation on this particular task of producing industrial alcohol. Probably we will.  It certainly will be desirable to ensure that there is a staff of chemists and engineers familiar with the process and workmen capable of operating the distilleries, whose services will be available as soon as they must be brought back into full production again.  But it could be that the Government will decide, for one or other of the distilleries, that it would be better business to turn them into some other form of production.  That is a question for decision in the future. It is not one for decision now and I am not asking the Dáil to decide it now.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that it is not the purpose of the Bill. The matter was never considered in relation to the Bill.  At present we are still working upon a petrol ration.  We want all the motor spirit we can get, either imported or produced, and there is certainly no assurance yet that we can anticipate uninterrupted supplies on an adequate scale for some time to come.  When that time does arrive, there will also have to be considered the other reason which the Government had in mind in forming this company at all.  It may be that that reason also will not be operative at that time, in which case a decision on the future utilisation of these distilleries can be more easily taken; but if the other reason also operates, there may be good reason why the production of industrial alcohol from potatoes should be continued, either on the basis of the full utilisation of the capacity of the five distilleries, or, as was done from time to time in the past, by opening two or three in each season.  I have no doubt whatever that it makes for economy and efficiency to use the Industrial Alcohol Company under the new name we are proposing to give it for the purpose the Government had in mind in framing the measure.</P>

Lasmuigh de na contaethe sin, bhí 65 ceard-Scoileanna&mdash;22 sna Contae-bhuirgí agus sna Baile-Cheanntair, agus 43 faoi Scéimeanna bhí dhá stiúradh ag Coistí Contae.  Bhí tuairim is leath na Scol san i dtithe bhí oiriúnach, agus ní raibh ag an gcuid eile ach tithe a bhíodh, roimhe sin, ina n-ospaidéil, nó ina bpríosúin, nó ina séipéil, nó ina dtithe comhnaithe, agus dá réir sin.  I ranganna tráthnóna a níthí an phríomh-obair, agus bhíodh freastal na rang sin ag brath ar mhian pearsanta na n-oibrí óg, óir ní raibh sé éigeantach.</P>
      <P>I dTuarascáil 1927, tá achmaireacht déanta ar na saghasanna de thréineáil teicniciúil a bhí curtha ar fáil d'aos óg na tíre san am sin, agus is í seo an achmaireacht:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Teagasc lán-aimsire roimh fhostú;</P>
      <P>(b)  Ranganna tráthnóna i gceardscoileanna;</P>
      <P>(c)  Ranganna i gceanntair tuaithe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an roinn tionnscalach de shaghas (a), bíonn an cúrsa críochnaithe, gach bliain, ag tuairim is 200 de na 500 dalta bhíos ag freastal ar na deich scoileanna oiliúna, agus bíonn sé críochnaithe ag 50 buachaill agus ag 50 cailín ó scoil na bpríntíseach agus ó ranganna na bpríntíseach i mBaile <Col N="547" /> Átha Cliath.  Maidir leis an roinn tráchtálach de saghas (a), bíonn an cúrsa críochnaithe, gach bliain, ag tuairim is 1,200 de na 2,000 a bhíos ag freastal ar 40 láithreán.  Einne a bhfuil suim aige i gCeard-Oideachas, ní féidir leis a bheith sásta leis na figiúracha sin a bhaineas leis an roinn tionnscalach Idir Scoileanna Gairm-Oideachais agus Scoileanna atá leathghairm-oideasach, ní ullmhaítear go bhliantúil ach ó 250 go 300 den aos óg le haghaidh a bhfostaithe i dtionnscail &mdash;uimhir atá fíor-bheag do thír ina bhfuil 3,000,000 de dhaoine.</P>
    <P>Maidir le saghas (b), tá tuairim is 22,000 ag freastal ar ranganna tráthnóna. Cúrsaí cheithre mblian a leagtar amach dóibh sin, ach bíonn mórán dalta gan teacht arais an dara bliain, agus ní fhanann ach fíor-bheagán i bhfreastal go dtí an tríú bliain nó an ceathrú bliain.  Mórán den teagasc a níthear, ní tagasc teicniciúil é.  Sna cúrsaí tionnscnaimh go háirithe, bíonn bun-oideachas ag teastáil, agus laghdaíonn an riachtanas sin éifeacht na hoibre tríd is tríd.  Níl an dlúth-bhaint chóir idir na ceardscoileanna agus an tionnscal agus níl siad ag coimhlíonadh a bpríomhchuspóra, eadhon, tréineáil speisialta a thabhairt dóibh siúd atá fostaithe cheana.</P>
    <P>Maidir le saghas (c), bíonn 10,000 dalta ag freastal ranganna i gceanntair tuaithe, ach tá mórán de na ranganna sin nach maireann a gcúrsaí ach sé nó ocht de sheachtainí&mdash;rud is ionann agus 60 nó 80 d'uaireanna teagaisc.  Is mór an locht ar na cúrsaí sin iad a bheith ró-ghairid agus ró-chumhang agus gan aon bhaint a bheith ag cuid acu le prímh-thionnscal na tíre, an talmhaíocht.  Tríd is tríd, iséard a meastar go bhfuil sochar áirithe do lucht na bhfeirm sin teagasc a tugtar faoi scéimeanna tuaithe; ach, dá ainneoin sin, nár tugadh aghaidh mar ba cheart, fós, ar cheist an oideachais leanúnaigh agus an cheard-oideachais.</P>
    <P>Is é sin an chaoi ina raibh an scéal sul ar ritheadh an tAcht Gairm-Oideachais 1930.  Is an tAcht sin an chéad iarracht a rinneadh córas ghairm-oideachais a sholáthar don tír seo d'oirfeadh dá riachtanais speisialta féin, do réir mar moladh <Col N="548" /> i dtuarascáil aon-ghuthach an Choimisiúin um Cheard-Oideachais, i mbliain a 1927.  Na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais a ndearnadh soláthar lena n-aghaidh san Acht, tháinig siad i bhfeidhm sa bhfómhar, 1930, ach d'fhan an córas oideachais gan athrú go dtí Seisiún 1931-32.  Mar sin de, is le cúig cinn déag de sheisiúin iomlána atá an córas ba chuspóir don Acht i bhfeidhm.  Ar feadh na naoi seisiún tosaigh&mdash;go dtí deireadh Lúnasa, 1940&mdash; chuaigh an obair chun cinn gan aon chur-isteach neamhghnáthach.  Ach, maidir leis na trí seisiúin tosaigh, féadfaí a rá gur beag nár sheisiúin trialacha iad, agus nach raibh i bhfeidhm lena linn ach cúrsaí áirithe a bhí curtha ar bun dá dtriail ag na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais, faoi stiúradh agus faoí threoir na Roinne.  Ar feadh na dtrí seisiún ina ndiaidh sin, (1934-37) rinneadh comhdhlúthú i gcoitinne ar fhurmhór na scéimeanna ar éirigh leo, agus leanadh de na trialacha, sna ceanntair tuaithe go mór-mhór.  Sna trí seisiúin deiridh (1937-40) bhí farás buan i ngach ceantar, ach bhí aire faoi leith dhá tabhairt do ghairm-oideachas sna ceantair tuaithe.  Sé seisiúin na hÉigeandála (1940-46) tháinig siad-san ansin, agus bé príomhiarracht na tréimhse sin an obair a choinneáil ar cois chomh hiomlán agus bhí sí roimhe sin.  An riachtanas a bhí le spáráil airgid agus na deacrachta eile a bhain leis an Eigeandáil, ní hé amháin gur choisc siad forás na scéimeanna, ach chuir said isteach, a bheag nó a mhór, ar obair gach scoile agus gach ranga dá raibh ann, agus ní mór cuimhniú go maith ar an taobh san den scéal nuair a beifear ag meas an dul-chun-cinn atá déanta ó ritheadh an tAcht Gairm-Oideachais, 1930.</P>
    <P>Foirgintí Scol: tháinig athrú mór de bharr an Achta Gairm-Oideachais 1930, ach níl aon ghné den athrú san chomh so-fhaicseanach leis na scoiltithe oiriúnacha dea-riartha a cuireadh ar fáil in ionaid chomhgaracha ar fud na tíre.  Má cuirtear na ceithre ContaeBhuirgí agus Buirg Dhún Laoghaire san áireamh, tá 187 scoil den tsaghas sin ann fá láthair, agus is foirgintí nua ar fad 115 díobh sin agus 13 díobh is obair nua go leor den fhoirgint iontu.</P>
    <P>Céad agus sé cinn de na foirgintí <Col N="549" /> lán-nua sin agus sé cinn de na foirgintí a fairsingíodh, is i gceanntair na gCoiste Contae ata siad.  Tá sé de deagh-thoradh ar sholáthar na bhfoirginti sin go bhfuil fáil anois ag roinnt mhóor de na daoine ar oideachas leanúnach a chuirfeas in oiriúint iad do gach riachtanas dá mbaineann leis an gceanntar ina bhfuil comhnaí orthu. Faoi na forála airgeadais atá sa inBille seo, táthar ag brath fuairim is 100 eile scol-fhoirgint a dhéanamh, agus nuair a bheas said sin curtha ar fáil, is beag nach mbeidh gairm-oideachas i bhfoigseacht chúig míle do gach duine dá bhfuil sa tír.</P>
    <P>Sa tréimhse 1930-45, caitheadh £1,084,554 ar dhéanamh nó ar fhairsingiú scoileanna gairm-oideachais, £406,425 den iomlán san cuireadh ar fáil é trí dheontais speisialta a dheoin údaráis áitiúla na rátaí faoi alt 51 den Acht.  Fuarthas £495,294 trí iasachtaí a sholáthair na Coistí féin, agus tháinig an £182,880 d'fhuíolach as cisti bhí faoi réir na gCoistí.  Tuairim is leath an imláin sin, húsáideadh é leis na scoileanna móra sna Condae-Bhurgaí agus sna baile-cheantair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Deirg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is é an socrú atá ann ná go n-íocann an Stát a leath de na costais a bhíonn ar na Coistí ar ball le haghaidh uis agus ciste. Coláiste Tís Mhuire, i Sráid Chathail Brugha i mBaile Atha Cliath, chosnaigh sé tuairim is £110,000 Scoil Tráchtála agus Tís Chorcaighe, chosnaigh sí tuairim is £70,000; scoil speisialta do chailíní i Luimneach, chosnaigh sí tuairim is £20,000, agus bhí tuairim is £50,000 de chostas ag baint leis an socil atáthar tar éis a thógaint i gCabrach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mórán de na scoileanna eile, áfach, níl iontu ach foirgintí trí nó cheither seomra agus, idir na tithe féin agus a dtreallamh, níor chosnaigh siad ach ó £2,500 go £5,000 an scoil.  Meánchostas an 112 foirgintí nua a rinneadh lasmuigh de na buirgí agus de na baile-cheantair, is lú é na £5,000 an fhoirgint agus, má féachtar ar an gcaoi ina bhfuil costais faoi láthair, ní deacair a fheiscint gur chríonna an bheart do na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais dul ar aghaidh chomh tapaidh agus <Col N="550" /> b'féidir lena scéimeanna foirgníochta nuair a dhí saoghal fábharach ann.</P>
    <P>Cúrsaí Lae: I dtosach na hoibre, moladh do phríomh-Oifigigh feadhmannais triaileacha a bhaint as saghsanna éagsúla cútsaí lám-aimsire nó paírt-aimsire agus, de thoradh na dtriail sin, ceapadh cúrasí a chruthaigh go maith.  Ó 25 go 28 d'uaireanna gach seachtain a bhí sna cursaí sin, agus chaitá ó thrain an ama san go dtí na leath le hobair phraiticiúil.  Nuair a tháinig Seiseon 1935-36, bhí na saghsanna seo leanas cúrsaí lea dhá noibriú go coitianta:&mdash;(a) Cúrsa Coireann Oiliúnach (Buachaillí agus Cailíní); (b) Ceard-Chúrsa Sóisearach (Buachaillí); (c) Cúrsa Sóisearach i DTíos (Cailíní), (d) Cúrsa Sóisearach i dTráchtáil (Buachaillí agus Cailinf); (e) Cúrsa Sóisearach Tuaithe (Buachaillf).  Na ceithre cúrsaí tosaigh, nó cuid díobh, bhí siad i bhfeidhm sna ContaceBhuirgí agus sna Baile-Cheantair mhóra.  Sna ceantair tuaithe, ní raibh bunaithe ach Cúrsaí Sósearacha i dTíos do Cailíní agus Cúrsaí Sósearacha Tuaithe do bhyachaillí.</P>
    <P>Furmhór na scol ina bhfuil na cúrsaí seo i bhfeidhm, is láithreáin áitiúla oideachais iad do pháistí a mbíonn an bhun-scoil fágtha aca agus iad ós cionn 14 bliana d'aois.  Ghníthear freastal maith ar scoileanna na mbailecheantar mór.  Tá obair fhónta oideasach á dhéanamh ag na scoileanna sin, agus cuireann said tréineáil luachmhar ar fáil don aos óg a bhíos ag súil le fostú ar ball.</P>
    <P>Táan nós ag fás sna ceantair seo go deé páistí cheithre mblian déag chun na gairm-Scoile sar a dtosnaíonn siad ag obair sa mbaile nó lasmuigh den bhaile, agus fágann sin go bhfuil cuid de na scoileanna chomh lán, cheana, agus is féidir doibh bheith.  Go páirteach, tá an nós sin ag fás toise na tuismitheoirí bheith ag tuiscint, do réir a chéile, cad is fiú an t-oideachas seo; ach, go mór-mhór, tá sé ag fás toisc go bhfuil méadú buan ag teacht ar an lion fostaitheoir a bhíos ag iarraidh oibrithe d'fháil ó na scoileanna gairm-oideachais. Is fíor, áfach, gur deacair freastal iomlán d'fháil i gcuid de na scoileanna tuaithe.  Caitear cuid de na páistí a ligean á bhfostú toisc a dtuarastal a bheith ag teastáil go géar ó na <Col N="551" /> teaghlaigh ar díobh iad; agus caitear cuid cile a chur ag obair sa mbaile, í séasúir áirithe, toise ná bíonn cúnamh eile le fáil in obair na bhfeirm.  Ach. dá ainneoin sin, is deimhin go mbeadh an freastal i bhfad ní ba bhuaine, dá dtuigeadh na daoine a riachtanaí atá sé a thuilleadh oideachais a thabhairt don aos óg sar a gcuirtear ag saothrú a mbeatha iad sa mbaile, nó as an mbaile.  Is áthas liom, áfach, bheith i ndon a rádh go bhfuil feabhas ag teacht ar an scéal le dó nó trí de bhlianta.</P>
    <P>Aithníodh, do réir a chéile, ar an obair gurbh iad na Cúrsaí leanúnacha lán-aimsire a b'fhearr toradh, agus, i Meitheamh 1942, chuir an Roinn amach Meamram V 40, ina bhfuil cur-síos ar na cuspóirí agus ar na modhanna oibre is cóil a bheith ag Oideachas leanúnach.</P>
    <P>Scoileanna Tuaithe: Sna buirg agus ina lán de na baile-cheantair mhóra, bhí scoileanna tar éis bheith ag obair ar feadh roinnt blian, agus bhí cúrsaí lae acu a bhí cosúil leis na cúrsaí lae atá ann faoi láthair, ach go raidh siad ar scála i bhfad ní ba lú.  Chuir Acht 1930 i gcumas na scol sin cuid mhaith fairsingithe agus feabhsuithe a dhéanamh ar na háiseanna a bhí acu cheana, agus thárla, dá bharr sin, gurbh iad na baile-cheantair ba thré a bhí ag éileamh cúnta ar na Coistí Contae sna chéad blianta a bhí an t-Acht i bhfeidhm.  San am céanna sin, ní dearnadh ach fíor-bheagán chun áiseanna Gairm-Oideachais a chur ar fáil sna ceantair tuaithe.  Tar é is bliain a 1935 is ea tonsnaíodh i gceart ar thithe scoile a dhéanamh agus ar chúrsaí leanúnacha lán-aimsire d'eagrú sna ceantair sin.  Ar dtúis, níor cuireadh mórán dalta chun na scol seo, óir ní ró-thapaidh a tháinig léargas chun muintir na tuaithe ar an sochar a d'fhéadfadh a gclann a bhaint as na cúrsaí nua.  Do réir a chéile, áfach, bhítheas ag aithneachtáil an tsochair sin ar dheagh-obair na scol, agus d'fhéadfaí a rá, i Seisiún a 1939-40, go raibh an ghairm-Scoil Tuaithe tar éis ionad buan di féin a bhaint amach i gcóras Ghairm-Oideachas na tíre.  Tá 98 scoileanna den tsaghas sin ann faoi láthair, agus tá garradhanta lena n-ais <Col N="552" /> ag 90 díobh sin.  Caitear níos mó na leath an scol-ama le habhair a bhfuil dlúth-bhaint aca le hobair ar an talamh agus i dtithe na tuaithe.</P>
    <P>I dteannta na n-abhar coitianta, tugtar teagase do na buachaillí ar Eolaíocht Tuaithe, ar Obair Adhmaid, ar Líníocht agus ar Mhatamaitic Cheardúil, agus tugtar teagase do na cailíní ar Chócaireacht, ar Obair Shnáthaide, ar Níochán, ar Bhainisteoireacht Tí agus ar Eolaíocht Tís.  Sa gcúrsa ar Eolaíocht Tuaithe, féachtar do gach ceann de na prionsabail is mó tábhacht sa bhFeirmeoireacht; sa gcúrsa ar Eolaíocht Tís tugtar aire do gach bun-eolas a theastódh ó chailín chun an tuiscint cheart a bheith aici ar obair mná ina teach féin.</P>
    <P>Ó leath-acra go dtí dhá acra an t-achar atá sna scol-gharradhanta, agus baineann na trí cuspóirí seo leo:&mdash; (1) Chun triaileacha a bhaint as ithreacha, as leasa, as síolta, as plandaí, as spréidheáil agus as modhanna éagsúla oibre; (2) Chun glasraí agus tortha a chur ar fáil do na cailíní i gcistin na scoile; (3) Chun an garrdha féin a bheith do réir modha agus eagair a spreagfas na daltaí chun an deagh-eagar agus an deagh-chuma a choinneáil ar a n-áiteanna féin sa bhaile.</P>
    <P>Ní hionann agus brainsí eile oideachais, is riachtanach a thuiscint, sa chas seo, nach í an scoil atá ina haonad ach an ceantar máguairt ar feadh sé nó seacht de mhílte, agus is riachtanach a thuiscint gur le haghaidh na ndaoine go léir atá an scoil ann agus nach amháin le haghaidh an aosa óig a bhíos tar éis an bhun-scoil a fhágaint.</P>
    <P>Go coitianta, bíonn ceithre múinteoirí lán-aimsire ann-múinteoir in Obair Láimhe, múinteoir i dTíos, múinteóir a theagascas Gaeilge maraon le habhair eile, agus múinteóir a bhfuil céim aige in Eolaiocht Talmhaíochta agus a bhíos, de ghnáthe, i gceannas na scoile.  Bonní an ceathrar páirteach in obair na lá-Scoile agus, ina theannta sin, bíonn ranganna tráthnóna acu sa scoil féin agus i láithreáin eile so scoil-cheantar.  Sa chaoi sin, tugtar riar d'ocht láithreáin faoi seach, agus tugtar Gairm-Oideachas <Col N="553" /> i geóngar daoine fásta atá ina geomhnaí ró-fhada ón lár-scoil chun dul chun na ranganna a bhíos ansin.</P>
    <P>Chun treoir thabhairt do mhúinteoirí Eolaíocht Tuaihe, ehuir an Roinn meamram amach i mbliain a 1944.  Cuireadh sa Mheamram sin an t-eolas a bhí fachta cheana de thoradh na hoibre agus, ina theannta sin, bhi treoracha agus cláir oibre ann maidir le cúrsaí na céá bliana agus na darabliana, agus maidir leis an gcaoi cheart chun scol-gharrdha a leagan amach.</P>
    <P>Na ranganna tráthnóna in Eolaíocht Talmhaíochta a cuireadh ar bun sna blianta seo caite, tá sé cruthaithe acu gur mhaith a b'fhiú iad a thionnscnamh sna Gairm-Scioleanna Tuaithe. Tagann feirmeoirí agus a gcuid oibrithe chun na gcomhthionól seo, agus ghníthear cainnt agus díospóireachta ar phríomh-phronsabail na heolaíochta a bhaineas le feirmeoireacht.  Saghas fhónta oideachais do dhaoine fásta é seo, agus féadfaí a úsáid ar shlite a raghadh chun sochair do gach dream de mhuintir na tuaithe.</P>
    <P>Ceard-Oideachas: I gcóras an Cheard-Oideachais, freisin, rinneadh áthraithe chomh fónta leis na nithe atá luaite agam.  Tar éis 1930, thosnaigh na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais ar shaothar na scol a thabhairt ní ba dhlúithe in oiriúint do riachtanais tionscail a gceantar, agus thosnaíodar ag fairsingiú an teagaisc a tugtar do lucht ceirde agus do lucht oibre speisialta i monarchain.  Chuir na Ceard-Scoileanna chun ranganna speisialta a chur ar fáil a thabharfadh tréineáil d'oibrithe a bhí fostaithe, nó a bhféadfaí a bhfostú, san iomad tionscal nua a bunaíodh sa tír seo le blianta gairide anuas.  Tháinig a leithéidí sin de ranganna le chéile sna gairm-Scoileanna nó sna monarchain féin.  Imeasc na gceard agus na dtionscal a bhfuil na ranganna ag dul chun sochair dóibh tá Déantóireacht aliminium, Déantóireacht Bróg, Déantóireacht Chnaipí, Criadóireacht, Obair Bhiatais, Súdaireacht, Déantoireacht Miotal-Shreang, agus Tionscail na hOlla.  De bharr na rang sin, tháinig feabhas ar lámh-thoradh na n-oibrí a bhí oilte cheana féin agus, ina theannta sin, is ioma monarcha a bhí i ndon tosnú go luath ar tháirgeadh <Col N="554" /> toisc a cuid oibrí a bheith tréineáilte roimh ré ag na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Maraon leis na scéimeanna sealadacha sco, cuireadh ar bun scéimeanna eile chun tréineáil bhliantúil a thabhairt d'oibrithe nó do phrintísigh. Formhór na scéim seo, tá said i bhfeidhm sna scoileanna Gairm-Oideachais atá faoi stiúradh ag Coiste Gairm-Oideachais Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, agus baineann siad lena leithéidí seo de Chearda-Déantóireacht Bróg, Saoirseacht Brící, Obair Adhmaid agus Siúinéireacht, Cócaireacht Tithe Ósta, Oibriú gléas Cinema, Trealmhaireacht Leictreach, Péinteáil agus Maisiú, Dóireacht, Obair Luaidhe Clódóireacht, Táilliúireacht agus Déantóireacht Uaireadóir.  Sceimeanna an-shuimiúla uad an scéim chun tréineáil a thabhairt do phrintísigh i Monarchain Bhiatais, an scéim le haghaidh phrintísigh don Bhord Soláthair Leictreachais agus an scéim a ceapadh le gairid do phrintísigh Chumann na MótarThrádóirí Éireannach.  Is den ghrúpa seo, freisin, Meiceánaicithe an AerFhórsa, agus toghtar triocha díobh sin, gach bliain, as na buachaillí a chríochnaigh dhá bhliain de Cheard-Chúrsa Sóisearach sna Scoileanna Gairm-Oideachais. Maidir le printísigh Chóras Iompair Éireann, tá scéim leathan tréineála dhá tabhairt chun foirfeachta ag Roinn na bhFoireann den Chóras agus ag na húdaráis scol i gcomhar le chéile.  Nuair a bheas an scéim seo á hoibriú ina hiomláine, béidh suas le 500 printíseach faoi n-a réir i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath féin.  Táthar tar éis buan-scéimeanna a leagan amach chun tréineáil a thabhairt do phrintísigh le Déantóireacht Troscáin, le Gruaig-Dheisiú, agus le Péinteáil agus Maisiú, i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, agus tána scéimeanna seo faio rialacháin na gCoiste a bunaíodh faoi Acht Printíseachta 1931.</P>
    <P>Sna Condae-Bhuirgí agus i gcuid de na baile-cheantair mhóra, ceapadh scéimeanna faoi leith do dhaoine ar mhian leo teastais a fháil ó na hInstitiúidí Foirgníochta, nó Innealtóireachta, nó Runaíochta, nó Fógraíochta, no Cuntasaíochta.</P>
    <P>Do réir mar chuaidh an cheardtréineáil i bhfeabhas, d'éirigh sé <Col N="555" /> riachtanach caighdeáin áirithe cháilíochta a cheapadh mar mhaithe leis na fostaitheoirí agus leis na hoibrithe in éineacht; agus, ar an abhar sin, chuir an Roinn ar bun córas nua scrúdúchán i gcóir teastas, i mbliain a 1936.  Tá na teastais seo roinnte ina ndá shaghas&mdash;teastais cheardaíochta agus teastais tráchtála&mdash;agus tá a n-iarrthóirí ag dul go buan i líonmhireacht ó rinneadh an córas nua scrúdúchán a thionnscnamh.</P>
    <P>Cuid V. Maidir le cúrsaí.éigeantacha páirt-aimsire den tsaghas a bhfuil trácht orthu i gCuid V d'Acht Gairm-Oideachais 1930, táthar á dtriail i gCathair Choreaighe ó bhliain a 1938, agus i gCathair Luimnigh ó bhliain a 1942.  Sa dá chathair sin tá freastal ar chúrsaí leanúnacha d'iachall ar bhuachaillí agus ar chailíní atá idir 14 agus 16 bliana d'aois agus gan iad ag freastal ar aon lá-scoil aitheanta.  Tá 180 scoiluair i ngach seiseon de na cúrsaí seo, agus teagasctar iontu na habhair is gnáthach bheith i gcúrsaí leanúnacha, maraón le hobair láimhe do bhuachailli-agus tíos do chailíní.  Tá 36 seachtainí sa tseiseon, agus bíonn na daltaí i láthair ar feadh chúig n-uair, láamháin i ngach seachtain.  I gCathair amháin i ngach seachtain.  I gCathair Chorcaighe, tá 900 dalta ag freastal ná gcúrsa seo, gach bliain ó 1938, agus chuaidh lion na ndalta thar 600 i gCathair Luimnigh.</P>
    <P>Ní hí seo an chéad uair dhom cuntas a thabhairt don Dáil i dtaobh na dtriail sin.  Ní gá dhom éinní a rá, an uair seo, ach go bhfuil sé cruthaithe gur mhaith a b'fhiú na trialeacha a dhéanamh, agus go bhfuarthas tríothu eolas a bheas an-úsáideach nuair a beifear ag socrú ceist árduithe na scolaoise. Táthar ar intinn na cúrsaí seo a chur i bhfeidhm i mBaile-cheantair eile, agus tuigim go mbeidh Coiste Gairm-Oideachais Phortláirge ullamh chun a leithéid a chur i bhfeidhm sa chathair sin i Mí Eanair seo chugainn. Ba é an Stát a d'íocadh lán-chostas na gcúrsa seo ar dtúis, ach tá siad anois ina bpáirt aitheanta de scéimeanna Gairm-Oideachais na gceantar ina bhfuilid i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Comhairle le Leas Óige: I gCathair Bhaile Á Cliath, chuathas i mbun <Col N="556" /> triaileach cile ná fuil neamh-chosúil ar fad lc scéimeanna úd Chorcaighe agus Luimnigh.  Ach ní bhaincann aon fhreastal éigeantach leis an scéim seo. I mbliain a 1942, chuir an Coiste Gairm-Oideachais fo-choiste ar oun chun láithreáin tréineála a eagrú do dhaoine óga a bhí gan fostú, agus is ar m'achaine-se a rinne siad sin.  Séard is cuspóir do na láithreáin seo, áiseaona oideachais agus caitheamh-aimsire a chur ar fáil, féachaint an laghdódh siad sin droch-iarsmaí an díomhaointis agus an dístiúrtha imease ógánaigh na cathrach.  Tuarim is 500 buachaill atá idir 14 agus 16 bliana d'aois, tagann siad chun an dá láithreán.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta sin, tá comh-cheangal leis an gComhairle déanta ag 31 cumann buachaillí agus ag seacht gcumann cailíní, agus féadfaí a rá gur tré na cumainn sin a ghníthear an mhórchuid d'obair na comhairle.  Mar sin de, baineann obair na Comhairle le breis agus 2,500 buachaill agus le breis agus 600 cailín.</P>
    <P>Tréineáil Múinteoir Ó thainig an méadú mór ar aiseanna Gairm-Oideachais de thoradh Achta 1930, ba riachtanach fóirne líonmhara muinteoirí a thréineáil, agus b'é ba mhian leis an Roinn go mbeadh na múinteoirí sin chomh dea-cháilithe agus b'fhéidir. Fuarthas roinnt áirithe ó na hOllscoileanna, ach b'í an roinn féin a thréineáil a bhfórmhór mór, agus rinneadh sin tri ghearr-chúrsaí dian-thréineála nó tri chúrsaí eile a mhair dó nó tri de bhlianta.</P>
    <P>Sa tréimhse 1930-45, cuireadh 500 le líon na múinteoirí lán-aimsire&mdash;tuairim is 250 do Thíos, tuairim is 100 d'obair adhmaid, tuairim is 100 d'Eolaíocht Tuaithe agus tuairim is 50 d'Obair Mhiotail.  Ba riachtanach líon na múinteoirí Tí a bheith mór, toisc go geaitheann ban-mhúinteoirí éirí as an obair nuair a phósas siad.  I Seiseon 1932-33, bhí 649 de na múinteoirí lanaimsire fostaithe, agus chuir siad isteach 445, 113 d'uaireanna teagaise. I Seisiún 1944-45, bhi 988 múinteoirí lán-aimsire ann, agus chuir siad sin isteach 728,497 d'uaireanna teagaisc. Ina theannta sin, bhí 766 múinteoirí páirt-aimsire ag obair agus chuir siad isteach 226,360 d'naireanna teagaisc. Gach bliain, bíonn ath-chursaí áirithe <Col N="557" /> ann faoi stiúradh na Roinne, chun go mebeidh caoi ag na múinteoirí bheith ar chomh-chéim le dul-chun-cinn na n-abhar a bhíos á dteagase acu.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an nGaeilge ní gá dom a rá ach gur tosnaíodh go luath ar chúrsaí samhraidh i nGaeilge d'eagrú do ghairm-mhúinteoirí ague, i mbliain a 1932, tionnscnadh an scrúdúchán le haghaidh an Cheard-Teastais Ghaeilge. Faoi na scémeanna Gairm-Oideachais, b'é sin an cháilíocht a caitheadh a bheith ag múinteoirí in abhair eile lasmuigh den Ghaeilge, agus is riachtanach anois é a bheith ag na gairmmhúinteoirí lán-aimsire fó léir, beagnach.</P>
    <P>Maidir le teagasc na Gaeilge féin, níor mheas an Roinn go raibh dul-chun-cinn sáthach maithe á dhéanamh faoi na scéimeanna gairm-oideachais, agus tionnscnadh cúrsaí speisialta chun múinteoirí a thréineáil sna modhanna teagaisc is fearr, agus chun a dtréineáil i saghsanna eile oibre a measadh a bheith riachananch chun labhairt na teangan a chur ar aghaidh mar be cheart.  Ar fud na tíre faoi láthair, tá na múinteorí seo ag cur sprid nua sna ranganna Gaeílge.  Gach bliain, tugtat socláireachta do 600 dalta, nó mar sin, chun a chur ar a gcumas freastal, ar feadh míosa, ar chúrsaí speisialta sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Airgeadas an Gairm-Oideachais.  Is é is priomh-chuspóir don Bhille seo ná oiread breis-chistí a sholáthar do choistí gairm-oideachais agus chuirfeas ár a gcumas comhlíonadh a dhéanamh ar na feidhmeanna atá leagtha amach do gach Coiste in Acht 1930, viz.:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) córas oiriúnach d'oideachas leanúnach a bhunú a bhuanú do réir an Achta ina gceantar féin, agus soláthar a dhréanamh chun a leithéid sin de chóras a thabhairt i bhforás, diaidh ar ndiaídh;</P>
    <P>(b) soláthar, nó soláthar-i-gcabhair, a dhéanamh le haghaidh ceárdoideachas ina gceantar féin do réir an Achta.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mar sin de, ba mhaith liom anois gearr-achoimre a thabhairt don Dáil ar na forála airgeadais áta in Acht 1930.  Do réir an Achta sin, d'fhéadfadh Coistí Gairm-Oideachais suas go dtí 6p. sa £1 de shíntiúis a fháil as na <Col N="558" /> rátaí áitiúla sna ceithre contae-bhuirgí agus sna seacht mBaile-Cheantair atá sceidealta san Acht, agus d'fheadfaí suas go dtí 4p. sa £1 a fháil i geás na gCoiste Contae.  Bhí deontais ón Stát iníoctha, freisin, agus socraíodh ar ball gurbh é bheadh iontu sin ná (1) bun-deontas a rialófaí do réir an mhéid Stát-Chúnta a bhí á fháil ag an gCoiste roimh 1930, agus (2) breis-deontas a bhead do réir an méid ráta a fuarthas de bhreis ar minimum áirithe.  (3p. an minimum ba ghnáthach bheith sna cathracha agus sna mó r-bhailte, agus sna Contaethe).  £1 in aghaidh gach £1 de ráta áitiúil an breis-deontas sna Contaethe agus i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath; £4 in aghaidh an £1 atá sna baile-cheantair sceidealth, agus £2 in aghaidh an £1 i nDún Laoghaire. Níorbh fhéidir, áfach, an síntiús áitiúil a mheadú ach do réir 1/4p. gach bliain agus, ar an ábhar san, ní raibh an 4p. de shíntiús áitiúil le fáil ag na Coistí Contae go dtí an bhliain airgeadais dar tosach an 1ú Aibreán, 1940; agus ní raibh an 6p. de shíntiús áitiúil le fáil sna cathracha agus sna mór-bhailte go dtí an bhliain airgeadais dar tosach an 1ú Aibreán, 1942.</P>
    <P>Ach ní raibh sé d'fhiachaibh ar na Coistí na breis-rátaí sin a thógaint&mdash; agus ní bheidh anois.  Ina theannta sin, fhéadfaí gan an breis-ráta a cheadúin aon-chor, dá meastaí ná raibh sé riachtanach; agus bhí cumhacht a choiscithe ar an abhar sin ag an Aire Oideachais, agus an cumhacht cheanna ag fo-choistí áitiúla na meastachán&mdash;fo-choistí ar a mbíodh ionadaithe na n-údarás áitiúil.  Tuigfear ón méid sin go gcoinnítear stiúir dheimhin ar fhórás an ghairm-oideachas i ngach ceantar.  Go fírinneach, ní raibh na maxima sroiste ach I gceithre Chonndae agus i gceithre bhaile-cheanntar ar na dátaí atá luaite agam.</P>
    <P>I mbliain a 1930, measadh ná beadh na maxima sroiste agus ná béadh an scéim i bhfeidhm ina hiomláine go ceann 15 bliana nó go ceann fiche blian.  Mar sin de, rinneadh soláthar do 6p. de maximum do na Coistí go léir sa gcéad dréacht den Acht, ach ní shroisfeadh na Coistí Contae an maximum sin go dtí an bhliain dar tosach an lú Aibreá, 1947.  Nuair a <Col N="559" /> bhí an bille á bhreathnú i gCoiste, i 1930, ghlac an t-Aire Oideachais le leasú a laghdaigh maximum na gContae go dtí 4p. sa £1 agus a laghdaigh an tréimhse shroiste go dtí an lú Aibreán, 1940; ach ba mhian leis go ndéanfaí an cheist a athbhreithniú i ndeireadh na tréimhse sin, agus dúirt sé go raibh &ldquo;gan amhrais, roinnt nithe eile sa mBille a dteastódh leasú uathu i mbliain a 1940.&rdquo;  Dúirt tairgeoir an rúin:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Gidh go stadfaidh íocaíochta faoi'n Acht i 1940, níl fáth ar bith ná tabharfaí isteach Bille leasúcháin, an uair sin, chun an tsuim a mhéadú agus a bhúanú go dtí 1947.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is amhlaidh atáim ag trácht ar na nithe sin anois sa chaoi a mbeidh a fhios agaibh cad é an chuspóir a bhí ag údair an Achta agus cad a mheasadar ba chóir a dhéanamh nuair a gheobhfaí a thuilleadh eolais trí oibriú an Achta.  I mbliain a 1944, bhí Bille (Leasúcháin) Gairm-Oideachais againn, agus baineadh feidhm as chun 1p. sa £1 de bhreis-ráta a fháil do na Coistí a rabh an maximum sroiste acu agus ar theastaigh níos mó uathu mar gheall ar an méadú caiteachais a thárla ann de bharr na héigeandalá&mdash; go háirithe sa mheid a bhain leis an mBónas Costais Maireachtana agus leis an mBónas Eigeandála.</P>
    <P>Faoi láthair, tá na maxima sroiste ag 12 de na 27 Coistí Contae agus ag 5 den 11 Coiste Baile-Cheantair; agus, lasmuigh de Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, is beag ná fuil deireadh foráis curtha i gcrích ag na Baile-Cheantair, do réir an scála atá anois ann.  Ach tá a lán le déanamh sna Contaethe go léir beagnach, sar a bhféadfar a rá go bhfuil áiseanna gairm-oideachais curtha ar fáil do thromlach mhór na ndaoine. Mar adúirt mé cheana, tá tuairim is céad scol-fhoirgint nua le déanamh go fóill.  Ní bheidh ina bhformhór sin ach ó 2 go dtí 4 seomraí, agus bhéarfaidh siad gairm-oideachas isteach i gceantair ná raibh a leithéid iontu cheana féin, cé's moite de ghearr-chúrsaí anois agus arís.  Deacrachta aimsir an chogaidh, níor leig siad don ghairm-oideachas dul ar aghaidh i mBaile Átha Cliath sa chaoi ina mbeadh sé ar <Col N="560" /> chomh-chéim le mear-fhás na cathrach ó taobh achair agus ó thaobh daonra; agus caithfear, ar a laghad, cúig nó sé cinn nua de scoileanna réigiúnacha a dhéanamh in aghaidh an éilimh atá ar chúrsaí deontacha Gairm-Oideachais ar fud na cathrach.  Pé scéal é, tá dianaire á tabhairt do na riachtanais seo ag Coiste Gairm-Oideachais na Cathrach, agus táthar ag ullmhú chun na háiseanna atá ag teastáil a sholáthar comh luath agus bhéas fáil ar abhair foirgneamh agus ar threalamh scol.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom feidhm a bhaint as an ócáid seo freisin chun buíochas a thabhairt go poiblí do Choiste Gairm-Oideachais Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath.  D'ainneoin a mbíonn de ghnó lena gcuid foirgint agus a mbíonn d'obair ag a gcuid foireann, tugann siad áiseanna agus cúnamh luachmhar don Roinn i gcónaí, maidir le tréineáil múinteoirí le haghaidh an GhairmOideachais. Go dearfa, ba rí-deacair, ar feadh na gcúig mblian déag seo caite, uimhir sáthach mór múinteoirí a thréineáil don Ghairm-Oideachas, mura mbeadh na háiseanna speisialta a fuarthas ón gCoiste sin, maraon le húsáid a bhfoirgint breá scol agus le comhairle na n-eolgach atá ar a gcuid foireann.</P>
    <P>San ócáid chéanna seo, is ceart dom, freisin, moladh a thabhairt do na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais, do na Príomh-Oifigigh Feidhmiúcháin agus do na Múinteoirí Gairm-Oideachais ar a fheabhas a chuir siad cuspóirí Achta 1930 i gcrich.  Obair ghlan-deontach an obair a ghní na Coistí, agus ba deacrachta nua ar fad a lán de na fadhbanna a bhí le réiteach acu féin agus ag a bhfóirne agus, má cuimhnítear air sin, táim cinnte go n-aontófar go bhfuil buíochas an phobail í gcoitinne tuillte acu mar gheall ar an gcaoi ina ndearna siad a gcuid oibre agus a dtug siad an Gairm-Oideachas san éifeacht ina bhfuil sé anois.</P>
    <P>Maidir liom féin go pearsanta, táim cinnte gur beag an méid comhlucht poiblí atá níos dúthrachtaí ná na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais nó a thug seirbhís níos fearr don Náisiún, go háirithe i rith na hEigeandála.  Ina theannta sin, creidim go deimhin go bhfuil na Scéimeanna anois sa riocht ina bhféadfaid teacht chun bheith ina gcóras sáréifeachtach <Col N="561" /> Gairm-Oideachais; agus, nuair a bheas lán-fheidhm á bhaint astu ag an bpobal, is é mo mheas go mbeidh siad ina bpáirt an-tábhachtach de sheirbhís oideasach a bhéas comh maith, i ngach slí, leis na seirbhísí is cuspóir don reachtúchán atá déanta ag Rialtais eile.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoi na hAilt sa Bhille.  Mar adúirt mé faoi Alt a 2, tá socrú á dhéanamh againn ansin faoi chúrsaí airgid.  6d. sa phunt i gcás Contae Bhuirgí agus Baile-Ceanntair faoi sceideal agus 4d. sa phunt i gcás limistéirí Contae, sin í an íocaíocht bhliantúil a bhí iníocha ag na húdaráis áitiúla faoin Acht Oideachais Ghairme Beatha, 1930. Fritheadh amach sa bhlian 1944 gur theastaigh tuilleadh airgid ó Choistí chun na seirbhísí a bhí ar bun acu a choinneáil ar siúl agus chun socrú a dhéanamh i dtaobh a gcuid scéimeanna a leathnú.  Dá bhrí sin, faoin Acht a ritheadh sa bhliain 1944 do hárdaíodh an ráta sin thuas go dtí 7d. sa phunt sna Contae-Bhuirgí agus 5d. sa phunt sna Coistí Contae.  An bhreis airgid a fritheadh de thoradh na rátaí sin maraon leis an gcabhair airgid a thug an Stát uaidh, do hídíodh an chuid is mó dhe de bharr an mhéaduithe a tháinig ar an gcostas maireachtana agus ar an mBónas Éigeandála a híocadh le múinteoirí agus le hoifigigh eile de chuid na gCoistí.  Tá tuilleadh airgid ag teastáil anois chun bail a chur ar scéimeanna atá beartaithe cheana féin, ach nár mhór moill a chur orthu le linn tréimhse an chogaidh, agus chun socrú a dhéanamh i gcóir na scéimeanna a bhfuil tagairt déanta agam dóibh cheana féin.</P>
    <P>Meastar go mbeidh 2d. sa phunt sa bhreis ag teastáil, agus tá beartaithe gan ach 1/2d. sa phunt de mhéadú a leagan in aghaidh na bliana agus go dtosnófar sa bhliain 1947-1948.</P>
    <P>Tá beartaithe in Alt a 3 beárna a bhí i seirbhís inphinsin oide de chuid Choisde Chathair Luimnigh a dhúnadh. Idir 1919 agus 1923 a tharla an bheárna sin agus seo mar a tharla: le linn réim an tSasanaigh do shocraigh an Coiste a bhí ann san am&mdash;Coiste CeardOideachais Luimnigh&mdash;ná beadh aon bhaint acu feasta leis an <i>Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction</i><Col N="562" /> ach go bhfeidhmeoidis faoi Dháil Éireann.  Cuireadh an socrú sin i bhfeidhm agus leanadar orthu ag obair go ceann bliana nó mar sin agus níor tosnaíodh arís go dtí 1923.  Lean an t-oide atá i gceist ag obair faoin gCoiste le linn dóibh bheith ag feidhmiú faoin Dáil agus fostaíodh aris é nuair a thosnaigh an Coiste arís.</P>
    <P>An rud atá beartaithe in Alt a 4 is de dhruim an tsocraithe a rinne Coiste Luimnigh&mdash;feidhmiú faoi scáth na Dála sa bhliain 1919&mdash;a tharla se.  Dhiúltaigh an chuid is mó den fhoirinn leanúint i seirbhis an Choiste tar éis an athraithe seo agus do tugadh uas-phinsin nó uas-aisci dhoibh faoi Alt 8 den <i>Local Government Act</i>, 1919. Rinneadh socrú faoin Acht Cúiteamh Oifigeacha Áitiúla (Tréimhse Cogaidh), 1924, I gcóir na niocaíocht sin as Cisti an Stáit.  D'éirigh leis an gCoiste oidi eile a fháil le leanacht den obair faoi scáth na Dála agus ar na hOidí sin bhi Oide Adhmadóireachta a thug suas a cheart chun pinsin a fháil faoi Acht 1919 i ngeall ar gur éirigh sé as an bpost a bhí aige faoi choiste cheard-Oideachais eile (.i. Coiste Chontae Mhuigheo).  Nuair a cuireadh deireadh le feidhmiú an Choiste ní raibh post ar bith ag an oifigeach seo ar feadh scathaimh.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1921 fuair sé post faoi Choiste Cheard-Oideachais na Mídhe. An bhliain ina dhiaidh sin fuair sé post faoi Bhord na nOibreacha Poiblí agus rinneadh post seasta dhe sa bhliain 1925.  Tá sé ar tí dul ar phinsean anois agus ó thárla nach féidir an tseirbhís a thug sa faoi Údarás Áitiúil a chur san áireamh i gcóir pinsin sa Stát-Sheirbhís&mdash;seirbhís ná téann thar 20 blian&mdash; ceaptar go bhfuil sé tuillte aige go gcuirfí an méid pinsin a bheadh ag dul dó as a sheirbhís faoi Údaráis Áitiúla san áireamh freisin.  £68 an tsuim atá leagtha amach san alt agus tá sin bunaithe ar sheirbhis thrí mblian déag. Déanfaí leath na suime seo a íoc thar n-ais leis an íocóir as Chiste an Stáit agus d'íocfadh na húdaráis sin a raibh sé mar oide acu síntiúis freisin.</P>
    <P>Séard atá beartaithe in Alt a 5 réiteach a dhéanamh ar amhrais a tharla faoi fhorála Alt 6, 7 agus 8 den Acht Ghairm Oideachais (Leasú), 1944, maidir leis an mbaint atá ag na <Col N="563" /> forála sin le hOifigigh de chuid na Sean-Choistí Chéard-Oideachais a haistríodh chuig na Coisdí Gairm-Oideachais faoi Alt 99 d'Acht 1930.</P>
    <P>Baineann Alt a 6 le costais taistil agus táimid chun an scéim cheanna a oibriú.  Do rinne Alt 67 den Acht Rialtais Áitiúil, 1946, leasú ar an dlí a bhain le costais taistil a íoe le baill de Chomhairlí Contae.  In a theannta sin, tá socrú á dhéanamh go n-íocfar ráta seasta do réir an mhíle agus go bhféadfar liúntas a íoe le baill a chomhnaigh níos mó ná tri mhile ó áit an chruinnithe.  Sílim go bhfuil an tAlt sin ann cheana do bhaill na mbárdas áitiúla faoin Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil, agus nilimíd ach ag chur an gairm-oideachas ar an dul céanna ó thaobh costais taistil dhe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been at great pains to give us a historical review of the development of technical and vocational education in this country, both before and since the Principal Act of 1930 was passed.  While the historical review may in itself be very entertaining reading, I feel that it was given to us more for the purpose of hiding the implications of this Bill than of enabling us to tackle the problem of vocational education in the country.  I look upon vocational education as a system which will give us good Christian technicians whether they are to be managers, skilled artisans or workers, and whether their work is to be performed on the land or in industry. Nowhere in the Minister's statement is there any evidence that his Department is facing up to the realities of the situation here.  We are, industrially, one of the most backward countries in the world.  At the same time, we are engaged on a big industrial development programme, and all forms of industry are being encouraged here.  While that development is taking place, the Department which the Minister controls is lagging miles behind.  There is no effort so far as I can see to give us a system which will enable the agriculturist and the industrialist to command technical skill.  The position of our country at the moment is that we are exporting human beings, <Col N="564" /> and that at the same time our industries and our agriculture are striving to find skilled labourers, skilled managers and skilled men of all kinds.  We have certain native talent here but it is largely untrained.  A good many of our industrialists, for example, have not the tradition of industry behind them that you get in Great Britain or on the Continent, and we are not doing anything to fill the gap, the historical gap if you like, created by the peculiarities of our history.  We are not doing anything effectively to fill that gap.  We have had from the Minister a long report of the various developments that have taken place to supply skilled artisans to cater for various trades. When it is all boiled down, I would ask him to tell the House how many hundred of these we can call upon in the morning for industrial employment.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Minister's Department during past years has been to cut down trade scholarships.  So far as I am aware, they have been discontinued at a time when industry is seeking everywhere to get skilled men so that Irish industrialists are compelled to go abroad for skilled technicians and skilled management.  There are no trade scholarships to-day, or if there are I would like to hear of them.  These trade scholarships have been abandoned, and the money in respect of them has been turned over to scholarships for Irish, of which some 600 are given out every year.  I put it seriously to the Minister that it is not the purpose or the objective of the Department of Education to promote Irish in technical schools, or in vocational schools as they are called now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that the main bias of training in these schools should be entirely technical, entirely towards providing skilled labour and, as I have said, skilled people who will control labour. If we are to have satisfactory relations in this country between management and worker, it is as essential to train men to be competent to take charge in a factory and workshop as it is to turn out the skilled man who is to make goods under his supervision.  We are not getting that.  I would challenge the Minister to produce figures to show what is his policy in that direction.  In 1936 there were about two trade schools <Col N="565" /> catering for apprentices in France dealing with a handful of apprentices.  To-day, in France, despite what has happened in the intervening years, some 80,000 men and women are trained in trade schools.  I give that as one example of what might be done here in a short space of time.  I am not suggesting that the conditions are similar in any way but if in ten years France could have jumped from a few hundred apprentices in their trade schools to 80,000, surely we could have done something since 1930 to develop on the same lines?  I say we have not developed on these lines to anything like the extent we could have if we were serious about the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a very good reason why we have not so developed.  A great portion of the curriculum in the vocational schools is devoted to rectifying defects in the education of the pupils coming from the primary schools.  There is no co-ordination between the primary school system and the vocational school system or indeed between the primary school, the vocational school, the secondary school and the university.  There is certainly not the development here that has taken place in England, France and Germany, from the primary school to the technical school, from the technical school to the technological institute and then to the university.  If outside a couple of professions, such as agriculture, our educated young men and women, our university graduates want a highly technical training they have to go abroad for it.  That is our position, and I shall give facts and figures to prove that contention.</P>
    <P>I hold that up to now vocational education has been the Cinderella of the services under the Minister's control, that it has been starved by State policy of the money it needs. There is something between four and five million pounds devoted to primary schools and you have something like 13,000 school teachers in connection with these schools.  A sum of £550,000 odd is put up by the State for secondary education, for some 40,000 odd pupils.  Mark you, the <Col N="566" /> majority of these pupils come from parents who are in a position to pay for the education of their children. When I make an analogy between the amount given to secondary education and vocational education, I want it to be clearly borne in mind that there is no similarity in the social conditions of the pupils attending secondary schools and the pupils attending technical institutes.  You get the position where something over half a million pounds is devoted to 40,000 children in the secondary schools and of those 40,000 children, some 1,376 have got to the secondary school by means of scholarships from the primary schools.</P>
    <P>I want to know where is the means by which the poor man's child will get from the primary school to the type of technical education which I have in mind, the type of technical education which will give him a career either as a skilled worker, a skilled technician or as a manager.  You find this position in technical education.  A very slightly increased grant is set aside for vocational education.</P>
    <P>The amount all told is £577,374 and the number of pupils is 60,000 odd.  The number of teachers is somewhere about 900 whole-time and 700 part-time, whereas in the secondary schools there are 3,300 odd teachers.  The State itself puts up only some £300,000 odd by way of a grant.  I hold these figures show clearly that vocational education in this country is the Cinderella of the Department.  The Minister and his Department are merely tinkering with the fringes of this problem.  There is a definite demand from agriculture to get skilled labourers, skilled workers, skilled agriculturists.  There is definitely even a bigger demand for the skilled manager, the trained manager&mdash;and when I say trained manager, I mean not merely trained in the technique of his job but the man who has a proper Christian, social outlook that will enable him to be a good manager and to maintain decent relations with his workers.  That training is missing here. It is very badly needed, and industry is crying out for it.</P>
    <P>I said that there is a definite reason for the position which obtains here.  In <Col N="567" /> the first place you have the State starving vocational education.  In the second place, you have the State failing to turn out from the primary schools pupils who are sufficiently educated to derive any real benefit from the first year or two of vocational education.  What I am stating is proved by statistics of the Minister's own Department. You have first of all the position in the technical school where the vast majority of pupils coming from the primary school have to be put into the preparatory course.  There technical teachers have to do the job of the primary teacher&mdash;to improve the pupil sufficiently in his knowledge of arithmetic and even of English, not to speak of other subjects, to enable him to derive any benefit from the vocational system.</P>
    <P>Not only that, but the results of the examinations held by the Minister's Department of these preparatory group pupils are so bad that they do not publish them.  The majority of these pupils have failed.  The majority of pupils in rural science and kindred courses, so far as I can recollect, are failures.  If that is not an indictment of the Minister's Department and an indication of the complete failure of our system of education, I cannot conceive what it is.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister quite frankly that our whole system of education has to be revised.  There is grave need for such a revision, and certainly from the point of view of vocational education a system of co-ordination will have to be brought about whereby the pupil coming from the primary school will be certified qualified to benefit by vocational education.  It should not be the job of the vocational education system to do anything by way of primary instruction, but, as it is to-day, a period of from one to two years is devoted to primary instruction of pupils who have come to the vocational institute for the purpose of getting a training which will fit them for a career.</P>
    <P>I again say there must be co-ordination as between the secondary school and the vocational school, and it is up to the Minister to see that whatever friction <Col N="568" /> may exist between the secondary school and vocational authorities, particularly in rural areas, is removed and that poaching&mdash;I use the word advisedly&mdash;which the Minister knows full well goes on will stop and that the vocational school will get its fair chance to fulfil the functions for which it is intended.</P>
    <P>Again, there must be co-ordination between the vocational school and the university, and, if necessary, the Minister must consider setting up higher technological institutes for the training of men who will go into the higher walks of industrial life.  I cannot conceive how that job is to be done, unless the agriculturist, the industrialist, and, above all, the parents, as well as all other bodies and authorities interested in education, are brought together to hammer out a national scheme on a national basis.</P>
    <P>Time and again, we have advocated the setting up of a council of education to go into all these matters.  Whether the Minister ever intends to yield to that demand, I cannot say but I can assure the Minister that, outside this House, that demand is very persistent, and if the Minister chooses to search he will find outside the House many industrialists who will tell him frankly what I am telling him now&mdash;that the work of the primary school is so bad that they cannot retain these pupils in their service and that in some cases considerate employers give the option to the employee of attending the vocational school to make up for the deficiencies in his education and that, so far as vocational education is concerned, there is grave need for the development I advocate.</P>
    <P>Committees on vocational education throughout the country could do a great deal more than they are doing. Under the present system of constituting these committees, the local authority is given the majority of the representation.  It may or may not be a wise thing to do to preserve the control of the purse in the committee itself.  There is perhaps a very sound reason for it, but invariably you find that the balance of the committee is made up of a few clergymen and anybody else who can be induced to take <Col N="569" /> his place on the committee.  These committees do very laborious work and they have a big programme to carry through.  Their job is not a light one.  It is purely voluntary, and I can understand certain people being reluctant to go on such committees, but I do say that in those towns in which there are industries, some effort should be made to give these industries direct representation on the committees, so that co-ordination between industry and vocational training will be effected in practice.</P>
    <P>I have taken the trouble to look up the output of our universities for 1943-44 and I find that, in that year, 917 graduates were turned out by the National University.  Of these, 363 were Arts graduates, 177 Medicine, 80 Commerce, 127 Engineering, 35 Agriculture, and 17 Science&mdash;I may be wrong in that figure; it might be 130. From Trinity College, 429 graduates were turned out and of these 314 were Arts, 61 Medicine, 3 Commerce, 20 Engineering, with Agriculture nil and Science practically nil.</P>
    <P>That is the position we get in our universities&mdash;that we are training men here for export.  Many of our engineers are going abroad; many of our doctors are going abroad; and many of our teachers are going abroad; but we are not training any technicians here&mdash;nothing worth while.  I want the Minister to consider this problem in the light of the industrial development we are visualising here, in the light of the agricultural development which is so badly needed here.  Let us be frank as regards our agriculture&mdash;it is not scientifically developed as it might be and there is as grave a need for the trained man in agriculture as there is for the trained man in industry.</P>
    <P>The finances of this measure give me some cause for concern.  Already it has been the Minister's policy to cut the grants.  The State grants have been cut since 1940 or 1941, and in one case of which I have personal knowledge&mdash;the Dun Laoghaire Borough Vocational Education Committee&mdash;the cut amounted to £1,500.  Here we have a proposal which will increase the amount of rates to be raised for vocational education in the county boroughs, the Borough of <Col N="570" /> Dun Laoghaire and in the country.  In the county boroughs and in Dun Laoghaire, the rate will jump from 7d. to 9d. in the £ over the short period of five years and in the country from 5d. to 9d. in the £.</P>
    <P>I am not quarrelling with that <i>qua</i> increase.  If, again, there are local industries from which the people could benefit by having extra training facilities placed at the disposal of local industrialists, there would be no grave objection to this proposal to increase the rates to provide for vocational education; but if that condition of things does not obtain and if, at the same time, the Department cuts its grants and quietly passes on the burden to the local authority, I say that we have a distinct grievance.</P>
    <P>I say that that grievance may be emphasised in this way, that a year or two of the curriculum of the vocational institute is devoted to making good the failure of the primary system to give primary education to qualify pupils.  The primary system is entirely a State-financed system, and why should the local authorities be compelled to make good what has been the failure of the State?</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister how the proportion will work in future as between the amount to be raised locally and the State grants. In some cases it works out in the proportion of 5 to 3, that is 5 by the State and 3 from the local authority.  In some cases it is 2 to 1, £2 for every £1 raised locally.  It varies, and it is hard to get an accurate average figure which will give the exact proportion. But I venture to prophesy that, as the Minister has already embarked on a policy of cutting grants, he is now embarking on a policy of increasing the contribution from the local rates. It is quite easy to see that the proportion will be twisted to the detriment of the local authority and that the State will pass an increasing burden on to the local authority.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I want to mention as regards the Bill.  I am pleased that the Minister is taking steps, even at this late hour, to recognise the services of the teacher concerned in Section 3 and also with <Col N="571" /> the provision being made for Mr. Hugh O'Flynn.  Both these teachers gave up their ordinary careers in the Department of Technical Instruction run by the British régime here and chose to come under the auspices of the First Dáil and work for a year under the First Dáil until the British military authorities made it impossible for them to continue.  In so far as the Bill seeks to give recognition to these individuals for the services which they rendered, the Minister is to be complimented on the measures he has taken.  But I am afraid I cannot compliment him on the provision which he is making in Section 5.  Here the Minister seeks to arrogate to himself power to dismiss or remove an officer or teacher of a vocational authority.</P>
    <P>Under the 1930 Act, which, as the House will appreciate, was the principal Act brought in to make a beginning, if you like, in vocational education here and which took over a number of officers from, shall we say, the British system, a definite undertaking or guarantee was given to these transferred officers by Section 99 of that Act.  Section 99 (3) of that Act says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every officer transferred by this section shall not, in the service of a vocational education committee to which he is so transferred, receive less remuneration or, subject to the provisions of this section, be subject to less beneficial conditions of service than the remuneration to which he was entitled and the conditions of service to which he was subject in the service from which he was so transferred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have a definite undertaking given to all officers of the old committees. By Section 5 of this Bill the Minister proposes to remove that undertaking.  I say that it is a very bad precedent to set up.  I say that it is a violation by statute of the undertaking given by a previous statute, and that it is very wrong in principle that this House should endorse a violation of that kind.  I also hold that it is a grave injustice to the officers who had this statutory undertaking by the Act of 1930.  Their <Col N="572" /> rights are being filched from them now by Section 5 of this Bill.  Under that Act all the officers who transferred over had that guarantee given by law that their conditions would be no worse than they were.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions they had to endure, if you like, was the liability to disciplinary punishment which, of course, is a condition in any service of the kind.  But under the old system and under the system obtaining in the 1930 Act, no officer could be removed or dismissed by the Minister except after a public inquiry had been held and the officer had the right to defend himself to a certain extent in that inquiry.  Now the protection of the inquiry which he had under the 1930 Act is removed by Section 5 of this Bill.  The only reason advanced is that certain doubts existed as to the Minister's rights or powers and to set these doubts aright the Minister introduces this very drastic provision. I want to appeal to the Minister on behalf of these officers&mdash;they are not very numerous&mdash;who did transfer, that the provision should not apply.  I want to appeal to him, in the first instance, to withdraw this provision from the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has already sufficient powers under the existing law to deal with any case of misconduct, or any case of inefficiency, or any case where it is desirable in the public interest that an officer should be removed or dismissed.  He has ample power under the 1930 Act for that, and I cannot see why he should seek to give himself these additional powers.</P>
    <P>If he cannot see his way to remove the section entirely, then I would ask him to restrict its application so that the section should not apply to officers who were in the service before the date of the 1930 Act.  It would also be inequitable to apply it to officers who came into the service since the 1930 Act and who are in the service at the moment.  If there is need at all for this provision, it should only apply to officers to be recruited in the future.</P>
    <P>This is a definite worsening of the conditions of employment under which these men took office.  It is a definite <Col N="573" /> breach of the contract which the committees undertook with them.  It is a definite breach of the statutory undertaking which was given to them by Section 99 (3) of the 1930 Act.  I do not think that a case can be made for this drastic provision at all.  But, if there is a case for giving the Minister these powers, then I say these powers should not apply to men who had statutory guarantees hitherto and that they should only apply to the officers to be recruited henceforth.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I would like to bring to the Minister's attention.  It is the position which obtains in Clonmel.  Some years ago the chief executive officer of the vocational committee of the South Riding of Tipperary had to take proceedings against the Clonmel Corporation who were, at the time, the vocational authority in Clonmel.  These proceedings were very protracted, but they terminated in a settlement, at least in regard to certain parts of the proceedings. As regards the general issue, the officer won his case and judgment was given in his favour.  Costs were awarded to him, but, by reason of the settlement which was suggested by the court to both parties, this officer waived certain of his rights, particularly in the matter of costs.  He agreed to accept portion of his costs on the understanding that when conditions changed in the local corporation the balance of his costs would be made good.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, before this undertaking was made good by the corporation, the whole system of vocational education was changed and what was heretofore the liability of the Clonmel Corporation was transferred to the South Riding of County Tipperary as a whole.  Under the 1930 Act provision was made in Section 97 by which the debts and liabilities of existing committees would be transferred to the new committees.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of inequity in the transaction I refer to, in this way, that you get the position that the liability of Clonmel was transferred to the whole South Riding and people would regard it as unfair that what was a local liability should be made a county-at-large charge.  All <Col N="574" /> the time the individual concerned, who is legally entitled to his costs, has been unable to get these costs.  The amount is not a very considerable one&mdash;a sum of £500 represents the balance of the costs due to him&mdash;and I ask the Minister to consider favourably a proposal to embody in this Bill a provision whereby it should be possible to recoup this gentleman's losses.  He is legally entitled to this money but, as I understand the case, the Department take the view that the local rates should make up the loss rather than that the State should make it good.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House with details of a purely local affair, but this matter is tied up with other matters which occurred in Clonmel at that time.  The officer concerned was entitled, over a period of years, to certain remuneration for extra services rendered in relation to British ex-Servicemen's schemes.  That money was allowed to him by the local committee, but was refused by the officials of the then Department of Technical Instruction in Dublin under the British régime.  At the same time the committee, which was running a large ex-Servicemen's scheme, made a profit of something like £7,000 on the scheme.  Eventually, he was given some monetary consideration for the schemes, but that has no great bearing on the general issue.  It is tied up to a certain extent with it.</P>
    <P>This matter has a long, involved history.  I ask the Minister to consider favourably any representations he may receive in this particular case and, I hope he will try to meet the views of the officer, who has a distinct grievance and who may be compelled eventually to go to law to get that grievance rectified, and of the South Riding Vocational Committee.  This matter was brought to the notice of the then Minister in 1936 when there was a Vocational Bill before the House and an amendment was proposed, but I understand it was ruled out of order. I am prepared to let the Minister have the amendment I have in mind.  It would, I think, help to settle this grievance of the officer and the committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> I hope the Minister will consider the inequities of the whole case.  I would also ask him to make a State grant to settle this matter once and for all.  The amount is very small and all parties would then be satisfied.  If the present position is allowed to continue, there is a danger that further litigation may ensue and the local committee may have to fight the matter again.  There is no doubt that if these matters had been brought to the notice of the judge they would have been made a rule of court and they would have been part of the settlement that was brought to his lordship's notice at the time.  For some reason, these matters were not included in the settlement.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go so far as to say that it is an issue that is incontestable. I suggest the equities of the case lie with the officer and the committee.  I think the Minister might look upon the matter in a generous way and settle it by way of a small State grant.  I appeal to him to avail of this measure to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous occasions, when a Vote for vocational education or technical instruction was before the House, or when Bills relating to these subjects were being discussed here, I voiced complaints because of the inequitable treatment of the City of Dublin Vocational Committee. In the recent past that position has been adjusted, if not entirely in a satisfactory way, at least on a more favourable financial basis.  Therefore, my complaint against the Department so far as the financial aspect is concerned, disappears for the moment. Since the Minister's statement is in the nature of a general survey of the operation of the Act of 1930, I can advert to some aspects of the operation of that Act in so far as it affects the City of Dublin.  I should like to refer to what I regard as the sweeping statement of Deputy.  I should like to refer to what I Deputy Coogan in relation to what he described as the difficulties of operation of the Act.  There are two phases of this subject.  One relates to the rural districts, of which I have no experience, and the other to the cities and large towns.  I do not mind confessing that, even within my own Party, there are diverse views as regards the manner <Col N="576" /> in which the Act has been carried out during the last 15 or 16 years in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>I have personal experience of its operation in the City of Dublin and I am happy to tell the House that the Act is working extremly well.  The best proof of that is that all our schools and institutes in the city are crowded to the doors and that it is impossible to find accommodation for all the students offering.  The committee responsible is now compelled to engage in a large building programme which provides for a school of music, and&mdash; if Deputy Coogan were present he would be interested to hear&mdash;a school of technology.  He referred to the absence of such a school.  He lamented that the poor man's child could go only to a certain stage because of the absence of such a school.  I am not a member of the Minister's Party but I am deeply concerned with the working of this Act in the city and I am bound to say that there is not a child in the city who, because of his lack of means, is not in a position to complete the range of technical education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, we have our institutes working to capacity and we cover a wide range of subjects.  We have engineering, building construction, printing and other schools, while we also provide instruction in architecture as applied to building construction.  We have what is the nearest approach to a school of technology in our institute in Kevin Street.  We have those institutions working with the goodwill of the students and with the co-operation of the employers and trade unions&mdash;a very important factor so far as technical education is concerned.  We have ample evidence of that co-operation from these two sections.  So far as the Department is concerned, we are not being starved in any way.  It is not correct to say, as has been said here, that there are no trade scholarships. In the City of Dublin, there is a most generous quota.  As between the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and the Department of Education, there are the most cordial relations&mdash;with one exception.  I should be prepared to give the Department a clear certificate save in one respect&mdash; that there is an undoubted difference of <Col N="577" /> opinion as between the committee and the Department in respect of teachers who are eligible for promotion to positions in the gift of the committee and are denied that promotion owing to the Department insisting on a particular standard of Irish which was not one of the conditions when these individuals entered the service.  A number of such cases are pending and, as the matter may be regarded as <i>sub judice</i>, I leave it there.  With that exception, I think that any member of the Vocational Education Committee would say what I say&mdash;that the system is working extremely well.  Quite frankly, we have no complaints.</P>
    <P>Having given that certificate to the Department, I feel all the stronger in commenting on Section 5 of this Bill. The Minister can have this Bill passed easily through the House if he sees the wisdom of deleting Section 5.  An effort was made along the same lines in connection with the amending Act of 1944 but it did not succeed.  This is a retrograde step and I support Deputy Coogan in urging that the Minister remove that very objectionable section&mdash; objectionable in the sense that individuals under the 1930 Act had certain guarantees and that you are repealing those guarantees under this amending measure.  Nothing is more calculated to destroy confidence or to create distrust in Acts of Parliament than this form of legislation.  As Deputy Coogan pointed out, not many individuals are affected.  That is all the more reason why this matter should not unduly disturb the Minister and his Department. Deputy Coogan thought that, if the Minister could not delete the section, he might amend it in such a way as to leave certain individuals under the 1930 Act in the position in which they were. I take a slightly different view.  I think that this section goes somewhat deeper than the implications which Deputy Coogan read into it.  In so far as the Minister is prepared to dismiss or suspend without reference to the committees, he is, in effect, hitting against the independence of the committees. As a member of a committee for a number of years, I know of no instance in which the necessity for an amendment of this character occurred.  The Minister acknowledged in his opening statement <Col N="578" /> the service which the committees have given to vocational education and to the Department for the past 15 or 16 years.  He should not unduly antagonise them at this stage.  Therefore, I join in the appeal by Deputy Coogan to the Minister to delete that section.  If he does his Bill will have an easy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill provides a means for vocational education committees throughout the country to obtain extra money for their work, I welcome it.  I was also glad to hear the statement of the last speaker that vocational education in Dublin City is a success and that they are able to cater for all and sundry in their schools.  Having said so much, I feel disappointed that no indication has been given by the Minister as to what the ultimate aim of vocational education is so far as the Department is concerned.  The increased expenditure provided under this Bill will not meet the demands in Mayo and will not bring vocational education to the masses of the people.  For a number of years vocational education committees throughout the country have been in the peculiar position that they have built schools, that there are demands for further schools and for itinerant teachers, and yet they do not know what the ultimate aim of the State is in respect of vocational education or how far the State intends to go in this direction.  Where a number of schools have been erected in the larger centres of population they are working all right and provide good opportunities for the students attending them but, under the rating system, the people in the country districts are paying for those schools, providing service for the people in the towns and the areas adjacent to the towns.  The agricultural industry is not catered for or is catered for only to a very limited extent.  As far as possible we should try to provide technical training in agriculture and I think it is generally admitted that, particularly in these days, skilled training in agriculture is essential if we are to get the best results and if we are to be in a position to compete <Col N="579" /> with our agricultural exports on foreign markets.</P>
      <P>It is admitted by practically all students of agriculture that one of the main reasons for the success of agriculture in Denmark is the fact that the vast majority of the Danes are technically trained in agriculture and schools are provided for that training. Under our system the only opportunity of providing technical training for farmers' sons is through vocational education and whereas the vast majority of our people are engaged in agriculture, where vocational schools are provided, they are in the main for the use of the towns and do not cater for the rural community.  It is true that, recently, rural science courses were carried out in some of these schools but in most of them there was no plot of land surrounding the school for the purpose of practical demonstrations. When vocational schools are being erected in rural areas the provision of a plot of land for practical demonstrations in rural science should be one of the first considerations.</P>
      <P>I do not think that will solve the problem.  I do not think that the schools as at present operated, in the centres in which they are situated, will bring vocational education of a rural character to the people.  I do not know whether or not the proposition has been examined by the Department of the erection of an additional room in national schools where lectures could be given or at which itinerant teachers could attend, so as to bring technical training in agriculture to the local people, in their local parish, in their own national school.  At the present cost of the schools already erected in Mayo plus the proposed increase under this particular Bill, after the erection of a few more schools already planned for we will not be able to go any further because, in addition to the cost of erection of the school, there is an initial expenditure on staff ranging from £1,500 to £2,000 per annum.  That is a recurring item of expenditure and with normal increases in salaries will be increasing year by year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> We have found that some schools that have been erected are not big enough, and in connection with a few new schools in Mayo there are complaints that they cannot take in all the persons seeking admission.  On the other hand, schools have been erected that should never have been erected. These matters should be gone into more carefully.  To a large degree the fault may rest on the shoulders of county committees of vocational education. I suggest that, before a school is erected, classes should be held in the particular centre for a period by itinerant teachers and the attendance at these classes would be a guide as to whether there was need for a school in that particular place or not.</P>
    <P>I regret that an indication has not been given as to how far it is intended to go with vocational education.  There is certainly a very large demand for it in the towns, but the curriculum is wrong for the rural areas.  One class of people is being catered for, and I am not so sure that we are meeting with the success that we should have or that results in accordance with the amount of money expended are being obtained. At page 216 of the Report on Vocational Organisation, the commission say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is difficult to estimate the number of students who are turned out each year trained in the various subjects.  Examinations are held, but entrance for them is voluntary.  The following table, compiled from figures in the Department's report for 1939-40, shows the numbers who passed the senior or advanced stages of technical school examinations in that year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From the ensuing table it would appear that for the year 1939-40, the total number of first-class successes was 108; the total number of passes was 2,306, making a total of 2,414 candidates who passed examinations in the building trade, mechanical engineering, motor-car engineering, electrical engineering, applied chemistry, art, flour milling, domestic economy, and commerce, in the vocational schools and, in connection with the building trade, mechanical engineering, motor-car engineering, electrical engineering and <Col N="581" /> applied chemistry there were only 324 successes, including first-class successes and passes, for the whole country. That seems to me a very small figure if we can rely on these particular figures and if they are an indication of the progress of vocational education.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer briefly.  It is in connection with the work done under the heading of Domestic Economy in the vocational education schools.  It would appear that, in 1939-40, of all the girls who presented themselves for examination in domestic economy, there was not one solitary first-class success. Of the total number who entered for examination in that year, only 1,659 passed.  This is one of the most important functions of vocational education, one of the first avenues that should be open to the young girls throughout the country to learn the art of cooking, to start off with, yet only 1,659 passed and there was not one first-class success.  The system of work in these schools would appear to be that quite a lot of time is given to teaching commercial courses, training girls in shorthand and typewriting, for jobs that are not there for them, instead of concentrating on one of the first functions of vocational education.  The young girls should be trained for the job which the majority of them ultimately will be doing, that is, the job of running a house and cooking decent meals.</P>
    <P>Secondly, where there is provision for training in domestic economy, the system appears to be to train these girls to cook in a modern all-electric kitchen, under conditions which they will never meet in their home lives.  In the main, provision should be made for them to work under the conditions which 99 per cent. of them will meet in their own homes, with their own turf fires in country kitchens.  I am speaking solely about rural areas, as I am not qualified to discuss what happens here in Dublin.  I have had the feeling for a long time that much time is being wasted in training girls as shorthand typists.  It has also the effect on the rural community that such girls, going each night to vocational schools for commercial courses and learning shorthand and typewriting, <Col N="582" /> are not prepared to do the work their mothers did in the homes.</P>
    <P>They are being trained for office jobs and so become a complete burden on their fathers and mothers.  Possibly as a result of getting away from the home and local atmosphere, they do not want to work on the land and do the ordinary work that country girls do, so all we are training them for, in the main, is export.  Far greater bias should be given to teaching matters connected with farming and the work our people have to do in the ordinary course of events in their own homes.</P>
    <P>If the amount of money proposed to be provided under this Bill comes along to committees like mine, we are still in the position that, while we have a few schools that we will erect and have need for, we do not know what further Bill may be brought in in five or six years' time.  We do not know whether it might be open to us&mdash;as some committees have done throughout the country &mdash;to run into debt if we feel like it.  We know the limit that was imposed by law before this.  I understand that some' committees were not living within their budget and were prepared to go ahead with an extension scheme, always knowing that the Minister or the Department would ultimately come to their aid if they got into the mire deeply enough.  Whereas the limit provided here under this particular Bill would allow us to do a little, it will not make even a start in my particular part of the country towards bringing the benefit of vocational education to the ordinary country farmer.  We estimate that even on the building of schools, if we cut out itinerant teachers altogether, in my particular county we will want something in the nature of 2/6 in the £ levy.  I may say that the majority of the committee members would agree with that view.  I do not know how far the Minister intends to go.  Having started as we did with 1/4d. in the £, increasing year by year until we reached a maximum of 5d., there will always be the feeling that, if we are allowed to go a bit further now, there will be another Bill introduced by the Minister in a few years' time to allow us to go still further.  That feeling will get abroad in my county and in other counties.  I <Col N="583" /> would like it to be laid down somewhere what the intentions are, whether there will be an ultimate limit for vocational education or whether the matter will be considered again in a few years' time when the Minister sees what progress has been made throughout the country with the extra expenditure under this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a more particular check by the Department on the location of schools.  There should be some regulation, so that, before we go to the expense of erecting schools which might turn out to be white elephants as the classes would not be there for them, a test would be made by means of itinerant teachers to see if there would be consistent attendance and demand for the classes.</P>
    <P>In regard to all future schools to be erected in rural areas, I would insist on provision being made for a piece of land around them, where the rural science teacher could work with his pupils.  The courses should be adapted to our particular needs and should be given a rural bias.  Also, if the Minister finds it possible to do so&mdash;though I do not know how it can be done&mdash;I would like to see vocational education brought into the heart of the rural areas.  We are catering too much at present for people in the towns, while denying this very necessary training to young farmers' sons whose need is far greater than that of the people in the towns and who, as a unit of our community, merit that we spend more money in providing for them.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Coogan approached the subject of this Bill on entirely wrong lines.  He showed considerable want of knowledge of the subject that he was dealing with.  In the first place, he charged the Department and the Minister with this, that provision was not made on these local committees for representatives of the Church and of industry.  Now, the formation of these committees depends entirely on the local public bodies.  In most places they make provision for representatives of the various Churches.  These are nominated by the Bishops and other leading ecclesiastics.  So far as the other members of the committee are concerned, it is up to the local bodies, the corporations or county councils, to put on people who will be representative of the various interests that are represented on the local bodies themselves.</P>

      <P>At any rate, that was the burden of his attack.  Dealing with this matter of the local committees, I can say that the local councils have even gone outside their own bodies to get people with special knowledge of technical education to act on them.  If the local bodies do not recognise their local responsibility in the matter, surely the Minister is not expected to educate them in that regard.  Deputy Coogan travelled from one thing to another in such a way that his arguments were a whole mass of confusion in so far as I could gather what he was driving at.  He wound up by saying that, of course, if a council of education had been appointed a lot of these ills would have been remedied.  In this House I have been listening for a considerable time to a lot of discussion on this question of a council of education. It has always surprised me why those who advocate it do not themselves set about forming such a council.  If the <Col N="585" /> Government were to form such a council, the first criticism that would be made of it would be that it was interfering with natural development. I will give a commonsense example which is as well known to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle as it is to myself of how a council of that particular type worked.</P>
      <P>When the Gaelic Athletic Association was in its infancy, as well as the Industrial Development Association and the Gaelic League, they saw that they had certain interests in common, and without going to the Government or anywhere else they decided that it would be a wise thing to form a council on which all of them would be represented. They asked the particular units in each county to appoint two men on a particular council.  That was done.  The same thing was done at headquarters.  You have that body in existence to-day.  Of course, when our own industries were developed the need for that council, so far as industry is concerned, was not as keen as before, but still the contact remains and you have An tOireachtas.  You have the Thomond Feis and other bodies of that kind so that the action of that council at that time did promote the national ideal.  There is nothing to prevent the primary teachers, the vocational teachers, secondary teachers or the university people from doing something on the same lines.  They can do so in the morning if they wish.  If they decide to do so they can then call on the Government to give the council such sanction as may be in the public interest. That is my view on this question of a council of education.  I am not against it.  I am in favour of it, but I am not in favour of the Government forming the council.  The bodies I have mentioned should themselves set about it and do that particular work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that Deputy Coogan was confused about what I may describe as purely educational scholarships and skilled technical knowledge.  He confused these two things.  He spoke as if the vocational schools were expected to turn out skilled technicians.  When our infant industries were being formed and when we did want skilled technicians, it was not to any vocational school or college that we sent the prospective <Col N="586" /> technicians for our home industries but rather into the actual industry itself.  The point should not be overlooked that the principal object of the vocational or technical education system is to give sufficient knowledge to youth to enable them to derive full benefit subsequently from their studies. You cannot make them technicians in a technical school because, for one thing, you could not, in the first instance, put up enough technical schools with the particular type of education and knowledge of the actual operations of industry that would be necessary to bring that position about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan also wanted the vocational schools to provide good Christian managers for industry.  Well, undoubtedly, while he was not prepared to admit as far as I could gather from his arguments that cultural and technical knowledge go hand in hand, he opposed the teaching of Irish.  He said that too much time is being given to it.  He opposed the teaching of the national language which would give the pupils a national outlook and a link with the best traditions of their own country.  He expected the vocational schools to do all these things.  All schools help in that direction, but all schools do not turn out a strait-laced technician of any kind or a manager for a particular work or industry. Another serious criticism was the attack that he made on the primary schools.  Now last week we had from the benches opposite very strong arguments in favour of paying the national teachers better than they are being paid.  It was said that they were not getting salaries in keeping with the work they are doing, but Deputy Coogan this evening said that most of the time of the teachers in the vocational schools is spent making up for the defects in the primary schools.  Is not that an extraordinary state of affairs?</P>

      <P>Approximately 75 per cent of those who sit for the examination are successful.  Again we have pupils entering the vocational schools who might have not been very good in the national school and their parents will say, if the children have not been very good in the national school at, say, English or Irish: &ldquo;Well perhaps they have had a bent for something in the technical line&rdquo; and they send them into the technical schools.  The technical school teachers will have to take these pupils as they find them and if they have to devote a certain amount of time in qualifying these pupils to avail of the technical knowledge, that is part of the system. They will have to take the class as a group and see what they can do in the best interests of these pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion to give a rural bias to vocational education is very important and is one with which I entirely agree, because the rural community is a very extensive community.  To my mind, instead of building a few huge vocational schools&mdash;while it may be wise to build such schools in centres where there is a local industry for which these schools can cater&mdash;it would be advisable to add additional rooms to most of our national schools where, as Deputy Moran suggested, the teachers can instruct girls in domestic economy and give boys a primary course in rural science while also imparting to them a certain amount of practical knowledge in the plots attached to the schools.  That was done formerly but the fees for such courses were withdrawn&mdash;a very unwise thing to do, in my opinion.  That is one of the subjects the teaching of which should be encouraged.  We are told that there is not sufficient <i>ceangal</i> or bond between the different systems of education, but it should be remembered that the classes of pupils who go to vocational schools and universities do not always blend. For example, those who go to the vocational schools are mainly intended for industry.  They acquire a knowledge there which enables them, when they enter a particular trade or industry, to absorb more quickly the additional instruction which they receive. After all, there is no substitute, <Col N="588" /> to my mind, for the serving of an apprenticeship to a trade or industry.</P>
    <P>Those who go into secondary schools have a different outlook.  Their object is to pass into the Civil Service, to obtain clerkships in the Electricity Supply Board or to get into an office, while those who pass on to the university intend to take up some profession. They want to become doctors, secondary teachers or engineers.  So while there is a definite fundamental principle attached to all types of teaching, there is a particular point which marks a distinction between the various classes of pupils who take up different courses.</P>
    <P>As regards vocational schools and the university, we have only two sets of universities in the country.  How can anybody suggest that we can have any kind of bond between the people who go into these vocational schools preparatory to entering some industry at 16 or 18 years of age and the universities? How are these students to get away from their homes and who is going to pay the expense of taking them to the University Colleges of Galway, Cork or Dublin?</P>
    <P>All these theories may be very high sounding but I do not think they would work at all if an effort were made to give practical effect to them. Something in this way has been achieved by the vocational schools in Cork.  Diplomas are now issued in social and economic science to students who acquire their knowledge of economic subjects&mdash;the ordinary theory of economics, book-keeping, etc.&mdash;in the school of commerce and who receive instruction in sociology and other subjects in the University at night when the pupils can go there. That, however, is only one city, but how are you going to organise such a system in Limerick, Kilkenny, Waterford and other places?  The Minister and his Department have the responsibility of formulating schemes for the good of the country as a whole.  They have to keep in mind the requirements of the country generally and what is best suited to the needs of the country in general.  To my mind, the needs of rural districts should receive earnest consideration.  The <Col N="589" /> work carried on by these schools in the towns is making good progress, especially where local industries are located.  These industries give an incentive to the pupils to improve their skill inasmuch as they know that the certificates that are issued by these schools will obtain for them a certain preference in employment and rapid promotion when they enter industry.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest blots I find in the system is that in proportion to the total number of teachers employed, there are too many part-time teachers and too many temporary whole-time teachers.  I recognise that it is necessary to have a certain number of part-time teachers because, as I have said, there has to be a certain bond between industries and the technical schools.  Certain men who are, perhaps, engaged all day in industry of one kind or another, go into the technical schools at night as part-time teachers.  You cannot avoid that. It is a good system because no man is more capable of imparting instruction in a particular trade than a man who has been working at it.  Then, however, there are temporary whole-time teachers who get no pay whatever during the summer months.  During the holiday period, with the exception of a few who, by the grace of the Minister, might have been put on a yearly salary, they get no pay whatever. The great bulk of them are not entitled to a pension or to any of the privileges which an established teacher enjoys.</P>
    <P>Teachers sometimes write to me and say that they have been three or four years teaching under a county committee but the committee cannot make them permanent because they have not enough money.  Such conditions should not prevail.  Taking it all in all, I think the system has a fairly solid foundation. There is room for development but, when we criticise it, our criticism should be directed towards achieving what we believe to be best in the interests of the pupils and the interests of the community at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been reared <Col N="590" /> on a farm, I found what I learned in my early days in the national school from Baldwin's <i>Agriculture</i> of great use to me in after-life.  I was anxious to get on the vocational committee in my area, being a member of the county council, but they were not keen on putting me there.  They put me on the mental asylum committee instead, but I have some knowledge of what is happening.  I had often wondered what the term &ldquo;rural science&rdquo; meant, and, when I asked one of my sons attending the classes, I was amazed to find it was agriculture, so that you have the rural science teacher and the agricultural instructor teaching one and the same thing.  In the light of the benefit I got from the teaching of agriculture in the national school, I agree with those Deputies who suggested an additional room in the national schools, but there would appear to be overlapping between the work of the rural science teacher and the agricultural instructor, and I have often wondered why they should be teaching the one thing.  Many of the technical schools which have recently been built have been built in the towns instead of out in the country where they could have a plot of ground on which to give demonstrations.  In Killenaule, in my county, there is a plot of ground attached to the school, and I have heard high tribute paid to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the old rural tradesmen, it is a pity that they are dying out, and, in my area, there is a complete absence of the rural carpenter. Farmers' sons and agricultural labourers have picked up quite a lot of useful knowledge in the technical schools, and I notice that many of them are making use of that knowledge on the farm where the shaft of a mowing machine often breaks, with no carpenter available within eight miles.  The difficulty is for young men to get into these technical schools which are far apart.  In the case of Cahir, it is a matter of 14 miles on one side, 11 on another and 10 on the third, and it is difficult for young men to get into them, even with bicycles, after a hard day's work.  I suggest, however, that a rural bias could be given by having a room attached to the national school and that more use should be made of the <Col N="591" /> rural tradesmen.  I know three carpenters and a blacksmith who are examples of what I mean.  The smith has three men working for him and has now gone into oxy-acetylene welding.</P>
    <P>I suggest that some fee might be fixed for apprenticeship to such tradesmen because apprentices, no matter how willing they may be, will smash quite a lot of stuff in their first years. As it is, these old craftsmen are, as I say, dying out.  Another tribute to the technical schools is paid by what I learned from a young man who had a set of rough tools on the farm at home and who had a penchant for this type of work.  He went across to England and got work as a builder's labourer. Within four months, by keeping his eyes open and by watching the carpenters working, coupled with the little knowledge he had gleaned at home on the farm, he became foreman with a big building contractor.  The knowledge he got in the technical school he made good use of and he told me that he attributed his success to his training in the technical school.</P>
    <P>Many of these young men have great hands and I know a fellow near me who would not know B from a bull's foot when he left school but who turned out to be a great craftsman, and his place now is a credit to him.  These rural tradesmen can get anything in reason they ask for, and, if they go across to England, they earn £8 and £10 a week. In view of that, I cannot understand why our young fellows should have such a liking for &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; jobs.  If a clerk or a shop assistant goes to a dance or to a &ldquo;spread&rdquo; of any kind, he is &ldquo;it&rdquo;, but the tradesman is not considered as being in the same class. It is time we dropped that outlook.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the tendency on the part of young people to go in for shorthand and typewriting. I see from reports in the papers that typists are very scarce and that they are being offered good salaries. Recently a lady was appointed to a position in America at £2,000 a year. Apparently we are going to have a great increase in typists.  But, for the training of the future wife, typing and shorthand are not very much good.  As to the training in domestic economy in <Col N="592" /> the vocational schools, we have up-to-date cooking stoves in these schools.  I am afraid it will be a long time until we get such stoves in houses in the rural districts.  I think a little training in cooking on an open hearth would be a very good thing, because it is neglected to a great extent.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  I am a member of the county council in Tipperary but I am not on the vocational committee.  But the Minister is cognisant of what happened in the case which has been referred to.  I have a copy of the statement sent to the Minister.  I think if that were dealt with from the Central Fund it would be an easy way out of it. I do not wish to mention the gentleman's name.  He is a member of the Upper House.  He is one of the most capable men I have met in such a position. His heart and soul are in the work and he has worried quite a lot over it. If the Minister could see his way to fix that up, it would be a great help.  The person concerned is one of the most capable men I have ever come across. He is not a native of my county, but I appreciate his work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was not here for the Minister's opening statement on this Bill, as I might not have to make many points which I propose to make now.  As many other Deputies on both sides of the House have said, there is a lack in some parts of the country of vocational schools. Another thing that is more lamentable even than the lack of schools is the lack of interest in the existing schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On another occasion, when speaking on education, I suggested that lectures could be delivered in the ordinary national schools where the children are going every day and that, in turn, the parents could be educated to the point that their children would be sent from the national school to the vocational school to prepare them for their future life, which is the most important thing, because a boy leaving the national school at 14 is not very well fitted for anything, much less for a trade.  The same thing applies to the girls as regards sewing and the ordinary things that a girl should know in <Col N="593" /> order to run a home later on.  These matters are more or less neglected for the other subjects, which perhaps are necessary.  If we could bring the children to recognise the great advantage of a training in a vocational school it would be a great help.  Emphasis has been laid on the fact that boys should be taught carpentry or some other trade which they might think of taking up.  I am speaking now of children who are not able to go to a university or have no ambition to go there.  The same thing would apply to girls, whom we should try to get interested in domestic subjects.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the teaching of shorthand and typewriting, but domestic subjects are really necessary for the running of a home.  It is the mothers who make the home. Therefore, we should encourage young girls to take advantage of the vocational schools.  As I say, we have not enough of these schools, apart from the lack of enthusiasm for them which undoubtedly exists in certain places. For 20 children that go to these schools, there are 50 not going to them.  Apparently the parents do not recognise the duty that lies on them to send their children to these schools. But in many places in the country I believe that children would be sent to these vocational schools if they were provided for them.  Otherwise we should have lectures and demonstrations given in the ordinary schools.  I realise that it would take a good deal of money to put up a lot more vocational schools.  Nevertheless, it is a pity that children who wish to learn some trade are deprived of the facilities for doing so simply because they are not living in or near a town where there is a vocational school.  I would ask the Minister if there is any way he could devise by which this education could be given to anyone who was willing to avail of it.</P>
    <P>Then there are the children who have an ambition to receive a university education.  There are many people who wish to send their children to a university but who cannot afford to send them to Dublin or Cork. Take, for instance, the case of Waterford. <Col N="594" /> It would cost parents a certain amount to keep their children in pocket money, apart altogether from the cost of maintenance for a number of years.  I know that money is scarce and if there was an increase of taxation we would perhaps be the first to come down on the Minister.  At the same time, I think it would be well if the Minister would consider having other university colleges established in the bigger centres.  I speak in particular for Waterford, but the same thing applies to other cities.  There are buildings which could be utilised for the purpose with the expenditure of very little money.  With very little cost to the State these buildings could be made available for university colleges.  In that way there would be an incentive to parents to give their children a chance of a university education because they would not have the expense of sending them to the existing university colleges.  We have spent a good deal of money on education in the past few years.  Some people think we cannot do any more, but others have a different opinion. Personally I think that what I suggest could be done at a comparatively small cost.  Therefore, I think it would be a good thing for the Minister to consider the establishment of a few more university colleges throughout the country so as to provide an opportunity for children whose ambition is to get a university education.</P>
    <P>I may not be quite in order in the suggestion I am about to make, but I believe there is one way in which money could be saved, so far as education goes. This may not be very popular, but at any rate it is my opinion.  Much money has been spent on the teaching of Irish.  Irish may be all right in its own way, but not to the extent to which it is being pushed at the moment.  It is not for the betterment of education or of the children's minds.  I believe that the expenditure in that direction could be cut down somewhat.  Every little helps.  There would be a saving in that respect and that saving could be put to some practical use.  I think the <Col N="595" /> money that might be saved in that manner could be devoted to other more useful purposes.  I hope the Minister will consider those points that I have mentioned and if he does consider favourably my point about the university, I trust that he will place Waterford in the No. 1 position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing a Bill of this nature, naturally the first question that would occur to one would be, is the country getting value for the money we are spending on education? When we were discussing the Estimate for primary education this year a member of the Labour Party asked that question in relation to primary education.  I am asking it in relation to this Bill.  The Minister dealt exhaustively with the developments that have taken place from 1930 up to the present, but he did not deal definitely or expressly with the educational results that were achieved in these years.  He did not deal expressly or definitely with the results achieved in the vocational schools during all these years.  It appears to me that when the Minister asks the Dáil to give him authority to impose additional levies on the ratepayers, it is his duty to let the Dáil know definitely what results have been achieved by the vocational system of education.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be misunderstood.  I am a wholehearted believer in the system of vocational education, but I feel that the time, money and effort devoted to propagating vocational education have not been utilised to the very best advantage.  I believe that with more intelligent direction and, perhaps, a better system of education, one designed to suit the interests of the country, we would have achieved much better results than we have succeeded in getting so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the amount spent on vocational schools.  I wonder if all that expenditure was necessary and if, with some sort of co-operation between the officials in charge of primary education and those concerned with vocational education, some of that money could not have been saved.  It appears to me that our national <Col N="596" /> schools could be utilised much more extensively for the purpose of vocational education.  I realise that for the purpose of courses in vocational training it is necessary to have special equipment, and that equipment cannot be left lying loose in national schools. But an annex could be built to any school in order to house that equipment. If a spirit of co-ordination existed between those in charge of the primary and vocational schools, and if an additional room or two could be added to national schools, where such schools are now being erected, in order to provide additional facilities in certain areas in the country, it would be very desirable.</P>
    <P>The administration of our educational system is carried out in a rather haphazard manner.  There is a lack of co-ordination between those in charge of our different systems of education.  In rural areas there are schoolmasters in national schools giving the same instruction to their classes as is given by teachers in the vocational schools and by instructors under the Department of Agriculture in other schools or parish halls.  That means a waste of money&mdash;altogether unnecessary expenditure. No effort has been made, despite the fact that the vocational scheme had been in operation for 16 or 17 years, to co-ordinate the education with that imparted in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said that agricultural instructors hold classes during the winter and the spring, and they impart useful agricultural information to farmers' sons.  Pretty much the same type of education is given by other instructors in our vocational schools and in some of our national schools.  Where the teacher is so minded, he has additional courses and he gives instruction to his pupils.  All this instruction is costing a considerable amount, and I suggest that by intelligent co-ordination it should be possible to avoid a considerable amount of our present expenditure.  If we are to achieve desirable results in our systems of education there must be some proper spirit of co-ordination.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the vocational schools in our cities and towns have achieved definite results and the officials <Col N="597" /> deserve credit, but vocational education as applied to rural areas is making tardy progress.  The Minister must accept part of the blame for the fact that people living in rural areas have been rather reluctant to avail of the advantages of vocational education. The scheme as applied to rural areas does not cater wholly for the needs of the rural districts, and, until it does, it is unlikely that it will succeed or get the support which it should get if it were wisely administered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran said girls are flocking in huge numbers into the vocational schools in our cities and towns in order to get certificates in shorthand, typewriting and book-keeping for situations that are not there; they are training for positions that cannot be obtained in this country.  Many of them have to accept other positions, and numbers probably have to emigrate.  People entirely overlook the fact that at the moment domestic servants are at a premium and our vocational schools are making no effort to train girls as domestic servants, so that they will be able to obtain good positions.  Domestic servants, probably for the first time in the history of this country, are able to command any wages they may ask.</P>
    <P>Housewives are prepared to offer any wages if they are satisfied that they are getting good girls.  Notwithstanding that it must be apparent to the Minister and the officials of his Department that the demand exists, they have made no effort, so far, to cater for it.  It is time that our vocational education system was so designed as to give girls of that type a special training in domestic service. There should be special certificates for girls who are prepared to take a course in domestic service.  In fact, they should be encouraged to take an advanced course.  As the demand exists, I submit that it is the duty of the Minister and the officials in charge of our vocational schools to cater for that demand, as far as possible. Reference has been made by Deputy O'Donnell to the fact that many of our old crafts are dying out.  That is a pity.  It is one of the tragedies of the rural areas that those old crafts, which were redolent of life in rural Ireland <Col N="598" /> in days gone by, should be allowed to die out.  The Minister should make an effort to preserve those of the crafts which are worthy of survival.  It should be the function of teachers in rural schools, particularly, to preserve such crafts so far as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid tribute to the committees of vocational education for the work they have done.  That tribute was well deserved.  From my experience, the vocational education committees have given wholehearted service and have done their utmost to make the scheme a success.  I am not so sure that the Minister, on all occasions, has given them the support which they, certainly, deserved.  It has been a subject of frequent complaint by these committees that plans and schemes for improvement of schools and for additional courses in vocational training have been held up for months in the Department of Education and that some of the schemes have been returned in a form in which it was impossible to administer them or in a form in which, if administered, they would yield no positive or definite results.  If vocational committees who are endeavouring to discharge their duties in an efficient and competent manner do not receive co-operation and assistance from the Department of Education, they are bound to become lukewarm and indifferent.  The experience of at least one vocational education committee, of which I have knowledge, is that they have not received the co-operation and assistance from the Department which they regarded as their due.</P>
    <P>There are clauses in the Bill dealing with the payment of travelling expenses to members of vocational education committees.  These sections follow much on the lines of a Bill introduced by the Minister for Agriculture 12 or 18 months ago.  The scale of payments is similar.  I notice that, in Section 6, it is provided that no man living less than five miles from the place of meeting shall be entitled to any payment.  On its face, that appears to be unfair.  Even though a member be living within five miles of the place of meeting, it may be necessary for him to engage a car in order to attend the meeting.  Whether he <Col N="599" /> should be entitled to payment or not should be left to the discretion of the secretary of the committee.  Later, there are some qualifying sub-sections, but it seems to me that these sub-sections do not give the secretary authority to pay travelling expenses to a member who is living a lesser distance than five miles from the place of meeting.  The Minister should give a certain amount of discretion to the secretary of the committee to decide what would be a reasonable distance to entitle a member to payment of travelling expenses.  Nothing else in the Bill deserves very much consideration, but I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should give special attention to the scheme of vocational education for rural areas.  They are, certainly, not being catered for in the way they should be catered for.  The programme needs to be enlarged in many directions and the Minister should make a special effort to avoid overlapping as between primary and vocational education and the instruction given by officials of the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal point, in my opinion, in connection with vocational education is that of extending the school-going period by one year. The last year of the school-going period should be devoted to developing the pupil's mind in regard to subjects which I shall mention presently.  In order to do that, additional accommodation should be provided in all the schools.  I am particularly concerned with the rural areas and the small rural towns.  I do not think that, if such a policy were adopted by the Department and if a room or other accommodation were added to every school, it would be very expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lectures could be given in the subjects which I have in mind by the different instructors in the county.  We have horticultural and agricultural instructors and poultry and butter-making instructresses.  Many of the people in the rural areas grumble when they hear of such appointments being made and of the salaries being paid to such people because they do not get an opportunity of deriving as much advantage from the instruction of those persons <Col N="600" /> as they should.  That is why I suggest having additional accommodation in all the schools.  These appointees could then attend in the different school areas and deliver their lectures. The Department of Agriculture has repeatedly emphasised the value of egg and poultry production.  That is a very valuable monetary asset. Many Deputies have spoken of the importance of developing the youthful mind industrially. If you want to do that, you must first develop agriculture.  The only way to do that is to give the youth in rural Ireland a chance of developing during their school-going period.  If increased agricultural production is encouraged, it will result in more industries being established.</P>
    <P>Egg and poultry production are very important branches of agriculture.  In my opinion, poultry instructresses should be appointed in every county and should attend the schools for, say, even one and a half hours on one day a week to instruct the girls and the boys if they wish to attend, in methods of production of the best type of eggs and poultry.  That would be a most profitable scheme.  If we had extra poultry instructresses to carry out that work, it would provide a means of employment for young ladies instead of having them seek employment in Great Britain and elsewhere.  That would be a sound policy for the Department of Education and would be a way of developing the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>There is the matter of instruction in domestic economy.  Everybody will agree that a good deal of discontent and unhappiness in the home is due to the fact that the housewife is uneducated in housekeeping.  Money spent on lectures on that subject would be well spent.  The Department should provide such lectures in rural and urban schools.</P>
    <P>There are instructors in horticulture appointed by every committee of agriculture.  Are they supposed to be figure-heads, to attend meetings of the county committee once a month?  In my opinion the appointment of two or three additional instructors by every county committee for the purpose of giving lectures in rural areas would be justified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> Repeatedly, Deputies have dealt with forestry in this House.  That is a branch of agriculture that could be developed in rural schools by lectures and practical demonstrations.  A year ago, I suggested that in addition to an extra room, plots of at least half an acre should be provided in the schools in rural areas and such plots might also be provided in rural towns.  Trees on the land are like good furniture in a house.  The youth of the country should be instructed in the planting of trees.  In each county, there are six or seven agricultural instructors who help to develop the minds of those boys who are not in a position to attend agricultural colleges.  I suggest that they should also attend the schools for the purpose of giving lectures and, where suitable, the instructor should remain at the school to lecture after ordinary school hours. Agriculture is underdeveloped in this country.  A knowledge of soil-testing, production of crops, seed-testing, and so on, is very essential, even for the worker.  In my opinion, the agricultural labourer is as much a farmer as his employer and requires to be equally skilled.  The farmer cannot attend to everything and must depend to a very great extent on his labourer. If the labourer is a skilled man, he will be able to command a better wage, a wage equivalent to the wages paid in industry in urban areas.  There should be lectures on milk testing, the value of milk production, the proper methods of producing milk and of obtaining the best results from dairy stock.  These things are essential to the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of mechanisation.  Farming in the future will be revolutionised 1,000 per cent., I should say.  There should be teachers and equipment in the vocational schools and periodically some training should be given to the boys in rural areas who have not an opportunity of attending technical schools. In recent years some boys in the area in which I live were able to have access to machinery and in many cases have obtained good jobs as a result of getting a little training.  A little training <Col N="602" /> of that kind in rural schools would help the boy who has not a chance of attending technical schools.  I would ask the Minister to provide classes such as I have mentioned in rural areas.  By taking a year from the ordinary school-going age, the boy could, at the age of 13, go on to the particular class suitable to him.  If he is to remain on the land, that education would be of great advantage to him and would help him to be an asset to the country.</P>

      <P>It is generally acknowledged that the time has come when vocational education forms as necessary a part of the educational system as national or secondary school education. How to develop that is a problem. Vocational education in this country so far has been purely experimental. Everybody agrees that the experiment, short as it has been, and in so far as it has been carried out, has given excellent results in, say, 90 per cent. of cases.  Many boys and girls take advantage of the vocational schools established in towns and elsewhere for their personal improvement and in some cases have qualified themselves for a livelihood and in many cases that I can vouch for personally, a very lucrative livelihood by this means.  The vocational schools established in towns have proved excellent for those within a radius of four to six miles but we must now pay more attention to the rural districts.  Many Deputies have deplored the fact that the boys and girls in country districts get no chance. We have from time to time people in high positions deploring the flight from the land.  The flight from the land will continue so long as we in this House continue to neglect the most important part of the education of the young.  The boys in a country district who go to the national school get a fair measure of elementary education there but, in addition to that, and equally important, some kind of vocational education should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come to the time when we must establish in or near every national school a separate room or small building to provide vocational education for the boys and girls on <Col N="603" /> two or three nights or days per week. From time to time, young men who have had to leave this country and go to England as there was no employment or prospects here, write to me, and very often I meet young men who say: &ldquo;I wish I had some knowledge of machinery, of building, of concrete work, as when I went over I met Irishmen who had some groundwork in a vocational school or had some experience with skilled people and they were able to go to a job straightway which gave them very good pay.&rdquo;  The vast majority of our young men have become hewers of wood and drawers of water in a foreign land.  We could remedy that by a proper system of vocational education.  There are many openings for young men if they had a chance to develop their natural bents, whether in woodwork, in machinery, in mechanics, in electrical engineering, or on the land itself.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, a scheme of loans is necessary, and I would ask the Minister to take up with the Minister for Finance the question of giving cheap credit, to provide young people who hold a certificate from a vocational school, proving sufficient knowledge or groundwork, with a chance to open up into life with something in their hands, instead of&mdash;as happened to many of us in this House&mdash;starting off with a national school or secondary school education.  We had to face out into the world and depend on whatever knowledge was handed down to us from those who came before us.  In cases where that knowledge was not available, through the early death of parents, we had to start at the bottom and gain by experience.  There is an old saying that experience is a very dear school to learn in.  That is the reason why very many people on the land are fed up with their means of livelihood.  They start with the best intentions, with all the freshness of youth, and propose to do great things, but for lack of certain knowledge, which could be made available cheaply to them by the State, they have tried again and again.  Very often they have burned their fingers and in some cases wrecked themselves through experimenting. All that should be <Col N="604" /> changed.  I would like to see a system of itinerant teachers, male and female, provided for those who want a chance to learn something, in these extra buildings attached to each school.</P>
    <P>It may be pointed out that the first response to such a scheme would be small.  Very likely it would, but we do not know.  It would be well worth a trial.  Seeing the success which vocational schools have met with, it is past time we turned to the rural districts. By providing them with a sound education, we could develop many things at home.  There are many means of livelihood available in the rural districts if there were a sufficient ground work of education to enable them to go ahead, with a little bit of aid from the Minister for Finance in the way of loans to develop new businesses and small industries.  We have some of them starting from time to time, but there is not enough of them.  By that means, we could stem the tide of emigration and keep more of our youngsters at home developing our industries.</P>
    <P>We must pay attention to rural science, as it is called, or ordinary agricultural education, to call it by its proper name.  Listening to the speakers, I thought it very strange that, during the period of England's occupation, there was in the national schools some scheme of agricultural education for the boys in the country districts, but since we got our own Government here 25 years ago that has vanished completely&mdash;so much so that one would get the impression that we do not care two hoots about the people in rural Ireland, that we do not think they are worth training.  We seem to think they are not worth educating, that it is not worth while training the youngsters to make the most out of their livelihood on the land.  The provision we make for other people for business or the professions seems to be denied to the ordinary farmer.  I repeat that the system of vocational education should be carried into the heart of every rural district. It might be pointed out that, if that is not done at present, it is the fault of the vocational education committees; but if so, there is something wrong in the legislation and it is up to the <Col N="605" /> Minister and his officials, who are experts in the matter, to investigate it. Now that the emergency is over, a start should be made to provide a livelihood for the people in the country districts, and the money would be well spent.</P>
    <P>It is a very nice thing to see what a young man can do on a farmstead or holding.  In many cases, I have seen them build their own dwelling-houses to replace the old thatched dwellings which were falling into disrepair and they made an excellent job of them. Then we meet young men who are able to turn out a good deal of their own farm equipment and can make very creditable pieces of furniture for their houses.  We find many who, without any help but from watching others working, have done excellent work in concrete, in roofing, and so on.  There are young men who, without any previous mechanical knowledge, have put £700 or £1,000 into some mechanical outfit, such as a threshing machine or tractor for the land.  It is very nice to see that, but it would be much nicer and better if those men, instead of making costly mistakes through no fault of their own and who were big-minded enough to get on in life, received previously some system of education which would give them at least a rough working knowledge of those things, which would show them the principal pitfalls and mistakes and how to avoid them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with a few specific provisions.  Firstly, it proposes to increase the financial provision for vocational education.  It also deals with the question of a pension for an individual who served under Dáil Éireann in 1919 and who, under the law, is not eligible for a pension.  It also contains a specific provision for Mr. Hugh O'Flynn, and finally with travelling expenses for the members of the committees.  As far as the provisions in the Bill for pension and annual allowances for individuals are concerned, I have no doubt that no member of the House will question <Col N="608" /> them.  With regard to the provision for travelling expenses for members of committees, I think that the parsimonious policy that is being applied is all wrong.  After all, there is a distinction made between the individual who lives five miles distant from the place of meeting and qualifies for the travelling allowance and the individual who lives less than five miles away.  It is expected that the latter will not spend more than three hours away from his home.  Of course, that is all nonsense because he is going to spend more than three hours in order to qualify for the miserable allowance provided for in that case. The Minister ought to be realistic about this.  There may be men who can ill afford to be away, and yet who might be a great asset to the committee&mdash;a workingman who is a family man.  He might be a very useful asset to the local committee.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not be so stingy in a matter of this sort merely because there may be a similar provision in the Local Government Act.  The Minister may tell us that he wants to make this provision harmonise with the provision in that Act.  I suggest that because the Minister for Local Government has been very mean about it is no reason why the Minister for Education should follow the same line.  I would ask him to reconsider it.</P>
      <P>The financial provisions in the Bill gave rise to a very wide discussion on education to-night.  I want to disagree with some Deputies who expressed certain views.  As a matter of fact, I think that in the Minister's speech there was some reference to the difficulty of cultivating an interest in vocational education.  I think myself that there is a growing interest and demand throughout the country for vocational education.  The people today are beginning to appreciate the value of education.  As a member of a vocational committee I sometimes feel that the work we do is to some extent rendered futile because of the lack of finance to provide the necessary facilities for vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see that the provision for vocational <Col N="609" /> education is something in the neighbourhood of £577,000 as compared with over £5,000,000 for primary education. We are therefore just barely touching the fringe of the problem. There is no doubt that a good deal of useful work has been done by vocational schools.  I think the vocational committees generally are very enthusiastic in their work but I am wondering whether, in fact, the policy that was adopted under the Principal Act and that has been gradually extended for financing vocational education is a proper one, whether we can rely on it to provide the facilities for vocational education that are necessary.  The burden of financing approximately 50 per cent. of vocational training is being thrown back on the local committees. I might say that to a very great extent we are throwing back that burden on the primary industry of the country. The Minister under this measure proposes to increase the local rate from 7d. to 9d. in the case of boroughs and for county councils generally from 5d. to 7d.  I think it was Deputy Moran who asked, will that end it?  I do not suppose it will.  The Minister did not give us an estimate of what that increase really means and how much is going to be provided out of the Exchequer.  I take it that the contribution will be on a 50-50 basis.  The contribution from the Exchequer may be slightly more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Even that in my opinion will not provide the facilities that are necessary.  The demand for vocational education from a great many centres cannot be met.  In fact, I am satisfied that the provision will not be adequate to meet the demand that is there.  I have expressed the view that I believe this is not the proper way to finance the system.  I could understand the view that financing it in that way gives the local committee a certain amount of authority over their own schools.  It may appear to do that on the face of it, but to a great extent a cut-and-dried scheme comes down from the Department which has to be adopted by the committee. <Col N="610" /> I agree with Deputy Roddy that so far as education generally is concerned there is lack of co-ordination. Certainly, so far as agricultural education is concerned, there appears to be no co-ordination at all.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to know where the responsibility of the Department of Education ends and where that of the Department of Agriculture commences. I have heard numerous complaints also from vocational teachers, who say that they have to carry on the work, as a matter of fact to perform the work, of the primary schools, that in the early days of the pupil's attendance at the vocational school the work is merely that of continuing to lay the foundation of his education.  I am not in agreement with the Deputy who suggested that vocational subjects should be introduced into the primary schools because I think it will certainly take all the time of the teachers in the primary schools to lay the foundations for the pupil's later education. There is no room there for the introduction of technical subjects. The proof of that is to be found in the general contention of the vocational teachers that the educational ground work of their pupils generally is not sufficient and that they have to continue the work of the primary schools and introduce vocational subjects as well.</P>
      <P>I do not want to take up too much time because many Deputies have already spoken exhaustively on this subject.  So far as agricultural education is concerned, I do not think that we can hope under the present scheme to have an up to date knowledge of agriculture imparted to the pupils if we are to rely on schools of this sort to give the necessary technical knowledge. The Minister gave us a good deal of information about the number of schools, the number of teachers in rural districts, and the amount of land and gardens attached to each school.  He told us that school gardens vary in extent from half an acre to two acres and he told us that the purposes of such gardens were to conduct experiments with soil, manures, crops under varying conditions, plant sprays and plant propagation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> Does the Minister believe it possible, in a garden of half an acre, to achieve all that work, or did he merely let some civil servant write that out for him?  If you think that you are going to give any idea of field conditions in half an acre or an acre you are making a great mistake.  Are we satisfied that it is possible to provide the educational facilities essential to equip our people with the necessary knowledge within the very narrow limits provided under the vocational system at present?  I want to suggest to the Minister that the first thing we have got to consider is whether it is any use going any further when in four or five years' time we may decide that we cannot provide the facilities that are needed.  I do not think that we can provide adequate facilities under the present scheme and that, as far as agricultural education is concerned, we shall have to adopt a completely new system.  I think now is the time to have that matter examined and not to commit ourselves to further substantial expenditure without fully realising what results we are going to get and ascertaining whether the results will be adequate for our requirements.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the teaching of domestic economy and I agree with the views of those Deputies who referred to that subject.  I believe that every girl should get a course in domestic economy as the ultimate aim of the average girl is to preside over a home and to rear a family.  Many girls are lacking in the knowledge necessary for that purpose.  The aim of the vocational school, so far as females are concerned at all events, should be not merely to teach other subjects but to ensure that every girl gets a course in domestic economy as well.  Many of the other subjects taught in the schools, such as carpentry, metal work and smith work, are very useful, beneficial and helpful to young fellows who are anxious to follow certain trades, but I want to conclude by saying that I believe we cannot possibly hope to provide the sort of education necessary for agriculture within these narrow limits, coupled with the <Col N="612" /> county instructors under the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The whole scheme of agricultural education ought to be looked into very carefully, and, as a matter of fact, I think the Post-Emergency Planning Committee recommended that special committees should be set up to examine the whole question of agricultural education, and the sooner a decision is made on that the better.  The present system does give some assistance, but it is not sufficient if we are to provide the technical knowledge necessary to enable young farmers to go on to the land with technical education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a vocational education committee, I welcome this Bill.  I want to say that vocational education in the cities and towns has proved its worth and has done a good job of work for the youth of the country.  I am satisfied that vocational education in the rural districts is a very lop-sided affair.  The ratepayers of our rural districts are not getting the service for which they are paying.  I cannot bring myself to agree with many of the Deputies from rural areas who advocate the adding of a room to every national school in the country.  People acquainted with the technical schools must know that we <Col N="613" /> have in these schools woodwork classes, electrical engineering classes, domestic economy classes, and so on, and the addition of a room to a national school will not provide the accommodation necessary for giving vocational education. If this matter is to be tackled as I believe it ought to be, a system of central vocational schools throughout the rural districts is the proper policy for the Department to adopt, if they wish to help the children of the rural community.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter which I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister in relation to an inequality which operates particularly in the area of South Louth.  We in Drogheda have our own vocational education school, an urban affair.  There is also in the county a county vocational education committee which collects the rates from no fewer than seven districts, although they do not spend a single penny on vocational education for the children of the rural community in any of these districts, all of which comprise a very wide area.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take note of my complaint in this regard.  I believe it to be my duty on an occasion such as this to bring it to his notice.  The districts concerned are:&mdash;Drogheda rural, east and west, the parish of Termonfeckin, Tullyallen, Clogher Head, Togher, Dunleer and Collon.  These are all areas that must pay their 5½d. in the £ which amounts to something like £350 annually, and the people there are then mulcted in additional charges through having to avail of the urban vocational school in the town of Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have repeatedly applied to the county committee for a contribution towards the cost of providing education for the rural pupils.  It is a matter which is discussed at every county rate estimate, but we have never been able to get compensation from the county committee for the services we are rendering on their behalf, although the neighbouring County Meath gives us an annual contribution for the vocational education which we provide for the children of East Meath who come into Drogheda for their vocational education.  That is an anomaly which <Col N="614" /> the Minister should take steps to put an end to once and for all.  I am very glad that the Minister proposes to empower vocational education bodies to increase their demands upon the rates in order to provide additional vocational education for the pupils of our town and district.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much impressed by the speeches of Deputy Roddy, Deputy Heskin, and Deputy Blowick, and by the excellent programme they outlined, which, I am sure, every Deputy would like to see given effect to, if possible, of bringing vocational education to every boy and girl in the country.  That is a high ideal to aim at, particularly in relation to the land and its proper utilisation but, like Deputy Walsh, I gravely doubt if the method suggested is the best means of achieving it&mdash;the building of an additional room or annex to each national school&mdash;because I take it you could not build an annex to one school without building an annex to every school.</P>
      <P>I can easily imagine the chaos which would arise if you were to build such an annex to each school and try to bring the vocational instructors, the forestry, horticultural, and agricultural instructors, and the poultry and domestic economy instructresses in there to give time in all these annexes. You would have a position in which confusion would be worse confounded. The excellent scheme envisaged would not produce results, even if the Minister had all the money necessary to give effect to it.  I agree with Deputy Walsh that the proper way of attending to this urgent need is an extension of the rural vocational schools and having them built within reasonable distance of the national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my county, we have done fairly well in that respect.  There may be room for some more vocational schools there, but very excellent work has been done.  It would be much better if there were a central vocational school in which vocational subjects would be concentrated, in which proper teachers would be available <Col N="615" /> and to which would be attracted the national school children within a reasonable radius rather than to attempt to bring vocational education in on top of primary education in small rooms entirely unsuited for the purpose, thus making it utterly impossible for education in the various crafts to be given.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see the Minister increasing the money available for this very excellent form of education, and I would urge that effect be given as quickly as possible to the extension to the remote rural areas of vocational education.  The people there are entitled to it, and are robbed of it only because of their remoteness.  With very little in the way of extension of central schools, they could be brought within a reasonable distance.  You would thus bring out the vocationally-minded child, whereas if you go into the national schools, you may be preaching to people who are not interested. By having schools set aside for the purpose, you would attract those with a bias towards vocational subjects and get much better results. It is due to the rural children and I trust the Minister will give effect to what I consider is the best and most feasible way, namely, by extending the rural vocational schools to suitable centres adjacent to the maximum number of primary schools and having such a number as would keep the teachers fully employed.  That is, I think, a more sensible proposition than those made by other speakers, with whom I largely agree, except that we have a different method of approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill sets out to improve the method of vocational education, but not a great deal.  Nevertheless, I notice that every Deputy who spoke agreed that whatever extra money will be demanded will be gladly given, because vocational education is as necessary as primary education. There are different ways in which vocational education can be given and every Deputy has his own ideas about that.  Each Deputy can put up a good case for his own method.  I would not agree with vocational education being given in the primary schools, because <Col N="616" /> the primary schools provide the foundation for the education of the younger generation.  At present it is quite a task for children in the primary schools to master two languages and to learn mathematics and the other subjects that are taught.  Therefore I think it would be unwise to introduce any kind of vocational education into the primary schools.  There is, however, the period from 14 to 17 years of age, after children leave the primary school, in which a lot could be done by way of vocational education in night schools. I am a great believer in night schools.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the United States where thousands of our people with very little education have made good. Any of those who have made progress in the United States will tell you that it was due to what they learned in night schools.  A great deal could be done for vocational education in night schools in the way of mechanical training, carpentry, boot-making, tailoring, and, above all, domestic economy.</P>
      <P>Then, again, you have the question of agricultural education which, as Deputy Hughes pointed out, can never be taught with a half-acre or acre plot attached to a vocational school.  Some things can be learned, but you cannot have a real agricultural education given in that way.  A half-acre or an acre plot which has been constantly devoted to experiments of one sort or another is bound to lose its fertility and the soil in one area may not be the same as the soil in another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to what can be taught in vocational schools in the night time, people have a certain leaning towards a certain occupation.  One may wish to be an electrician.  Another may turn to carpentry and another to iron work. These young people can definitely be helped by getting a proper vocational education when they have reached the age of 14 years or over.  I am not entirely opposed to giving vocational education before that age, but I maintain that a child has enough to do learning other subjects before that age. If we do not learn mathematics and other subjects, we can make very little progress in vocational education.  To add an additional room to every school <Col N="617" /> in order to give vocational education in the rural areas would not, I think, be a very successful method.  There may be arguments which can be advanced in its favour.  But, as Deputy Keyes has said, it would be impossible to bring to all these schools the instructors necessary to carry on the different classes in order to make them a success.  You would also have to install an electric plant of some sort which would entail a lot of expense. Such trades as electric welding and so on are very useful at the present moment.  No one can deny that a person who has a trade in which he can utilise his hands will very often make a better livelihood than the person whose occupation demands the use of his brain.  We know how successful some of our men and women who have gone across the Channel have been in some of these trades.</P>
    <P>I think the best method of promoting vocational education in the rural areas is to erect decent buildings where you can have the necessary plants installed and different trades taught.  In that way you would have centralisation.  You would be able to choose your centres to suit those who required vocational education.  Every Deputy who has spoken has referred to the necessity of teaching domestic economy, which is one of the most essential things that can be taught in a vocational school.  We have heard complaints from everybody in town and country that the average housewife is hardly up to the standard which she could reach if she had been taught the little extra in a vocational school.</P>
    <P>In the section of the vocational school dealing with domestic economy much could be done to enlighten the average young woman whose ambition, as Deputy Hughes said, is to become the mistress of a home at some time. She would learn better methods of cookery.  When she would be taught those things, and given a knowledge of different fires and stoves, her ideas would definitely become modernised. In time she would make an effort to branch out and use a different range in her home to supplement the old open fire.  Much could be done in that <Col N="618" /> way to instruct the average young woman in domestic economy and better methods of housekeeping.</P>
    <P>I would like to see that sort of thing brought into the rural areas.  Take the locality from which I come.  The nearest vocational school is 12 or 14 miles away.  It is impossible for anybody who has a leaning towards any type of training that can be acquired in the vocational school to get there&mdash; even to go to a day school, not to speak of going to a night school.</P>
    <P>One thing that has influenced me in taking part in this debate is a carpentry class that has started in my locality.  It amazed me when I went there a few nights ago to see the crowd of young men, and even men up to 45 and 50 years, eager and willing to handle saws, planes, spokeshaves and chisels and the other implements which a carpenter uses.  They were all anxious to get some knowledge of a trade that would be useful to them on the farm and around the house.</P>
    <P>While we all agree that what is learned in a vocational school may not be as good as practical training in a workshop, we realise that the knowledge gained in the school is very valuable.  A man, for instance, may be anxious to learn something about mechanics.  I do not suppose he would reach the standard of the average mechanic in a garage, but yet the vocational school training would help him along.  The same would apply to the carpentry trade.  In the school the young boys and men acquire a knowledge which is very valuable in the home.  They get hints which are of great value to them in later life.  In the technical schools boys and girls get a knowledge of book-keeping and other subjects, and these things have their uses.</P>
    <P>There should be more vocational schools established.  We are not old enough as a nation to say that we can advance all our branches of education. There may be an outcry if too much were spent on vocational education. But there is an old saying which should be remembered.  I think it was Abraham Lincoln who said that anybody who empties his purse into his <Col N="619" /> head makes the best investment of all. Any system of education, primary or vocational, is definitely welcome.  I welcome vocational education above all because it has various uses and it helps to make the handyman handier.  It enables many people to put pounds into their pockets, to carry out little repairs that otherwise would cost them a lot of money.</P>
    <P>There is one thing in the Bill with which I do not agree.  I refer to Section 6 (2) (b), which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No person shall be paid expenses under this sub-section in respect of a meeting held at a place less than five miles by any route from his residence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that provision is unfair.  Take the average official of a county council or other local authority.  If he travels he gets expenses.  When road engineers inspect roads they get paid from the moment they start on their travels.  The same should apply to instructors, vocational or otherwise, who have to travel around.  They should be treated the same as other persons who go five miles or over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important education of all is the education given in the vocational schools.  The education given in the vocational schools in my part of the country is of great value to the pupils.  If there is any falling away from the attendance in the vocational schools, I am afraid the parents are responsible.  I am sorry to say that parents set very little value on educating their children.  I do not know if other Deputies will subscribe to that.  In my constituency we have a first-class technical school or vocational school in the town of Ferbane and another in the village of Shinrone. We have a splendid modern school in Tullamore and another in Portlaoighise. We have schools also in the villages of Clonaslee and Arles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised when I made inquiries in my constituency about the attendances at the technical schools. The Government have provided those schools and they have done everything possible to assist in completing the <Col N="620" /> education of the young people, preparing them for the long, serious battle of life.  I am sorry to say that when the boys and girls leave the national school &mdash;as I did a few years ago&mdash;they have not sense enough to be able to select a vocation to follow, whether it be woodwork or engineering or any other occupation, and so be in a position to get a solid grinding in the local vocational school.  The pupils have not the sense at the time to realise the importance of this.  That is where the parents should come in.  They should insist on the children attending these schools.</P>
    <P>In my part of the country we have excellent staffs in the schools.  I am sure other Deputies could say the same for their areas.  There is neglect on the part of the parents to use their influence so as to get their children to attend those vocational schools.  The national school is undoubtedly the poor man's university and the school teacher is the poor man's professor.</P>
    <P>The education the children acquire in the national schools is of very little value to them.  Let us take the subject of Irish.  A great deal of attention has been devoted to Irish in all our schools. It is very unfair that fabulous sums should be provided for the purpose of making good Irish speakers out of our boys and girls.</P>
    <P>The fact is that as soon as they have the fáinne they are faced with the emigrant ship.  They cannot earn a loaf of bread at home.  They are denied the right of employment here, the right of existence in their own land. The Government spend huge sums trying to make Irish speakers and good citizens out of them.  Of what use is the money the Government have placed at the disposal of teachers and various committees in order to establish courses for advancing the Irish language? It would be much better if less money was provided for such nonsense and if we put an end to this squandermania. That is the way I look at it.</P>
    <P>The Government should provide much more money than has been provided in the past for vocational training. I think it is a downright disgrace to see thousands of pounds spent trying to make Irish speakers out of the children and, as soon as they have got a thorough knowledge of Irish, when <Col N="621" /> they look for some employment, there is not a day's work to be had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the Minister an opportunity of making a speech if he has only the manners to listen to me.  I think that the money being provided could be spent in a manner which would give much better results. Technical schools serve a very good purpose because they provide a training for whatever vocation those young people propose to follow.  As Deputy Heskin ably pointed out, lectures in agriculture are given in these schools but not to the extent we should like in an agricultural country.  I attended some of those lectures and I know that young people are anxious to get an opportunity of attending them.  But the lectures are not available.  These lectures on agriculture should be delivered more frequently and there should be insistence upon attendance at them.  I hope I am not going outside the scope of the debate when I say that, if I were Minister for Education, I should make it compulsory on every citizen to attend a vocational school.  I think that the day will come when the Government will have to compel the people to attend vocational schools.  There would be fewer slackers and idlers if people were made to attend woodwork and engineering classes, which would be of some benefit to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Heskin ably pointed out, the vast majority of our young girls are unable to serve a suitable meal.  I am afraid, speaking as a young man, that a lot of young men are going to get a hell of a &ldquo;stick&rdquo; when they select wives and find themselves awkwardly situated.  The vast majority of our young girls to-day&mdash;and I am in a position to speak with authority on it&mdash;are absolutely useless around the house.  The reason is that they have got no training.  I am referring to the girls in the towns and not in the rural districts, because the girls in the country districts follow the good example given by their parents.  A farmer's wife will, certainly, give her <Col N="622" /> daughter a very good training but, when you come to the towns, where the larger population is, instead of girls sacrificing recreation in order to attend domestic instruction classes, you see them clearing off to dances, pictures and other amusements.  I suppose that is in accord with the times but some steps should be taken to set matters right in the interest of the nation.  The young men and women of to-day will be the important people of to-morrow and I think the day will come when a Government will have to make it obligatory on our people to attend vocational schools. Very valuable work has been done in the past and I hope it will continue. Vocational schools have been of great help in preparing young people for life in the world.  Many more teachers should be appointed.  We have not half enough manual instructors.  Money spent in giving assistance to our young people is well spent.  In part of my constituency, we have had appeals for a woodwork class during the winter, and I am sorry to say that no appointments of manual instructors have been made.  Where you have young people anxious to learn, every assistance should be given them by the vocational committees and by the Government. That is most important in the case of engineering and carpentry classes and in the case of lectures on agriculture. The Government should take every step to satisfy such demands, because any money spent on education is well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose most Deputies who have spoken have supported the vocational education system.  As one who attended a vocational school, I must say that it has its advantages and disadvantages. Take a young lad who leaves school at 15 or 16 years of age.  Most parents who are desirous of giving their children a sound national school education insist on their continuing at school until they are 15 years of age and, in some cases, 16 years.  He is then sent to a vocational school where he learns carpentry or joinery or smithy work or some other trade.  Let us assume that he spends two or three years at a vocational school and that <Col N="623" /> he has acquired a certain knowledge. Does he gain anything when he comes to serve his apprenticeship?  Is any allowance made for the knowledge he has acquired?  Does his employer give him any consideration, in the form of remuneration, for that knowledge to gain which he cycled in and out in the wet and cold to the vocational school? I understand that there is no acknowledgment by way of remuneration for such knowledge.  It will hardly be argued by anybody who served his time to the joinery trade that, after six months' training, a young man is not of certain assistance to his employer, even though he is serving his apprenticeship.  But we find that he has got to pay a fee in some cases to be apprenticed to the joinery or carpentry trade or to smithy work or any of those other trades taken up by young men in rural Ireland.  That young man may have made every effort to acquire the knowledge placed at his disposal by the instructor in the vocational school. He may be as efficient as the young man who has served three years with the master in the workshop.  But if he wishes to take up a joinery job on a housing scheme, he is prohibited by the trade union and he will not be allowed into the trade union movement unless he is able to present his papers.  The young man puts himself the question: &ldquo;What have I to gain; am I not as well to go off and serve my time as to serve two or three years in a vocational school and then find that I have to do the same period over again in a workshop as part of the period of five years which is the recognised period for apprenticeship. I will not be admitted into the union because I have not gone through the process of apprenticeship.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain amount of discouragement and the young men are not very interested in vocational education. Mayo Deputies know that there is a vocational school in Ballyhaunis. I have been told that the number attending there is very small.  It is a fine modern building and we are entitled to ask why it is that in a thickly populated rural area such as Ballyhaunis that should be the <Col N="624" /> case.  I am convinced that it is due to matters I have mentioned.  Some time ago I wrote to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and was informed that my letter was passed on to the Department of Education, in relation to a young man who was over in England.  Like myself he spent a few years there and he noticed that the young men who leave this country, through no fault of their own, and seek a livelihood in Great Britain or America are very anxious to secure a better type of employment than hod-carrying, sewerage cleaning or other heavy work involving sweat and labour.  One can hardly blame them.  They are very well brought up young men of respectable families.  They are seeking the best possible type of employment but they have not the trade and even if they have been to a vocational school they cannot get into the union there, because, as is the position here, the union will not recognise them, irrespective of their qualifications, unless they have a bit of influence and can get in on false pretences, which does happen with unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to relate that to the value of vocational education, and I am putting it forward as a possible reason why there is such a small attendance at our vocational schools.  The question is whether the money which is being spent on vocational education is a paying proposition and what benefits we are getting for that money.  That is the reason why I mention that.  He wrote to the Department because he was interested in having some idea of brick-building and plastering imparted to the young men because brick-building and plastering are very important to-day in view of the housing problem in Great Britain and this country.  All he wanted was the raw material, the bricks, and he was refused the bricks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He told me that, for demonstration purposes, he had used mortar which could always be reused and put through the same process again, showing the young men how to lay bricks and how to plaster.  That was refused <Col N="625" /> on the grounds that, no matter what knowledge a young man would acquire, let him be the best bricklayer in the world, he would get no employment because the unions here would object.  Because of that I cannot see much benefit to be derived from these classes except that the young man would have the benefit of that knowledge for work in his own house.  He might be able to repair a gate or a door or replace a window, and that kind of thing, but so far as providing him with a qualification for employment, it would be of no use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that, but I am trying to point out that for the money spent on vocational education there is no return and that the young man who attends the vocational school has no outlet for the knowledge he acquires there.  That means that the money is spent badly and that the knowledge acquired will eventually be lost over a period of years.  Let him be the best joiner in the world, if he does not get practice he will lose his skill.  The same applies to domestic economy or anything else.  We have not the openings.  If we are to advance vocational education there should be openings for those young men and women.  Every young girl should get the advantage of training in domestic economy but when it comes to the question of a trade, I feel the reason for the small attendance at vocational schools is the fact that the youth can see no benefit to be derived from attendance.  In England, no matter what factory a man may be in, the employer insists on his going to the vocational school at night and pays the man to go and provides the time, so many days in the week or so many nights.  Is that done here at the moment?  I understand that a boy cannot go into a garage unless he has attended for a year or two at a vocational school but whether the employer gives any consideration for the knowledge so acquired, or not, I do not <Col N="626" /> know but I feel that there is no remuneration or consideration for that knowledge.</P>
      <P>That boy has acquired as much knowledge as he would acquire by spending six months in the garage, workshop or factory, at his trade.  He has learned how to handle tools and to sharpen saws.  Otherwise it would take him six months to acquire that knowledge and before the boss who had any respect for his tools would allow him to handle them.  Yet, notwithstanding that he has acquired that knowledge, there is no consideration or remuneration for it but he is expected in many instances to pay a fee.  That is my experience and I understand that continues in many places throughout Ireland even where boys have spent a period at the vocational school.</P>

They were all designed to be helpful in making the work even more successful than it is.  A good many Deputies seemed to feel that substantial progress has been achieved with the schemes, that they are doing good work and that the expenditure is worth while.  I think if I had come to ask for more than I was asking in this Bill Deputies would have been satisfied to give it, but we are proceeding on the basis of imposing as little as possible upon the ratepayers and, incidentally, upon the taxpayers. The emergency situation threw a heavy burden upon the schemes.  Some committees, as I have said in my opening statement, found it very difficult to carry on and, in spite of the additional penny that we gave them a few years ago, we now find we shall have to give them some additional aid.  It is probable that the whole matter will have to be reviewed in connection with whatever decision is being arrived at <Col N="627" /> on the question of the raising of the school-leaving age.  If the school-leaving age be raised, the manner in which that is to be brought about will affect vocational education and the financing of the schemes.</P>
      <P>I think Deputies will admit that advantage is not being taken generally of the facilities that certainly are available and I feel very much inclined to point out, particularly to Deputy Heskin, that he could do a great deal in his own constituency, if he really believes, as he seems to believe, in the value of the scheme.  Deputies who have personal knowledge of the work of the vocational schools, particularly in rural areas, are prepared to testify to the work that has been done.</P>
      <P>I would ask them, then, to try to get the farming community to realise the value of the schools.  It will strike Deputies as being an extraordinary state of affairs&mdash;and it is extraordinary &mdash;that in rural areas children are kept away from schools where instruction in shorthand and typewriting is not being provided.  Of course, it is felt that that is an avenue towards employment but the whole trend and bias of the schemes, in so far as I can influence them or the Department can do so, is to encourage instruction in rural crafts and aspects of the work that have a particular bearing upon country life. But, if the local people do not take advantage of these facilities when they are made available, and at pretty substantial cost, and if they refuse to encourage the rural bias that so many Deputies are interested in, and the teaching of domestic economy, by sending their children to these schools, what can we do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that, in the ordinary vocational schools, the education that is being given is superior to that in any rural part of any country in the world, I venture to say.  You have four teachers there&mdash;the manual instructor, the rural science instructor, the domestic economy instructress and the teacher of Irish and general subjects. These teachers are being paid salaries ranging from £200 to £250&mdash; perhaps somewhat less in the case of the instructress&mdash;and there are the <Col N="628" /> running costs of the school, the cost of materials and so on.  If we were to try to provide the type of education that we are giving in these vocational schools in every parish in the country, the cost would run into millions.</P>
    <P>I hope that, if the emergency was the reason why full advantage was not taken of the courses provided, there will no longer be any excuse.  Even those Deputies who are not members of committees or directly associated with the work, might try to get their constituents to appreciate the education that is being given, particularly for those who have to remain at home. Our inspectors tell me that in the farming mind the idea of education&mdash; giving the person who has to remain at home as good an education as those who go outside and look for positions in some other way&mdash;is making only slow progress.</P>
    <P>We have yet to get away from the idea that the stupid member of the family must be left on the farm or, if he is not stupid, even if he is considered the most intelligent member of the family, then that such attention need not be given to his education as to those who go away.  It is even said, and I think it is not very far wrong, that in rural areas the idea has been that the school is to prepare young people for life in the town.  It is not realised that the object of these vocational schools&mdash;of which we have 100 or so and I hope we shall have another 100&mdash;is to try to improve those attending them even in the art of living, even in the way of doing things for themselves on their own land, to learn something about the scientific principles of agriculture, to learn how to use and repair machinery on the farm.  Surely all these things would be of value, but the fact to-day is that advantage is not being taken of the facilities.  They are costly and if we are to provide teachers in all these practical subjects, we must pay them accordingly and the classes are limited. In the ordinary practical class you cannot go very much beyond 20 in number and, therefore, the cost per hour, having regard to the cost of materials and so on, is much higher. Again, the classes are entirely voluntary. <Col N="629" /> The question of making attendance at vocational schools compulsory raises a very big question which we will be coming to another time.  At present, the farming community have not been sending their children regularly to school during the emergency in a great many areas, owing to the claims of agricultural and turf work&mdash;and the vocational schools have suffered even more.  These seasonal demands that are made for additional labour at home may have a good reason behind them but the point is that specialised instruction by highly qualified&mdash;and I suppose I may be excused for saying well paid&mdash;teachers results in the general cost per pupil working out at a fairly substantial figure.  That is a thing that should be borne in mind by those for whom the facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>Another factor which makes vocational education costly is that after a year, perhaps in the second year and very often before the second year is finished, the pupil has an opportunity of getting employment and leaves fairly early in the session.  That adds to the cost.  If you get the maximum number of pupils at the particular centre and can keep them for the full length of the two-year or three-year course&mdash; preferably the three-year course&mdash;then you get the maximum result, not alone from the pupils' point of view, as they get the best value from the courses, but you get the most economical results from the staff of teachers.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the committees to utilise the teaching power to the best of their capacity.  We do not interfere with that, we try to advise them as to where they are going to place their schools.  If they are guided by the chief executive officer and if he understands his duty, he ought to be able to distribute his staff to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the addition of a room to the national school would be more satisfactory.  Those who are closely acquainted with primary education will realise, however, that the numbers in our rural schools are going down very much indeed.  A school which had four teachers 30 or <Col N="630" /> 40 years ago has only two now.  That means that in the upper classes you have only a handful of pupils, and in such cases it would not be practicable to provide facilities even on a much less expensive scale than the provision of a new room.  When I inquired into this matter some years ago I was advised by an architect of some experience that it might be done for about £1,000, but even in the last two years building costs have gone up a good deal.  I find it much harder to get work done now in connection with school buildings than it was two years ago, and for some time to come it may be still more difficult.  I do not believe we would get the extra room, particularly if you are going to attempt what is perhaps impossible&mdash;to have a room where the teaching of both domestic economy and manual instruction or metal work can be carried on alternately&mdash;at anything like that figure now.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday afternoon Deputy Commons and myself addressed the following question to the Minister for Lands:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he is aware that the farm, containing 207 acres, situated at Cottage, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo (More O'Ferrall estate), the property of Hubert Treston, was put up for sale by public auction on 16th October, 1946, if he will state whether this land was sold; if so, the name of the purchaser, and also whether he will take steps to acquire same immediately for the relief of local congestion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am aware that this farm was put up for sale last month and I understand from Press reports that it has been sold to a solicitor in <Col N="631" /> trust for a client.  Following upon previous questions by the Deputy and by Deputy Commons in May last, the Land Commission had noted this case for inquiry in due course as is their usual practice; but it is not their practice to interfere with public auctions, nor do they propose to be moved by agitations and intimidation of the type which has developed in this case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A similar question, in relation to the same holding, was addressed to the Minister for Lands on the 28th May last.  The reference is Vol. 101, column 884 of the Dáil debates.  The following is the question and the Minister's reply:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Cafferky asked the Minister for Lands if it is the intention of his Department to acquire for distribution among the local congested tenants the lands formerly held by the late James Tristan on the More O'Ferrall estate at Logboy, Ballyhaunis.</P>
    <P>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan): The question appears to relate to the lands of Cottage, County Mayo, owned by the representatives of James Tristan, deceased.  The Land Commission have no proceedings for acquisition in this case, but a note has been taken of the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We received that reply on the 28th May last.  The Minister, in his reply to the question that was asked yesterday, gave us to understand that it is the practice of the Land Commission in matters like this always to move expeditiously.  Yet, notwithstanding the fact that this was brought to his notice last May, we find that, as far as we are aware, no move has been made as far as the Land Commission is concerned or as far as the Minister is able to tell us, unless it has been made within the last few days.  This holding of land consists of 207 acres.  It has been untenanted.  The present owner does not live there.  I understand he is a Professor in the University in Cork.  This land has been worked, grazed and cultivated in conacre by the tenants.  Without it the tenants could hardly survive.  They would have to close their doors and go away. <Col N="632" /> These 207 acres are part of the More O'Ferrall estate.  If these tenants had not worked and cultivated that land during the war we would have had no food production out of it unless the Land Commission had stepped in, as they did elsewhere, under a compulsory tillage Order.  But due to the good husbandry of the local tenants and their desire to cultivate and use this land for the benefit of the people, a thing that they have been doing during the past 20 years and upwards, they have kept this land with a &ldquo;body&rdquo; in it.  One would expect that, as it is surrounded by small tenant farmers, some of them with valuations of 30/- and even lower, an agitation would have broken there many years ago.  When Fianna Fáil was at the height of their glory, telling the people &ldquo;the bullock for the road and the land for the farmer&rdquo; one would have expected that these tenants would have taken advantage of a new Party coming forward looking for power and would have picked up with that Party and started an agitation. But they did not do so because they were law-abiding citizens and did not desire to trespass on their neighbour, notwithstanding the fact that, by holding on to the land, he was so to speak depriving them of their livelihood, and notwithstanding the fact that they were paying heavy rent for the conacre that they got.  Yet they never made one move until it was well known to the tenants that he was about to dispose of his holding, when they believed that they were justified and right.</P>
    <P>They asked their representatives to make representations to the Minister and to the Department of Lands, and that we did in a constitutional way. We were given to understand by the Minister on the 28th May, 1946, that he would note the matter that was brought to his notice in this House and would bring it to the notice of his Department, and to his commissioners in the Land Commission to take steps to acquire this land for the tenants. That the Minister did not do.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Hubert Treston put this up for sale Deputy Commons and myself took the responsibility of <Col N="633" /> visiting the Minister's Department.  I called specially to see if I could meet the Minister and was given to understand by the Minister's private secretary that the Minister was on sick leave at that time.  I met his private secretary and I was brought to see other officials in the Department.  I consulted with them and informed them of the advisability of taking steps to acquire this land and not allow anyone to purchase it.  I say that notwithstanding the fact that the Minister will tell me to-night that whether anyone has purchased it or not the Land Commission has still the power to acquire it.  I know very well that the Land Commission would be very reluctant to acquire land from a new purchaser, from the man who bought this holding of land.  That shows that the Land Commission had not inspected it beforehand.  If they had they would naturally have notified the purchaser that if he did purchase it he would know that at any moment the Land Commission could step in and take it. If this land is now sold, as it is supposed to be, the tenants of that area have lost their only opportunity, their only chance of solving the problem of congestion unless they are taken out of that particular area and migrated to the Midlands.  There is no need for me to tell the Minister what it is going to cost to move those tenants to the Midlands.  It is going to cost some thousands of pounds.  They are going to be taken away from their environment, from the locality and the county that they love so much and are going to be placed perhaps among hostile neighbours, placed on land in a locality where there are landless men who will rightly feel that they have just as much right to that land as any men from County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the men from Mayo, when migrated, may have to receive police protection.  Yet, on this very doorstep in the middle of the townland of the parish of Bekan, we find this farm of 207 acres being offered for sale by Mr. Hubert Treston.  Due notice of the circumstances was given to the Minister, almost a year's notice, but we find that due to laziness or for some other reason, he has failed to bring to the <Col N="634" /> notice of his Department or of his officials concerned, the necessity for acquiring, inspecting and revaluing this land with the intention of taking it over when the opportunity would arise.</P>
    <P>The tenants in that locality have been told that the land was in the hands of the Land Commission and that they had no need to fear.  They were told that the Land Commission would see that their problems would be solved.  I cannot see how their problems can be solved now, and I should like to hear whether the Minister is prepared to acquire the farm from the gentleman who has bought it.  I am, personally, of the opinion that he is very reluctant to do so and I do not believe that he will do so, if this gentleman who has acquired it will work and cultivate the land in accordance with the policy laid down by the Government.  I am not out to deprive any man, irrespective of race or creed, of his right to acquire and cultivate any land, provided the exercise of that right does not militate against the superior interests of the tenants in the locality wherein the land is situated.  I feel that the tenants have a superior right to any individual or group of individuals, a right far before that of any man, no matter what his connections may be or what foundations he may have.  I maintain that in a congested area such as this the tenants should first receive the sympathetic consideration of the Minister.  That has not happened in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell me that neither he nor the Land Commission will be intimidated by an agitation such as has now taken place in that area.  That may be so.  This State may be capable of expending out of the funds which the taxpayer has subscribed a sufficient amount of money annually to maintain a large police force such as there is in the locality at the moment, a police force which is doing very much the same thing as was done in the days of the land agitation 50 years ago&mdash;protecting the grabber and suppressing the moral rights of the tenants, whatever about the legal aspect of it.  It is all very well to draw up legal codes, but legal <Col N="635" /> codes should bear some relation to recognised standards of morality and to the rights of tenants in cases such as this.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that Deputy Commons and Deputy Cafferky are setting a very bad precedent in encouraging the tenants to do what they have done in this case.  I want to tell the Minister that neither Deputy Commons nor myself in any way regret anything we have done or any steps we have taken to maintain the rights of the tenants.  We have acted constitutionally; we have acted strictly in accordance with the law.  We have done our utmost to bring home to the Minister the necessity of acquiring this land. Seeing that constitutional means have failed, seeing that it was impossible to persuade the Minister to acquire this land and divide it amongst the tenants, seeing that he was far more interested in defending the man who purchased the land than in the rights of the tenants in that area, is it any wonder that the people are losing faith in constitutional means?  The Minister may tell us that he believes in the principle of free sale.  It may be alleged that we are against free sale.  We are not.  I am as much in favour of the principle of free sale as any man, but we do object to any man coming in from an outside district, or even a man in the same locality, purchasing a large holding such as this in the midst of congested areas where the tenants are clamouring for that land, especially having regard to the fact that these tenants worked and cultivated this farm during the emergency when the production of food was so necessary.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the gentleman who sold this farm would have cultivated it as these tenants did during the days when food production was so necessary.  I can assure the Minister that if he thinks he will defeat the tenants of the locality, in which this agitation has taken place, his efforts will have the same fate as those of the Black and Tans in the case of the Ballinavilla estate across the river, efforts which were later carried on by the Gárda under the Fine Gael Government and, subsequently, under the Fianna Fáil Government.  The tenants <Col N="636" /> were maltreated, people were kicked and women's arms were broken, but notwithstanding all that, the tenants fought on and won eventually.  The tenants in this case will fight on and win also.  I want to say that the tenants are law-abiding citizens, but the Minister by his reactionary policy as head of the Department and by his laziness or reluctance to take the necessary steps to have this land acquired for the tenants, has compelled the tenants to do what they are doing now and has compelled their public representatives to stand by them.  We shall continue to do so until the Minister is finally compelled to acquire and allocate this land amongst the congests in the locality.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday, 29th May, 1946, as reported in column 1035 of the Dáil debates, I addressed the following question to the Minister for Lands:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he is aware that about 40 tenants in the townlands of Gorrane, Johnstown and Lavellyroe, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, More O'Ferrall estate, are living on uneconomic holdings, the average of the valuations being £5; if he is further aware that 450 acres of land, the property of Hubert Treston, The Cottage, Ballyhaunis, have been untenanted for a number of years and if he will consider acquiring same for the relief of these tenants.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I received the following reply from the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Deputy's question appears to refer to the lands of Cottage owned by the representatives of James Treston, deceased.  The Land Commission have no proceedings for the acquisition of these lands but the Deputy's representations have been noted for consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that question was put down, a week following a similar question by Deputy Cafferky, we thought that the Land Commission would have taken <Col N="637" /> some action in this matter.  You can imagine our surprise when we were notified by the people in this locality that this farm was being put up for public auction on the 16th October. Immediately on receiving that notification, I wrote to the Land Commission. I wrote on Friday, September 20th, and on Monday, September 23rd, I wrote a personal letter to the Minister and telephoned to the Office of the Land Commission in Merrion Street.  I explained the situation to them and how necessary it was that this land should be taken over for the relief of the tenants.  On Friday, September 27th, I tried to get in touch with the Minister by telephone from Balla, County Mayo.  I was informed he was on sick leave.  I spoke to his private secretary who said he would place the matter before the Minister and acquaint him of the facts.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that, the land was put up for auction and sold to a gentleman who could afford to pay £2,500 for it, even though there were 40 tenants in the locality with valuations ranging from 30/- to £6 5s. 0d. These tenants lived in a circle completely surrounding this farm, none of them more than 700 yards from the land, but their interests were sacrificed so that the man with the money could come in and buy the land.  This happened notwithstanding the fact that in the debate on the Vote for Lands on Thursday, 11th April, the Minister, as reported in Volume 100, columns 1882-3, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is right that that security of tenure should be perpetuated and that a man should be able to go into the market and sell the farm which is his own&mdash;if he cannot do that, there is no security of tenure&mdash;irrespective of the size of the farm and irrespective of where it is.  But there is, as we know, a certain amount of land speculation and the Dáil will have to make up its mind.  The representatives of the people will have to decide how far such a scheme of things can be approved and how far such a scheme of things can be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where individuals have bought ten, 12 or 15 farms, and it has been argued to me, and it is <Col N="638" /> true, that those people are working them perfectly, and to the fullest extent.  I hold the personal view that, even so, it is wrong that that land should be permitted to accumulate to that extent in the hands of individuals.  The man who has purchased 15 farms because as a result of activities in another sphere he has been able to accumulate their price has brought about what I consider to be economic eviction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What a great change there has been since the Minister made that statement ! If he did not approve of that then, why did he not introduce some measure, in his capacity as Minister for Lands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister not ask the Dáil for permission to stop speculative buying?

      <P>I had the idea that matters are raised on the adjournment because of the inadequacy of the answer given to a question on the Order Paper. It seems to me that on the question asked yesterday by Deputy Cafferky I gave him the fullest information and a complete answer. Deputy Commons has quoted a statement of mine from the Dáil debates. Everything I said then I still believe. I believe it is not only a correct and true statement of Government policy but one which will have the approval of every decent-minded man in the country.  If a man has a farm and is not permitted to sell it in the public market, then there is no security of tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky mentions the fact that, on 28th May, a question was <Col N="639" /> raised about this farm for the first time.  He says that owing to the laziness, incompetence and weakmindedness of the Minister no action was taken in regard to the matter raised by him in the question.  The farm was sold, I understand, in October.  In July the Land Commission asked their inspectors in Mayo to make a preliminary report on the farm concerned&mdash;five or six weeks after the question was put down.  Neither the Land Commission nor any other Department of State can drop all the work it has to do and immediately set out to obtain information or take particular action because a Deputy has asked a question in the House.  Because that question was asked in the House and because representations were made, within a few short weeks the Land Commission asked for and received a preliminary report in regard to this farm.  I know that there is congestion, and bad congestion, in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">

      <P>It is the main purpose of the Land Commission to try to do away with congestion and to relieve it everywhere, but the Deputy would <Col N="640" /> need to remember one thing: the congest is generally a poor man, poor in this world's goods, and, above all, for the poor man the only protection and only help is the law.  When the Deputy urges that the law should be broken, he is not helping the poor man; he is hurting him.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission, in deference to public opinion expressed in this House, made a preliminary examination of the farm concerned. A preliminary examination, particularly in congested areas, is the first step towards the acquisition of the land for the relief of congestion. The Land Commission was not permitted to operate in the normal way in regard to the land in County Mayo. That will not prevent the Land Commission from doing its duty to the poor people who live in the county. Deputy Cafferky has rightly anticipated my statement and I say definitely that no Deputy and no man from Mayo will intimidate the Land Commission or me.</P>
