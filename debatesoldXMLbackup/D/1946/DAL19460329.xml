      <P>I had not intended. When I moved to report progress last evening I had been explaining to the House the new section which it is proposed to insert before Section 21.  On reconstruction, as between the original <Col N="876" /> Section 21 and Section 19, we have set out in the new Section 21 provision for dealing with verminous conditions as such.  In that way we propose to provide in the Statute the facilities and the powers in relation to verminous conditions that were vested in the Minister formerly under his powers to make regulations.  There has been on this question of vermin, and the provision it is proposed making to deal with it, a good deal of misunderstanding, to put it at its best.  I leave it at that.  That misunderstanding might be set out under two headings, (1) as to the powers we possess in relation to it at the present time, and (2) as to the seriousness of that particular problem from the public health point of view.  Again, adverting to Section 148 of the Public Health Act, 1878, the Minister is given power from time to time to make, alter and revoke such regulations as may to him seem fit, with a view to the treatment of infectious diseases, the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, and so on, and, under that power, from time to time regulations have been made, in particular in regard to typhus fever to deal with the matter of disinfestation, and under the regulations that have been mentioned more than once in the course of the debate on this Bill, provision is made for the compulsory removal of contacts, and for the compulsory disinfestation of themselves and their clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are things that might be said in relation to this problem that one would prefer not to say, and that I believe it ought not to be necessary to say.  Consequently, I feel that on this subject I must speak with a certain amount of restraint.  I will tell you why.  I do not want to offer material to critics of our people, particularly, those outside this State, who would like to refer to us as the dirty Irish.  We are as clean, perhaps, as our neighbours but, at any rate, there is information at my disposal of a reliable and convincing character that this is a problem that must be faced, and must be faced with the determination to try to solve it.  As to whether this is the best way of doing that, we can afford to have difference of opinion, but it is intended to be a sincere and earnest effort <Col N="877" /> deal with that difficult and delicate problem.  Let me at this point make this offer.  If any Deputy belonging to any Party has any doubt as to the extent of this problem, I would very much welcome an opportunity of placing certain confidential evidence at his disposal that I should not like to place on public record.  The knowledge of this problem comes to me from two sources&mdash;the reports of our school medical officers and our experience in the running of a health embarkation scheme under which people who propose to secure employment in a neighbouring country have to be medically examined and certified as being in a cleanly and healthy condition.  By the very nature of things, school medical reports on this matter are not entirely reliable and they do not in fact give a true reflection of the position.  The reason again is clear enough.  We have not any powers of compulsory examination of school children at the present time, and we are advised by our county medical officers of health that on the day of the medical inspection a big proportion of the most highly infested children do not present themselves for examination.</P>
    <P>If that is in fact the position, the reports of our school medical officers in the matter of infestation do not give us a true picture of the degree and extent of infestation.  It is a somewhat different matter in the health embarkation scheme because there is no evasion there.  I have been receiving monthly reports from the medical officer in charge of that scheme for a number of years and the reports have conveyed to me that this is a very serious matter indeed and that it is one that the responsible Minister must tackle and endeavour to solve.</P>
    <P>Coming away from the question of personal hygiene and the facts that the enemies of our people would like to seize on to humiliate us, let us briefly examine the matter purely from the public health point of view.  Let me remind the House that in the proposed new section placed before them, in response to the representations that were made to me in the House and outside of it, and in the realisation that from the public health point of view there was <Col N="878" /> only a certain limited set of vermin that caused us serious concern, the restrictions that we are imposing and the powers that we are taking relate only to the three types of lice that are set out in the amendment.  We need not mind about their high-sounding description, a louse is a louse for all that.  There are three classes of lice there with which we are all familiar&mdash; the head louse, the body louse and the other &ldquo;boy&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>As a medical man I would be familiar with them, apart from any other knowledge but I think we have seen the varieties of them that walk about, at any rate, even those of us who have been brought up under the most sheltered conditions.  There are two infectious diseases immediately associated with the species of lice that are referred to in this section.  There is the disease called impetigo contagioso&mdash;a very high-sounding name&mdash; but you have seen children with that terrible condition of the scalp&mdash;scabs and running sores.  You have seen children bring those sores out all over their bodies.  You have seen it. You have observed some of the physical consequences of it.  You cannot have been blind, even as laymen.  How are we to remedy that if we do not get rid of the louse?  There is the other more serious and deadly and dreadful disease, the disease of typhus.  It may be difficult, I am sure it is, for laymen to grasp the full significance of these matters, but no medical man living, whether he belongs to the small minority of cranks who were mentioned in this House last night, or to any other section of medical thought, no medical man who ever got his degrees will challenge the statement that the louse, and the louse alone, is the cause of typhus fever in this country. Consequently we find ourselves in this position.  If we can plan to eliminate the louse we, at any rate, remove one threat and danger that hangs over our people.  There is no question about it. If we eliminate lice, we are finished <Col N="879" /> with typhus fever in this country.  In many civilised countries typhus fever has already disappeared, but it has not disappeared here.  Do not let Deputies tell me that we only have an occasional case of typhus fever in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume you will; I wish you would not.  So long as typhus fever is even endemic in this country, so long is there a potential danger hanging over our people if they remain infested.  I may be told that we only have had occasional outbreaks.  Thanks be to God; the Almighty has been very good to us if we have not had devastating outbreaks, because all the setting is there.  Deputies may think that, because we have not had these devastating outbreaks of typhus fever, there is not any real danger or any well-founded cause for apprehension.  I wish they were right; I dearly wish that that were the position.  But, as certain as I am addressing this House, it is not the position and I have a definite responsibility in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always tried my best when dealing with scientific or semi-scientific subjects, to put things as clearly to the layman as it is possible to put them. In relation to this typhus fever business&mdash;and the louse is the vector&mdash;it is an acknowledged scientific fact that persons living in an endemic area who have acquired a substantial degree of natural immunity but who are infested and who go to another area where the soil is virgin and deposit their lice there, without anybody knowing that these persons ever have had typhus fever or without their knowing it themselves, can initiate an outbreak.  It has happened. We have, fortunately, through the excellent organisation of our public health services, been able to control the various outbreaks of typhus fever which have taken place in this country in recent years.  Will I be asked to wait before taking precautions to eliminate one, at any rate, from the public health problems that we can eliminate; or will I be given power to do what some Deputies pleaded with <Col N="880" /> me to do during the course of this debate, to try to prevent disease rather than wait until disease is contracted and then try to cure it?</P>
    <P>This is essentially a preventive measure.  It is true that in 1944 we had only nine cases of typhus fever and only one death.  Does it matter if we have escaped with nine cases, that we have brought that dreadful disease about nine households and that only one person died?  Is it something to disregard?  We are particularly vulnerable at the present time because of the degree of infestation and because there are many people returning to this country who have been out of it for some years and who have been in typhus areas outside this country.  I can solemnly assure you that those whose responsibility it is to safeguard the health of the community are concerned and are anxious.</P>
    <P>About January, 1944, I personally discussed this matter at a conference of county medical officers of health.  That is very recent history. They were as anxious about it as I was.  But we were in this position: we saw no remedy for it.  The older methods of disinfestation were tedious, costly and unsatisfactory, and the particular preparations that had a certain reputation as to their effectiveness were not available.  We talked about it; we sympathised with one another; it was about all we could do.  But medical science has, even in that short period, come to our rescue and now we are in the position that we can remove this infestation from the most highly infested human being in this country in a matter of hours.  We would be wanting in our duty, having got that remedy, if we failed to avail of that remedy and to place that remedy at the disposal of our people and say: &ldquo;You can rid yourselves of this infestation in a matter of hours.  It is your bounden duty to your family and to your neighbours that you should do it&rdquo;?  I think it is reasonable.  I think I ought to get the support of this House, I think I ought to get the support of any enlightened community in trying to bring about that condition that is so easily brought about.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might develop a point that <Col N="881" /> must be obvious in this type of debate. I am sure it is necessary, because one does not know in advance whether his statement will be subjected to carping criticism or whether people will be merely looking for information with the fixed and only purpose of trying to help in achieving a desirable objective. But do not tell me again that we are going to keep people at home from Mass.  Do not tell me again that the right of freedom of worship is going to be interfered with.  Do not tell me that we are interfering here with the right of the parent to send his children to schoolor to Mass or himself to go about freely and gaily in an infested condition. All those arguments would have force and weight if the remedy were not at hand.  In advance of that type of criticism and in the hope that it will not again be pursued in this House, I want to emphasise that the remedy is there and that it is certain.  To the layman, its results would appear to be miraculous.  We are taking steps to ensure that that remedy will be made available to every human being in this State who requires it.  Already, an explanatory pamphlet has been drawn up which we hope to circulate to every household. It sets out how this new preparation called D.D.T. is to be used against the different types of lice referred to in this section.  There is a powder to be used in relation to one or two groups and an emulsion to be used in the case of the head.  Incidentally, I might mention that, when D.D.T. was not available to the civil population of any country in Europe&mdash;I do not want to boast but people should know what is to our credit, as they are so often told what is to our discredit&mdash;we showed our initiative, had D.D.T. manufactured in this country and made available, if not in sufficient supply, in considerable supply, for the civil population.</P>
    <P>We have already secured an option at a very reduced figure on sufficient D.D.T., both in powder and in emulsion, completely to disinfest every infested person in this country on the basis of the percentage figures we have been enabled to work out by our experience <Col N="882" /> of the problem.  In order that nobody should be deterred on the ground of expense, it is being made available free of charge.  In that setting, I do not think that anybody is justified in refusing to rid himself of these lice.  Unless we make an organised and concentrated attack upon this problem, we cannot succeed.  Children who have been brought up under the most rigid supervision, and under the best hygienic conditions, go to school or to a cinema or even to a place of worship and bring home the infestation, as a result of which the rest of the family become infested.  That is the experience of parents in every class of the community.  We can remedy it.  It is one of the things through which we can see plenty of daylight.  Far-reaching as these powers may appear to be, there is no reason in the world why they should inflict any hardship on any well-meaning citizen.  The remedy is there and, if he is not prepared to pay for the remedy, he will get it free of cost.  I do not know that I can make the position any clearer than I have made it or that I can impress the House with the seriousness of this type of problem if the House is not in the mood to be impressed.</P>
    <P>I appeal again for co-operation.  If we get the co-operation of all Parties in this matter, we shall achieve success. Do not assume that, without the power to compel people to do things, you can achieve success.  That applies in every sphere of life.  Deputies might as well have told the Minister for Agriculture during the recent emergency that this, being an agricultural country, and we being blessed with an abundance of arable land, sufficient food would be raised by the people not only for their own requirements, but to provide an exportable surplus.  They would not do it.  Do not let anybody say I am criticising those concerned. I am merely asking the House to realise that compulsory tillage became necessary notwithstanding that we had the land and that we had men who knew how to work the land.</P>
    <P>We had the attitude &ldquo;We will be all right&rdquo;.  The same thing applies in <Col N="883" /> this case.  The vast bulk of those concerned will shrug their shoulders and say: &ldquo;We will be all right; we have not had an epidemic of typhus for a long time.  We may have impetigo, but everybody gets that, and there is no need to take these steps&rdquo;.  I believe there is need.  I am very firmly convinced that there is danger.  I should be lacking in my duty if I did not warn the House that danger exists and that I think I can cope with that danger.  I ask the co-operation of the House in my efforts to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the exhaustive statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary on this proposed new sub-section.  If I have any regret in connection with the matter, it is that he did not give us the benefit of his knowledge of those matters to the same extent on other sections.  The Parliamentary Secretary has painted a picture which seems to indicate that the situation with which we are dealing is more serious now than it has been in the past.  To put the matter in plain language, the people of this country are more verminous at present than they have been in the past.  I should like to know if that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant to convey was that we have evidence of it which was not available to us in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that any member of the House will deny to the Parliamentary Secretary any powers which, he can establish to the satisfaction of the House, are necessary to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said in the beginning of his statement that there was a great deal of misunderstanding in this country as to what we meant when we talk about people being in a verminous state.  There is and, mind you, that misunderstanding or that particular view is not confined to laymen.  I have reason to be interested in this particular section.  The definition of &ldquo;verminous&rdquo; on one occasion cost me or rather cost, I am proud to be able to say, my constituents as the result of a verdict in the courts, something over £1,200.  What gave rise to that? The county medical officer of health goes into a convent school, a new <Col N="884" /> building with a very large number of children on the rolls, children drawn from all classes but mainly from an urban area, and that medical officer states in his reports that in some of the classes as high as 95 per cent. of the children were verminous according to his definition.  It is not necessary for me to say that that was not accepted by the parents, and it certainly was not accepted by myself, who had personal knowledge of the many homes from which these children came, who knew the conditions under which they were reared and the standard of personal cleanliness there. The fact that it was not accepted by the people generally was borne out afterwards.</P>
    <P>I want to know whether the very serious, the terribly serious picture which has been painted by the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to lice gives an actual and completely true presentation of the position in this country to-day or are we to attribute a certain amount of exaggeration due to over-zeal to have this matter dealt with?  I am not for a moment trying to minimise the dangers.  The Parliamentary Secretary talked about the danger of making ammunition which could be used by outside enemies of this country and, mind you, while he was anxious, I am quite sure, not to do that, I do not think that either from inside or outside the country has such a picture ever been painted before of the standard of the personal cleanliness of our people as has been painted by the Parliamentary Secretary himself this morning.</P>
    <P>If we are to judge by the powers which are sought, the position must be a very serious one.  The Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied that if he gets the powers sought in this sub-section, that with these powers and D.D.T. he has a complete and certain remedy.  I should like to be able to believe that.  People do not go round infested with lice because there is any pleasure to be derived from it.  I do not know that anyone can conceive any more troublesome or more irritating travelling companions and there must be some reason for it.  People do not <Col N="885" /> usually inflict torture on themselves. They do not usually allow to remain on their bodies, in their homes or in their clothes, something that can be removed easily.  I think we have got to go down a bit deeper for the cause and I think it is going to require more than D.D.T. and the powers sought in this section, even if they were fully operated or could be operated.</P>
    <P>The state described by the Parliamentary Secretary can come about, in my opinion, from two sources and two sources only.  One is gross negligence, carelessness and a complete absence of any idea of personal cleanliness.  The other is the economic conditions in which the people have to live.  This is a serious matter and, being a serious matter, should be treated in a serious and frank way.  There are none of us children.  There were very few of us reared with silver spoons in our mouths and some of us have been brought up in very close contact with people who have lived in very great poverty.  I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary how he is going to eradicate conditions in this country in which you have anything from one to ten, 12 or 14 people living, eating and sleeping in one room, where you have most of these people wearing the same underclothes anyway, for 24 hours in the day.  When the end of the day comes and when they want to turn into a bed on which there is very little covering, they have not clothes to replace the clothes which they have been wearing all day during the heat and sweat of work.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about this matter as it really is.  Is it not well-known&mdash;and it is not confined to the City of Dublin or even to the urban areas; it is true even of the rural areas&mdash;that very often some of the clothes worn by people during the day have to be thrown over them at night to keep them warm?  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me whether under this or any other section there is anything that is going to remedy that state of affairs.  He said a moment ago that this was a purely preventive section, that it was to prevent so-and-so happening. You may completely disinfest a person and a person's clothes to-day; <Col N="886" /> put him back into the same conditions again, and where are you?  Remember, there are thousands and thousands of people&mdash;it was true even of normal times, and how much more so was it true during the last five years, having regard not only to the scarcity but to the high cost of clothes&mdash;who have not a single change of clothes?  Is there anybody in this House so far removed from the actual living conditions of our unfortunate people that they do not know that is the position?  I want to say that I believe that if our people have not the ways and means, they certainly have the desire to attain as high a standard of personal cleanliness as the people of any other civilised country in the world.  Where they have the means and the way, they certainly attain and maintain that standard, but again when we come down to questions of hygiene, of sanitation, of the ordinary means at their disposal, the ordinary facilities that will enable them for parts of the year to do more than wash their faces and heads, we may ask what percentage of our homes even to-day, of even our new homes built within the last ten, 15 or 24 years, can boast of having a bath installed?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary wants us to be realists about this matter and I agree it ought to be attacked in a real way.  Let us attack it in a real way and let us realise what the conditions are.  Let us make up our minds to this, that, in so far as our people are verminous, they are verminous not because of any wish or desire of theirs to be verminous, not because they do not wish to be as clean in their persons as any other people, but simply because the conditions under which they are forced to live and exist will not enable them to keep clean.  We know that it is a problem.  We know quite well that when children who are fortunate enough to live in fairly well-equipped homes, who are fortunate enough to be the children of parents with a fairly decent income and who therefore can afford to look after them from the point of view of personal cleanliness and from the point of view of their clothes and the necessary frequent changes of clothing, go into <Col N="887" /> our schools, our churches, our cinemas or theatres, they will become infected.</P>
    <P>It is not because the father or mother live in a labourer's cottage, or in one room in a tenement in the City of Dublin, rather than in a five, six or ten-roomed house that they are not just as anxious to have their children clean as the fathers and mothers living in the ten-roomed houses.  I am not satisfied, that even with this new provision, the Parliamentary Secretary is going the right way about dealing with this matter.  I have been informed that, as the Parliamentary Secretary said at the beginning, certain reports based upon examinations amongst certain people, particularly in certain parts of the country, have disclosed a very serious state of affairs.  I doubt if all the powers now sought by the Parliamentary Secretary will completely eradicate these conditions, and what I say about this section and about the proposed remedies could, I think, be said about nearly every other section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary smiles, but it is quite true.  It is notorious that a person suffering from T.B., being taken in time, goes into a sanatorium, spends three or four months there and then is sent home cured, but he is sent back to the same home and the same conditions which were originally responsible for his contracting the disease.  You may deal with them under this section; you may forcibly treat them; you may remove every louse on their bodies or in their clothes, but so long as these children, and even these adults, have to go back to live under the same miserable conditions, you will have to keep on doing it, and I am afraid you will never completely rid our people of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening the debate, the Parliamentary Secretary spent a good deal of time battering at an open door.  So far as this House generally is concerned, all Deputies are unanimous that, so far as possible, it should be the aim of our medical authorities and of the people generally to see that vermin are eliminated completely. <Col N="888" /> On that question, we are all in complete agreement, and I think it would be foolish to suggest that there was any opposition in any part of the House to measures which might be considered necessary and desirable to achieve this object, provided the measures are reasonable and justifiable. In all my long career, I have never met an individual who was partial to, or tolerant of, lice, except one, and he happened to be a poet.  I distinctly remember a habit he had of picking an insect off his person, putting it on the back of his hand and then blowing it off, saying: &ldquo;I would hate to kill the poor creature&rdquo;.  I mention that as the one exception that proves the rule.</P>
      <P>Since we all agree on this aspect, it is a matter for us to decide how best to achieve the object we have in view, and I am personally in complete agreement with Deputy Morrissey when he says that a raising of the standard of living of our people, an improvement of our housing conditions and of the ability of our people to secure decent facilities for washing and general cleanliness and the provision of sufficient means to provide a change of clothing are of vital and, as I think, primary importance.  In dealing with the amendment, we have to accept a good deal of what the Parliamentary Secretary tells us, because most of us are laymen and he is a medical officer, but I have a growing feeling of fear in my mind that, by the time this Bill has wended its way through the House, most of us will be qualified to take our degrees in medical science of some kind or another.</P>

      <P>I hope not, because I trust we shall be able to make greater progress than we have been making. We are all becoming a little anxious about getting out to put in the crop for the coming year.  While it is a good thing to eliminate vermin, it would be a very serious position for the country if the people were left without food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to our reliance on the Parliamentary Secretary's technical knowledge, it is necessary to compare <Col N="889" /> this new section with that which it seeks to supersede.  I mentioned at another stage of this debate that this new section is a definite improvement upon the one which it supersedes.  It is certainly much less absurd.  It may be a little more pediculous, but it certainly is not so ridiculous.  In the first draft, we were confining our compulsory powers to children, as if it were only a louse which inhabited the body of a child could spread this disease.  Apparently the Parliamentary Secretary, in drafting the section, was ignoring the fact that a louse sheltering, perhaps, between the permanent waves on the head of a fair lady could be as dangerous to the public health as an insect on the head of a small boy.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has learned something since he introduced the Bill in its original form.  He has realised also that, since it is lice and lice alone which spread infection, it is unwise and would be imprudent to have his medical officers chasing all other kinds of insects and thus waste a lot of public time and money.  The fact that he has made such an advance and has had to make such changes in the original section gives us reason to have certain doubts.  It is admitted now that he was not infallible when he introduced the Bill.  Are we to assume that the gift of infallibility descended on him between the Second Reading and the introduction of this amendment?  If we accept the view that it did, there is no need for further discussion, but if we do not consider that he is absolutely infallible we should question various methods which are proposed in this new section.</P>
    <P>One thing admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary to-day was significant, that is, that in the medical profession there is a number of cranks. It is well to get that admission from a member of the medical profession.  We have to be very careful to guard against the crank.  In this section as it stands, I think there is no danger to the ordinary citizen if every person called upon to administer the Act is absolutely impartial and fair at all times and acts with absolute prudence. If we could rely upon that, we might <Col N="890" /> be prepared to give the section to the Parliamentary Secretary without any further consideration.  There are very drastic provisions in it and a very roundabout procedure.  The Parliamentary Secretary has dwelt a good deal upon the fact that medical science has made an extraordinary step forward in the past 12 months.  He referred to D.D.T. as miraculous.  If we have discovered this miraculous method of eliminating vermin, it should not be necessary to have such a roundabout procedure as is contemplated in this section, of a person being refused permission to expose himself on the street, of a registered medical practitioner attending a person in a dwelling and being aware that some person is infected with vermin in that house, being obliged to report to the district medical officer.  With the new remedy, it should not be necessary to have all this reporting and isolation.</P>

      <P>Might I point out to the Deputy that the private practitioner, under the section to which the Deputy is referring, is given seven days within which to clear up the condition, before he has to report it&mdash;and he can clear it up in less than seven hours?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am considering at the moment.  We have discovered a new method of eliminating this type of evil and, therefore, we should be more careful about putting these excessive powers into the hands of the medical profession.  I would also warn the Parliamentary Secretary against undue enthusiasm being aroused in the medical profession by reason of this new discovery.  From time to time in medical history new discoveries have been brought to light and immediately hailed as complete remedies for particular evils.  Time has proved that they were not so miraculous, so far-reaching or so beneficial as was at first thought.  It ought to be, and I am sure it will be, the policy of the Department to treat this new remedy with care.  I am sure the most painstaking research will be undertaken to ensure that it has no ill-effects on human health or otherwise, as that is but an elementary precaution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the very opening words of this new section there is a sweeping provision. <Col N="891" /> It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A person who knows that he is verminous shall not expose himself in any street, public place, club, hotel or shop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us look a little distantly to the future and see, perhaps, a Minister for Health performing his toilet in the morning, dressing his hair and discovering one of these insects, the pediculus capitis, and finding he has not one of the remedies in the house.  He may not be a medical officer, but he may be a very conscientious Minister.  What is he to do?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just wondering what precaution the Minister for Health in this case has to take, if he is not to be completely isolated and cut off from all his public duties and debarred from leaving his home until he has satisfied his conscience that this particular insect and all his relatives and friends have been exterminated. I think it was Oliver Goldsmith who put it on record that a louse becomes a grandparent before he reaches the age of 24 hours.  I do not know how he discovered that.  Medical science may have made some little advance since then and may contradict the statement of Oliver Goldsmith, but it is admitted that vermin reproduce very rapidly.  I think it would be impossible for any person to be absolutely certain, if he were to discover vermin in his home or on his person, that he was absolutely free.  Then, by this first sub-section, he would be debarred from moving in public and forced to isolate himself completely. That is unnecessarily drastic, in view of the advance which medical science has made and the new remedies which have been discovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be careful about adopting such drastic measures.  We know that in some of the totalitarian States they had the same enthusiasm for activity against vermin.  We know that, in some of those States, one of the <Col N="892" /> methods of publicly humiliating those who were not loyal to the totalitarian régime was to have them publicly deloused.  Anything which reflects upon the dignity of the human person and anything which imposes a humiliation on the individual should be handled with extreme care and no undue publicity should be given to any measures which it may be necessary to adopt in order to eliminate vermin. Therefore, we should see that the methods to be adopted should be as simple and as forthright as possible and there should be the least element of officialdom and red tape or the filling up of forms and the making of declarations in connection with the matter.</P>
    <P>We know that there may be&mdash;and I think there are&mdash;a limited number of people who suffer from this evil by reason of their own neglect, but in the great majority of cases it is due to extreme poverty.  In quite a considerable number of cases it might be due also, in addition to extreme poverty, to physical incapacity.  There are many cases in the country of aged people, perhaps living alone, or there may be two or three people living in the same house, suffering from rheumatism or other troubles which would make it difficult for them frequently to change their clothing.  Those people become affected.  I think that type of person should not be publicly humiliated.  That is the point I wish to stress.</P>
    <P>We all know of a recent case, a very shocking case, in which a poor person was found dead and the view was expressed that that person was infested with vermin.  These things will happen, and it is not always due to neglect.  We must take the view that physical incapacity and sickness are contributing causes, but the greatest contributing causes are extreme poverty, which makes it impossible for people to change their clothing frequently, and also lack of housing, which deprives people of facilities for bathing and cleanliness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that portion of the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary that I happened to hear I was impressed with the reference to <Col N="893" /> the effects of infestation and the necessity for steps to be taken to remove that type of affliction.  I did not, however, hear any explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary as to the causes of infestation.  I made inquiries from a colleague to know if it was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary in the earlier portion of his speech, and I gather it was not.  It is the general opinion that the causes of infestation are mainly poverty and bad housing conditions.  Obviously, the remedy would be to remove poverty and ensure that every individual has housing conditions of such a character as will enable the members of the household to maintain a standard of personal cleanliness through the amenities which the better housing will provide.  Until that desirable state of affairs is reached, until poverty has been removed from our social sphere and until we have the housing conditions that we desire, I think it is evident that our people, particularly those in one room tenements and habitations of that description, will have to undergo a considerable amount of discomfort, which may be transmitted to others.</P>
      <P>I think that commonsense would compel us to adopt any remedy, even though it may be a temporary remedy, to ensure that that discomfort should be removed from that type of person and, if the remedy suggested here in the form of D.D.T. or any other preparation gives a measure of comfort to our people, particularly in slums or other such habitations, I think it would be exceedingly foolish if we did not take advantage of a course of treatment along those lines.  For that reason, I and my colleagues take the view that, while the ideal thing would be to remove the causes, if the causes are poverty and bad housing conditions, meanwhile we must not turn aside something that is at hand which gives a measure of comfort in the conditions of living that our people have to undergo in insanitary dwellings.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to understand the Parliamentary Secretary, but I find it even more difficult to understand Deputy Cogan <Col N="894" /> when he sees something valuable in this measure.  I wonder if I understand Deputy O'Sullivan aright when he says that, in order to save people the inconvenience of being infested, he thinks it right that we should take powers to prevent people who are infested going upon the public street? I think it is a very shocking and drastic approach to the task of making people comfortable.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary harped on the necessity for powers as drastic as these in order to prevent people being troubled by the disease of typhus and impetigo.  As regards typhus, at the same time as the Parliamentary Secretary is taking power compulsorily to disinfest people infested with lice and to take power to punish them if they go out on the street or into a public place while so infested, in the same measure he is wiping out compulsory vaccination. From his own statement, in the case of any danger of an outbreak of typhus fever you can take all the necessary precautions to prevent that spreading beyond the infected cases much more simply than you can take precautions to prevent the spread of smallpox.  They had cases in Great Britain where smallpox became prevalent and there was the very confused situation where people, who took advantage of compulsory vaccination not being enforced there, were rushing to be vaccinated when the danger arrived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that, if there is a case of typhus, the whole place can be cleaned up with D.D.T. inside of seven hours. This is just another example of the inconsequential way in which the Parliamentary Secretary is approaching this, and of his lack of any kind of clearly understood principles in dealing with it.  With regard to typhus, which is very serious from the point of view of its incidence, the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that science has put into the hands of the people a way of remedying the difficulties they previously laboured under because of housing, clothing or some other conditions. Science has also put into the people's hands an opportunity of completely <Col N="895" /> cleaning themselves, if they so wish, of infestation by lice, and it is in these circumstances that the Parliamentary Secretary wants the very drastic powers that he is seeking in this section.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to look at the last report of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and to turn to page 40 where they will find some details with regard to typhus and of the number of cases that occurred between 1938-43.  In 1938 there were none.  In 1939 there were five, in 1940, 13; in 1941, 25; in 1942, 28 and in 1943, 20.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us this morning that there were nine cases in 1944.  The deaths from this disease were: in 1938, none; in 1939, three; in 1940, two; in 1941, six; in 1942, five and in 1943, four.  The Parliamentary Secretary said this morning that in 1944 there was only one death.  The report, in dealing with this matter, says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This disease has been endemic in the western counties for over a century.  From time to time it was responsible for disastrous epidemics with cases sometimes numbering thousands....</P>
    <P>From the year 1923 onwards more effective measures began to be adopted to bring the disease under efficient control.  The improvement effected was largely due to the efforts of the Department and its medical staff, ably assisted by the local medical officers.  Preventive measures were put on a basis which was scientific but simple and easy to operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say that preventive measures were put on a basis that was scientific but simple and easy to operate before ever D.D.T. appeared.  We see, therefore, from this report that medical science was able even during the conditions which this country laboured under during the last five or six years when there was no great chance, in some of the western districts, of buying new outfits of clothes, on the one hand, or soap on the other, to keep the incidence of the disease down.  I fail to see, therefore, why there should be this extraordinary pressure at this <Col N="896" /> hour of the day to pass a law saying that anybody with lice on him cannot go on a public road, that he cannot go into a public place, that he cannot go into a church, and that children cannot be sent to school.  I think that in spite of what Deputy Cogan may have at the back of his mind, and in spite of what Deputy O'Sullivan has said, the Parliamentary Secretary's proposal is quite fantastic.  On page 42 of the Department's report we find this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The efforts to eradicate the disease were fruitful and for the first time there was no case of typhus fever recorded in the country in the year 1938.  With the existence of emergency conditions outbreaks of the disease have again occurred and the number of cases increased from five in the year 1939 to 28 in the year 1942.  A slight decrease has been noted in the year under review when there were only two outbreaks involving 20 cases and four deaths, compared with four outbreaks resulting in 28 cases and five deaths in the preceding year.  Only two counties, Leitrim and Cork, were affected in 1943.  The Leitrim outbreak was by far the more serious of the two, resulting in 19 out of the 20 cases and three out of the four deaths.  It occurred amongst itinerant tinkers encamped near Carrick-on-Shannon, but who had previous contacts in their wanderings through other parts of the country.  The extent of the outbreak was due to the fact that at the outset the disease was not clinically recognisable as typhus fever being of a mild type, and was diagnosed as influenza.  In County Cork there was only one case...the patient succumbed.  It is significant that in several instances in recent years the disease has been spread by itinerants and it may be necessary to obtain more power by legislation to ensure that the standard of cleanliness amongst that class will be improved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That report was printed for the Department of Local Government and Public Health in January, 1946, the report having been signed in December, 1945, by the Secretary to the <Col N="897" /> Department.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Secretary speaking for the Department, with all its experience, reported that &ldquo;it is significant that in several instances in recent years the disease has been spread by itinerants and it may be necessary to obtain more power by legislation to ensure that the standard of cleanliness amongst that class will be improved.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am leading up to this, that I do not know what is going on inside the Department of Local Government and Public Health. Yesterday, we on this side of the House were charged with being, more or less, slaves: that there were British Acts, the Act of 1878 and others, with all kinds of powers in them, and that we never asked anybody what was the reason for those powers, but that when the Parliamentary Secretary came before us with this Bill we wanted to put all kinds of objectionable restrictions in his way.  He more or less suggested that we are of the slave type and would take things from the foreigner that we would not take from him: that here, with this amendment in front of us, we were being offered a piece of Irish legislation, made by Irishmen for Irishmen, to deal with purely Irish conditions.  But what was my surprise, almost my disappointment, when the Parliamentary Secretary told us to-day: &ldquo;No, this thing which is, as it were, crawling into the Bill by way of a belated amendment, thought of for the Committee Stage, is something <Col N="898" /> which has crawled out of some sections of the Public Health Act of 1878.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the grandson that Deputy Cogan has learned about from Oliver Goldsmith would be able to recognise his grandfather, but I find it very difficult to think that anybody could recognise the amendment which the Parliamentary Secretary is now putting before us as being anything like the legitimate offspring of Section 148 of the Public Health Act of 1878.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Bill on the last date on which it was under discussion, I was making the point that the relations between the farmer and his labourer were very different from the relations which exist between the industrial employer and his employees, and that we should try to avoid, if possible, having the same rigid rules and regulations in the case of the farmer and his labourer that we already have in existence for the industrial employer and his employee.  I just want to add, so far as that point is concerned, that the reason why I make that point is that in a number of cases &mdash;I do not know whether I can say the majority in this country, but certainly, so far as I know, the majority of agricultural labourers&mdash; they get more holidays with pay than would be provided for in this Bill if it were passed.  In addition to that, the agricultural labourer gets certain help in connection with looking after his plot and so on, and if we were to pass this legislation it might have the effect of having the rigid rule applied: that is, that he would get a certain number of holidays with pay, but no more, or no more outside help than he is getting at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against that, however, I must say that I agree, and I think that almost every member of this House agrees, that we should do everything possible <Col N="899" /> for the agricultural labourer.  We all agree that his lot is not a very happy one, so far as remuneration and working conditions go, generally, and if we can improve his position, then all to the good.  The question, however, is to know how that improvement can be effected as things stand, because we must deal with this Bill from the point of view of how things stand.  In the case of Deputies who have read the speeches that were made in the House on the last day, there is no use in their saying that they are in favour of this Bill and of giving more concessions to the agricultural labourer, conditional on the farmer being in a position to do so.  We must take the position as it is at the moment, and if Deputies are going to vote in favour of this Bill, then they should vote on the understanding that the farmer is in a position to do this at the present prices which he gets.  It must be admitted, of course, that if the employer can afford to give the agricultural labourer better wages and better conditions than he has at the moment, it follows that the small farmer is in a better position than we believe him to be in.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether this is the time to make reforms of this kind, I should like to ask the Dáil to consider the position that we are in and what is likely to be before us for some time to come.  I should like to stress in particular that the objective of, I think, everybody is more and higher production in agriculture.  If we can get higher production by working shorter hours, well and good, but I do not know if that is possible.  More production, of course, means more work, and it is held by some that if a labourer or worker has shorter hours and good holidays he will do more and better work than if he were working for longer hours.  Deputies who vote for or against this Bill can keep that point in mind and express their opinion on it by their votes.  What we can hope for in agricultural production is a higher aggregate income for agriculture in general, and if there is a higher aggregate income with more production, it means that with the same number of workers, there whether <Col N="900" /> farmers, sons of farmers, or agricultural labourers, there should be more for ever person engaged.</P>
    <P>Now, that question of more production is a matter that must come from planning&mdash;planning by the farmers themselves, by the county committees of agriculture, by the Department of Agriculture, by me, by the Government, and by the Dáil.  If and when we get higher production and a higher aggregate income for all engaged in agriculture, the Agricultural Wages Board is the body to arbitrate, as it were, between the employer and the employee.  Now, in the Agricultural Wages Board, we have representatives of the employers and the employees, and I think that it takes no great imagination for any Deputy to reconstruct, if you like, what takes place at a meeting there: in other words, that the representatives of the workers make the plea that it is difficult, if not impossible, for an agricultural labourer to live on his present wage, and they, therefore, try to get a better wage for the worker; whereas the representatives of the employers, I take it, make the case that they are paying as much as they can afford, or almost as much as they can afford, if they are agreeable to give a small rise.  At any rate, the two sides make their case and, so far, although that board has been in operation for almost ten years now&mdash;well, nine years, certainly&mdash;they have got general agreement on the wages and conditions that should apply to agricultural labourers &mdash;that is, of course, the minimum wage that should apply, and the conditions. So that we have there a body which has been working successfully, on the whole, on this problem for all these years, and I think that anything that concerns agricultural wages or conditions should come from that body.  The Agricultural Wages Board have to consider various matters and weigh the circumstances.  Let us take the case of Church holidays first, and say that the question arose of whether agricultural labourers are entitled to Church holidays with pay: if there should be any difficulty there, as would appear to be in the minds of some people as to the legal aspect of the matter, they would have at least my co-operation <Col N="901" /> and, I should say, the sympathy of the Dáil in dealing with a matter of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like in dealing with this matter, to put it to Deputies &mdash;summarising, if you like, what I have already said&mdash;that this Bill is impracticable because if it were passed, the main Bill could not be applied to agricultural workers, for many reasons. I mentioned some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, one very strong point was that if a worker does any work whatever the day cannot be regarded as a holiday.  In addition to the six bank holidays or Church holidays he must get seven days' continuous leave. That may not be suitable to agricultural conditions.  The most Deputy Norton and the sponsors of the Bill could achieve by getting the Dáil to agree with them, is that they would get the matter decided on principle. The Bill would have to be amended before it could be applied.  If that is the case, the wiser course would be to have the matter considered by the Agricultural Wages Board.  That could be done in this way, that there are committees through the country and on these committees&mdash;there are about 5 regional committees&mdash;there are one, two or three representatives, according to the size of the county, of employers and the same number representing employees.  They initiate any proposals that come before the board.  Surely it is not beyond the ingenuity of any Deputy to have the matter raised before some regional committee.  If it is discussed there, it will eventually come before the board for discussion.  If the Agricultural Wages Board makes any decision with regard to holidays, it will certainly have my co-operation, if that is necessary.  There are certain decisions that I do not come into, but, if it is necessary to give legal effect to any decision come to, I will certainly co-operate as far as I can to bring the <Col N="902" /> matter before the Dáil.  I expect the Dáil will be sympathetic.</P>

      <P>I have no policy in this matter.  The Agricultural Wages Board has a policy, and, as I understand it, the first part concerns conciliation. The chairman is there to act as conciliator between employers and employees in order to get agreement. He only acts as conciliator, and if he cannot get agreement, he acts as arbitrator.  He has never had to act as arbitrator.</P>

It must then go to the board to see what they may decide.  I am not a lawyer, but my opinion is that they can decide this matter without coming to me or to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this Bill, we realise that the agricultural worker is the most important man of to-day. The Minister pointed out in a speech last week that it was not practical to extend holidays to the agricultural worker, that the agricultural worker was different from the industrial worker.  For the information of the Minister, I want to say that in my constituency there is a large employer who, for the past two years, has granted seven days' holidays each year &mdash;not, of course, at harvest time, but at the particular time that suits himself, in agreement with his workers&mdash; and a half day each week.  He finds that production has increased.  He has not had any trouble in his farm for the past ten years.  He points out that he can leave the farm to go away on business for 43 weeks and that the work is carried on, that the men take an even greater interest than when he is present.  That may happen where there are ten men employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise the difficulties in the case of the small farmer but they are difficulties that we could get over.  The Minister is a practical man and he knows about farming.  He knows there is a difference between the agricultural worker and the industrial worker. I hope the friendship will continue between the employer and the worker. The Minister points out that the agricultural worker receives so many Church holidays in the year.  The work <Col N="906" /> of the agricultural worker is not a question of hours.  It is not a matter of leaving off at 6 o'clock or 5.30.  He works until he saves the particular crop in a particular field.  At threshing time he may work until all hours of the night.  It is not a question of hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of weather conditions.  The men give their best, with co-operation of both sides.  To maintain that spirit of co-operation and to induce the younger generation to take a greater interest in the land, I would suggest that the Government, apart from the wages board, should treat the rural worker no less favourably than the industrial worker or the city worker.  The city worker to-day is depending upon the rural worker.  We are all depending upon the co-operation between the rural worker and the farmer, they being the two essential workers in the community.  We should put the rural worker in the position that he can maintain and increase production so that we will have not alone sufficient for ourselves but a surplus which will enable us to extend generosity to people less fortunate than we are.  The flight from the land is deplored.  The Minister must know that younger men will not take the interest in the land that their fathers took.  Agricultural employees who have good employers will receive wages, perquisites and benefits that the city worker does not receive but my complaint is against the owner of large estates.  The working farmer treats his men as he would treat a member of his own family but in the case of estate owners where there is a large number of men employed, and a steward in control, the men are paid by the hour.  If it is a wet day and they can only work a few hours they are paid only in respect of those hours.  There are no perquisites, no harvest bonus.  There may be overtime in rush periods when they work until 9 o'clock.  These men can afford to pay.  They have capital and they are reaping benefits and making profits.  The small farmer can make arrangements, and is prepared to make <Col N="907" /> arrangements, to give his worker holidays, if necessary.  He does not pay his men on a rate per hour basis. I know cases where if a man is out for a day or a week on account of illness he is paid for that period by his employer but, again, that is in the case of the working farmer, the man who is depending on the co-operation of the labourer.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1939 does not go far enough, in my opinion, because, if a man works on a holiday, he receives only 25 per cent, more for working.  If he works, he should have more than a mere 25 per cent addition.  I can see no difficulty.  We do not suggest, and no Deputy would suggest, that the holidays should be taken in the harvest or sowing time or any other busy season, but the Minister knows that there are often days when men could be allowed off, in rotation.  We do not want to close down the industry by giving holidays to all the men at the same time and I do not think the Deputy who moved the Second Reading has suggested in any way that work should be interfered with during spring or harvest.  There is a time between those seasons when arrangements could be made to give holidays to the men that we are really interested in.  We see the troubles we have all over the country, apart from the flight from the land, and we recognise that there is a serious position.  The Minister is concerned to see that production is maintained and increased.  Industrialists admit that in industries where the men are satisfied with their conditions there is greater production than there is when men have to endure bad working conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that in the harvest time the rural workers give of their very best.  If men have been working from 7 o'clock in the morning until 9 o'clock in the evening, in the months of July and August and, often, September, they, at least, are entitled to some recognition by the people of the country as well as by the Government. We owe a debt of gratitude to those men who are engaged in production and we should show our appreciation of them by giving them some recognition.  The Minister points out <Col N="908" /> that we can go to the wages board. The industrial worker has an advisory tribunal before which the representatives of his organisation can put forward his case.  Two ploughmen are the Wicklow representatives on the wages board but I have heard the complaint in respect of other areas that the labour representatives never worked as labour men in their lives and often vote with the employers' representatives against granting any increase or concession to the workers engaged in the industry.  If the industrial worker has representatives, through his organisation, to put forward his case, and an official of his union to prepare a case to put before the advisory tribunal, why not give a similar concession to the agricultural worker to put his case before a tribunal appointed by the Government, having a representative of the agricultural workers on that tribunal?  I do not see why industrialists should be represented on it, but there should be on it somebody who has a thorough knowledge of the conditions and hardships that have to be endured on the land and who will take an interest also in the position of the farmer and his capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>We are led to believe from the bank returns and from Government statistics that farmers are in a position to pay decent wages owing to the profits they are making.  We maintain that the agricultural worker is entitled to as generous treatment as the industrial worker.  If he is to be put in that position the whole system of the Agricultural Wages Board will have to be changed.  The Minister could bring in a Bill, which I am sure will receive the support of all Parties, including the Farmers' Party, and which could be passed within 48 hours, to give to the agricultural worker due recognition during the next six months for the food he is producing for the people. If these men are to produce that food for the nation we should be prepared to make some sacrifice in order that they should be accorded better treatment than they have had during the past ten or 20 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that, in principle, he recognises the right <Col N="909" /> of the agricultural workers to as generous treatment as the other sections of the community.  He wants some committee representative of Deputies in the various areas to put forward a case with the labour representatives. How can we put forward that case when, with the exception of Wicklow, we are satisfied that those representing labour on the Agricultural Wages Board are not real labour representatives?  We want more production and more food and the co-operation of all parties.  I am prepared to do anything I can in my own constituency to see that production is not interfered with provided we are assured that the Government and the Dáil will recognise the rights of these men.  If the farmers are not getting proper prices for their produce, when we are able to vote millions for other services we should be able to put them in the position that the price they obtain for their produce will enable them to pay the agricultural worker a reasonable wage and give him the same facilities as are given to industrial workers.  If we do that, I am certain we will bring about contentment amongst the agricultural workers. So far as I know, there will not be any opposition to that from the genuine working farmers if they are placed in a position to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister may point out that I am putting the two sides of the case, that I am demanding recognition of the rights of the worker and also that the farmer should be put in a position to pay.  I do not think the Government will object to that proposition. As I said, we want to bring about a position in which nothing will interfere with the production of food.  The people in the country districts may not be affected, but the people in the cities and towns will suffer from any action which may interfere with the production of food.  In order to prevent that happening, I ask the Government to be generous and to show appreciation of what the agricultural workers have done during the last six or seven years.  Every encouragement should be given to these men, who work sometimes until 9 o'clock at night, to produce food for the country. We should show some recognition of <Col N="910" /> what they are doing and place them in a similar position to that of the workers in the towns and cities.  In the summer-time, as I say, the agricultural worker is often working until 9 o'clock at night.  Those who are engaged in milking or who are employed on mixed farms must work on Sunday.  When football matches are being played, these men are working while town workers and city workers are enjoying themselves.  That is a system which should be changed.  If the Minister will play his part and give some encouragement to these men nothing will be done to interfere with the production of food during the next six months.  The principle of this Bill should be accepted and the men granted some holidays.  There should also be some improvement of the Act of 1939.  These men should be given a generous wage and the Minister should indicate that he will see that these men will be treated no less generously than the workers in the cities and towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure goes far beyond what appears on the surface. When I come to Dublin I find great ignorance&mdash;I cannot call it anything else&mdash;displayed by everybody with regard to farming conditions.  I suggest to the Labour Party and to other Parties, and even to the Government, that they should first lay down a basis of £3 10s. a week for agricultural workers, prepare their costs for agricultural produce on that, and then say: &ldquo;There is the cost of the food; let that be paid&rdquo;.  We have 495,000 people over 18 years of age employed in agriculture in this country.  This Bill would only apply to 80,000 of them.  Where do the other 400,000 come in?  What is to be their position?  I want to know what is to be the position of the unpaid labourers on the land.  When are they going to be taken out of serfdom?  That is the first question we ought to ask ourselves.  I should like Deputy Norton to tell us that.  I hear a lot of talk about industrialism and everything else.  The biggest curse ever inflicted on this country was the Agricultural Wages Board which the Minister talks about. I admit that it was an absolute <Col N="911" /> necessity brought about by a political organisation that endeavoured to knock satisfaction out of the ordinary labourers of this country because they happened to vote for the Government. That was the only reason why these men were hounded out of employment and their wages reduced to such a pitch that an Act had to be brought in to give them justice.  It was the first thing that interfered with the happy family relations that existed in rural Ireland before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes that the agricultural labourers should get six working days as holidays as well as six bank holidays or alternative days in lieu, or 12 days in the year.  What holidays does the agricultural labourer get to-day?  The agricultural labourer gets ten Church holy-days, Stephen's Day, Easter Monday, and an odd day off for race meetings.  That is the difference between the regimentation which this Bill would effect and the present position of the agricultural labourer.  He would be in the unhappy position that the labourers of some of the buckshee gentlemen living around me are in at present.  When a Church holy-day comes along and all the boys go down to Mass, the employees of those fellows have to rush out before Mass is over, get into their old clothes and commence clipping hedges or digging up the soil&mdash; and that on a holy-day of obligation. Their fellow workers on the land are off for the day.  Is that the condition of affairs we want to see brought about?  Let all Parties in this House come together and deal fairly with the 495,000 persons working on the land. The maximum wage of many of these workers is £2 per week.  They are the people who have been feeding this country for the past six years and they should at least be treated as white men.  Let all Parties come together and agree that these men should be treated as other men are treated.  Let us fix a minimum wage for agricultural labourers which will make their position at least as good as that of their brothers in the towns.  You cannot do that because of the absolute ignorance of conditions in agricultural <Col N="912" /> Ireland.  Nobody outside the rural areas knows those conditions.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is considering anything in the line of holidays for the rural districts, let him fix holidays for the 495,000 of us and he will be doing a good day's work for the country.  He says that agricultural employment is periodical&mdash;that the men are employed at one job one day and at another job another day and that they, therefore, differ from the industrial worker and the man in the office.  I suggest that the boys in the offices be sent down for a fortnight to take the places of the agricultural workers.  Give the agriculturists a fortnight's holidays and bring down the boys in the offices in their stead and they will have some realisation of the condition of affairs in the country.  They will be able to make up their minds far more readily as regards agricultural problems.  That is a fair proposition.  If the Minister accepts it, I make a special appeal to him to send me down the fellow who prepared the White Paper and the ration for a cow to give 500 gallons of milk.  He would save me a lot if he would show me how a 500-gallon cow could be fed on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He showed it.  He made every farmer in the country laugh.  We shall have to get somebody to do the work while we are on holidays and I ask that the boys in the offices be sent down.  I ask, particularly, that the investigation officers for old age pensions be sent down.  I should like to see one of these fellows taking his place on a farm.  He would have an opportunity of making up the enormous sums he manages to credit to an applicant for an old age pension in order to deprive him of the 10/- a week.  These fellows would get a training there.  When it comes to about 4.30 the man from the office who is sent down can put his hand on his back and straighten it up.  Then, he will look around for the wash basin and towel he is accustomed to at 4.50 when he is preparing for a 5 o'clock stop.  While <Col N="913" /> he is looking for the wash basin, he may hear the cows bawling.  I wonder if he will send the cows a note saying that their complaint will have attention or if he will send a note stating that the Minister regrets that they cannot be fed to-night.</P>
      <P>Let us get down to business on this question.  Let these fellows be sent down and trained and they will have some knowledge of the rural Ireland with which they are dealing in their offices.  If one of them came down to me in harvest time, I should, probably, find my machine tied up in red tape. We would want the Minister and his whole Department down to deal with the tape worm.  That is the trouble we are in in rural Ireland.  Deputy Everett talked about the work of ten or 12 men on a couple of estates.  Did he ever examine the figures and find out how the farmers stood?  You have 384,000 farmers in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Of these, 242,000 have under 30 acres of land.</P>

I am concerned with the 495,000 people working on the land and I say that this is an attempt to drive a wedge between them and the 80,000 agricultural labourers.  Instead of giving these labourers ten Church holidays every year you are saying to them: &ldquo;For four of these Church holidays in future, you will have to take off your coats and work.  Then you may get two quid some Saturday night and go down to the county home on the following week.&rdquo;  That is the offer contained in this Bill.

If they get a pain between the shoulders then their association will be able to look after them and give them a rub up.  Let us avoid this piecemeal legislation.  Why pick out a special class of 80,000 from the 495,000 agricultural workers and say that they are going to be compelled to take six holidays in addition to six Church holy-days and that they are going to be compelled to work for four other Church holidays on which their Church tells them that they should not work? Under which system were they better off?  The more you regiment them and the more you interfere by legal methods with the present happy family position that exists amongst the agricultural community the more harm you are going to do.</P>

      <P>Give the agricultural worker a decent wage first as a result of which he can afford to take a holiday. What is the use of telling him to put on his Sunday clothes and take a holiday if the poor devil has no Sunday clothes to get into?  I want to <Col N="916" /> draw a distinction between the industrial worker and the ordinary agricultural labourer who walks into me of an evening and says: &ldquo;Martin, I am going off for the evening.  I am going to Cork to take a doll to the pictures&rdquo; or the man who says: &ldquo;I want to take a day off to buy a pair of boots.&rdquo; What would happen to the industrial worker who approached his employer in that way?  You have to draw a line between the conditions that exist for agricultural workers and those that exist amongst industrial workers.  If the poor devil of an industrial worker is out for a day, he is wiped out. Again there are very few agricultural labourers who will not be laid up for some period during the year.  The worker gets national health insurance, but he has three days to wait before he gets anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three days anyway, during which he is entitled to nothing by law.  He is paid for these three days by the farmer just as if he worked.  I never met a case in which an agricultural worker received any other treatment from a farmer.  It is now proposed to introduce regimentation into that system.  You place the farmer in the position in which he has to say to his labourer: &ldquo;You are entitled to nothing more and nothing less, and that is all you will get from me&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for some neighbours of mine who are working as gardeners and who do not get Church holy-days.  I see these poor devils getting into their old clothes and going off to work.  I say it is unfair and unjust in a Catholic country that certain workers have to work on Church holy-days while industrial workers have the right to get off on the Freemason thing called a bank holiday.  Let us get down to business in this matter, and let the Deputy come in here with a decent Bill to provide a minimum wage of £3 10s. 0d. per week for the agricultural worker. Let the Minister approach that by saying: &ldquo;Very well; there is the cost of agricultural labour.  On that basis <Col N="917" /> let us fix the price of milk, beet, butter, eggs and everything else produced by the farmer.  There is the price&mdash;the cost of production plus a certain profit for the agricultural community, and let the agricultural community be taken out of the rut they are in.&rdquo;  Let us have a proposal of that kind instead of the present miserable proposal to give holidays to a poor devil who has not five bob in his pocket to enjoy them or never can have under present conditions.</P>
    <P>What is the good of giving a holiday to a slave?  Where is the good telling a poor labourer like that: &ldquo;Mick, you can go off for a week's holidays, and Jack you will remain, but on next Patrick's Day you will have to work, Mick, and Jack can go off for the day.&rdquo;  That is what you are doing. If you want to do it, do it, but do not do it with your eyes closed.  Let us have such conditions in agriculture as will enable the agricultural community to have something on which to take a holiday.  What is the good of comparing these people with industrial workers?  If, in the morning, you increase the pay of the industrial workers, the industrialist can walk over to the Prices Commission the following day and put the amount of the increase on to the amount the consumer pays for the article.  What court can the farmer go to on matters of that kind?  The price of beet was fixed at 80/- per ton four years ago, and, since then, agricultural wages have been increased by 5/- per week by law, but the farmer is still getting 80/- per ton for his beet.  How is it possible to draw a comparison between the industrialist who has a court to which he can go and the farmer who has to take what he gets for feeding everybody?  Let us look at this matter like men, like Christians and let us look at it as people who should be more than thankful to the people who fed us when we would have died from hunger otherwise.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry knows as well as anybody in the House that there is no intention on the part of the promoters of this Bill to drive a wedge <Col N="918" /> between the agricultural labourer and the working farmer who works his land with family labour.  He seems to presume to speak on behalf of the working farmer when he suggests that they could not benefit by the operation of a Bill of this kind.  I suggest, from my limited knowledge of the working farmers of my constituency and of other counties in the Midlands area, that the majority of the decent farmers in these areas are at the moment giving these holidays with pay to their agricultural labourers, and they do it in the turf-cutting counties for the purpose of enabling the labourers to provide themselves with fuel for the winter.  They have been doing that for a very long period.  I admit that a number of them will never give concessions, either in respect of wages or working conditions, until forced to do so by law, and that is why this measure has been brought in.</P>
      <P>Does Deputy Corry suggest that the 415,000 working farmers out of the 495,000 who are engaged in agriculture could not take the holidays provided for in the Bill, if they desired to do so?  Of course they could, and nobody would prevent them from doing so, if they desired to take them when the Bill comes into operation.  The main point is: does Deputy Corry suggest that the 415,000 working farmers and those who help to carry on their farms do not want to give the conditions laid down in this Bill to the 80,000 agricultural labourers who work for 39/- and 40/- a week?  I suggest that no opposition will come from the working farmers to the operation of this limited measure.  I know that Deputy Corry has a decent outlook with regard to conditions for workers generally, but if he or any other Deputy can suggest ways and means by which we can give benefits corresponding to those provided in this Bill to the working farmers, let him get up and put them forward.  He will find that the promoters of the Bill will be the first to shake hands with him on that point.</P>

Aside from the little political play-acting he carried on, I agree with him that it is a common-sense thing to suggest that an agreed living wage should be fixed for the agricultural labourer.  Nobody will suggest&mdash; not even the Minister&mdash;that he is in receipt of a living wage at present.  It is desirable that there should be an agreed living wage for him, so that the farmer, the Minister and his advisers will know how to frame costings in the agricultural industry.  I think Deputy Corry will agree that the small farmer or the big farmer who does a good deal of tillage, who grows beet and wheat, is getting an economic price for that beet and wheat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the Minister is quite right in relating any additional cost which may be put on the farmers to the necessity for increased production.  I do not disagree with that viewpoint expressed by the Minister, whether this Minister or any future Minister, but the Minister suggests that working farmers and others should get down to business and plan for increased production in the future.  It does not matter what planning you have&mdash;you can have all the planning you like by <Col N="920" /> the farmer at his fireside after his day's work&mdash;if the farmer cannot get credit facilities to purchase machinery and work his farm in such a way as will bring about increased production, that increased production will not be brought about.  What is the use of talking to a farmer about increased production if he has not got the capital to enable him to work his farm or if he cannot get that capital at a lower rate from the banks than 5 or 6 per cent., or 4½ per cent. from the great Agricultural Credit Corporation of which the Minister is the father and the grandfather?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Corry or the Minister in particular can provide cheap credit facilities for the farmers, he will be doing something which will increase production and increase it quickly.  The farmers of other democratically governed countries can get credit facilities&mdash;some of them in competition with us on the foreign market&mdash;at as low a rate as 1 per cent. This is the greatest country in the world for the moneylender.  He can suck 5 and 6 per cent. out of the farmers after getting gilt-edged security for his money and the Minister seems to think that that is not related to increased production.  Is it beyond the bounds of reason that the Minister should tell the working farmers that they will be able to get money at 2 per cent., the average rate of interest at which the Governments of other countries similar to ours can provide money for farmers?  Is it not a fact that the British Government propose to give money in the near future, under the Government-controlled bank, to the farmers of England at the low rate of 2 per cent?  If the farmers of this country have to pay 5 and 6 per cent. for the money they need to develop their industry, how can they compete in the foreign market, or get profitable prices in that market as against competing countries which provide their farmers with money at 1 per cent. and 2 per cent., and not more than 2 per cent?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister mean to tell me that the £35,000,000 shown in the summarised bank balance sheets recently published does not include a very high figure representing advances to the agriculturists?  To my knowledge, certainly a big portion of the money is loaned to farmers.  Would it not be a great contribution if the Minister could bring about this state of affairs, if he could reduce the interest paid on those loans from 5 to 2 per cent.?  Would it not give the farmer a greater profit for the running of his industry and would it not help him, if the Minister desired to help him, to pay the small amount of the increased cost that might fall on him as a result of the operation of a measure of this kind?  I ask him to concentrate on that particular aspect of the farmer's problems and if he is able to use his influence and if the influence of the Government can be used to bring down the rates of interest paid by farmers to the joint stock banks or the Agricultural Credit Corporation, he will be doing a tremendous amount of good in helping to increase production.</P>

      <P>The lack of capital is one of the principal difficulties of the working farmer in increasing production.

I do not pretend to know more than the <Col N="922" /> gentleman I have in mind and I have no objection to giving the Minister his name, but I do not want to mention it here in this debate.  At any rate, Deputy Corry can be quite assured that the working farmers and their families are not opposed to the operation of a measure of this kind.  If the Minister, instructed by Deputy Corry &mdash;Deputy Corry forcing the Minister&mdash; will bring in a Bill to give the agricultural labourer £3 10s. a week or to increase credit facilities or any other facilities for working farmers, he will find the first Deputies to stand up in support of him will be the Deputies responsible for the promotion of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think enough has been said on this Bill and in other discussions that have taken place here to make it clear that, unless the agricultural labourer is so established in regard to wages and conditions of employment, that he is satisfied with his avocation in life and can support his family in reasonable comfort, there is going to be no solid foundation for our whole economy here.  It is also clear that we cannot bring that position about merely by passing resolutions or expressing opinions here.  There must be a very definite application of a plan and work and policy over quite a wide range of things.  Deputy Davin has indicated how many things might have to be taken into consideration before that desirable stage even would be reached.</P>
      <P>I welcome the approach of the Minister to the Bill before the House and would suggest to the promoters of the Bill that they would advance the idea they have in mind, in so far as it can be advanced at the moment, by taking the Minister's proposal this morning and not pressing this motion to a division&mdash;a division that might easily be misunderstood, since there is no one satisfied that this Bill, if passed in its present form, would solve the difficulty or bring about the conditions the promoters desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the Minister's proposals, there are seven regional agricultural wages boards in the country, with a chief Agricultural Wages Board <Col N="923" /> at the head.  I understand it is within the competence of any of those regional boards to discuss this question of holidays for agricultural workers.  As the boards are made up, however they may be appointed, of men who are accepted as being competent to speak the voice of the workers in agriculture on the one hand and the voice of the employing farmers on the other hand, we arrive at a very satisfactory and interesting point.  Following discussion here on a proposal to extend the idea of formal annual holidays to agricultural workers, we have the Minister's suggestion that this could be discussed profitably by any one of those bodies and that, if it is so discussed and further discussed by the chief Agricultural Wages Board, then the Minister thinks, in the first place, they would probably have power to arrange without legislation that holidays be given and, in any case, that he would be prepared sympathetically to consider proposals coming from that board, to the effect that legislation should be introduced. If that is the point we have reached, it would be a pity for us to divide here on the principle as to whether the agricultural labourers should have these particular holidays or not.  Everybody is agreed that the work of agriculture is so carried on that attention has to be paid to various aspects which have not to be taken care of from the point of view of time and period when you are dealing with an industrial occupation.  In the latter case, they can be fixed, but in the case of agriculture the work has to go on over the greater part of the day and the greater part of the year.</P>
    <P>I have been arguing the question of road workers' wages, as it is a thing we fixed here and on which we had explicit Government policy disclosed.  I have been protesting against keeping the road workers' wages down to the point to which they are being kept down, particularly in the light of various public bodies unanimously protesting against the level to which they have been kept down.  I have been urging that our plans and our development here must be such as to enable the rural worker to live in stable comfort and raise his family, without feeling <Col N="924" /> fretful that he wants to go to some other work or to some other place or to some other country.  To some extent, the agricultural labourer is the foundation of our whole group of rural workers.  I think it will be found that, given a plan thoroughly thought out, every section of the people will agree that we should not continue the situation in which the agricultural worker is as it were a pariah of our agricultural industry.  Such freedom and such leisure as can be made available for workers in industry will have to be made available ultimately for workers in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Given the approach of the Minister and the expression of the Minister's mind on that matter to-day, I think a very satisfactory advance would be made.  The regional agricultural wages boards could discuss this matter in a way we could not have it discussed, with all the facts in front of them. It would be discussed there by people deeply interested in the industry from every point of view.  That would be a constructive step along the road the promoters of this Bill are seeking to travel, and I suggest it would be more helpful if they did not insist on dividing on the measure in the form in which it is at the moment.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Corry is still a member of the Fianna Fáil Party or not.  I imagined from his speech that he was not, but so far we have had no indication of his formal severance from the Party.  For a Fianna Fáil Deputy he was particularly hard on the Minister.  It was a hard thing that, at the end of the 14 years of Fianna Fáil Government, Deputy Corry would say that the agricultural labourers were only unpaid serfs on the farm.  That was not a scintillating tribute to the Government's agricultural policy.  He told us, too, that after the same 14 years, if he gave an agricultural worker a week's holidays, that worker would have to go to the county home during the week. Then he sort of embroidered his tributes with statements such as &ldquo;the poor devil has not got five bob in his pocket&rdquo;, and &ldquo;he has not a decent suit to wear on Sunday&rdquo;.  Is not that just a glowing tribute to the success of <Col N="925" /> the Fianna Fáil Government's agricultural policy?  That is Deputy Corry, the agriculturist, talking, and remember, that is an analysis of the Government's agricultural policy that we got from the Government Benches to-day.

      <P>Deputy Corry talked about the happy association of the agricultural workers and the farmers. If a happy association exists, and it does not result in the grinding down of the agricultural labourer to the level that is described by Deputy Corry as equivalent to serfdom, everybody welcomes that association; but there are many farmers and agricultural workers who think it is very largely a case of the small man who married a lady of mammoth proportions, his romanticism having led him into that difficulty.  The wedding ceremony over, they come down the church steps and the little man, looking at the titanic proportions of his wife and wanting to be on good terms with her, said: &ldquo;Mary, now you and I are one.&rdquo; Looking down on John, Mary said: &ldquo;Yes, John, but I am the one.&rdquo;  This happy association, which Deputy Corry apparently wants to continue, is one which, according to himself, has produced a position in which the agricultural worker has not a decent suit for Sunday, has not five bob in his pocket, and if you give him a week's holidays, he has to go into the county home. There is surely something wrong with <Col N="926" /> an agricultural economy in which that condition of affairs is described as a happy association?  One shudders to think of the condition of the agricultural worker if the association were an unhappy one, if that is the best that can be produced by a happy association.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry, and the Minister in the earlier stages, said that this scheme of giving agricultural workers holidays will not work in Ireland.  We have some special dose of original sin that nothing will work here that works in other intelligently governed countries.  How does it work in New Zealand, where the agricultural output is the envy of every farmer in the world, where the prosperity of the agriculturist is the envy of every other agriculturist in the world?  How does it work in Denmark?  Both these countries beat us hollow in the British market.  They have an economic and agricultural structure far better than ours and they manage to give their agricultural workers holidays.  New Zealand is providing a minimum wage of five guineas a week.  We can give our workers only £2 a week of a maximum and no holidays, while New Zealand can give their workers five guineas a week, with holidays.  A bad suit of clothes on Sunday and only five bob in a man's pocket is something unknown there.  Hand in hand with the pauperising of the agricultural workers, we have a low agricultural output, whereas they can give good wages and holidays and they have a good agricultural output, something that we probably will never be able to attain.  However, I do not want to spend any more time dealing with what Deputy Corry said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that, so far as he knew, the farmers granted their workers Catholic holy-days.  It is true that some farmers do that, but it is equally true that a considerable number do not grant Catholic holy-days with pay to their workers.  A number of farmers allow holidays with pay and others allow holidays without pay. Where one farmer allows Catholic holy-days with pay, while many of his neighbours do not allow them with pay, surely some effort can be made to level <Col N="927" /> up that position?  If the Minister is right, that the generality of farmers allow Catholic holy-days, this Bill imposes no extra charge by making it obligatory on them to give the holidays set out and pay their workers when they take leave from their work on these days.  I have had letters since the Minister made his speech, from my own and other constituencies, in which it was indicated that these El Doradolike conditions that the Minister referred to do not exist, and if a person gets a day off to go to a race meeting, or takes a day off on a Catholic holy-day, in many instances he is deprived of any payment for the time he takes off.</P>
    <P>I have shown in my introductory speech that the cost of providing a week's holidays for an agricultural worker represents no more than £2 per annum to the farmer at the present rate of remuneration of agricultural workers.  That £2 per annum represents, roughly, 9d. per week.  Surely we are in the position in which agriculture is at least capable of paying an additional 9d. a week to agricultural workers?  If we cannot evolve an agricultural economy which is not capable of bearing the slight burden which the granting of a week's paid holidays will impose then we ought to give up agriculture as a branch of our national activities.</P>
    <P>The fact that an agriculturist like Deputy Corry feels bound to call for increased wages for agricultural workers, and the fact that every Deputy must know the seething discontent which exists among agricultural workers, indicate, whether this House likes it or not, and whether the agricultural industry likes it or not, that the agricultural workers insist that no longer are they to be what Deputy Corry describes them as, serfs of the agricultural industry.  My experience, particularly in recent months, convinces me that the agricultural worker has made up his mind that he is no longer to be exploited 54 hours a week for the miserable wage of £2, a rate utterly inadequate to enable him to provide for his wife and children and to buy the necessaries of life at the high price levels which <Col N="928" /> operate to-day.</P>
    <P>We have already had a sample of the fact that the agricultural worker is not going to be a door-mat any longer.  Very large numbers of agricultural workers in County Dublin have gone on strike.  They now insist that they should get a week's holidays with pay and that their wages should be £3 a week.  If the Minister is a wise man, he will recognise that what is happening in County Dublin is not an isolated protest by agricultural workers against their conditions.  It is symptomatic of the feeling of agricultural workers throughout the country.  I believe the County Dublin strike will spread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the demands in <Col N="929" /> that strike&mdash;payment for a week's holidays&mdash;is going to bring the whole question of the wage rate for agricultural workers right into the public view, and, whether the Minister likes it or not, these people are going to insist on getting holidays the same as every other class of worker in the community. Nobody here has attempted to show why they should be deprived of holidays, or that it would not be possible to evolve legislation providing for agricultural workers the same type of holidays as is granted to every other worker in industry, to every worker in shops and to those in domestic service. Are we driven to make this admission: that, while we can provide holidays for every other class of worker in the community, when we come to deal with the agricultural worker on whose efforts we have depended to such a large extent during the past six years, the best we can do to meet this problem is to offer him low wages and bad economic conditions: that we collapse completely when faced with this problem, and pretend that while we can provide wages for everybody else we cannot provide wages for the unfortunate agricultural worker?  I think that the agricultural workers have just got tired of listening to the flowery tributes paid to their services over the last six years.  Flowery tributes and low wages added together still leave only low wages.  The agricultural workers cannot live on low wages, and I am sure that they are not prepared to continue on the impoverished standard of living to which they have been condemned especially during the past six years of rising prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that one of the things we need in respect to agriculture is increased production.  I do not think anybody concerned with the welfare of the country will attempt to deny that one of the most essential things in this country is to intensify national production, because out of an increasing pool of wealth we can make available services and conditions of life which will not be present and will not be possible of diffusion if the standard of national production is low.  I suggest to the Minister that contentment is probably the cheapest agricultural <Col N="930" /> instrument that you can use on a farm. It is as essential as fertilisers are for prosperous farming.  You can have contentment on the land by showing the agricultural workers that you recognise the contribution which they make to national productivity, that you are not going to regard them as an untouchable class by denying them rights which every other class of worker has been able, by organisation, to wring from those employing them. You must make some approach to recognise the function of the agricultural worker, that he is an essential element within the community, and the way to do that is to extend to him recognition in the form of paid annual holidays.  In that way you can make a silent contribution to agriculture which, in the long run, will add to our national productivity by the factor of contentment in agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister whether he likes it or not, is nearer to paid annual holidays in the case of agricultural workers than he thinks he is.  I think that it is bound to come.  In very large measure it will probably come this year, whether the Agricultural Wages Board wishes it or not, and despite what the Minister will do or will not do.  I would prefer to see it done in a way removed from the acrimony and from the strife which I think will be associated with its coming.  The Minister and the House have an opportunity of showing now by their attitude towards this Bill that they are in favour of extending to agricultural workers the same holidays as those which have been granted to every other class of worker in the country. The Minister says that he thought this was a matter which the Agricultural Wages Board could deal with, provided it came up to it through the regional boards.  I have no faith whatever in the Agricultural Wages Board.  I do not think it would matter twopence to the country if that board was abolished to-morrow so far as the agricultural workers are concerned.  It has acted as chloroform on them because they have been looking to it to get increased wages.  If there had been no board they would have found other methods of getting increased wages, and from the <Col N="931" /> beginning could have looked for other methods.  I have no faith whatever in the board and the fact that the Minister should refer this to the board to consider just leaves me icy cold so far as expecting anything progressive from that board is concerned, a board which in 1946 could recommend a wage of £2 per week to agricultural workers when the cost of living had increased by over 70 per cent. as compared with 1939. Clearly, this is a board that has a rather Babylonian conception of what the conditions in the agricultural industry ought to be, and of what the standard of contentment and comfort ought to be in the homes of our agricultural workers to-day.  I am prepared to do this if the Minister will say that he will direct the board to give him a scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am prepared, if the Minister will direct this board to produce a definite scheme to give agricultural workers holidays on the same basis as all other workers get holidays, to withdraw this Bill, but that is on the clear and definite understanding that the board will be told to show the Minister ways and means of implementing a scheme of holidays for agricultural workers this year.  If the Minister is not prepared to do that, and judging by his rather heated interruption I gather that he is not, then there is only one course left to us, and that is to ask the House to express itself on the subject of granting holidays to agricultural workers.  We have been paying tributes to them for the last six years, telling them what fine <Col N="932" /> fellows they are, but when it comes to looking after their wage envelopes we put very little into them to measure our appreciation of their services.  We have now the opportunity of showing the agricultural workers that, if we have given holidays to every other class of worker in the country, we are not going to deny holidays to those who made such a magnificent contribution to the national effort during the last six years.  That is the simple test that I am now putting before the House.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the fate of this Bill may be.  The big battalions will decide that.  We shall see how Deputy Corry, who protested so much, shall emerge from the process of regimentation if it comes to the question of a vote.  The Minister owes it to himself, he owes it to the House, and he owes it to the agricultural workers of the country to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill as an endorsement of the principle of not regarding agricultural workers as outcasts; as an endorsement of the principle to extend to agricultural workers the same holidays as those which are granted to every other class of worker.  I suggest to the Minister, now that he has recovered from the temporary anger to which my surface reference to the Dublin strike gave rise, that that ought not to blind him to the responsibility which he owes to the agricultural workers.  I therefore appeal to all Parties to support the Second Reading of the Bill. The House, having endorsed the principle of paid holidays, can then discuss in what way that proposal can best be given effect.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton asked me about the matter of giving a direction to the board.  I explained to him&mdash; perhaps he did not understand me&mdash; that legally I cannot do that.  When the Agricultural Wages Bill was going through the Dáil the Labour Party insisted that I could not give a direction to the board, and, therefore, I cannot understand why Deputy Norton should make such a recommendation as he has made.</P>
