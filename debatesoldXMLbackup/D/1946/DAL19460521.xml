      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the price of industrial turf, which had previously been 25/- per ton, was increased to 30/- per ton, from the 11th April, 1946, and to 40/- per ton from the 16th April, 1946, by Fuel Importers (Eire) Limited; that these changes are very disturbing to industrial firms which have been using industrial turf and impose large and unexpected increases in fuel costs; and if he will cause inquiry to be made as to the reasons for these increases and state whether they are warranted, and, if so, what has brought them about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial turf to which the Deputy refers is the residual turf left in the dumps after disposal by Fuel Importers (Éire), Limited, of the supplies considered suitable for domestic use.  As Fuel Importers' turf trading activities entail the payment of a substantial subsidy, the company are required to dispose of this residue at the best possible price in order to minimise the subsidy payments.  The price realised for the turf varies according to the time and circumstances of its sale.  Industrial concerns using turf are not obliged to purchase it from Fuel Importers (Éire), Limited, and may, by arranging for the direct production of their own requirements, avoid if they wish any disturbing effects of the fluctuation in the price of supplies from Fuel Importers, which <Col N="358" /> is fixed in relation to the quality and the demand from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether he is causing inquiries to be made as to why the price should be changed by an addition of 5/- on the 11th April, and why a further additional charge of 10/- should be made on the 16th April?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have told the Deputy, the price of this turf varies from place to place and from time to time, according to the circumstances of its sale.  The prices quoted by the Deputy refer to one concern and to one area.  There prices would not necessarily be charged to concerns in other areas.  Fuel Importers, Limited, are endeavouring to secure the best possible price for that residual turf.  The price it secures is, obviously, determined by the demand for it, and by the quality of the turf itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister surely will realise that if there is an accumulation of turf in one particular centre, and if there are industrial users depending on it, it is frightfully unsatisfactory to them, in depending on these fuel supplies, to have an increase in one week of 5/- per ton, and a week afterwards a further increase of 10/- a ton.  In all, these increases might involve an additional expenditure on fuel for 12 months of, say, £2,500 or £2,300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Industrial users should not be depending on this turf.  All industrial users were urged to make arrangements to meet their own turf needs, and have no assurance whatever that this turf will be available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So that industrialists may take it that for practical purposes Fuel Importers, Limited, and industrial turf are going out of business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The business of Fuel Importers, Limited, is to provide, store and dispose of turf for domestic purposes. Some proportion of the turf that they acquire may be found to be unsuitable for domestic use, and, consequently, may be sold for industrial purposes, but industrialists can have <Col N="359" /> no assurance that a supply of this turf will be available to them.</P>

    <P>All of this timber is of building quality and has been reserved primarily for work in respect of which building licences are issued under Emergency Powers (No. 358) Order, 1945.</P>
    <P>Building licences for the various categories of building&mdash;houses, hospitals, factories, schools, etc.&mdash;are issued in proportions as near as possible to those indicated in the White Paper on the post-war building programme <Col N="360" /> published in February, 1945. The allocation for housing for the year 1946 is approximately 50 per cent. of the total, 30 per cent. being for houses built by local authorities and 20 per cent. for houses built by private enterprise. Licences to authorise the building of houses will be issued up to this maximum and it may be taken that timber will be available for any work so authorised, but timber cannot be held in reserve for projects that may not materialise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the remuneration of officers of local authorities is generally unsatisfactory and, in many cases, is not sufficient to enable the recipients to enjoy an adequate standard of living; and whether, in view of the development and extension of public services administered by local authorities, he will give immediate effect to clause 4 (i) of the Local Government (Officers) Regulations, 1943, with the object of improving the standard of remuneration and living of such officers, as well as encouraging a higher standard of efficiency.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  In regard to the second part of the question the Deputy appears to be under a misapprehension as to the purpose of Article 4 of the regulations to which he refers.  Article 4 deals with the submission of the officers' schemes by the local authorities. The officers' schemes should not contain proposals to alter the standards of remuneration or conditions of service of local officers.</P>

      <P>The difficulties arise in connection with the increased checking and certification that would be necessary and the diversion of the services of technical officers to this work.  It is open to local authorities to pay wages weekly subject, of course, to the prescribed safeguards against irregular payments.  The matter has been examined on more than one occasion and county councils generally have not found it feasible to adopt a system of weekly payments.  In part of one county it appears to have been tried and abandoned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Laoighis County Council acquired portion of the Derrykearn bog and that up to 1945 the county council granted temporary turf production facilities in the bog to a number of private persons. I am informed that these facilities have been withdrawn, as the council have undertaken turf production in the area for the 1946 season so as to produce the quantity of turf required. The persons concerned were fully aware that the accommodation provided was of temporary duration.  I am informed that there are alternative bogs in the district available for letting on terms not less favourable than those granted by the county council.  If this accommodation is not available or cannot be obtained the county council should be so informed in order that the matter be reexamined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the county council have been so informed and that the only alternative turf banks that can be suggested by the county council to these 11 families are in an area where turf is either non-existent or nonusable? Further, is he aware that many of these 11 families were in the position of occupying, as tenants, the turf banks taken over for more than 25 years before the county council started their activities on the banks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Our information is slightly more favourable.  We understand that turf is available on the de Vesci estate bog, which is the same distance from the lessees as the previous bog.  The turf may be of slightly inferior quality, but it should <Col N="364" /> be suitable.  If no satisfaction can be obtained, the matter can be reopened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's information is half correct. There is turf on the de Vesci estate, but every bank there worth working has been working since the beginning of the emergency.  The county council did not consider the turf banks left on the de Vesci estate worth cutting; that is why they dispossessed these people. I think that it is only necessary to place all the facts before the Parliamentary Secretary and then justice will be done.  In the circumstances, I will ask the permission of the Chair to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has no function in the allocation of briefs to counsel appearing on behalf of the State so that the question of his consent does not arise.  The briefing of counsel is a matter for the Attorney-General.</P>
      <P>I understand that briefs are usually given out well in advance of the fixing of the court lists and that, consequently, it is not always possible for counsel to say with certainty that they will be available but, in all cases, the basis upon which counsel are briefed is that they will be in a position to attend at the hearing.</P>

    <P>The Attorney-General is not aware of any practice whereby the same counsel is briefed in cases which are at hearing simultaneously in different courts held at widely separated venues. Every effort is made by the Attorney-General at the time of selecting counsel to ensure that no clash of engagements will arise.  It does, however, occur at times that, owing to the arrangement of court lists or the unexpected termination of other proceedings, <Col N="366" /> cases in which the same counsel are briefed come on for hearing on the same day.  Where the cases are in the same court or where it appears likely that the cases will be taken at different times of the day, no difficulty arises; where, however, it is clear that counsel will not be in a position to attend at the hearing, the practice is that he returns his brief and another counsel is briefed in his place.  Occasionally, where, owing to the unexpected listing of State cases, it is not practicable to brief another counsel, the counsel already briefed arrange, with the prior approval of the Attorney-General and in accordance with the usual practice of the Bar, that one of them shall attend to one case and the other counsel to the other, but there are the usual co-operation and consultation between the counsel as to the conduct and direction of such cases.  The arrangement of court lists is dealt with by the appropriate court officers, and is not a matter within the control of the Attorney-General.</P>
    <P>In general, fees are not paid to counsel in respect of two or more briefs in cases simultaneously at hearing and, indeed, any question of such payment can scarcely arise in view of the practice of the Attorney-General's office.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the Government in regard to the strike of national teachers in Dublin has been stated clearly on a number of occasions, namely, that the proposals made to the national school teachers represented the utmost extent to which the existing scales could be increased having regard to the other demands upon the taxpayer.  Provision had been made <Col N="367" /> for a review of the position in three years.  In the light of these circumstances, the only way in which the present situation can be terminated is by the teachers now on strike resuming duty and I can only express the earnest hope that they will do so at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the statements made, by the medical officer of Portlaoighise Prison, at the inquest on the late Seán MacCaughey, on Saturday, May 11th, 1946, that for a period of four and a half years the deceased had not been allowed out into the fresh air, had been kept in solitary confinement and not allowed to speak or associate with any other person, and also that he, the medical officer, would not treat a dog in that fashion; and whether, in view of these statements, he will immediately order that a sworn inquiry be held to investigate prison conditions in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to order that an inquiry should be held to investigate prison conditions in this country. There is no need for such an inquiry. The prison conditions here are well known to compare favourably with those in any other country.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the late Seán MacCaughey and seven other prisoners who were found guilty of the most serious crimes that could be committed against the community, including murder and attempted murder, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These men on being sent to Portlaoighise Prison demanded that they be allowed to wear their own clothes, contrary to the rule that all long-term prisoners shall wear clothes of a uniform make and colour as prescribed. This demand being rejected, these prisoners refused to wear the clothes provided for them and, instead, improvised garments from their blankets.  For obvious reasons of discipline, they could not be allowed to appear before other prisoners, or to go out of doors while so attired.  On this <Col N="368" /> account also, they have been exempted from the work usually prescribed.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that these men are kept in solitary confinement or are not allowed to associate with any other person.  They are allowed to associate, for recreation, for two periods of one and a half hours each (three hours in all) every day in a large and well-ventilated room, the windows of which look out on the prison farm.  In addition, they are frequently visited by members of the visiting committee, the chaplain, the governor, officers of the prison and the inspector of the prisons division of the Department of Justice, They are allowed to write letters and to receive letters, newspapers and books.  They are given the ordinary prison diet with occasional additions. So far as any unusual restrictions are imposed on them, this is necessitated solely by their own action in refusing to conform to the ordinary prison regulations by wearing the clothes provided for them.</P>
    <P>MacCaughey's health was good until he went on hunger strike and the health of the others has similarly been uniformly good, and MacCaughey went on hunger strike not because of the conditions of his imprisonment but to force his release.</P>
    <P>The matters referred to in the Deputy's question were not the subject of inquiry at the inquest.  Any reference to them arose out of questions asked in cross-examination by counsel representing the next-of-kin and pressed contrary to the deputy coroner's ruling. The replies given by a single witness under the type of cross-examination to which he was subjected do not give any true picture of the real situation.</P>
    <P>The questions at issue are these: Must the Government distinguish between those who commit murder and other serious crimes for one reason and those who seek to justify their crimes on the ground that they have a political aim in view?  Must we allow convicted prisoners to dictate the conditions under which they are to be detained?  Must we allow them to force their release by going on hunger strike and so enable them to commit their crimes with impunity?  It must be clear <Col N="369" /> to the Deputy and to everybody else that if the answer to these questions were &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, there would be an end to all restraint of evildoers and to all effective efforts to preserve ordered conditions in the community.</P>
    <P>For a long time, the Government pursued a deliberate policy of leniency towards the group to which these men belong.  We failed to get them to respect or recognise the rights of the community, but we have no intention of allowing them to enforce their will by organised crime.  During the recent war, these men, if they had their way, would have brought immeasurable disaster on this nation.  Short of execution, our only safeguard against their violence is imprisonment and we shall not allow them to deprive the community of that safeguard by the hunger strike or any other device.</P>

In these various places, the Tourist Board hold hotels, farmhouses and lands of different kinds, which, according to the Minister's statement, they propose to hand over to a new temporary company which they will set up.  That temporary company will run these hotels, will establish cafés and carry them on until such time as they make up their mind that they will sell the property which they have in a particular locality and which they have developed to some private person or group of private persons.  I asked the Minister if he could give us a picture of the number of these and the value and total cost of the proposed developments, together with the amount of money likely to be locked up in the company.  The Minister indicated that there would be simply a nominal capital for the company; but I suggest that that is rather an unsatisfactory way in which to leave this matter.  If the company is going to be set up and certain capital assets are going to be transferred to the company the whole should be disclosed in the company's account as a definite capital holding by the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was dealing with this matter he agreed that the approach had been radically changed from the time when the original Bill was introduced.  He stated that the reason why the approach of the board had been changed was because of the emergency conditions; but he rather threw emphasis on the nature of the change that had taken place&mdash;on the amount of development work that had taken place&mdash;and not on the extent to which the board was going in to do work which would normally be carried on by private enterprise.  To my mind, the real change in the board's workings, as compared with the complexion the Minister put on it when dealing with the original Bill, is that the board has begun to go in in an enormous way for work that should be normally carried on by private enterprise.  In the various places I have mentioned they are not only purchasing and opening and running hotels, but they are planning to develop and open cafés. For that reason, I would like to have some more definite financial information as to the amount of money which is likely to be spent and the reason why, for instance, it was found necessary for the Tourist Board to open a café at Salthill in Galway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not necessarily mean that the board is going to operate it.  As a matter of fact, in the case of Salthill I understand that private enterprise is now showing an interest in the development of the locality in which the board was interested. Should that prove to be the case the board will, of course, step down.  Their plan involves the erection of baths, a café, and other facilities in the locality, but the operation of the café would be carried out by some person who would rent the premises erected by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave the Minister a blank cheque for the original Bill but very radical changes have taken place since and work is now being undertaken by the board which is definitely an invasion into the theatre of private enterprise and an invasion into the sphere of private enterprise&mdash;in other words, getting facilities for the setting up of these things and for building materials, and so on, which are not normally available to private persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary thing that the board is able to go ahead with these things and that a development which one would normally expect on the part of private enterprise is not going ahead in any way which would reflect the amount of advances made by the board to private persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but, as I explained to the Deputy, while it was originally intended that the board should in the matter of the development of hotel accommodation stimulate private enterprise and facilitate private enterprise by the provision of financial accommodation, the fact is that private enterprise, in the earlier stages of the <Col N="376" /> war at any rate, was most reluctant to commit itself to projects of that kind and consequently there was little or no development.  It is only now I think that there is any real prospect that private enterprise is becoming active and the board will have on the enactment of this measure resources from which they can give assistance, if in fact assistance is required; but the general policy of the board is to stimulate and assist private enterprise and not to compete in any way with private enterprise.  It will follow that policy throughout its main lines of activity.</P>

I would prefer that this Bill to increase the limit of the advances to the board should have been held over until the end of this year because I think at that stage it would have been possible to have shown in a more practicable way the nature of the work on which the board will be engaged and the extent to which it would be able to carry it out.  Many of their resort development schemes, even those in relation to which there is no difficulty, <Col N="377" /> either existing or anticipated, in the matter of acquiring property or securing the co-operation of local authorities, will not be undertaken until the end of the present season.  In so far as these schemes involve the expenditure of money at existing holiday resorts, it is obviously desirable that such work should not be carried out until the winter months when visitors would not normally be patronising these resorts.  At the present time, therefore, we can only talk in terms of plans on paper and I have given the House all the information at my disposal concerning these plans.  Obviously the officers of the board may have ideas concerning the fuller development of these plans &mdash;ideas which may or may not prove to be practicable or justifiable when put to the test.  But it would be wrong to give as plans what are no more than ideas at the present time.</P>
      <P>I have given the House all the information I can as to the board's projects, which have been approved of by me and the amounts of the advances that will be approved to the board for the completion of these projects, together with a general indication as to the nature of the projects themselves. I am not in a position to give any further information at this stage. I have certainly no desire to withhold information from the House.  If I had any further information I would be very glad to give it to the House.</P>

      <P>Assuming that in the course of this year people operating in a private capacity undertake, say, development of a locality which the board proposed to develop under their scheme as outlined, will the board cease to operate in that locality if it appears to them that a private individual or a private company are undertaking a suitable hotel or suitable cafés or whatever other amenities may be necessary in the area?  If the board realises that at the end of this year a private person or private company will have got sufficiently under way with a hotel or other facilities, will the board then allow such private enterprise to operate free from competition in the area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us leave aside for a moment the question of hotels.  As I explained, the board acquired hotels more or less because of an accidental combination of circumstances and will dispose of these hotels.  It is not intended that the board should go into the hotel business at all and certainly there will be no approval of any plan of the board to erect hotels or acquire hotels which will put them into direct competition with private enterprise.  The hotel properties or the properties which will be developed as hotels are being transferred to another company and will ultimately be disposed of to private owners, if private owners are willing to acquire them on terms and conditions that the board would regard as fair to itself. Apart from the question of hotels acquired by the board, or the assistance which the board gives to ordinary private hotel owners, its main activities will be the development of holiday resorts.  The Deputy asks me if the board will allow other people to build cafés and, if other people build cafés, will the board refrain from doing anything that would involve competition with them.  I want to make clear what are the obligations on the board.  The board is obliged to recover all the money it gets for these resort developments.  These moneys for resort development are in no way being given as grants.  The obligation is on the board to get back the whole amount and to get it back with a profit, if it can.  It goes to a resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take Tramore as an example, because work has been done at Tramore.  It took an area of waste land, which had been subject to flooding and was of no commercial value until a great deal of work had been done upon it and a great deal of money expended on drainage.  It has been engaged in the reclamation of that land with a view to developing it as an estate.  The aim of the board will be, having provided amenities and facilities of various kinds for that locality, to dispose of that land in lots to people who are willing to put up shops, hotels, restaurants, or other facilities which the resort requires, getting back in ground rents or in the sale price of <Col N="379" /> the land its own expenditure.  Clearly, if other people proceed to develop these businesses, not upon the board's property, but in some other part of the locality, then the board would have to take positive measures to ensure that it was not just left with its developed estate and nobody using it.  It would have to promote, as they have done, in fact, in the case of Tramore, a local company, which is going to undertake the development of the area.  While, therefore, the board would not ordinarily seek to go into competition with private enterprise, its primary concern will be to develop the property which it acquires and to dispose of that property in a manner which will secure it against loss.  That was the development scheme in the case of Tramore. In some other case it may consist of the development of baths or tennis courts or of some other facilities of that kind, again with a view to enhancing the value of the property in the immediate vicinity.  It will endeavour to dispose of that property at its enhanced value, but may have to recover its money by utilising the land for the erection of buildings to rent to people or in some other way to get back the amount it expended.  I think the Deputy will understand the limitations there will be upon the board's activities in these matters if he keeps in mind that the money so expended must be recovered by the board.  It is in no sense a grant, but a repayable advance which must be got back by the board by raising the value of the property it acquires.</P>

    <P>In sub-section (1), line 22, to insert before the word &ldquo;inspected&rdquo; the words &ldquo;either expressly or by implication made known to the owner the <Col N="382" /> purpose for which he requires the goods and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is, I think, to obviate any difficulty arising from a difference between the sample of the goods and the article supplied. The words make more clear that the obligation is on the hirer to explain explicitly the purpose for which he requires the goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps on this amendment I may express a view which applies to many of the amendments tabled to this Bill&mdash;that is, that the legislation should be confined to dealing with the abuses which have arisen, or which may arise, in connection with hire-purchase transactions and that it is not necessary to give to persons acquiring goods under hire-purchase agreements safeguards which are not considered necessary in the case of persons buying goods for cash.  What we propose in this section is that the obligation on the owner of the goods to make known to the prospective hire-purchaser the cash price of the goods will be fully discharged if the hire-purchaser, having entered the owner's premises, sees the goods on the premises, or similar goods, with the price clearly marked on them either by means of a ticket or the other devices used by shopkeepers for the purpose of indicating the sale price of commodities. I think that that is a sufficient safeguard.  It is the only safeguard which the person has who is buying for cash.  The person buying on a hire-purchase agreement has the same opportunity which the cash buyer has of inspecting the goods and satisfying himself whether they meet his requirements and whether they are value for the money or not.  The primary intention of this section is effected when it is made known to the purchaser what he is paying for the hire-purchase facility&mdash;in other words, the difference between the cash price and the hire-purchase price.  He knows precisely how much the facility of hire-purchase is costing him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not agree to Deputy Coogan's amendment because it would introduce a number of complications. It is desirable that this legislation <Col N="383" /> should be as simple as possible because many of its provisions will, no doubt, be contested in court and, the more complications we introduce into it, the more likely it is that at some stage a court decision will arise which will have the effect of limiting the operation of the Bill or facilitating those who want to evade its provisions. Deputy Coogan's amendment would introduce a variety of obligations which would be unnecessary, having regard to the general circumstances with which this section is intended to deal.  I think that we shall have met our obligations fully if the person buying goods on a hire-purchase agreement has brought to his attention their cash price in the form of a written statement or is shown other like goods with the cash price clearly marked upon them.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what the necessity is for the words I propose to delete.  If an individual goes into premises and inspects the goods, surely the transaction should end there.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that, with these words in the section, there is the possibility of abuse.  I can see no reason for the addition of those words in the case of a purchaser who goes into the premises and selects the goods.  Those are the goods he requires and not goods of a different and, perhaps, inferior quality which might be supplied at a later stage.  I am afraid that the addition of those words to the section leaves it open to abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No more than in the case of a cash purchase.  Take the ordinary run of goods which are bought under hire-purchase agreements&mdash; bicycles, wireless sets and so forth. They are usually of a standardised type.  A man decides to buy a bicycle at so much down and so much per week.  He selects a well-known make of bicycle, inspects it and says: &ldquo;I <Col N="384" /> will buy that particular type of bicycle&rdquo;.  When the bicycle delivered to him is of that type, the transaction is completed.  Whether the actual bicycle he inspected is the bicycle delivered to his house might be difficult to prove.  The hire-purchaser is in no different position in that regard from that of the cash purchaser.  In each case, the transaction is settled with the delivery of the goods.  It would be unwise to put on the owner of the goods the obligation to deliver the precise article that was inspected, with the possibility of legal proceedings arising out of the issue, whether, in fact, the bicycle or wireless set which was delivered was the exact bicycle or wireless set demonstrated in the shop.  If the article delivered is of an inferior type, both classes of customers have means of redress.  The only question that arises here is that of the disclosure of the cash price.  What we are requiring is that the hirer shall have an opportunity of inspecting the article he proposes to hire with the cash price marked on it or a similar article with the cash price marked on it, so that he will know what the cash price is and what the hire-purchaser facility will cost him.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point so far as it relates to standard or proprietary articles.  He mentioned a bicycle.  A man who desired to buy a bicycle and wanted a particular make would, I admit, be satisfied if, desiring a Raleigh bicycle, he were to be supplied with a bicycle of that make, even though it was not the bicycle he inspected in the shop. I do not know, however, whether the Minister is an expert in furniture any more than I am.  There are no two commodities.  I think, in respect of which the ordinary individual can be so easily humbugged as furniture and jewellery.  Generally speaking, there is no standard type of furniture, though there were a few firms making furniture of a special type here.  If the furniture were of standard type, there would be substance in the Minister's point but I am afraid that the insertion of those words will place a disability on the purchaser so far as articles like furniture are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have extended the scope of this Bill to cover all hire-purchase transactions and we must keep that fact in mind when considering matters of this kind.  In the case of a motor car&mdash;motor cars are frequently the subject of hire-purchase agreements&mdash;the normal practice is to have a demonstration car which the prospective purchaser inspects and the performance of which he is in a position to judge, it being understood that he will get delivery of a similar car from the works at some later time, when available.  You could not, in that case, require that the demonstration car must be the car to be delivered.  If that were done, no hire-purchase agreement would be possible at all, because the effect of the deletion of those words would be to make it an offence for the owner of the goods&mdash;in this case, a motor car&mdash;to effect a hire-purchase sale unless the purchaser had an opportunity of inspecting the exact car which was to be delivered to him.</P>
      <P>The safeguard which this section is intended to provide is the limited safeguard of making known to the purchaser the exact cash price.  Having regard to all the circumstances of the various types of cases which might arise, that purpose is served if the hire-purchaser has an opportunity of inspecting the goods, or like goods, on which the cash price is clearly marked.</P>

      <P>At the end of sub-section (1) (b) to add the words &ldquo;and is supplied with a warranty which states that the goods are similar in every detail to those described in the catalogue, price list or advertisement, as the case may be&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was referred to also on the Second Reading, and I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that a considerable amount of this business is done by means of catalogue or advertisement and there is no opportunity for personal inspection.  In these circumstances, I suggest that the individual concerned should have a warranty along the lines suggested in <Col N="386" /> the amendment, that is, that the goods are similar in every detail to those described in the catalogue, price list or advertisement, as the case may be. I suggest that that is a reasonable precaution in the case of the business of a widespread character which takes place under advertisement or catalogue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My first answer to the Deputy is that the person who buys from a catalogue or advertisement under a hire-purchase agreement is in no worse position than the person who buys for cash; and the purchase of goods from a catalogue for cash is an everyday transaction.  I have explained that I do not think it is necessary, and from many points of view I do not think it is desirable, that we should impose, in relation to hire purchase sales, more onerous conditions on the trader than apply in the case of cash sales, except where they are clearly necessary to eliminate abuses associated with hire-purchase. I would refer the Deputy to Section 9 (1), paragraph (d), which gives a reasonable safeguard to the hire-purchaser. It provides that, except where the goods are hired as second-hand goods, every hire-purchase agreement shall contain an implied condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality, so, however, that no such condition shall be implied as regards defects of which the owner could not have reasonably been aware at the time the agreement was made or, if the hirer has examined the goods, as regards defects which the examination ought to have revealed. We are providing there that the hire-purchase agreement shall be deemed to contain in it a condition to the effect that the goods are of merchantable quality.  That gives the purchaser of the goods on a hire-purchase agreement a right against the hirer if, in fact, the goods on delivery to him are not of merchantable quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main objection to the Deputy's amendment is that it puts restrictions on hire-purchase sales which do not apply to cash sales, and I think that is undesirable.  I expressed here on the Second Reading the view that, while we should endeavour to eliminate the <Col N="387" /> abuses that have been associated with or might arise in connection with hire-purchase agreements, we must not go so far as to make that form of trading impracticable or unduly risky for traders.  I think it is a form of trading which has social advantages, if properly supervised; and certainly very many people in this country have been enabled to raise their standard of living by reason of the existence of hire-purchase facilities.  The putting into legislation of that idea involves the acceptance of the limitations to which I referred upon the provisions of this Bill, namely, that they should not put, in respect of these transactions, restrictions on hire purchase sales which do not apply in the case of cash sales.  In the case of persons buying goods from a catalogue for cash, they rely on the reputation of the firm and upon their rights if the goods are mis-described in the catalogue.  The hire-purchaser has precisely the same rights, but it is not proposed to give him any additional ones.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (b), line 46, to insert before the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; the words &ldquo;including a calculation of the rate of interest taken into account on arriving at such purchase price&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move it merely for the purpose of ascertaining if the Minister is satisfied whether the definition of &ldquo;hire-purchase&rdquo; in Section 1 includes the total amount of interest payable under an agreement of this kind.  In sub-section (2) of Section 3, paragraph (b), it is stated that the note or memoranda shall contain a statement of the hire-purchase price.  Will that include the interest for which the hirer would be liable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the hire-purchase price is concerned, the safeguard we give the purchaser is that he is informed, in a specific personal way, <Col N="388" /> what the hire-purchase facilities will cost him.  We are not proposing under this Bill to control the cost of hire-purchase facilities.  There is a Control of Prices Act in operation and it may be that that Act will be extended and amended in the future.  If it should be considered necessary at any time to control the price of hire-purchase facilities, it will be done under a control of prices measure and not under this measure.  What Deputy Coogan's amendment suggests, however, is that the purchaser should be informed of the method of calculating the interest, which is a most complicated business. There are different methods by which interest can be calculated and, if the Deputy's amendment were accepted, very elaborate provisions would have to be inserted in the Bill.  There is a very substantial difference between the effective rate of interest and the nominal rate of interest and the calculations that would be involved in determining the difference between one and another would be far outside the capacity of the average person buying under a hire purchase agreement.</P>
      <P>I think it is undesirable that this amendment should be accepted.  We have satisfied the requirements of this legislation if we let the purchaser know the precise amount in cash that he is going to pay for the hire-purchase facilities.  If at any stage it should appear necessary to limit the cost of hire-purchase facilities, the rate of interest that may be charged or the difference between the cash price and the hire-purchase price allowed in any particular case, it would be done under the control of prices legislation and not under this legislation.  Ordinarily, I think we should maintain the principle that, so long as the buyer knows precisely what he is doing, what goods he is getting and what price he is paying for them, it is for himself to decide whether the transaction is in his interests or not.</P>

      <P>As set out in the explanatory memorandum, under the minimum payment clause a hirer must pay one-half of the value of the goods whether he continues to hire them or not.  Actually that is the position under the 1938 Bill in Great Britain. I pointed out on the Second Reading why the question of &ldquo;one-half&rdquo; was introduced.  The Bill there was a Private Members' Bill, and was subject to minor restrictions, and the mover in order to preserve it had to give way on many principles.  This is one that she did not like.  I suggest that it would be a hardship for an individual to have to continue paying if, in certain circumstances, he wanted to make other arrangements, provided the goods were not of a type that would be subject to depreciation in any great measure.  I think it would be well if the figure were &ldquo;one-third&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;one-half&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This is a matter on which one has to exercise individual judgment.  I expressed the view that whatever provision you put into the Bill, you should have in mind the dual purpose, of protecting against abuses while, at the same time, facilitating a form of trading which has social benefits. I think that if we were to adopt the Deputy's amendment we would face the risk of making hire-purchase trading impossible for a very considerable range of goods.  The difference between the price of many articles sold as new, and the price of the same articles sold as second-hand, is often considerable. I suppose the earliest form of hire-purchase trading with which most Deputies came into contact was the sale of books, such as D'Alton's <i>History of Ireland</i>, the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> and similar books sold on the monthly payment system.  I am sure that no Deputy would agree that volumes of that kind which were acquired and read should be returnable to the hirer after one-third of the <Col N="390" /> purchase price had been paid, the buyer of the books either regretting having entered into the transaction or having read everything in them that interested him.  But the books would no longer be saleable by the hirer at anything like two-thirds of the original price, because books, like a motor-car, or certain other commodities do deteriorate considerably in value once they have been used, and once they can no longer be sold as new.</P>
      <P>I think it is a reasonable protection for a trader to ask a person proposing to make a purchase under a hire-purchase agreement to remember that, once he enters into agreement, he is liable for one-half of the purchase price, even if he subsequently regrets the transaction and desires to avoid full liability under it.  I think it is protection for a buyer to be able to return goods when he has paid half the amount.  I believe it would stop a great deal of hire-purchase trading if we were to reduce the figure from one-half to one-third, as over a very wide range of commodities traders could not sell goods on hire-purchase without loss falling on them, in view of the possibility of the goods being of very reduced value if returned when only one-third had been paid.</P>

      <P>This particular amendment fell down in the British Parliament but that does not mean that it did not gain a good deal of backing.  I think there is a pretty big volume of opinion that one-third of the payment is a substantial amount, while it gives the individual a chance of breaking away on what would be regarded equitable terms.</P>

    <P>Here I am trying to protect the individual who, obviously, is not an expert on the value of things, particularly of furniture.  I can only point to the fact that young people making a purchase in the early stage of their career accept what might appear to them to be an exceedingly nice article, but eventually find that it is not all that it appeared to be.  As the Minister stated on the Second Reading there are certain types of people who must be protected from themselves, and I suggest that this is what the amendment proposes to do.  It is only people who are experts in the business will be able to assess the value of articles.</P>

      <P>Here again a question arises whether a person acquires goods on hire-purchase should not be asked to rely on his own judgment, at least to the same extent as if buying goods for cash.  My main difficulty in relation to the amendment is the problem that would arise if we were to attempt to define in this Bill what constituted a trained observer.  We could not possibly have the phrase there without attempting to define it.  Having regard to the general nature of the Bill, it would be almost impossible to get a definition which would stand a test of legal action.  The scope of the Bill is so wide that we could easily see a position where persons would become professional trained observers in cases of legal actions arising out of the measure.  Whether they would be accepted by the courts as such I could not determine.  I think the section as it stands is reasonably adequate.  The agreement under which the hire-purchase transaction is made is assumed to have in it an implied condition that the goods are of merchantable quality.</P>

      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;so, however, that no such conditions shall be implied by virtue of <Col N="392" /> this paragraph as regards defects of which the owner could not reasonably have been aware at the time when the agreement was made...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the same protection as is available to the seller of goods for cash. Under the law as it stands he is not regarded as having misrepresented the goods or misled the buyer, and if any defect found subsequently were of such a character he could not reasonably be expected to know it.</P>
    <P>Similiarly, there is no obligation upon the seller of goods to pay damages to a purchaser, where he sells for cash under a hire-purchase agreement, if the purchaser of the goods has examined a sample of the goods and claims in respect of a defect which should have been apparent during the examination.  I would remind the Deputy that I have expressed the view that we should not, in matters of this kind, endeavour to put the purchaser of goods under a hire-purchase agreement in a different position from that of the purchaser of goods for cash.  The purchaser of goods for cash has to protect himself by inspecting the goods. He is not entitled to claim a refund of the purchase price on the ground that the goods have defects of any kind which he should have seen when he bought the goods.  We think it is undesirable to put the hire-purchaser in a different position.  We do say to him that &ldquo;the goods are of merchantable quality, your agreement so specifies, even though it does not say so in so many words, but it will be so interpreted by the courts; the seller of the goods will not be liable to you if the defect of which you complain is of a kind of which he could not have been expected to know; you will have no complaint if the defect in respect of which you claim is one that you should have seen when you were buying the goods.&rdquo;  Defect, in this connection, may not mean inferior quality.  It may refer to the unsuitability of the article purchased for the particular purpose for which the buyer requires it.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that people buy bicycle tyres under hire-purchase agreements, but it would not be a ground for a claim if a tyre was of the size that a purchaser requested but found, <Col N="393" /> when he went home, not to fit his bicycle.  One can easily see circumstances in which a similiar issue would arise in respect of articles of greater value.  Clearly, while most traders will endeavour to meet the wishes of their customers if they can do so without loss to themselves, we think it is sufficient to prescribe in the law that the complaint must be in regard to a defect of which the purchaser was not aware when he was effecting the purchase.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 10 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) In respect of any goods to which this Act applies the rate of profit charged by the owner thereof shall not exceed such rate as may be prescribed by the Minister from time to time.</P>
      <P>(2)  In prescribing a rate of profit under this section the Minister shall have regard to the manufacturer's price of the goods concerned but in any case the Minister shall not prescribe a rate of profit which exceeds 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that, on the Second Reading of the Bill, I drew attention to another side of this hire-purchase business, namely, the rate of profit.  This Bill undoubtedly makes provision for a good deal of protection so far as the hire-purchaser is concerned. It contains quite a number of features in regard to protection that did not operate heretofore, but I suggest to the Minister that these will, in a certain sense, be negatived, if the vital precaution is not taken of controlling the rate of profit so far as particular goods are concerned.  Here again arises the tendency there is for trading of this particular kind.  Young married couples at the outset are concerned to set up a house.  Their only consideration is to get a suite of furniture. They are not so much concerned with the question of price.  At least, at that stage price is not of such great importance to them because they <Col N="394" /> know that the payments are to be spread over a considerable period.  It is, however, important, because of the extent of this trade and at the stage in their lives when so many people enter into these contracts, that they should be rigidly protected from anything in the nature of excessive or inflated prices.</P>
    <P>My information is&mdash;I cannot vouch for anything by way of a positive statement&mdash;that the rate of profit covering certain sections of this trade runs to about 100 per cent.  If that be so, then obviously it is an exorbitant rate.  It is also clear that it is capable of being cut down considerably. On a previous occasion I indicated that, in my view, the only way of getting around that was by means of a system of licensing.  The Minister did not seem to fall in with that suggestion. As an alternative, therefore, I suggest some measure of internal or domestic control, so far as cost is concerned, so as to ensure that all the other beneficial sections of this Bill shall flow in favour of the hire-purchaser, and so that he may be protected at the very earliest stage in respect of the cost of the articles that he purchases.  The amendment that I have put down may not be the ideal one.  I am putting it forward as my point of view on this matter, because I think there is a real necessity to control the rate of profit in regard to the class of transactions contemplated under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the war there was a Control of Prices Act.  That Act could have been used to limit the profit on hire-purchase transactions, or to fix the prices at which goods could be sold under a hire-purchase agreement, either generally or in relation to individual cases.  At the present time, of course, price control is operated under the Emergency Powers Act.  This matter of hire-purchase agreements was considered in that regard.  There are enormous complications in any attempt to regulate the cost of hire-purchase facilities in a general way, having regard to the enormous variety of goods that are sold under such agreements and the various circumstances of their sale.  I hope to be able to <Col N="395" /> introduce, some time this year, further legislation which will amend and extend, in some respects, the pre-war Control of Prices Acts to provide for the time when the normal machinery of control will be substituted for the present emergency system.  If there is to be control of the cost of hire-purchase facilities generally, or in relation to particular commodities, it should be under the general prices control system, and not under this Bill. Clearly, if the Deputy's amendment were to be accepted we would have to put in a number of consequential provisions to direct how the power of the Minister should be operated, the penalties that would apply for non-compliance, and so forth.  These provisions are in the Control of Prices Acts at the moment and will be in the new legislation.  I suggest to the Deputy that, while I would not dispute with him the possibility that in various circumstances it may be necessary for the State to take action to control hire-purchase facilities, it should take that action under its general powers to regulate prices, and not in this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again the Minister will recall that I mentioned that a certain sort of practice obtains, I hope in an isolated form, with certain firms engaged in this business; that is, bringing undue pressure to bear on the domestic circumstances of the hirer to such an extent that his credit might be destroyed in his local area.  There are reputable firms engaged in this business and I know they would not resort to such practices.  I am informed, however, that this sort of thing does take place and it is desirable that steps should be taken to ensure that the personal position of the hire-purchaser is <Col N="397" /> not prejudiced.  I think communications should not be sent through the open post or by telegraph.  It is a private transaction and should be regarded as such and any communications should be by sealed letter or by a verbal arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I have been unable to find any evidence of the prevalence in this country of a practice which would render necessary or desirable action along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  For reasons that I have stated already, I have an objection to placing a hire-purchase transaction in a special or privileged category.  Furthermore, if we considered there were grounds of public policy why we should require traders selling goods on hire purchase agreements to carry on their business on a confidential basis, in order to make that effective we would have to go much further than the Deputy suggests. It occurs to me that the mere sending of a letter in a sealed envelope does not protect anybody, unless we specify what shall appear on the outside of the envelope, because the outside could reveal, as much as the plain van taking away the furniture, the nature of the business in which the recipient had been engaged.</P>
      <P>I presume we would also have to provide that the oral transaction would have to take place otherwise than in the presence of witnesses.  You could tell a man verbally in the middle of O'Connell Street that he owed you money in circumstances far more embarrassing to him than if you were to send him a telegram about it.  Apart from the impracticability of avoiding entirely the difficulty the Deputy has in mind, I am not at all sure that it is desirable that we should require that hire-purchase transactions should be carried on in that confidential way so that there should be in relation to them obligations between the parties concerned which do not apply in ordinary business transactions.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 25 seeks to delete sub-section (6). The Minister will note that sub-section (4) (b) sets out that the court may,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  make an order for the specific delivery of all the goods to the owner and postpone the operation of the order on condition that the hirer or any guarantor pays the unpaid balance of the hire-purchase price at such times and in such amounts as the court, having regard to the means of the hirer and any guarantor, thinks just, and subject to the fulfilment of such other conditions by the hirer or a guarantor as the court thinks just, or.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am suggesting that, in addition to these words being included in paragraph (b), they should also be attached to paragraph (c), which says that the court may:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;make an order for the specific delivery of a part of the goods to the owner and for the transfer to the hirer of the owner's title to the remainder of the goods.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest adding the words as they appear in paragraph (b).  This is very much linked up with sub-section (6) and I regard it as one of the most important of my amendments.  This relates to the recovery of goods.  Heretofore there has been no protection of the individual hirer, but he is now protected to the extent that once one-third of the purchase price is paid the owner <Col N="399" /> cannot attempt to recover until he takes action through the courts.  An important point arises as to the power of the court to decide what portion of the goods should be returned in certain circumstances to the owner. Certain powers are vested under paragraphs (b) and (c).  The court may order certain sections of the goods to be returned to the owner and, in certain circumstances, some of the goods become the property of the hirer.  In sub-section (6) it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The court shall not make an order transferring to the hirer the owner's title to a part of the goods unless it is satisfied that the amount which the hirer has paid in respect of the hire-purchase price exceeds the price of that part of the goods by at least one-third of the unpaid balance of the hire-purchase price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that in the lower ranges of payments, that is, payments that are just border-line with the one-third, there is no protection for the hire-purchaser. In fact, under that formula it is possible, and it will happen, that after a substantial sum has been paid the hire-purchaser will have no right to the goods at all and, by direction of the court, they will be handed back to the owner.</P>
    <P>The formula is obviously a mathematical formula&mdash;one-third of the unpaid balance.  I suggest that is unduly favourable to the owner and will act with extreme severity on the hirer, particularly in the lower ranges.  I will give an illustration.  Say a man buys goods to the value of £100 and one of the articles is assessed at £20.  In order to get the protection of the courts he must have paid one-third of the price.  Let us assume that he has paid £35.  The formula comes in and we calculate one-third of the unpaid balance, £65, and it works out at £21 13s. 4d.  To get the value of the goods which the man desires to retain, you will have to deduct one-third of the unpaid balance from the actual price paid, £35.  It will be found that he is below the figure at which he may be permitted to retain the article which he desires to retain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will find that it is based on the formula graded down and that is how it operates.  For instance, suppose a man has purchased a suite of furniture and, say, a table and the table costs £20. He has paid £35 for the two and he is seeking to retain the table.  The court decides that his domestic circumstances are such that it is no use trying to continue the contract and the man says: &ldquo;Let me have the table.  I have paid £35&rdquo;.  The court immediately proceeds to this formula and reckons that, on the basis of the formula, the goods he may retain would be to the value of about £13.  The man will lose the table, plus the £35 he has paid.  If the fraction in that formula is altered to one-quarter of the unpaid balance, he is still caught, to the extent of about 30/-, but, if it is altered to one-fifth, he gets out, and I therefore suggest that there is a case for an alteration of the formula in favour of the hirer in the lower ranges of payments to at least one-fifth.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, what will happen is&mdash;and this is in line with the illustration I have given&mdash;that there will be a continuation of the disability or hardship under which hire-purchasers are now suffering.  They have paid a certain price on the goods.  Court proceedings follow and their payments are void and the goods forfeited.  That is pretty serious, and it is my reason for seeking to delete that sub-section entirely and for adding to paragraph (c) of sub-section (4) the clause:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and subject to the fulfilment of such other conditions by the hirer or guarantor as the court thinks just.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My idea was that the power of determination in respect of goods to be returned to the hirer on the breakdown of a contract should rest with the court on the merits of the case.  That will not operate so long as sub-section (6) is retained and I ask the Minister to look into that paragraph, because it is <Col N="401" /> the kernel of the whole question of hire-purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two amendments in the Deputy's name.  Amendment No. 24 relates to sub-section (4) of Section 13.  I do not agree with that at all.  I think it would be detrimental to the interest of the hirer of the goods to make the change which the Deputy proposes.  Sub-section (4) provides that, when an action comes before the court, the court can do one of three things: it can make an order to the effect that all the goods go back to the owner of the goods; it can make an order for the delivery of all the goods to the owner of the goods, but delayed, subject to whatever payment the court considers reasonable by the hirer or guarantor and to the fulfilment of conditions imposed by the court, which, presumably, will be conditions designed to protect the goods and to safeguard them from damage while they remain in the possession of the hirer; or it can say: &ldquo;This transaction is over and done with.  There is no good in expecting that the hirer will, in some weeks' time, be in a position to resume the transaction.  We must divide up the goods in the way which is most equitable between the owner and the hirer&rdquo; and then say of these goods purchased under a hire-purchase agreement that such-and-such shall go back to the owner and the balance shall remain with the hirer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That closes the whole business.  I think that paragraph (c) should be final and definitive.  It is intended that if the court proceeds under paragraph (c), it is bringing the transaction to an end, and it is both unnecessary and undesirable to provide there for the imposition of conditions by the court, which means that the business may be carried on further, possibly involving further legal proceedings on the question of whether these conditions were observed or not.  Having regard to the provisions of paragraph (b), it is unnecessary to do that, bearing in mind the three things the court can do&mdash;to decide that the man who purchased the goods under a hire-purchase agreement has no intention of paying any more for them and that he fairest thing to do is to send the goods back <Col N="402" /> to the owner; to postpone an order to that effect, taking into account the possibility of the man, who has perhaps been temporarily unemployed, getting his job back and making that postponement subject to certain future payments and conditions as to the protection of the goods and the owner's interest in the goods; or to wind up the whole transaction by dividing the goods between the parties.  I think that section should remain as it stands.  The words which the Deputy proposes to add would in fact be, if anything, against the interest of the hirer of the goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come to sub-section (6).  What happens when the court decides to split up the goods&mdash; that the transaction is over and done with and that it will terminate it on the fairest possible basis by splitting the goods up between the owner and hirer?  If account was taken merely of the amount which the hirer had paid and he were allowed to retain that proportion of the total goods, it would be quite clear that the hirer of the goods would have had the use of the balance of the goods over a period without charge, and that would be unfair to the owner.  It is proposed, therefore, that there should be a formula. The Deputy has given an illustration of how that formula would work in a particular case and the case he chose was the case in which the total amount paid by the hirer under the agreement barely exceeded the one-third which gives to the hirer the protection of the court.  In that case, it is clear that the formula will not permit of the hirer of the goods getting any substantial proportion of the goods on an order from the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the particular case the Deputy mentioned, the total value of the goods purchased under the agreement was £100 and the amount paid by the hirer, £35, the balance unpaid being £65.  One-third of that balance is roughly £22, and consequently the total amount of goods which could be left in the possession of the hirer of <Col N="403" /> the goods by the court would be £13, the amount paid, less £22, being one-third of the balance unpaid, or £13 worth of goods.  That proportion of the total amount of the goods which is being left with the hirer may appear small in relation to the amount he set out to buy, but remember that he paid only £35 on the £100 worth of goods he got, and the owner was, first of all, deprived of the opportunity of selling them to somebody else and was getting back, for his £35, £87 worth of goods which are now second-hand and consequently not of the same value to him as a trader as they were originally and for which he cannot hope to get, on resale, anything approaching the original price which he asked for them.</P>
    <P>In other cases, where the proportion of the purchase price paid by the hirer is a greater proportion of the total, the result may be more favourable to the hirer of the goods.  I have here an illustration.  I have assumed that the total purchase price is £60 and that the amount paid was more than half&mdash; namely, £36&mdash;leaving a balance of £24 outstanding.  One-third of the balance is £8 and £8 is deducted from £36, which was the amount paid, which leaves £28.  Now the court can order that goods to the value of £28 should remain in the possession of the hirer. What the owner of the goods is getting is £8 in consideration of the fact that the hirer of the goods had the use of the whole £60 worth up to the time that the matter reached the court.  It is clear that the owner of the goods should get some payment for the fact that the goods have been delivered to the hirer and have been in use by the hirer for a period of time and that he has been denied the opportunity of selling them to somebody else and that the goods have deteriorated in value by reason of the user of them by the hirer.</P>
    <P>The calculation of one-third provided in paragraph 6 is intended to provide that, even if the court directs that proportion of the goods should go back to the hirer, he will still get some compensation for the fact that these goods were in use by the hirer over a period <Col N="404" /> of time and that their value has deteriorated by reason of the fact of that use by the hirer.  It seems to me that the provision we propose to allow here is fairly moderate compensation for the deterioration in the value of the goods because of their use by the hirer during the period in which the transaction was alive.  In my view, if we were to attempt to make it less-to provide for a lower rate of compensation for the owner of the goods&mdash;many people who are engaged in business of that kind would not engage in it at all because the risk of loss would be very greatly increased.  If I, as a trader, have a suite of furniture and I sell that suite to a purchaser under a hire-purchase agreement and after three, four, six, or eight months the purchaser of that suite of furniture comes to me and says: &ldquo;I cannot go on with this transaction&rdquo; and there is a court proceeding which decides that, instead of getting back my £100 (which was the purchase price of the suite in the first instance) I am only to get back some of the furniture, after it has been nine months in use, clearly I am entitled to some compensation for the depreciation in value as well as for the fact that during the nine months, or so, during which this transaction was alive the purchaser had the use of the furniture and I had not.  I think it would be unreasonable to cut it down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the point of view of the Minister that when you go up this scale progressively it is in favour of the hirer; but what I am concerned with is the lower ranges just bordering on the one-third, which brings the man into court and in which, under the illustration I have given, there is no protection at all and it simply means the man will forfeit the goods as well as the payments.  I am quite prepared to admit that during some period of time the man had the use of the whole of the furniture and that, of course, the contract will be exercised; but the Bill proceeds to exercise that contract rather arbitrarily to the extent of the provision of that one-third.  I am anxious to protect the individual in the lower ranges of these payments in order to ensure that the position which obtains to-day where <Col N="405" /> the individual can come in at will and seize the goods, because of a breakdown in payments, without any compensation shall not be continued under this Bill.  Because of the matters which I have brought to the notice of the Minister and the manner in which this formula is working, might I ask the Minister to take this particular paragraph back and let us have another look at it on the Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I am quite willing to discuss it, but I am anxious that the Deputy should look at it from the point of view of the owner of the goods.  Let me repeat what I said already on the Second Reading.  It is not intended to prohibit this form of trading but, rather, that we should enable such trading to continue. Clearly we will not do that if we impose such an onus on the traders that they cannot continue in business without incurring losses.  If we desire people to continue selling bicycles, suites of furniture, and motor cars on the hire-purchase system, then clearly we must protect them against losses involved in cases where the transactions are not completed.  In the ordinary case the transaction is completed and the ownership of the goods passes automatically and everybody is satisfied.  But in cases where the hirer of the goods pays only one-third of the price and then wants to call the whole thing off, clearly the risk of loss to the trader is very considerable because, instead of having a new bicycle, or a new wireless set, or a new motor car, he now has a second-hand article and the possibility of selling that at a profit is considerably less than the possibility of selling it when it was new.  We must, therefore, compensate him, not merely for the use of the bicycle, or the wireless set, or the motor car by the hirer during the period in which he held them, but also for the deterioration in value of the goods by the time they revert to the original owner.  In any case where I myself have worked out the calculation it seems to me, taking a fair view of the interests of the hirer and the owner, this method of calculation works reasonably well.  However, I am quite agreeable to adopting the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  The court has discretion within the limits set out here; one of the limits is that it cannot make an order transferring to the hirer unless it is satisfied that the amount which the hirer has paid in respect of the hire-purchase price exceeds the price of that part of the goods&mdash;that is, the part that is given to the hirer&mdash;by at least one-third of the unpaid balance.  That seems to be a reasonable calculation in normal circumstances. But there might be a case where the condition of the goods has so deteriorated that the court would take a different view and say: &ldquo;Give the whole of the goods back to the owner&rdquo;, with no part of them at all for the hirer, because that would be a fair thing to do.</P>

      <P>The Deputy understands that what we are doing here is bringing actions for the recovery of goods let under hire purchase agreement into line with actions for the recovery of ordinary debt.  I am not sure that we should go further than that.  If we are to go further than that I think it should be considered by the Minister for Justice and the amendments made to the Courts of Justice Acts.  What we are doing here is merely bringing hire purchase cases into line with cases for the recovery of ordinary debt and I would not like to take upon myself the extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court to the extent the Deputy suggests because it would appear to involve, in order to maintain the principle of uniformity, the extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court generally.  It may be that there will be proposals affecting the jurisdiction of the District Court, in which case the Deputy could make a point on such legislation but here I think we are doing enough if we bring actions for the recovery of goods let on hire purchase agreement within the jurisdiction of the District Court subject to the same limit as applies in the case of ordinary debt.</P>

      <P>There is one further matter to which I should like to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I refer to the Boyne road, near Drogheda.  We find it impossible to get the county council to do anything to that road.  The circumstances are: The original county road from the town of Drogheda to Termonfeckin and Clogher Head, is about one mile distant from the Boyne road, running parallel with it.  Because of the scenic beauty of the Boyne, motor traffic is attracted to the Boyne road to Termonfeckin and Clogher Head.  There are at least three very dangerous blind turns on that road.  There is a bridge on that road, called the Beaulieu Bridge, where there is a right-angle turn.  Very serious accidents have occurred at that junction.  I very much fear that, with the return of motor traffic, we may have very serious accidents there.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should have that particular road inspected with a view to urging the county council to carry out the necessary works to make it a safe road for motor traffic.  This road leads from Drogheda to the well-known Baltray golf links. I want to emphasise that I am not a golfer and have no sympathy with golfers.  They are very well able to look after their own interests.  I am more concerned with the rural community who have to use that road, with their asses and carts, horses and traps, and so on.  The time has come when the Parliamentary Secretary should take action to force the county council to put this road into repair and to make it safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment relief grants are very <Col N="410" /> welcome to a town like Drogheda and have been of great use to us in the past.  I have had considerable experience of the administration of these grants over the period since 1934. Deputies have suggested that instead of four days a week for a period of two weeks or a month there should be full-time employment.  I suppose that could be arranged if sufficient money could be provided.  We have found the grants over the years that I referred to very satisfactory and we have very little difficulty in giving at least the half loaf to most unemployed people in the district.  Public bodies should be induced to avail of these grants for the development of housing sites. If housing sites were developed with the aid of those grants, it would, eventually, assist public bodies in erecting houses at a cheaper rate, and, consequently, enable them to let them at lower rents.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should use a little pressure to induce public bodies to avail of the grants for this purpose.  I want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that his Department refused, at one time, to permit us to use these grants for the development of housing sites.  I think that I can claim to be one of the first to make that recommendation to the Department. However, they have seen the light since and the change is welcome.  The grants are being availed of for this purpose in a number of districts and I hope that public bodies in other districts will likewise avail of them, so that, now that the emergency is nearing an end, we shall be able to resume the housing of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Deputies who stated that the limited amount of money allocated for the purposes covered by this Vote has been efficiently spent on useful local and national schemes.  My concern is that much more money should be allocated for this purpose until such time as schemes of the kind for which the money is allocated will have been exhausted.  That will take a long time. I intervene in this debate mainly for the purpose of urging the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government to bring about some revolutionary <Col N="411" /> changes in the conditions under which citizens are employed on minor relief schemes.  I have considerable experience, as other Deputies have, in dealing with the Department of Public Works in connection with proposals put forward by groups of constituents, by individuals and by local authorities, and, so far as I am aware, the moneys allocated to my constituency by the Department of Public Works have been so allocated without reference to political considerations or representations. I am sure that, if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department had more money at their disposal, much more satisfactory work could be done.  From observation of some works carried out in my constituency, I am satisfied that much better results to the ratepayers and taxpayers would have accrued if full-time employment at decent rates of wages had been provided for those employed on the schemes.  Deputies have been furnished, from time to time, with white papers and brown papers giving details of national development schemes which the Government propose to carry out, such as rural electrification, arterial drainage and turf development, but I see no commonsense plan in relation to the carrying out of minor relief schemes.  Surely, it is the policy of the Government to provide full employment for our able-bodied unemployed whenever the opportunity is available.  I understood from Ministers, speaking here from time to time, that their policy was a policy of full employment at decent rates of wages.  Nobody in this House &mdash;I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to do so&mdash;could stand up and defend the coolie conditions under which workers are conscripted on minor relief schemes in rural areas.  I use the word &ldquo;conscripted&rdquo; advisedly, because, unless they were registered at a labour exchange, they could not be forced to work under the coolie conditions appertaining to those schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to say how he justifies the allocation of the same amount of money this year for this purpose as he did last year.  The total is virtually the same. <Col N="412" /> In the Vote itself, there is a certain manipulation of figures.  £40,000 is taken off the rural employment item and £10,000 off sub-head I, which deals with development work in bogs used by landowners and other private producers. That makes £50,000.  He allocates that £50,000, taken off other sub-heads, to the Vote for farm improvement schemes.  That is purely a book-keeping arrangement.  In round figures, the total amount of the Vote is the same as it was last year.  How does the Parliamentary Secretary come to assume that we shall have the same number of unemployed persons during the coming winter and spring as we had in the winter of last year and the spring of this year?  I have here an extract from what, I think, is an inspired article in a leading British paper in which it is suggested that all the Irish workers who were recruited for civilian employment in Britain during the war period will be forced to come back here.  If a fairly large percentage of them are forced to return, will the situation not be different from that which the Parliamentary Secretary envisaged when arranging the details of this Vote?  Is it not a fact that, since the Estimate was prepared and approved by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government, there has been a considerable increase in the number of unemployed as a result of the demobilisation of thousands of able-bodied men from the National Defence Forces?  The Parliamentary Secretary is, nevertheless, basing his figures on the position that existed during the winter of last year and the spring of the present year.  Although I have no definite reasons for so doing, I question the wisdom of that policy.  May we assume that if the number of unemployed persons in the rural areas is considerably increased, there will be an automatic increase in the Vote for carrying out works of this kind?  The Parliamentary Secretary contrasted the figure of 57,000 unemployed men with that of 60,000 in January, 1945.  So far as my constituency is concerned, large numbers of unemployed persons refuse to register at the local exchanges because they are not prepared to accept the conditions under which they would be <Col N="413" /> compelled to work on minor relief schemes.</P>
    <P>A number of urgently necessary schemes are lying in the pigeon-holes of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department.  They were turned down because it was alleged that there were not at the local labour exchange the necessary number of men registered to carry out those schemes.  I pointed out in correspondence that, in some of those cases, the men were available, although they were not registered at the local exchange, and I am now giving the real reason why large numbers refuse to register.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will improve the conditions of workers on these minor relief schemes, he will find a considerable increase in the number of those registered in the labour exchanges in portions of my constituency, at any rate.  I cannot understand why the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary refuse to improve the conditions of men working on minor relief schemes.  On what grounds can the Parliamentary Secretary justify the treatment of those of its employees who carry out works of this kind less favourably than they are treated when carrying out works of a similar kind for local authorities or for farmers in the areas concerned?</P>
    <P>The Government should be a model employer and should set a good headline in regard to wages and conditions of service.  This Government should give good example to local authorities and to farmers living in the areas where these useful schemes are being carried out.  I have never yet heard the reason why they cannot provide continuous employment, a full week's employment, and at least the same rates of wages as are paid by the local authorities for carrying out the same class of work and by the local farmers or by groups of individual farmers. This Government has been described as a &ldquo;Workers' Government&rdquo;, but nobody who is compelled to work on minor relief schemes and only gets work for four or five days, or in some cases three days, in rural areas, would agree that the title is a proper description of the people responsible.</P>
    <P>I read a very interesting article on <Col N="414" /> this matter and, with your permission, I will quote it.  His Lordship the Bishop of Galway spoke in Galway on Wednesday last and is quoted in an article headed &ldquo;Wages&mdash;The Church's View&rdquo;. I am quoting from the <i>Standard</i>, which is infallible in matters of this kind, although it may not be infallible in other matters.  I am sure it is correct in quoting His Lordship, at any rate.  The issue is dated May 17th, in connection with a lecture on the &ldquo;Catholic Social Programme.&rdquo;  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Church,&rdquo; said His Lordship, &ldquo;had pressed strongly not merely for the right of a minimum wage, but a family wage, and She never put a ceiling to the top, but always held that the higher the wages go, and the higher the standard of living, the better not merely for the worker, but for the whole community.</P>
    <P>That had been proved, particularly in the last 20 years, to be absolutely true.  In the great economic slump of 1929, which reached its climax in 1931, it was found that the cause of the slump and unemployment was that money was not being spent, and it was not being spent because it was not being given out in wages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next portion is in black type, and I hope it will sink into the Parliamentary Secretary's head, and that he will, in his reply, deal with the policy expressed there:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The policy of the Church had been that the higher the proportion of money given to the working man in wages, the better for the whole community, because the money given to him was circulated quickly, kept within the country and, therefore, kept the wheels of industry and commerce going.  The higher the proportion of the national income given out in wages, the better for the prosperity of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are words I would like to hear refuted, if they can be refuted, by the Government spokesman in connection with this discussion and related particularly to the starvation rates of wages and coolie conditions laid down <Col N="415" /> for men who are conscripted to work on minor relief schemes.</P>
    <P>In summarising the employment value of this work during the financial year ended 31st March, 1946, the Parliamentary Secretary said, as reported in column 219, volume 101 of the Official Debates:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The average period of employment given to individual workmen varies with the class of work, and in the different areas, but the total amount of employment afforded in 1945-46, apart from the Farm Improvement Scheme, which is of a different order, is equivalent to 31,000 men each receiving part-time employment for four or five days per week, for the average period of 12 weeks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is well posted by his efficient officials and I wonder if, without great trouble, he could give the number, in that 31,000, who have got four days' work per week, the number who have got five days' work and those who have got a full week, if any.</P>

      <P>I would regard it as very important that he should furnish the House with the average earnings of the 31,000 men over the period of 12 weeks.  If he has not got that figure, I would be glad if he would pass it on to me as soon as he is in a position to do so.  The figure should be available, but perhaps I have not given him sufficient notice to answer the question now.  I would be very much obliged if he would furnish the information as soon as he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As pointed out by his Lordship the Bishop of Galway, there should be a living wage and the citizen who is employed on a minor relief scheme is entitled to that wage just the same as the person employed by the local <Col N="416" /> authority or by a local farmer doing the same class of work for which a higher rate of wages is given.  It is a bad example to the farmers for the State to fix a rate such as has been fixed over a long period of years and which has remained stationary over a long period, for carrying out work of this kind.  If the Parliamentary Secretary believes in the payment of a Christian wage, of a decent minimum wage&mdash;as I am sure he does&mdash;if he believes that the local authorities, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, are right in paying bonuses to the road workers and other employees to meet the increased cost of living that has arisen over the emergency period here, why does he not apply the same principle to the men employed on minor relief schemes and raise the miserable rate which has been in existence for carrying out that class of work for a long time?  The rate seems to be stationary, no matter how high the cost of living goes or how much the condition of the families of these workers has been changed as the result of increased prices and shortage of supplies.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary personally for this policy. I quite agree that it is Government policy, but he has considerable influence and I am sure he has sufficient influence with the Government to get them to alter their policy in this respect. I am sure he will agree with the very good reasons I have given and with the very much better reasons given in the recent speech by his Lordship the Bishop of Galway.</P>
    <P>I am reliably informed&mdash;and I dare say the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of it, too&mdash;that at a recent meeting of one of the area agricultural wages committees a decision to increase the rates of pay of agricultural labourers was carried by a big majority.  I hope the national wages board will confirm the recommendation made to increase the rate by 7/6 a week.  It was right and proper that such a decision should have been taken, immediately after the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech made £1,000,000 available so that farmers <Col N="417" /> would be able to pay agricultural labourers a decent rate of wages.</P>
    <P>If the local authority and the farmers and others employing persons in every sphere of activity in agriculture, in industry and commerce in this country find it right and proper to increase the rates of wages over the pre-war figures, which were fixed in regard to the price of commodities at that time, surely the same argument must be applied to the people who are working on these minor relief schemes?  If there is some reasonable improvement in the working conditions of men who are conscripted from the labour exchanges for work on these schemes or in other works of the kind, the Minister would find it would increase the number of registered unemployed locally and, as a result, he would be able to find the necessary number of men to carry out the many works which I believe have been approved or recommended to his Department and which are urgently necessary in several portions of my constituency.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that any red tape regulations or any other reasons should be a barrier to the carrying out of useful schemes of work urgently required in any portion of a turf-cutting county. If a scheme is recommended by the county surveyor or by the Parliamentary Secretary's inspectors as being urgently necessary, and if there are able-bodied men registered or unregistered who could be got to do the work in the area it should be finished in the shortest possible time.  I drew attention on previous discussions, during the period of office of the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, to the fact that some small schemes which were sanctioned, and for which money was allocated, are being carried out in a piecemeal fashion.  Are there not good business reasons why a minor relief scheme, costing perhaps £200, to repair a bog road or to carry out drainage, should be undertaken and men continuously employed until it is finished, rather than repairing half a road this year under a Vote of this kind and leaving the other half to be finished in the coming year?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="418" /> that these are good business reasons why such work should be finished as quickly as possible.  It is one way in which men could be employed continuously until the work was completed.  I know of one case in portion of my constituency where such a scheme took three years, and I am not sure that it is complete yet.  There were three separate Votes dealing with it.  The best results are not got for the money that is spent by doing work in a piecemeal fashion.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will review the procedure regarding the carrying out of these small schemes.  If it is decided to find money for them, then give the largest possible amount of employment locally, and pay a decent rate of wages for a full week's work.  I fully appreciate the value of the work that is being carried out by Votes of this kind over a long period.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with the points I have put to him, especially those concerning the conditions of workers employed on these schemes, and relate them to the conditions of service of men employed on the same class of work by local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this Department works wisely and well, but I am not satisfied when agriculture is not in the position of being able to benefit itself.  It is hard luck to be asking for sops.  We have been giving sops and doles to the unemployed for 25 years, and now we find that we have to give sops to farmers to look after their own little affairs.  I think that is bad.  In bad times it is all right to give help, but I do not stand for a Department continuing to give it permanently. A certain limit should be fixed, so that such a practice should stop, as it involves the time of hundreds of officials to look after small schemes.  It is my belief that if agriculture could stand on its feet, and if trade agreements could be reached with other countries, whereby there would be stability in the industry, there would be no need for these schemes and farmers would be able to fend for themselves.  If a farmer has to fix a drain, to put up a ditch, or to sink a pump, there is no reason why he should not do so without applying to the Government <Col N="419" /> for help.  I do not believe in doles.  It was all right to help during the economic war, or in a time of stress, but we should now concentrate on putting agriculture in its proper place, so that farmers would be able to fend for themselves.</P>
      <P>If we keep going on with all these schemes we will have a type of people who will always be looking for doles, while at the same time getting nothing from the Government really but money that came from their own pockets.  I think that is a stupid practice.  Millions of money are being spent on schemes and thousands of officials have to be employed to deal with them.  That is waste of money.</P>
      <P>I admit that this Department does good work, but we will have to stop this system and let schemes of that kind be done on a business basis.  Let the farmers fend for themselves, and let the Government see that they have proper markets, so that they may know what prospects are before them for say ten years.  No farmer should be going to the Government asking to have a drain cleaned up or a pier erected at the entrance to his farm.  I believe in having work done that is of benefit to the public, such as opening up bog roads, and leaving them in a condition in which they could be taken over by county councils.  Work of that kind gives good results, and we should concentrate on it.  The farm improvements shceme is all right but I think we are going too far with it, as every Deputy wants to go further ahead and spend millions of money under it.  The ordinary farmers are going in for these schemes because they think they are a help.  We have been told that agriculture is in a strong position at the present time and that there are millions of money in the banks.  If that money is lying idle why not apply it to help those who need it in their business?</P>

      <P>There is no need to borrow money if agriculture is put on a proper basis.  There should be no need for the State to have to help ordinary farmers.  I believe this <Col N="420" /> Department is carrying the baby for the Minister for Agriculture who has flopped on the job.  If he was doing his job as he should do it, there would be no need for this Department.  As it is there are far too many looking for this money and there are too many officials to see that these schemes are carried out.  I think we would accomplish more by maintaining roads that were built by the Land Commission. County councils will not take over these roads at present because they are not in proper repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After five or six years roads built by the Land Commission, when not kept in repair, are full of pot holes, and horses cannot travel on them.  The Department should concentrate on the maintenance of such roads.  If they did the unemployment problem would receive more attention.  I admit that very good work has been done by the Department on roads leading to bogs. I find that that work has given a good return to those who are cutting turf. Many big merchants are engaged in the turf business in my constituency, where everything possible was done to facilitate them, but beside these people are private individuals who work very hard on the bogs.  They provide a good deal of turf but they receive little attention.  The same facilities should be given to private producers as are given to merchants with a monopoly.  All parties should receive the same treatment.  If money is to be spent under this Vote lanes and bog roads should be treated in the same way as other roads.  I agree with what Deputy Davin said regarding rotational employment.  I believe in a full week's work.  The men hate the present system of three days on and three days off.  There is too much waste in connection with that system, and in putting gangers on to segregate them. On these schemes the men should not be paid less than the county council rate.  It is a real scab job that we are doing.  Men are put out to work on these schemes who are not fit for work. Some of them never worked and others are in bad health and not able to work. But, under this system, when they are called upon they have to turn out and work.  They are not able to do more than two hours' work in a day.  If <Col N="421" /> they had to work for eight hours I do not believe they would be able to get home at night.  They are just what one might call human scarecrows.  The county council rate is not very big, and these men should not get less than that.  As it is we have hundreds and hundreds of the county council workers on strike because they find they are not able to live on the present wage.  Why then give these poor fellows less?  It is a disgrace.  The Parliamentary Secretary should force the Government to do something in the way of giving these men a living wage and in doing away with the rotational system.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Department is alive and energetic.  Its officials are good.  At the same time, it is a Department that, to the extent of 80 per cent., could be wiped out if the Minister for Agriculture was doing his job.  He is not doing it.  He is sitting down on it, and the Parliamentary Secretary has to carry the baby for him.  It is a disgrace. We shall never have peace or contentment in the country until the farmers are allowed to do their business in their own way.  I do not believe in subsidies.  They are bad for the nation, bad for the Government and bad for the farmers.  In times of emergency, I suppose they are necessary but there should be no need for them now.  There is a great waste of money in connection with these schemes.  We are told that they give employment to a great many men.  In my experience there is hardly a farmer in the country who takes on an extra man in the winter months to do work on these schemes.  If they were doing that, then I agree it would be a good thing to have the schemes, but I find that they give employment to very few extra men.  The few boys on the land do whatever work is to be done&mdash;the building of fences or the making of a few hundred yards of a drain or a ditch.  At any rate, in my opinion, very little extra employment is given.  Generally speaking, the Department is giving good satisfaction, and a good return for the money.  At the same time, I would like to know where we stand as regards agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">

      <P>This Vote falls under three headings which are concerned <Col N="422" /> with the Minister for Agriculture, the special employment branch and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  It is in connection with the latter that I want to make a few remarks.  In connection with the schemes as a whole, I intend to reserve what I have to say until the Vote for the Minister for Local Government comes before us.  I would be glad if what I have to say were passed on by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister.  I am rather surprised in connection with a particular scheme which was heralded in the House with trumpets two years ago, a scheme which promised to give great results&mdash; I refer to the riverside walk scheme at the Tolka&mdash;that nothing, apparently, has been done about it.  I intend to refer to it at greater length on the Vote for the Minister's Department.  I was interested in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that the sum asked for in this Vote is based on the number of unemployment assistance recipients in the various areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Dublin is concerned, I wonder if the Vote is drafted on those lines, because from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement one would assume that all recepients of unemployment assistance would get a share in that particular type of work. Speaking subject to correction, the procedure invariably followed in the case of Dublin is that it is only the recipients of unemployment benefit at the top of the scales who are engaged on these particular schemes, while those on the lower scales rarely, if ever, get a turn on this type of work. If that be so, there is something there which calls for examination so far as the City of Dublin is concerned.  No matter what may be said to the contrary, I think the prime purpose of these schemes is to transfer a good deal of the responsibility, which should rest on the Government, to the local authorities.  The individuals drawn from the unemployment assistance category are automatically put over, to a considerable extent at any rate, on the local authority in as much as it has to bear a certain proportion of the cost of particular schemes.  There is, of course, in connection with these <Col N="423" /> schemes a grant given by the Government.</P>
    <P>My object in rising was to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the discrimination there is against Dublin in the allocation of these particular schemes.  I understand that the grants are based on something like 70 per cent. for general amenities, 50 per cent. for housing development and 40 per cent. for sewerage, whereas in areas throughout the country the percentage is as high as 90.  Some Ministers, I have no personal experience of this, justify that discrimination&mdash;not exactly in this particular case but in other cases where grants are due to the local municipality&mdash;on the ground that Dublin is a wealthy city and should pay a higher proportion of the cost of the schemes I refer to than other areas throughout the country.  That, in my submission, does not take cognisance of the fact that you have a greater concentration of poverty and unemployment in the City of Dublin than you have, relatively, in other areas.  Therefore, I submit that Dublin is entitled to greater consideration than the more favoured areas.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would look into these grants, which are considerable in their range of activities so far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned, and ensure that the corporation will, so to speak, get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>The amount in the Vote for housing development is £20,000.  I suggest it is grossly insufficient if councils throughout the country take advantage of the position as we in Dublin are doing. In Dublin we are embarking on a big housing programme.  There is an extensive scheme planned at St. Anne's estate which comprises 400 or 500 acres, and almost beside it there will be the further development of land to the extent of 600 acres.  The activities projected by the Dublin Corporation could certainly absorb most of the sum asked for in this Vote. I am surprised that, under that particular heading of the Vote, so little is to be devoted to housing development. The Dublin area could absorb it with great effect if the percentage is raised. <Col N="424" /> The percentage, which is only 50 per cent., imposes a rather severe burden on the local authority.  If, as I hope, as a result of an examination, the proportion is increased, we will be exceedingly interested in the Vote.</P>
    <P>As to the schemes generally, I am not in a position to speak of their effectiveness or general usefulness so far as the country is concerned.  I gather that in the rural areas a considerable amount of good work has been done, particularly as regards improvement schemes.  Generally speaking, there is a wrong approach to relief schemes.  Those schemes were introduced at a time when, perhaps, for panicky reasons, it was felt necessary to deal with what was deemed to be a rather urgent position in relation to unemployment.  What was then regarded as a temporary expedient has now come to be regarded as a sort of permanent institution in our social sphere.  I am not satisfied that it is a genuine attempt to solve the unemployment problem.  I grant that from the experience of these schemes sufficient knowledge has been gained of an exceedingly useful character and I suggest it could be made a permanent thing along lines that will be useful and attractive, and eventually it could be regarded as a useful supplement to the labour market.</P>
    <P>You will not have that position while you have rotational relief under conditions neither desirable nor attractive, with wages as they are and with workers assured of only four or five days a week.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will be doing a good day's work if he arranges for a general review of relief schemes with the object of co-ordinating them on well-planned lines, not alone for one period of the year but for every month of the year, and ensures that they will be of such a character as will enable him to pay decent wages under conditions attractive to the workers.  Until you have an approach of that kind, you can only describe the relief schemes, as one Deputy put it, as palliatives of a kind that will lead nowhere.  It is very near time that we should have something in the nature of a general review in order to see where we are heading.</P>

      <P>When leading off the discussion on this Vote Deputy Dockrell, among a number of complaints to which he gave voice, mentioned the lack of vision of the Office of Public Works in the selection of schemes. Back in 1934 an inter-Departmental Committee was set up and, as far as I can remember, it invited, through the daily Press, all citizens who had ideas to write in submitting any proposals that occurred to them.  It was hoped, as a result of that approach, to get some original proposals.  The committee also approached local authorities asking for their co-operation in the same way. Many suggestions were received, but I think the total result of the effort was fairly disappointing.  The committee was looking for works of a kind that were not being dealt with by State Departments or different local authorities. The committee was disappointed, inasmuch as the proposals submitted did not contain any considerable percentage of original ideas.</P>
      <P>There was a number of fairly large proposals suggested but, on examination, these proposals, as you often will find in relation to such matters, depended largely on the use of fairly heavy mechanical equipment and their unskilled labour content was fairly low, while the expenditure would be very high.  The proposals would not commend themselves to a Department looking for work in which the unskilled labour content would be high.  That particular type of scheme for these reasons would naturally have to be rejected.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell mentioned a particular scheme, the Merrion reclamation scheme, of which he appears to have considerable knowledge.  That scheme was submitted to this committee. The estimated cost of it was around £500,000.  That scheme was not acceptable for the reasons which I have already given and for the further reason that, when the area would be reclaimed, there was no well-defined use to which the reclaimed land could be put.  There was some suggestion at the time that it might be used as an airport, but, that idea being rejected, there was apparently no other purpose for which the reclaimed area could be utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> As regards the submission of suitable proposals for employment schemes, my office and the Department of Local Government must depend in the main on local authorities.  There is no other body in a better position to know the schemes that are most suitable.  We have to depend upon the co-operation of these authorities for suitable schemes.  Every proposal submitted by them is carefully examined and if it is found, on examination, to contain the elements that we insist upon, it is accepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell made the point that we should think in terms of improvement rather than employment.  It is all very well to make a statement of that kind.  If you were to give to my office the sum for which we are now asking the Dáil without stipulating any conditions whatever, there is a possibility that we would be able to apply it in a way that would give better results from the point of view of improvement than we are getting now; but the money we are seeking here is sought largely for the purpose of bringing further assistance to the section of our people who are on the unemployment register, and, that being so, we must naturally bring the money to the places in which these men are to be found.  Therefore, we cannot think, as the Deputy invites us to think, in terms of effecting improvements rather than in terms of employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Sullivan, and indeed a number of other Deputies, mentioned this matter of the provision for housing site development works.  Deputy O'Sullivan complained that the amount shown here was very small and also said that the 50 per cent. grant to local authorities and 50 per cent. contribution from the rates was unfair and not sufficiently attractive to induce local authorities to engage in this very desirable kind of work.  We must, of course, remember that housing site development work is really not the type of work in which we should engage, that is, if we are determined not to interfere with the ordinary type of work which is at the moment the responsibility of the local authority.  If, in the selection of employment <Col N="427" /> schemes, we are to interfere, by the provision of attractive grants, with the type of work which must in the ordinary way be undertaken by local authorities, we are diverting the Vote to a purpose for which it was never intended, and, because of that, it is only in cases in which the housing site development work is of a kind which is not likely to be undertaken in the near future by a local authority that our approval is given.</P>
    <P>On this matter of housing site development work, I cannot help thinking of a case of which I and the officials of my office had some experience because it refers to a town in the constituency of Deputy Morrissey who addressed himself to this subject.  I cannot help relating some of our experiences in regard to a housing site development scheme there.  The grant, as Deputies know, is on a fifty-fifty basis, and we found that there were 64 or 65 men in receipt of unemployment assistance in this particular town.  The local authority submitted a proposal for a housing site development work, and it was ultimately approved, and the grant was sanctioned.  The town surveyor proceeded to go ahead with the work, and shortly after he had started the job, we received from him a communication asking us not to insist upon the rotation of the men employed or to interfere in any way with the continuity of the work.  We were surprised by this request because it had been put to us that there were only a sufficient number of men in the place to make one gang.</P>
    <P>We proceeded to investigate and we found that the town surveyor, because the rates had to make a 50 per cent. contribution towards the cost of the work and because that 50 per cent. element would ultimately have a bearing upon the rents at which these houses would be let when erected, had to be careful as to the type of people he employed and, therefore, did not feel that people to the number of 40 odd, out of the 65 registered as unemployed in the urban area, were suitable or capable of giving the type of return that the local authority employing them would require to get in order to make the proposal economic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> I am citing that case to show those who have recommended to us the provision of full-time employment, the abolition of rotation and the payment of standard rates in all cases, that quite a number of unfortunate people, who, because of their economic circumstances and for a number of other reasons, are unable to find work&mdash;unable to find work in a competitive sense&mdash; and who are forced to the labour exchange in order to secure assistance, are incapable of competing in the open market, and, if employed, incapable of doing a full week's work and giving the sort of return on which any employer, even a local authority, would insist before taking them on.</P>

But in any criticism we have to offer we are&mdash;if we have given any thought at all to this whole unemployment problem&mdash;entitled, I think, to be reasonable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the same kind of contacts and the same intimacy with the bishops of this country that Deputy Davin has.  I would never dream of claiming to have the same facility for interpreting the words and the intentions of the Bishops of this <Col N="431" /> country that Deputy Davin would seem to have; nor do I follow up the articles that appear in the <i>Standard</i> with the same care and attention as Deputy Davin does.  Nevertheless I have to live.  As I say, the Government is not in any way and has never been wedded to this system of rotational employment any more than it is wedded to other matters of policy.  But, speaking as one who has some knowledge and who has some little idea of what this unemployment problem is both in town and country and the type of person for whom we are endeavouring to cater&mdash; the type of individual whom we find in the town to which I have referred where this housing development scheme was in operation&mdash;and keeping all these difficulties before our minds, I think at least it can be said to be a reasonable approach, not to the finding of a solution and not to the provision of a solution of the unemployment problem as a whole, which some Deputies allege it is, but a reasonable approach to assist those people many of whom, for the reasons I have stated, cannot be said to be capable and cannot be said to be made capable of competing in the open market with other workers for the employment which is available there.  Now, as far as I can remember, nobody on these benches ever claimed that this Vote was a Vote to remove unemployment in that sense. As far as I understand it, it is a Vote for the purpose of increasing the provision made by the State for that class of people who, for one reason or another, are unable to secure work either temporarily or permanently.  As I say, we are not wedded to the system, but I think it must be admitted that if the men, for whom Deputy Davin and some of the others speak, are in the physical condition in which they are alleged to be it would be unreasonable to start those men off by giving them in some cases four days a week, and in other cases five days a week, or six days a week, depending upon the amount of assistance of which they were in receipt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arguments could be advanced against any such scheme when one has regard to the inability of those men because of their physical condition.  If <Col N="432" /> you have regard to these considerations then you must appreciate that there is some justification anyhow, when asking these men to turn out on fairly heavy and somewhat laborious work, for ensuring that they are not asked to work a full week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies from rural areas mentioned the desirability of taking compulsory powers to prevent farmers and others from impeding certain desirable works such as bog development, minor employment and rural improvement schemes.  That is a matter that has been raised here on more than one occasion.  It was raised, I think, last year and perhaps the year before and it has been raised also in a number of other places.  It often crops up at county council meetings and, at one time, the General Council of County Councils made approaches to the Government with a view of having such powers taken for the purpose of preventing people from obstructing works of the kind I have mentioned.  I do not think that it would be wrong to take such powers.  Some Deputies thought it would be an outrageous thing to propose and other Deputies thought it was all right.  I do not think that there would be anything wrong in taking such powers, provided you could show cause for that action.  We certainly have not evidence of the kind and to an extent that would, in my opinion, justify us, or justify any Department, in seeking such powers.  I have asked for the percentage of schemes that are not put through because of such objections, and I find that in the case of bog development and minor employment <Col N="433" /> schemes it is under 3 per cent. and, in the case of rural improvement schemes, it is around 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>When one considers that the right of appeal must be given to the individual and that an elaborate machinery would be necessary in order to protect everybody's rights and that in the operation of that machinery the time in which it was proposed to carry out the work would elapse, it is obvious that the machinery would be largely ineffective.  As far as our experience goes, there is no evidence that would warrant us or any other Department in seeking such powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several other matters were raised but I have dealt with the points that were referred to by most Deputies.  I cannot say who it was who first suggested to me that employment schemes should be operated in the summer months.  In so far as rural areas are concerned, such a proposal does not make sense.  If a man is genuinely seeking work and if work is available at all, the summer is the period when he would be expected to get work as a result of his own efforts. Certainly for the last three or four years there should have been no difficulty, in rural areas, in finding employment for a man who was genuinely seeking work and was reasonably able to work.  Therefore, by those who understand the conditions in rural Ireland, the proposal is one that cannot be taken seriously. In urban areas these employment schemes are continued in winter and in summer.  Deputy Davin has complained&mdash;and he is not the only person who has complained&mdash;about the conditions under which men are asked to work on minor employment schemes in the rural districts.  He has also complained in regard to the wages that are paid on those schemes.  In that matter also we are always prepared to examine and re-examine and, if it is thought wise, to change our policy if there is justification for it.  But, as I have explained, and as my predecessors in this House have explained, the wages paid on these schemes are regulated by the wages paid in agriculture.  They are regulated, influenced and controlled <Col N="434" /> entirely by the hourly rate paid to agricultural workers and I must say that while I, like Deputy Davin, would be glad to see the workers getting a decent wage, a reasonable wage, I have no hesitation about standing up in this House or any other place and justifying the importance that is being attached to the rate of wages paid to the agricultural worker and the importance of tying down the wages of those who are engaged in a number of other occupations&mdash;county council workers and those employed on minor employment schemes, rural improvement schemes and all such works&mdash;to the rate of wages paid to the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>In saying so, I am not contending or suggesting that these wages are as high as I would be glad to see them but, when you think of what an agricultural worker's task is, when you think of his hours, the extent of the supervision, the output he must give and when you consider that the man employed in county council work is finished work at 12 o'clock on a Saturday morning and has the remainder of the day to himself, while the farm worker has to continue, when you think of all these things, and especially when you have regard to the importance of the agricultural industry and the importance of doing nothing that will induce men to leave that important and very desirable employment, from the point of view of the community, is it any wonder that we, or that I, should without any hesitation in the world stand up here and defend the policy of relating and of keeping in relation the wages of such workers to the wages paid by farmers to their staff?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary defending paying a lower rate of wages than the local authority for the same class of work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am defending paying the rate of wages that is paid and relating the wages paid on these schemes to the wages paid by farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>But you are paying less and you know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am paying the same hourly rate and if Deputy Davin is <Col N="435" /> right in his forecast, and if the new rate that is suggested by the board to which he referred, becomes, in a week, a fortnight, a month or six months' time, the legal rate to be paid by farmers to their workers, then we will be prepared, of course, to adjust our wages to fit in with that general recommendation.  I have had experience, perhaps not as much as many other Deputies, of local authorities.  I have been associated for part of my life with local authorities.  I always found, when applications came before these local authorities for increases of wages for their employees, and so on, the local authorities, while composed largely of farmers and their representatives and people who were employers, perhaps in a very limited sense, were always prepared to be very <i>flaithiúil</i> when it came to a matter of disbursing moneys that were extracted from the ratepayers in general.</P>
      <P>Many of them were not so <i>flaithiúil</i> when it came to regulating the wages of their own employees.  I should be glad to see agriculture in a condition which would enable it to pay a reasonable wage but I, certainly, shall not apologise for saying at any time or in any place that the wages payable to those workers, who are not engaged in as important an occupation, in my opinion, as agriculture, and who are not called upon to be as skilled in their occupation as farm workers, should be related to the wages paid by the farmer to his employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the rural improvements scheme, I might, to some extent, agree with Deputy Giles but I disagree with him that there is anything demoralising in the State coming to the farmer's assistance or tempting him to undertake useful works on a contributory basis.  If the farmer is himself called upon to make a cash payment, there can be nothing demoralising in such a scheme.  I was disappointed to hear the opinion of some Deputies that this scheme would not be a success.  I should be even more disappointed if I were to accept them as reliable prophets. The facts belie their forecast. When the scheme was first mooted, many Deputies thought that farmers <Col N="436" /> could not be induced to co-operate for the purpose of improving their rights-of-way or boreens or for the purpose of carrying out small drainage schemes.  The figures I gave in my opening statement show that this scheme has been very successful, indeed. I do not think that Deputies are acting rightly in suggesting that such a scheme could not be a success. I believe that we should, on every occasion, encourage our farmers to co-operate. I think that the State is wise in making provision to induce that co-operation for the carrying out of useful works.  The Deputy referred to the type of work produced by this type of scheme.  The difference between output on such a scheme and the output on a scheme to which there is 100 per cent.  State contribution is very noticeable, indeed.</P>
    <P>In the main, we find that the output on a scheme to which farmers and beneficiaries have contributed is much higher than the output on schemes entirely financed by the State.  When you come to do a job completely out of a State grant, even those who are benefiting by it, those whose approach-road is, perhaps, being improved, say: &ldquo;If they do not make a good job of it this year, they will do so in three or four years more; they will be back with us again.&rdquo;  The men employed on such a scheme may not be very closely supervised.  The surveyor and his assistants may regard the work as a sort of side-line&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not another reason for the better output&mdash;that the farmers' sons are better fed than the men who have been unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another reason &mdash;but the Deputy never gets the right reason.  Because of the increase in output, I should like Deputies to encourage farmers to take advantage of those schemes.  When they want the State or the local authority to have the tar laid on their road up to the door, it is not any harm to tell them that if they put up a certain proportion of the cost, the State will put up the rest.  Though the scheme does not seem to find favour with Deputy Giles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As you have indicated, it has been the practice to take these three Votes together and I am following this year on the same lines.</P>
      <P>Vote 9 bears the salaries and expenses of the administrative, executive and technical staffs of the Office of Public Works, which is the office responsible for the administration of Votes 10 and 11.  Vote 10 provides the necessary funds for the purchase of sites and buildings, for the erection, maintenance and furnishing of the Government offices and other State-owned premises throughout the country, for the erection and improvement of national schools, for the erection of major military buildings, for arterial drainage, for the maintenance of State-owned parks and State harbours, and for a number of minor-activities. Vote 11 is a small Vote, providing for the expenses of management of Haulbowline Island in so far as the island remains in civilian control.</P>
      <P>Vote 9.&mdash;There is an increase of £16,280 in the Estimate for the Office of Public Works.  This is due mainly to the payment of increased emergency bonus to civil servants and to the recruitment of additional staff for the architectural and engineering branches.  The additional architectural staff is required to replace officers seconded to the Department of Industry and Commerce for airports work and to undertake an increased programme of schools survey work; the additional engineering staff is necessary for arterial drainage.</P>
      <P>It will be noted that a new sub-head &mdash;CC&mdash;appears in the Estimate for this year.  The Government has decided to proceed with the development of the Rotunda Gardens site, which was acquired with a view to its conversion into a Garden of Remembrance dedicated to the memory of those who gave their lives for Irish freedom. The cost of the work will be borne on Vote 10; on Vote 9 will be borne incidental expenses as set out in Part III of the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vote 10.&mdash;The Estimate for Public <Col N="439" /> Works and Buildings at £980,900 shows an increase of £129,327 on the Vote for 1945-46.  The main increases are in the New Works, Maintenance and Drainage sub-heads.  The amount voted for sub-head B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions&mdash;for 1945-46 was £390,000.  The expenditure was £280,000, approximately.  Supplies of steel, timber, heating and electrical equipment essential for our building works were still restricted.  The amount provided for 1946-47 is £500,000, which is an increase of £110,000 on the 1945-46 Vote.  We have found it necessary to put forward a number of new items and to provide for the carrying out of others which have had to be postponed during the emergency.  Particulars of these items will be found in Part III of the Estimate.  We are hoping that there will be sufficient improvement in the supply position during the year to enable us to carry out our programme.</P>
    <P>We are again providing £250,000 for grants for building and improving national schools.  Expenditure on this service in 1945-46 was £176,000 approximately, which is £50,000 approximately less than the expenditure in the previous year.  This was due mainly to the difficulty of placing contracts owing to the unsatisfactory supply position.</P>
    <P>Maintenance.&mdash;Expenditure under this sub-head in recent years has exceeded the provisions and in view of the high costs of materials and labour still prevailing we consider it necessary to increase the provision for 1946-47 to £240,000.</P>
    <P>Drainage.&mdash;Provision for expenditure on comprehensive drainage schemes under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, is not made in the Estimate.  If we are satisfied later that a start on drainage works will be possible and desirable, provision for the expenditure involved will be made by way of Supplementary Estimate.  We are providing for the purchase of four new excavating machines which are at present on order and of which delivery is expected by the end of this summer, and provision is also made as in previous years for the reconditioning of our existing drainage plant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> Vote 11.&mdash;The Vote for Hawlbowline Dockyard is in the usual form and calls for no special comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on the absence of any provision for arterial drainage and would like to preface my remarks by pointing out that there has been a good deal of controversy here about wages and incomes. We should bear in mind always, in the provision of works for employment purposes, that we all live out of the national income and can only take out of the national pool what we put into it.  If the people engaged on unproductive works have to be borne by the rest of the community, that is a dead weight on the rest of the community. I was anxious to hear a reference by the Parliamentary Secretary to the anxiety of his office to provide, as far as possible, works of an improvement nature.  That is a very important aspect of this whole problem, as otherwise the attempts are only palliatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being very brief in that reference and just relating it to the problem.  Here is a very wide field open to the Parliamentary Secretary to employ a very considerable number of men and I cannot understand the very great delay in implementing the Arterial Drainage Act.  We had a very elaborate programme and a good deal of detailed information in the House when the Bill was under discussion; but while certain provision has been made in the last couple of years for preparatory work, no attempt at all has been made to launch out on a big scheme of arterial drainage.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us now that an order has been placed for four big machines and I see that a sum of £18,000 is provided for that purpose.  For maintenance of machinery there is a sum of £3,000 and there is a very big increase in the sum for surveys&mdash;there was £4,800 last year and this year it is £8,000.  I can understand the necessity for buying modern machinery, but were we absolutely <Col N="441" /> derelict of machinery?  Was the Office of Public Works, so far as equipment is concerned, not in a position to proceed with drainage of any sort for the last two or three years, when we were asked to provide a token Vote of £10, as occurs again this year?  Notwithstanding those orders placed for machinery and equipment, judging by the recent year's provision under sub-head J. (7), a considerable amount of preparatory survey work must have been undertaken and completed by now.  I cannot see why some real effort has not been made to attack this problem, of which there are several aspects.</P>
      <P>There are large tracts of land which, if drained and surveyed, have considerable potential wealth for this country and it is to be deeply regretted that years of neglect have passed and nothing has been done about them.  Again, there are many towns all over the country inundated with water maybe two or three times every winter.  We are passing a Public Health Bill here and I am often impressed, in some of the towns I know, by the shocking condition of the unfortunate people forced to live in houses where that inundation occurs. It is not merely the inconvenience and hardship they suffer during the flooding period, but the condition that is left afterwards&mdash;the damp and the slime, the dirt and the mud, and the possibility of tuberculosis and other diseases making headway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are very important considerations, and I am certainly justified in saying that this House is entitled very severely to criticise the responsible Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary acting for the Minister, when no attempt has been made to make a start.  I think there is no excuse.  It is regrettable if we find ourselves in the position that we have not the equipment or the machinery to proceed with work of this character.  It is odious to make comparisons, but we see what Great Britain has done in the way of arterial drainage, and drainage generally, as well as the amount of reclamation that has been carried out. We hear that little or no reclamation can be carried out here over large <Col N="442" /> areas until the arteries are opened up and properly drained.  I regret that no steps have been taken under the Act about which the Parliamentary Secretary was so very enthusiastic when it was passing through the House.  The Act was given a good deal of thought, and it was believed that there was going to be a very big national scheme. If we had a number of gauges to measure water flow taken, and preliminary work done on a few rivers we could be going ahead.  Why are we asked to provide an extra £1,000 for that purpose in the sub-head?  Are we in the position that we have to wait for a few machines before we can do anything? I do not believe that is so.  I think we could be starting and doing a considerable amount before the machines are delivered.  I have no doubt the machines will be a great asset in the work, but bearing in mind the shocking conditions, and the number of people who have made representations to Deputies from constituencies where flooding occurs, it is very hard to find an excuse for the fact that no effort has been made to tackle the problem. There is an increase in the Estimate for new works and buildings and the Parliamentary Secretary has informed the House of the difficulty of substantially increasing provision for that purpose because of the difficulty of securing raw materials.  I appreciate that difficulty.  All the advice I can offer is that, so far as the provision of schools and public buildings is concerned, all possible preparation should be made in the way of completing plans and preparatory work.</P>
    <P>I notice on page 40 that there is provision for the erection of an official residence under the heading of the President's Establishment.  I am wondering what that means.  Does it mean that we are going to provide a new residence for the President?  Is Árus an Uachtaráin not sufficient for that purpose?  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what is the intention behind that item.  A sum of £16,000 is to be spent this year on that establishment and £2,000 was spent last year, out of a total estimate for work there of £40,000.  It is rather extraordinary to spend a substantial sum like that if the intention is to <Col N="443" /> provide a new residence later.  There is a considerable list of works in the Estimate dealing with barracks and schools.  Some of these items have appeared more than once.  I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary has the legitimate excuse that it was impossible to get raw materials.  The only thing that could be done was to have preparations made in case raw materials are got at an early date. When replying I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give some real excuse for not making a start under the Arterial Drainage Act.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Hughes in pressing the Parliamentary Secretary for a little more information in connection with the operation of the Arterial Drainage Act, and to tell us when he hopes that work will start on some major schemes already approved of.  Can he say when the necessary machinery is likely to be secured, and following the delivery of the machinery, when a commencement will be made on drainage schemes like those on the Barrow River?  I understand that scheme has been approved of.  One of the county councils in my constituency was informed to that effect some time ago.  I should like to know when that work is likely to commence.  I am not certain as to what extent the Department is responsible for seeing that local drainage boards, including the Barrow Drainage Board, carry out their duties regarding maintenance work which has got into arrears.  Very useful schemes were carried out in recent years.  If the Department is the supervising authority I wish it would look into the position, to see that boards responsible for maintenance work do not allow it to get into arrears.</P>

    <P>I notice in the Estimate that there is a reduction in the amount set aside for turf during the coming year.  Last year the cost of fuel, light, water and cleaning was £103,960 and this year there is a round figure of £100,000, showing a decrease of £3,960.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary hope, as far as cost of fuel in Government Departments is concerned, that it will be reduced in the coming year, and that they will get the benefit of the <Col N="444" /> reduction of 10/- per ton in the price of turf?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House the average price paid for the turf covered by the sub-head during the year, and whether the necessary quantity was secured by inviting public tenders?  Is that the practice?  It will be interesting to know whether this particular sub-head will receive the benefit of the 10/- reduction in the price of fuel this year compared with last year.</P>

The question of the erection of schools is a most difficult one, because there are two, if not more, Departments involved.  I do not know whether it could be contended that the Office of Public Works is responsible for the delays that occur between the initiation of a scheme for the repair of a school or the erection of a new building, and the time when the work is put in hand.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in connection with the erection of new schools and the repair of old ones, if any plan could be devised for accelerating the operations which take place between the time a proposal comes before the staffs in the Department and the time the work is put in hands.  I know a case that has been going on for years, and no conclusion has yet been reached about it.  I know of another case in the County of Limerick in connection with the erection of new schools.  I admit that in that case there were difficulties about the site and the title to the site.  A search had been made for documents and these had to be examined.  Apart from that, there were difficulties about the plans.  Changes were made in them, and there were alterations of various kinds.  There was a difficulty in getting the Department to come to a conclusion and in getting the work under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to know how contractors for these works are selected. <Col N="445" /> Is there a list of approved contractors in the Office of Public Works?  Are proposals from contractors who are not in that list considered?  I heard of some instances, in connection with contractors who carried out work on school buildings, that after a few years their work did not turn out to be satisfactory. Has the Department any system of inspecting work for a few years after it has been completed in order to find out if there are any flaws in it, and if these flaws are due to bad work on the part of contractors?  A large sum of public money is expended on the erection of school buildings.  It is very important, therefore, that the occasion for spending more money on them should not arise soon after their completion.</P>

      <P>I notice there is an increase in the allocation provided for dredging operations in the case of fishery harbours.  The increase is substantial compared with the amount voted last year.  I want to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary a long-standing grievance in connection with Arklow harbour.  The fact that there is continuous silting there tends to make the harbour unsuitable for any type of shipping, and particularly so for fishing.  Arklow is a very important fishery harbour.  I think this is one of the first works that should be taken in hands in view of the recent increased allocation.</P>
      <P>In the case of my own constituency, I see that rather indefinite provision is made for the erection of a Gárda barracks at Baltinglass.  There is only a token Estimate, but I would strongly urge on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity for proceeding with that work.  The present station is a private house which has been rented for some years.  It is a rather old building and is unsuitable for the purposes of a Gárda station.  I think it should be possible to provide a suitable site, and that there should be no delay in going ahead with the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wonder, in connection with the provision of public money for the improvement and renovation of this House, if it would not be possible to provide some money for the improvement of the statue at the Kildare <Col N="446" /> Street entrance to this House.  I think the statue is somewhat out of date.  I have a feeling which I think would recommend itself even to a frugal-minded person, that if a little public money was expended on the renovation of that good lady, if a little beauty treatment was provided and she were re-christened Mother Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My view in connection with this parliamentary building is that I do not think it ought to be scrapped. It is true that it is an old building, but I think it should be well able to serve its purpose for a good many more years, possibly with the aid of a little beauty treatment and renovation. I follow the same line in regard to the Presidential establishment&mdash;the President's residence.  I do not think there is any occasion for the erection of a new building.  I think that the building which at present houses the President is very substantial and quite adequate for the purpose.  It is beautifully situated and I think entirely desirable. Hence, I do not see any reason why public money should be expended on the erection of a new building, particularly when there are so many other purposes to which public money could be applied, purposes for which it is urgently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The erection of suitable school buildings in our rural areas comes <Col N="447" /> under this Vote.  It is probably true that there is an equally urgent need for their erection in urban and city areas.  In that connection, I am not certain if it is the function of the Parliamentary Secretary to decide and determine the contribution which local areas have to make for the provision of new schools. I know there are some very poor parishes and districts where it is very difficult to raise the one-third of the cost which a local area is called upon to pay for the provision of a new school.</P>

      <P>At any rate, so far as this Parliamentary Secretary's proportion of the work is concerned, I hope it will be expedited.  In many of the rural areas of Wicklow we have some very antiquated and very unsuitable school buildings.  The difficulty, of course, is that not only have we poor and inadequate buildings, but also we have a very small attendance in many of the rural areas, owing to the sparse population.  That might create a problem, possibly, in regard to the financing of new buildings, but the need is very urgent and I am sure the demand for expedition with regard to the erection of new buildings will have the Parliamentary Secretary's wholehearted support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one item in this Vote that concerns the provision of a Garden of Remembrance at Parnell Square.  This proposal has been subjected to a considerable amount of criticism on the ground that the space available is inadequate. In view of the fact that Parnell Square is central, and in view of the associations of this Square with Easter Week, I think it is not an unsuitable location.  It was rather unfortunate that a building was erected recently on that site&mdash;a nurses' home&mdash; but, notwithstanding that, I think the site, if put in charge of a competent architect, or whoever it is will design <Col N="448" /> such an undertaking, will prove satisfactory and not only can it be made a suitable monument to those who sacrificed their lives for this country, but it can also be an added attraction to our city.  It will add beauty to the centre of our city.  I do not think that the criticism that has been launched against this proposal is entirely justified.  While the site may be small, there is no doubt that if used to the best advantage it can provide a very beautiful Garden of Remembrance.</P>

      <P>There are several small rivers that flow from the Galtee and Knockmeal down Mountains and they cause a considerable amount of flooding.  I have a feeling that the Chair will endeavour to bar my toss by saying that this has reference to forestry, but the Forestry Department disclaim all responsibility for it.  One of the rivers is called the Tar and it washes down considerable quantities of silt, particularly following excavations for planting and drainage.  The silt washed down by the rivers accumulates and I have had several complaints of large areas being flooded. The Forestry Department suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary's Department is responsible for the cleaning of those rivers.  The people whose farms are inundated do not care who cleans the rivers.  The shifting of responsibility from one Department to another does not get the silt away.  There are two streams of that class along the Galtees, from Chair to Mitchelstown, and there are others along the Knock-mealdowns, where a similar position prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people are peaceful, and going to court is not in their style; they would sooner go in any other direction. I would be slow to suggest a limb of the law to advise them.  They do not like going to a solicitor's office.  I do not know whether a county court judge would deal with it, but a mandamus in the High Court might.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should consider removing the silt from these rivers, the names of which I shall give him.  The people there are in a bad way.  In one instance eight farms are inundated.  The tillage inspector <Col N="449" /> asks for the tillage quota and the crops are flooded before they are half-grown. The people there are between the devil and the deep sea.  Which is the devil and which is the deep sea, I refuse to say.</P>

      <P>I should like to have some information about the President's residence, Arus an Uachtaráin. Is it intended to remove any of the buildings covered by this sum of £22,000?  There is a suggestion that some very expensive alterations are to be made.  Having regard to the substantial nature of the structure, I think that would be very unwise. Surely it would be impossible to replace any of those buildings for many years to come.  I think they fulfil their purpose.  If there are to be improvements, they ought not to necessitate the demolition of any of the existing buildings.</P>
      <P>As regards the Leinster Lawn Cenotaph, when is it proposed to proceed with this particular work?  This matter has been under consideration for a number of years.  I quite appreciate the necessity for having the original Cenotaph taken down, but I think the time has come when there should be some definite move to replace the Cenotaph in memory of the three men who were the founders of this State.</P>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary give us any information about Kilmainham Jail?  There are quite a number of people interested in this institution and for some time past they have wondered what is going to happen, whether the building will be pulled down or reopened as a museum.  If the building is left in its present condition much longer, with no roof on portion of it and open to all sorts of weather, it will be very difficult to do anything with it.</P>
      <P>What proposals are before the Board of Works with reference to restoring the Stores Department Factory at St. John's Road?  That was a very interesting industry for the city.  Nothing was done with regard to it since the fire.  The citizens are very anxious to have that factory restored.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot give Deputy Hughes and some other Deputies <Col N="450" /> any encouraging information as to when we are likely to start on arterial drainage.  Deputy Hughes mentioned that we have machines on order and commented that we must have had some plant of our own, apart from what we are trying now to obtain.  I should like to tell the House and the Deputy that, even if we were in a position to go ahead from the point of view of plant, we are not ready to go ahead, inasmuch as there has not yet been any exhibition of the Brosna scheme, and the law provides for the exhibition of the scheme.  The law also provides for the lodging of objections by those interested and it provides a period of three months in which that may be done.  It contains a number of other provisions all of which have a time effect.</P>
      <P>When we were discussing the Arterial Drainage Bill, Deputy Hughes and other Deputies were very anxious to see that all the individual safeguards were included, to make sure that no dictatorial powers would be given to the Board of Works and so on, but when you set out to secure these rights and that protection for the individual, it usually results in some of the delays, and, I would say, necessary delays, to which I have referred.  We are getting along with the Brosna as best we can. We expect to exhibit the scheme very shortly, and, after that, the law will take its course.  I make the point merely to show that it is not our inability to obtain the machinery which is responsible entirely for the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which consideration would have to be given if we had the scheme ready and the machines on the spot.  I should like to make a start on drainage, and I am sure that other Deputies would be glad to see that start made, but, even if we were in a position to start to-morrow, a number of other vital matters would have to be considered.  The fact that turf production is important, that tillage operations are important and that the Brosna&mdash;with which we propose to deal first as it happens to be first on the list&mdash;runs largely through a turf and tillage area&mdash;all these factors would have to be taken into consideration. It would be necessary to have <Col N="451" /> regard to these matters from the angle of the wider interest, even if the necessary plant were available and the scheme itself in a condition which would justify us in going ahead with the work.  We have not got the machines.  We have been trying very hard to get them, and, as I said in my opening statement, we have an assurance that we will get those four machines at the end of the summer. In addition, I hope to see the scheme exhibited shortly and that will bring us a step nearer to being ready to go ahead whenever we think the time is opportune.</P>
    <P>Mention was made by Deputy Doyle and others of the President's establishment. There is no intention of erecting new buildings there, but the building itself is an old building, and a number of improvements and alterations are necessary.  Some of these are being provided for in the Vote and the work will, we hope, be carried out this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of national schools, Deputy O Briain has referred to some of the irritating delays which take place in that regard and has asked me to say&mdash;hoping, I suppose, that we are not contributing &mdash;to what extent we are contributing as a Department to such delays.  I interrupted him to say that we contribute our fair quota to any delays that take place.  It is not unusual where so many interests are involved for one interest to try to throw responsibility for these delays on to the shoulders of the other.  The manager, the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works&mdash;all three are concerned in the provision of new school buildings and the alteration and improvement of existing buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing very well, I think, in that regard.  I do not profess to have an expert's eye, but it seems to me that the designs of the new buildings which are going up are fairly good.  However, I am not going to be drawn off the track.  I do not propose now, nor is it my intention to try, to <Col N="452" /> apportion the blame for any delays which take place, but I should like Deputies who are interested to remember that it is a cumbersome and tortuous method.  First, the manager has to get a site.  The site has then to be inspected, and, if found to be unsuitable, the manager has to get another. He can only take a site in a certain place because he must have the school for the convenience of the district it is proposed to serve.  If that second site is found to be unsuitable, the same thing is repeated, and even when a suitable site is found, he has to get in touch with the Land Commission and go through a number of legal formalities.</P>
      <P>He then has to take up with the Department of Education the amount of the contribution he will be called upon to make depending upon the circumstances of the district&mdash;whether it is poor, medium or very well-off.  All these negotiations must take place and when the contribution which the manager has to make has been finally determined, the manager has sometimes to look for the contribution.  He may not have it and he may not desire to go into debt.  He may desire to make it in kind and may call on his parishioners to raise the materials and cart them to the spot and, in that way, make the contribution, or portion of it, required of him.  The contribution must, of course, be made before the work can be gone on with.</P>
      <P>In that setting, it would be foolish for any one of the parties&mdash;the Department of Education, the Office of Public Works or the manager&mdash;to make any accusation against the other of being responsible for delay.  All I can say is that I think we have a reasonably efficient school architectural branch in the Office of Public Works and that we have a number of architects employed there who are as good as are likely to be found anywhere and who are really interested, as all of us are, in the provision of new schools in the different cities, towns and rural areas.  Having regard to all the difficulties we encounter, and to some of which I have referred, these men try to get on with the work and to see that as good a job as possible is done.</P>

      <P>On Vote No. 2 it appears to me, and I think it must appear to most of the Deputies in this House, that when both Houses are sitting here the entire staff, particularly the Reporting Staff, are grossly overworked, and I think some arrangement should be made whereby additional staff would be provided, particularly in relation to the Reporters. When the Seanad and Dáil are sitting four days a week there is a good deal of work to be done.  An extra burden of work is thrown on all the members of the staff; but I think the Reporters are the worst sufferers in that respect. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it could not be found possible to supplement the Reporters, or supplement the assistance given to them, in respect of occasions when the two Houses are sitting together over a long period such as we have had from January up to the present time.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that, in his Budget statement, the Minister for Finance indicated that it is intended to add £1,000,000 to this provision.  When is this additional £1,000,000 to be voted?  Will a supplementary Vote be required or will additional legislation be needed?  I think that there was a good deal of misunderstanding in regard to this increased allocation.  It <Col N="462" /> has been represented as a very great boon, conferred on the agricultural community, but, on closer examination, it shows itself to be very little of a boon.  It is, in the main, an attempt to redistribute the allocation in relief of rates.  There will be some increase in the provision for the relief of rates in the case of people with valuations under £20 but it will be at the expense of those with valuations over £20.</P>
      <P>So far as any favour is conferred on people with valuations over £20, it will be by way of wage subsidy in respect of each man employed and that is purely of a temporary nature.  It is only to last for two years.  I expect that, at the end of the two years, the additional £1,000,000 will be completely withdrawn and we shall have no increase whatever in the grant for the relief of rates on agricultural land. The whole thing has been a kind of subterfuge for the purpose of representing to the agricultural community that a substantial boon has been conferred upon them, whereas only a temporary benefit has been conferred, which may not accrue to the farmer at all inasmuch as it is merely a wage subsidy, which may be offset by a decision of the Agricultural Wages Tribunal to increase agricultural wages by that amount.  I think that there has been a good deal of deception and misrepresentation in regard to the increased grant and that it ought to be dispelled.</P>

      <P>The procedure is that we pay the money according to the compensation assessed.  We understood from time to time during the war that other Governments had taken responsibility for compensation in respect of specific happenings&mdash;the British Government in one or two cases and the Government of Germany in other cases.  What recoupment has so far been made to us by either or both of those Governments and, in the case of the German Government, what proposals have the Government towards refilling the public purse for what it has paid out, as against the promise of ultimate compensation?  Are any steps being taken with regard to frozen moneys in this country belonging to Germany or the other countries involved, or is the position just that the taxpayer pays the bill, in spite of the fact that promises and assurances have been made by both Governments?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to direct attention to some matters of importance arising in the conduct of criminal trials and in particular in connection with the practice, apparently justified by the directions of the Attorney-General, to send forward for trial to the Special Criminal Court a number of cases which might <Col N="467" /> be more appropriately considered by the ordinary courts.  During the discussion of the Department of Justice Estimate last year, I raised the question of the cases being sent forward to the Special Criminal Courts at a time when the ordinary courts were functioning, and functioning well.  The Minister for Justice disclaimed responsibility for the cases that were being sent forward and said it was the Attorney-General who was responsible. At the same time, the Minister stated &mdash;and I accepted his statement&mdash;that so far as he was concerned, he would not permit cases in future, of a character which could be tried adequately by the ordinary courts, to be sent forward to the Special Criminal Courts.  I accepted his word, but notwithstanding that, during the course of the last 12 months, numerous cases have been sent forward, apparently on the directions of the Attorney-General.  All those cases were, in my view, and I submit to the House it is the proper view, of a kind which could be very adequately, in fact better, disposed of before the ordinary courts.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, was brought into force by proclamation of the Government. That proclamation is only to be made by the Government if the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order. That is the only justification for Part V of the Offences Against the State Act being brought into effective operation. It is under that Part V that these special courts operate.</P>
    <P>They, therefore, have their being only on the basis that the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate for the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order. I find that throughout the country, in practically every county and in every district, district justices are hearing cases under the Emergency Powers Act and Orders made thereunder. Even cases under the Emergency Powers Act have been brought in some cases&mdash;not very many&mdash;before a judge <Col N="468" /> or jury and in every case the law has been enforced in accordance with the proofs that came before the proper courts.  Therefore, I find it difficult to appreciate why these Special Criminal Courts should be chosen in selected cases instead of the ordinary courts.</P>
    <P>In all cases other than cases that I might refer to as cases involving order or involving public security, the courts are working effectively.  Juries throughout the country are doing a thankless job, and doing it extremely well.  It cannot be said, nor have I ever heard it urged, that juries do anything but decide cases in accordance with the oath that they took.  A special case was made, and had to be made, for dealing with matters that could not be dealt with by the ordinary courts of judge and jury. These were cases of safety, where the State was involved, where police witnesses were intimidated and shot and where even high officers of the Gárda were shot.  For that class of case, and for that class only, could a case be made for hearing before the Special Criminal Court.  It is an abuse of the powers given by the Dáil under Part V of the Offences Against the State Act of 1939, where ordinary courts are functioning and functioning well, where trained lawyers are there to hear these cases and to assess the evidence and give proper weight and effect to the evidence, that a selection of particular cases should be made by the Attorney-General and sent to these special courts.  I say deliberately that these courts are entirely inadequate for the hearing and the assessing of evidence in cases of that kind.  They were never intended for that purpose and they are not competent to fulfil that purpose.</P>
    <P>I had occasion&mdash;I hoped, for the last time&mdash;12 months ago to raise this point. I have seen in the last 12 months no slackening of the tendency to send cases to the Special Criminal Court. If there is a case, in fact or in law, under the Emergency Powers Act or under the scheduled functions, then there is no reason why these cases should not be sent to the district jusmarily, or to a judge or jury, if it is tice, if it is decided to hear them sumdecided <Col N="469" /> to have a more serious charge preferred and to have a trial under indictment.  I know of no reason why these cases could not be more adequately and more properly dealt with there than by the Special Criminal Courts.  I say deliberately that these Special Criminal Courts are not fit to deal with serious cases, involving sometimes very large masses of documents, books and accounts, whereas trained lawyers are capable of doing so.</P>
    <P>I do not know on what principle the Attorney-General selects these cases. One is tempted to say that it is on what the Americans, in graphic language, describe as &ldquo;rail-roading&rdquo;, and that a particular individual is selected to be &ldquo;rail-roaded&rdquo; to a conviction.  I do not know why these cases are sent there.  The more difficult a case is, the more reason there is for sending it to the ordinary court.  Where you have cases involving large masses of documents, as occurred in the last 12 months before the tribunal, what is the necessity for taking them away from trained lawyers and sending them to the Special Criminal Courts with non-trained lawyers?</P>
    <P>I do not know on what principle, if any, or what consideration, if any, those responsible for the selection of cases seem to have in sending some to the District Courts, some to the Circuit Courts for hearing before a judge or jury and some to the Special Criminal Courts.  However, I can guess the procedure, or the lack of procedure, and I want to take this opportunity, which I was unable to take last year, to protest against this practice.  Now that the emergency, or at least the more serious circumstances surrounding the emergency, with the ending of the war in Europe has come to an end, when we have our own courts functioning, with trained lawyers doing their job and doing it well, we ought to stop this extra legal court and let the law function. I hope this is the last time I will have to speak on this matter as it has given rise to considerable comment about the Government.  If the Government or the Attorney-General do not take effective steps to stop the practice, it will be necessary to harness public opinion against what I regard as an abuse under Part V.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> There is a case for Part V if it can be said that the administration of the ordinary courts is inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order.  Can it be said of cases that came before the special tribunal within the last few years, certainly within the last 12 months, that the ordinary courts were inadequate to secure the due administration of the law or the preservation of public peace? There was no question of the public peace involved in cases to which I adverted. There was a question merely of the administration of the law.  What is the justification for saying that, in reference to cases under the Emergency Powers Act, cases dealing with supplies and matters of that kind, or cases dealing with technical objections &mdash;sometimes serious objections&mdash;to the Emergency Powers Orders, the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice?  I say emphatically that there is no justification for the continuation of this practice, and I hope that this is the last time that anyone in this House will have to direct attention to it.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I want to refer concerns law charges.  It is a matter of importance, though, perhaps, not of as much importance as what I spoke of at the outset.  There has been a growing practice, not merely in the ordinary courts, but especially in proceedings which have been held before the special military tribunal, of relying on an accomplice for evidence to secure a conviction.  I use a word which was carefully avoided in the bad old days of the British administration of justice.  There has been a tendency or a practice to use the evidence of an accomplice, to use the evidence of people who have declared themselves in the witness-box as law breakers, and experienced law breakers, for the purpose of securing a conviction against a particular individual.  That practice has been animadverted to by the courts as a bad practice and contrary to the administration of criminal law.  It has been used frequently within the last 12 months.  It is hoped, as a result of some cases which have come before the courts, that it will not <Col N="471" /> be used any more.  We have had recent experience of men who have been giving their testimony stating that they themselves broke the law and had not been prosecuted.</P>
    <P>There is one particular instance of a case that came before the Special Criminal Court where a man's name was actually kept out of the newspapers. If the Attorney-General looks at the statement I have reason to believe he will find that in a case about 12 months ago the man was given an undertaking that if he gave certain information to the Guards he would not be prosecuted for the offence for which he was admittedly guilty, nor would his name appear in the newspaper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney-General had effective contact with the prosecution. I am being as careful as I can. I am not going outside the Attorney-General's responsibility.  It is right that the Ceann Comhairle has directed attention to that.  Of course, the Attorney-General did not give that undertaking.  The point I am making is that the Attorney-General should not utilise that particular evidence with that undertaking given and before him, when considering prosecuting. In those cases where people have gone into the witness-box and sworn positively, and with a certain degree even of enthusiasm in my hearing, that they were experienced law-breakers, they were the chief witnesses for the prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I hope that that practice will cease, and that accomplices will, at least to the very minimum, be utilised, and that they certainly will not be utilised in the Special Criminal Court because, there again, there is this distinction that in the ordinary courts the judge informs the jury of the position. He informs them that the evidence of men who come into the box with an undertaking, or perhaps without an undertaking but with the hope that by giving evidence they will not be prosecuted themselves, and so will escape punishment, is suspect.  In the case of <Col N="472" /> the Special Criminal Court, of course, the Attorney-General's counsel tells that to the gentlemen who are acting for the time being as judges.  It is an entirely different matter where a judge will warn a jury not merely that they ought not to convict, or that it would be unsafe to convict, but that in particular circumstances it would be their duty to acquit.  Now, that is not done by the Attorney-General's counsel in the Special Criminal Court.  Therefore, I say that in cases of that kind it is deplorable that evidence of that kind should be utilised before the Special Military Court.</P>
    <P>In one particular instance&mdash;I think it is the only instance that I know of at the moment, and I hope it is the only instance that will ever occur&mdash; circumstances arose in which a witness for the State, who was being examined by counsel for the Attorney-General, gave positive testimony which subsequently transpired to be in direct conflict with a statement which he had made to the Guards and which was in the possession of the Attorney-General's counsel.  That man was allowed to give evidence on oath which was in direct conflict with a statement that was given to the Guards and was in the possession of the counsel for the Attorney-General, and that statement was not disclosed to the court until&mdash; it was a risk&mdash;the defence insisted on its being produced.  It was always thought in the bad old days that that was a bad practice.  It has happened now under our native administration of the law.  I hope it will never happen again.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again on this Estimate that counsel appearing for the Attorney-General should be so instructed that their duty is not to secure a conviction at all costs, but to produce for the benefit of the court trying an accused person all available evidence, whether for or against the accused, and that if there is evidence in the possession of the Guards or of counsel for the Attorney-General which is not in the possession of counsel for the accused, or of accused himself if he is unrepresented by solicitor or counsel, then that that information should be placed at the disposal of the <Col N="473" /> accused or of his legal representatives. In that particular case that statement was not produced until it was forced&mdash; perhaps that is not the word to use&mdash; until counsel for the accused took what might have been a serious risk, particularly in the case of a trial before that particular court which is inexperienced and unversed in legal training.  We asked for that particular statement to be produced.  When it was produced it was found, in the first place, that it was in direct conflict with the sworn testimony of the individual giving evidence, and, secondly, in direct conflict with the sworn statement which he had made to the court that he had never before made a statement inconsistent with the testimony that he had been then giving. He was allowed to give his testimony, having sworn that his evidence there and then was not in conflict with any statement he had ever given, and it was not until he had been under cross-examination for hours that it transpired, on the production of his statement, that his evidence in the box was, in fact, contrary to his sworn statement&mdash;in direct conflict with his statement which was in the hands of the counsel for the Attorney-General at the time that he made it.</P>
    <P>That has never happened since, and I hope it will never happen again.  It was so serious that it was impossible for me to raise this on the Estimate for the Attorney-General's Office last year because the case on which it arose was then <i>sub judice.</i>  The case is now at an end, and I am at liberty to mention it.  It is so serious that I am taking this the first opportunity of protesting against it.  Perhaps my protest is now a bit stale, but nevertheless I feel that I should raise the point and make it clear that, so far as we are concerned, that should never happen again, and that counsel for the State should be directed by the Attorney-General not to secure a conviction at all costs, not, in the words of a famous gentleman who belonged to the circuit to which I have the privilege to belong &mdash;not to win a case but to see that justice is done.</P>

      <P>As an ordinary lay person I have often wondered why legal men should take such exception to this Special Criminal Court.  Deputy Costello has referred to it.  I think that an ordinary person approaching a question of this kind, having regard to the times through which we have passed, would have found no serious objection to the Attorney-General, or whoever was responsible, sending such persons or groups of persons thought to be responsible for crimes against the general community, before the Special Criminal Court in order to mark in a very definite way in the public mind the seriousness of their actions.  Looking at that action as an ordinary person, I cannot see what exception can be taken to such courts.  I believe myself that such courts would meet with, and have met with, general approval.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello referred to the type of evidence which has been produced by the Attorney-General in some cases and he also mentioned the undesirability of calling upon accomplice witnesses in criminal cases.  I imagine that however undesirable a witness might be, the court is always able to assess the value of his evidence. With all the knowledge and experience they have, surely the members of the court are capable of assessing the evidence of certain witnesses and of deciding whether or not a witness is a reliable and good witness and to what extent his evidence can be credited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if he has, surely all these factors will play a very substantial part in discrediting the witness. I think you can trust the court to be able to assess fully to what extent any value is to be placed upon the evidence tendered by such a person. Deputy Costello was right when he said all the evidence should be put before the court by the State; he was right when he said the State should not try to secure a conviction, should not enter the court with the idea of securing a conviction at all costs.  The State's duty is to see that all the evidence is placed before the court and then allow the court to make up its mind and to arrive at a just decision. I do not think there is anything inconsistent with that duty in bringing forward a witness who might not in the ordinary way be regarded as a credible witness.  The court should be capable of determining that matter.  I do not suppose there will much longer be any need to send forward such cases as those to which the Deputy has referred. <Col N="477" /> We hope such conditions will not continue for any great length of time. Even at the moment I think there is a diminishing need for such courts.</P>
      <P>Speaking as an individual and, as I believe, interpreting the minds of many people, while conceding that the legal profession have always taken exception to the activities of these special courts in what Deputy Costello regards as ordinary cases, I say that having regard to the type of crime that was fairly common during the past six years, having regard to how agitated the public mind was as a result of that type of crime and having regard also to the injury done to the community by those engaged in it, I would be far from making any apology to anybody on the part of the Government or on the Attorney-General's behalf, because he would have done what I would like to see him do&mdash;he would have sent serious cases before the court and by so doing he would mark them out in the public mind as coming into the category of very serious crimes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, it is perhaps not inappropriate that the last words we heard in this House to-night were a suggestion from the Parliamentary Secretary that it might be better if the ordinary courts of the land were done away with altogether and a military tribunal used in their stead.  Here we have a measure passing through this House which is, I think, the high water mark&mdash;at any rate up to the present&mdash; of the Government's attack on democratic procedure in this country. We have long been accustomed to the attitude of the Government that the local council should be controlled by their Party representatives in order that local administration by such bodies should be entirely in accord with the policy dictated by the Government. We have even had recently statements by a Parliamentary Secretary that the representatives, at any rate in a particular county, of the Fianna Fáil Party on a local body would be called together from time to time and instructed as to what their attitude was to be in the local council. We have seen the managerial idea introduced&mdash;an idea which was intended in its conception to put a better machine into the hands of the local representatives in order to relieve them of much of the detail in administering their areas and in order to put a more efficient instrument into their hands in carrying out their own local policies in relation to local matters.  We have seen that idea carried much further than was originally intended and the county manager made an absolute servant and tool of the Minister; and, by being made such a servant and tool of the Minister for local Government, made the servant and tool of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We now go another step further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as originally drafted, suggested that the Minister believed that circumstances might arise when, a rate having been struck, it might be clear that that rate was inadequate for the carrying on of the local services visualised under the Bill as originally drafted; and the Bill, as originally drafted, contained a provision that in such circumstances and on reconsideration of the matter a new rate might be struck by the local body.  By the time that we came to discuss this matter in Committee, however, we were presented with an entirely different idea.  We were presented with an amendment which, I think, was opposed by every single Deputy in the House, outside of the Government Party Deputies, and a new and brighter idea was introduced to the effect that when the Minister thought that a rate, having been struck, was insufficient to carry on the services of the county or the local body&mdash;as he understood them&mdash;he could order the local body to reconsider the matter and strike an adequate rate.  We now provide in this amendment on Committee that if the local representatives do not take his view of the matter, but stand on their own judgment and take <Col N="481" /> their own decisions in their own way, as local representatives dealing with local matters, and decide not to accept the Minister's judgment, the Minister can clear them out and put in a representative of his to take complete control of local finance, to strike whatever rate the Minister may dictate to him should be struck; in other words, to make, levy, collect and recover the rate.  It is obvious, therefore, that in the passage of this Bill through this House the Minister has taken advantage of the Committee Stage to pass an amendment by which he can, when the local council, having struck a local rate, decline to vary it in accordance with his instructions, remove them from their position of power and responsibility in representing the local ratepayers and put his own representative into their place; and he can, by all the powers at the command of the Government, through him take control over their pockets and collect whatever rate the Minister in his discretion decides shall be collected.</P>
    <P>Now, these powers are taken by a Government who came into office originally on a plank in their programme that they were going to derate agricultural land and reduce taxation generally.  Far from doing that, the total amount of rates collected in the year 1945-46 was £3,000,000 more than the total of the rates collected before they came into office and £2,000,000 of that was from county councils.  The total amount of taxation raised by taxes from 1932 up to the present year has increased by £17,000,000 and the whole tendency of increased taxation has been to shift the weight of the increasing burdens put upon the country by the Government from the taxes, which cannot now bear any more, on to the rates: and we have a number of Bills going through the House at the present time tending to increase the rates more and more&mdash;that is, rates that have been increased already by £3,000,000, to increase them still further by the powers the Minister is now taking to impose still further on the ratepayers. It is in that particular atmosphere that the Minister is taking under this measure the power to wipe out any local authority that <Col N="482" /> does not strike a rate high enough according to his outlook on the situation.</P>
    <P>It has been customary here in looking back over the times that have passed to realise that the introduction of local government, as we now know it, and the representative nature of local government, as we now know it, was the beginning of the political education of our people.  It was through local government that they developed a sense of responsibility, on the one hand, and, on the other, a sense of power; it was through local government that they developed the capacity to administer local affairs.  The general circumstances created by the Fianna Fáil Party's approach to local government have been such as to render local representative work distasteful to a very, very large number of our citizens and to a very, very large number of excellent people who have found it more convenient and more dignified to mind their own business&mdash;their own private business&mdash;and to avoid giving the public service what they would like to give because they are not allowed to give that public service in an atmosphere in which Christian, dignified and patriotic people would like to give it.  They are up against the Fianna Fáil machine.</P>
    <P>The public life of our country has been made all the poorer by the withdrawal of these excellent people from public service because of the circumstances created by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Now, there are those who still voluntarily give local service on local bodies and I sincerely hope that a large number of them will continue to do that work; but they are going to be put into a more undignified position, if you like, whereby they can be wiped out at any moment by an Order of the Minister who has power to dictate that they shall do certain things in their locality.  If the local representative body decide that it is not a thing that can be done and decline to provide, out of the pockets of their fellow-ratepayers, the money for it, they can be wiped out by a stroke of the Minister's pen.  The Minister is taking <Col N="483" /> these powers.  If I were unconcerned with the order and dignity of public life in the country, I would be tempted to say the Minister is welcome to these powers, because, great as has been the patience of our people, great as has been their bewilderment as to what they ought to do in face of the policy and tactics adopted by the Government Party, our people have not lost all sense of public responsibility and all sense of human dignity.  They realise that unless individual people and individual representatives in various parts of the country stand manfully, courageously and intelligently over local problems and local work, this country will be destroyed.  Even the very circumstances and difficulties of the last six years have awakened in the people a sense of the fact that they must trouble themselves and exert themselves in looking after their public affairs.  There is already an awakening throughout the country of that sense of responsibility.  The Minister will find that the wiping out of local government in the way in which he is doing it administratively and is now planning to do it in a more wholesale way, will not be tolerated by out people.  Our people realise that unless the local affairs of Cork are carried out with local intelligence and under local direction with a local sense of responsibility&mdash;the same applies in Roscommon and Galway&mdash;the affairs of the country as a whole will not be properly looked after.</P>
    <P>The strength of our people has never been the strength of one man.  The strength of our people has been the democratic strength spread throughout the country as a whole, where individual people realised their responsibilities and co-operated with one another to stand up to their responsibilities. It is the systematic policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to destroy that strength.  They have destroyed it to a certain extent.  There are things that you may damage but there are things that you may not wipe out completely and the Minister, I think, has gone to the end of his tether in attempting to wipe out local responsibility and local sense of service throughout the country.  This Bill will not be the tool <Col N="484" /> or the weapon in the hands of the Government that they expect it to be.  The country may be in for a certain time of difficulty when the new great plans of the Minister for Local Government and his two lieutenants reach the point of being put into effect, but when these plans and the cost of them disclose themselves and when the relationships between these things to the actual needs and capacity of the country reveal themselves to local ratepayers and their representatives the Minister will meet people that he will not be able to overawe or overcome.  While certain difficulties may arise between local bodies and the totalitarian-minded Ministry we have now, I am quite sure the result will be an awakening of Irish democracy to its responsibility, its rights and its duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The ambitions of men have been responsible for the disasters and calamities that have occurred in Europe, ambition to wield absolute and complete power over the lives of the people.  One would expect, in a country such as ours, that the advice and warnings of that august authority, Pope Pius XII, would be heeded by the Government.  Not so.  Under this particular Bill, if the House accepts it now in its Final Stage, the Minister for Local Government will have reached the zenith of his ambition, to sit in the Custom House and to dictate to every local authority in the country. We have been often told, in defence of the managerial system, that one particular power was the function of the local authority, namely, the power of the purse, that the manager had only executive power, and that if the local authority did not provide the moneys, the manager could do little about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the last power vested in the people of this supposed-to-be democratic country is going to be filched from them and vested in the all-powerful dictator in the Custom House.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs if the Fianna Fáil Party are going to vote for that.  The Minister for Local Government is quite satisfied that the people of this country are capable of electing a Fianna Fáil Government and that they show a high degree of intelligence in electing a Fianna Fáil Government, <Col N="485" /> but that they are intelligent only to that extent and that so far as the administration of their local affairs is concerned they are utterly incapable of electing a body from among themselves to administer and, because of that disability on the part of the people of this country, that it is now necessary for the Government to vest absolute power in a man, the individual Minister, whose ambition it is to wield absolute power over the local authorities in this country.  The expansion in local services that we were promised the Minister is going to provide regardless of the capacity of the people to pay.  No matter what the representatives of the people may think of these services, no matter what their practical experience may be, no matter what their idea is about the capacity of the people to pay, once the dictator in the Custom House says it, it must be done and the local authority can do nothing more about it. As a matter of fact under Section 30 the Minister can, by Order, wipe out the local authority.  He can threaten to proceed, and he can proceed, against the local authority by mandamus.  Considering the average member of a local authority in this country and his capacity to meet the fairly substantial costs that he might be mulcted in if the Minister had recourse to mandamus proceedings, it is a form of intimidation and it is unlikely that the average man would take the risk of involving himself in considerable cost.  The whole idea behind this section is repugnant to the idea of the rights and privileges and authority that are vested in the people.  It is trampling on the rights of the people and is arrogating to one individual here absolute power to destroy and to trample on the last vestige of local government in this country.</P>
    <P>Some day, if the House accepts this measure as it stands, we shall bitterly regret having set up dictators in one form or another.  It has been pointed out that the local authority is the training ground for parliamentary representatives. We all appreciate the necessity for some means of affording training for the representation of the people in their native Parliament.  Is any man, possessed of manhood, prepared to serve a local authority under an Act of this sort?  Is any man prepared <Col N="486" /> to be so servile that he will act under a Minister with the absolute power which is being taken in Section 30?  We have protested against these powers on the various stages of this Bill, particularly the Committee Stage.  Surely we should learn from the history of recent years and the advice of eminent authorities that at all costs we should preserve the authority of the people, government of the people, by the people, for the people.  What sort of definition shall we have of democracy when we have this piece of legislation in operation?  Is it too late to appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter before he takes the final step?  Has his ambition blinded him to the realities of the situation?  Does he not realise that the people will not stand for this sort of thing?  I suppose he is losing contact with the people. If he were not, he would appreciate that they do not want this kind of legislation and will not stand for it. During the passage of this measure, there has been opposition from every section of the House.  Very wise advice was given to the Minister from his own benches by Deputies with years of experience of local government.  He was not prepared to accept that advice.  He is machining this piece of legislation through the House, knowing that, in the ranks of his own Party, there are Deputies who will be forced to go into the Lobby and vote for it against their own will and judgment. I think that it is a most discreditable piece of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult patiently to discuss the type of speech which we have just heard from Deputy Hughes, and such as we heard, immediately preceding him, from his leader, Deputy Mulcahy. We are told that the purpose of the Government in putting through this measure is to make it easier for them to give effect to other measures which are at present before the House, or are in preparation, to improve the condition of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes said that the people will not stand for those measures, that they are opposed to them and that, if the representatives of the people had <Col N="487" /> their way, these measures would not be given effect.  Here is an Assembly in which the people are represented. Although I know that members of the Fine Gael Party make very grandiose claims for the amount of public support which they have, I have yet to hear them declare that they are entitled to assume the reins of government in this country as representing the majority of the people.  A remarkable change has come over the policy of Fine Gael within the past twelve months.  In 1943, 1944 and 1945, when the Government was beset with international difficulties of a most complex and critical kind, the leaders of Fine Gael were clamouring for more and more plans and more and more grandiose schemes.  We were told about the conditions which were being offered to the people on the other side of the water, about the far-reaching measures which were there being enacted, dealing with housing, public health and transport problems.  A little over twelve months ago, when Europe was still involved in war, this Government could not go quickly enough for Deputy Mulcahy and his followers.  We could not conceive plans sufficiently far-reaching or extravagant for them.  Of course, the sole reason they were in the forefront of those who were clamouring for what they called national reconstruction and post-war reconstruction was that they thought that the Government's hands were so fully occupied with the immediate and terrible problems arising out of the European war that we had not had time to plan or think of the future.  Now, when it is manifest that our statements, and our replies to them, during that period were, in fact, true, that these plans were being prepared, that Ministers were considering what the post-war situation was likely to be, that we had planned to develop our road system, our transport system, our tourist industry, our agricultural industry and prepared far-reaching measures for the improvement of the public health and the improvement of local administration in general, the tactics of the Opposition have changed.  We have Deputy Hughes to-night disclosing to <Col N="488" /> the people the real motive behind the obstructionist campaign which is being waged in this House not only against this Bill but against the Public Health Bill.  It was carried to such an extent in regard to a Bill to improve the health of the people and to enable us to survive as a race that no fewer than 600 amendments were put down to that measure.  Twelve months ago, they were clamouring for us to be progressive: to-day they want us to be as reactionary as themselves.</P>

They opposed us in every constitutional development we made.  They opposed us in regard to the Constitution, they opposed us in regard to industrial development.  At a time when they are opposing us in relation to the Public Health Bill, it is well to recall that there was a time when they opposed us in relation to wheat, beet and peat. When we increased the old age pension, when we brought in our measures dealing with the conditions of employment &mdash;no matter what we did&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is not to be wondered at, when we are quite frankly taking pains to ensure, in relation to measures which may be enacted by this Government or by our successors, that the old obscurantist mentality which animated Fine Gael from 1932 to 1939 and which was then put into cold storage and has now been taken out again, is not going to be allowed to prevent the onward progress of the people of this country.  Our people are entitled, if the country can afford it, to have the same advantages and facilities as people have elsewhere.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time to-day I addressed a question to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health inquiring from him if he was aware of the fact that Laoighis County Council had taken over an area of bog at Derrykearn and dispossessed 11 families who had previously been working that bog, and if that was correct would he take the necessary steps to see that these people were still allowed to work their portion of the bog.  The reply that I got from the Parliamentary Secretary stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am aware that the Laoighis County Council acquired portion of Derrykearn Bog and that up to 1945 the county council granted temporary turf production facilities in the bog to a number of private persons.  I am informed that these facilities have been withdrawn as the council have undertaken turf production in the area for the 1946 season so as to produce the quantity of turf required.  The persons concerned were fully aware that the accommodation provided was of temporary duration.  I am informed that there are alternative bogs in the district available for letting on terms not less favourable than those granted by the county council.  If this accommodation is not available or cannot be obtained the county council should be so informed in order that the matter may be reexamined.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From a Government point of view this may appear to be a very small matter, just a matter involving the rights of 11 humble families.  From the point of view of principle, it is a matter of the utmost importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It raises the question, whether the State is the State machine or whether the State is the odd 3,000,000 human beings that go to make up the State or nation.  It also raises the question as to whether the rights and convenience of humble people within the State, or the rights and convenience of councils and management schemes within the State are of the greater importance. The position with regard to this particular turf bank is as follows: There are people that live and farm right on the edge of that turf bank. A certain number of families, three in number, have been cutting turf there for the last 25 years.  It was part of their farming economy.  The farms were there, the houses were there and the turf bank was there adjacent to the farms.  When the emergency started the Government and Deputies from all Parties called on the public to bend their backs to the task of producing fuel and food, and when people in the turf areas were prohibited from using coal or from getting turf elsewhere they were exhorted to make arrangements to supply their own turf needs. A number of families from Abbeyleix town and neighbourhood six years ago took, at a rather high rent, the balance of this particular turf bank, the remainder of the population of that town taking any banks that were worth cutting on the De Vesci estate.  In the <Col N="495" /> case of this particular turf bank, roads were made into it and bridges built by the 11 families in question.  They paid their rent to a man named Gorry. When that particular gentleman passed out of ownership, the ownership passed over to a man named Tynan.  Last year there were certain delays and certain difficulties in the path of these 11 families in getting to their turf bank for that season.</P>
    <P>Unwisely and foolishly, but in simple good faith and in a trusting disposition, these 11 families went to the county surveyor of the Laoighis County Council and appealed to that body, in the interests of national fuel production and in the interests of their own economy, to see fair play and to insist that those banks would be set to them for a further period.  The county surveyor came out to the banks, met representatives of the 11 families, and stated to them: &ldquo;I will get the county council to take over this portion of bank and the county council will let it to you people again.&rdquo;  That was the ideal solution.  It pleased everyone and it was the way of getting the job done quickly.</P>
    <P>What was the amazement of these unfortunate, poor people when, five or six days later, they saw the county council lorries arriving with implements and squads of men, who started to cut turf for the county council.  The 11 families were left without turf. What I am stating here was, written to the county council by the solicitor employed to act on behalf of these 11 families and it was not contradicted. The letter went to the county manager. It said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All those people had turf banks rented from Mr. John Tynan of Ballinree, Abbeyleix, since the emergency and three of them were cutting turf on these banks for 20 or 25 years past.  Early in the present year Mr. Tynan hinted that he would not renew the letting of the banks to these people.  As a result of this they called upon the county surveyor and at the interview the county surveyor stated that if Mr. Tynan did not give the banks to them the county council <Col N="496" /> would take over the banks compulsorily from Mr. Tynan and rent them to these people.  The county council did, in fact, take over the banks but instead of giving them to the people who had been cutting turf there for years the county council cut turf on them for themselves, thus leaving these 11 families without any turf bank whatsoever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter was addressed to the county manager.  It was dated 16th April, 1946, and the county manager replied on the 23rd April.  He did not deny a single statement contained in the letter.  The reply was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the county manager to inform you that your clients were, as a special case, given permission to cut turf last year on the portion of Derrykearn Bog vested in the county council.  In order that the council may provide the quantity of turf required of them by Fuel Importers, Ltd., in the current season it is now necessary that they work the bogland in question to the full extent and it is regretted, therefore, that the concession granted your clients cannot be continued this year.  I am to point out, at the same time, that it is understood that lettings of suitable turf banks in the neighbourhood of Abbeyleix can be obtained from the De Vesci estate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to pay attention to the wording of this letter.  A special concession was made the previous year to allow these unfortunate people to continue to enjoy rights which they had enjoyed for 25 years, to continue to enjoy the rights of cutting turf in an area they had drained and bridged and made roads into.  It was a particular concession that they were not kicked out last year, but that they are kicked out this year, and that in the interest of one of the big concerns, namely, Fuel Importers, Limited.</P>
    <P>In the Parliamentary Secretary's reply he states that there are suitable turf banks that can be procured by these people on the De Vesci estate. Suitable from what point of view?  Is it suitable from the point of view of <Col N="497" /> turf, or is it suitable from the point of view of convenience?  There are three people living and farming in the Derrykearn bog, two of them tilling 30 acres.  They are to cut and drag and haul turf four and a half miles with their ponies and jennets and donkeys, absolutely interfering either with their turf production or their tillage.  If the turf on the De Vesci estate is suitable for these people, then surely it is suitable for Fuel Importers, Limited, and the extra few miles are much easier travelled in a county council motor lorry than by these people with their little donkeys and ponies.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that every good turf bank on the De Vesci estate was taken the first year of the emergency and these people went to Derrykearn. What is left in the De Vesci estate&mdash;at least, I have the word of experts in that area&mdash;is entirely unsuitable turf.  The county surveyor would not touch it for that reason.  The county manager, in his reply, when he says that there is alternative turf available, adds the words &ldquo;it is understood&rdquo;. Surely it is not so far from the county manager and the county management machine that he cannot ascertain whether there is or is not suitable turf available?  If there is suitable turf available, it is available for the county council.</P>
    <P>I am raising this matter not by way of controversy or anything like that, but just as a simple, trusting advocate of fair play.  I want protection for humble individuals from a mighty machine.  If the other turf is not so good and if it is less get-at-able, those are difficulties that are more easily surmounted by a great machine like the county council and its staff than by these little people.  One of the families concerned is a family of blacksmiths, people of exceptionally high character and of outstanding craftsmanship, people who have been doing smithy work for a very large portion of the county.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that for a business such as that you want high-quality turf, and even the best turf could scarcely be regarded as suitable.  Three of the people concerned are farmers living on <Col N="498" /> the spot.  Half a dozen others are working men who have to borrow the use of a donkey.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to get this whole situation properly and sympathetically considered.  I am perfectly satisfied from the reply given me to-day that it was based on information received only from one side.  Does it matter whether the county council took over this bank in March last or March 12 months?  We have the word of the Minister for Supplies that any people who were renting or working banks before the emergency would not be disturbed.  We have the word of the county manager for the neighbouring County of Tipperary that, where the county council took over a turf bog, any of the people who were renting and working banks in that bog would not be disturbed.  Is it right that we have one law laid down by the Minister for Supplies and another law carried out by the county manager in Leix; that we have one code of justice in the County Tipperary and a code of injustice in the County Leix?  It is with a spirit of confidence and hope that I place these facts before the Parliamentary Secretary, confident that a big injustice will be rectified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I received representations concerning this case and I am fairly well acquainted with the area and with the facts.  I can fully confirm the statement made by my colleague, Deputy O'Higgins.  Deputy O'Higgins has made an unanswerable case.  I know of a similar case near the town of Portarlington in which the Turf Development Board not very long ago interfered in the same way as the county council and county manager have interfered with the rights of local people in this case.  When the full facts of that case were put before the Turf Development Board, the board rightly and generously withdrew and restored the rights of the people who had been cutting turf in the place for a long number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has made an unanswerable case for the same type of action in relation to the 11 people concerned in this case, and I appeal to <Col N="499" /> the Parliamentary Secretary to use his influence and his good offices to persuade the county manager to change his attitude.  If the county manager and the county council, prompted by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, want to maintain the production of turf in this county at the same level as last year, they can have my assurance, from a fairly good knowledge of the turf banks in this county, that better turf can easily be got from many other bogs in the county, and even in the same area, without causing the inconvenience which has been caused to a large number of residents in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of Laoighis County Council, I am very familiar with the case presented to the House by Deputy O'Higgins and I join with him and Deputy Davin in appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to see that something is done for these eleven people upon whom great injustice has been done.  For the information of the Parliamentary Secretary, I might point out that the Laoighis County Council have received a notification from the Department of Local Government that the quantity of turf to be produced in the county this year has been considerably reduced.  I put the matter before the county manager some weeks ago and asked him to get the county engineer's approval for the cutting of some of the bogs on which the county council had ceased production this year, and for leaving the Derrykearn bog to the eleven tenants who have been cutting there for a number of years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a disgraceful state of affairs that these people in the immediate neighbourhood of that bog should be asked to go four-and-a-half or five miles to secure their turbary, and that the local authority should deprive these people of what they are duly entitled to have at their own doors.  I join with my colleagues in appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to have the other side of the case investigated, because I am convinced that, as Deputy Higgins has said, he got only the county council's side of the story.  As I say, <Col N="500" /> I am a member of the county council, and, with all due respect to the information supplied, as I assume, by the council, I go so far as to say that it is incorrect.</P>
    <P>These people have a genuine grievance and it was most unfair for the county surveyor or county manager to take the action taken in depriving these people of their turbary and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have an immediate investigation made.  Even if we do not get good results in this case, we want to see that it will not occur in any part of Laoighis again.  I ask him to make arrangements to enable these people, when the county council have secured one cutting from these turf banks, to get at least one year's cutting themselves.  They will be quite satisfied to start cutting turf towards the end of June or the first week in July, and I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should arrange with the county council to have the county council turf collected by that time to enable these people to cut their requirements of turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Emergency Powers Order enabling county councils to acquire turbary does not provide the Minister with powers to interfere to any great extent in this matter, and I think it is true to say that the less the Minister interferes actively in the matter of compulsory turf acquisition and turf letting the better.  These matters should be settled through consultation with the local authority, and by means of the operation of the ordinary rules of common sense and humanity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the area.  The target for Laoighis County Council for turf production has been reduced, but that target has to be achieved, as we understand, along with a very heavy road resurfacing programme.  These lessees were warned quite definitely that it might be necessary for the county council to resume the occupation of these lettings in order to carry out effectively and efficiently the production of turf on the bog in question. <Col N="501" /> The lessees were offered turf, which was admittedly brown and not black, at what would appear to be the same distance from most of their dwellings, at 4/6 to 5/- a perch instead of £2 14s. 0d.  They were offered this turf on the de Vesci estate.</P>
      <P>There are 150 persons cutting on the bog which has been offered as a substitute, and, while I understand that the development of the bog is not uniform in quality, it is possible to provide these lessees with suitable bog. They were offered, as a second alternative, turf on the Wood Street bog, and two families have already taken up banks in that area.  That particular bog has the disadvantage of being farther away.  I am interested to hear from Deputy O'Higgins that one of the lessees is a farrier of very high reputation. We have not been informed with regard to that matter but, in view of the fact that the Deputies have made representations, I am perfectly willing to communicate once more with the county surveyor and to make quite sure that the facts are as stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can do no more than to act informally and unofficially.  It would be most undesirable for officials of the <Col N="502" /> Local Government Department to have any direct control over the very pressing work of trying to distribute turf lettings to persons who have not been able to get turbary and providing for the production of turf for Fuel Importers, Limited, and enabling families to acquire temporary lettings. We are being constantly accused of dictatorship in local government affairs, and it comes rather badly that we should be criticised when we do allow a large measure of initiative to a local authority, but, as I have said, I will make further inquiries and I can assure-Deputies that, acting unofficially and informally, we will see that whatever can be done will be done in the interests of both parties.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for the manner in which he has approached this question.  As a Deputy, he is not unfamiliar with bog areas, and does it not strike him that the fact that people want to pay £2 14s. 0d. in one place, as against 4/6 in the other, bears. out the case I made?</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.10 p.m., until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 22nd May.</P>
