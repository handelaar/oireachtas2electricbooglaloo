      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the scheme relating to the payment to our nationals of unemployment benefit on their return home from employment in Great Britain, which he referred to on 8th May, 1946, has been submitted to him; and whether he is now in a position to make a statement in regard to the matter.</P>

      <P>Discussions are taking place in London between officials of my Department and the British authorities on proposals made by <Col N="1006" /> the British authorities regarding payment of unemployment benefit from the Unemployment Fund of Great Britain to Irish citizens who are unemployed on their return here after service in the British forces.  Arrangements regarding civilian workers who are unemployed on their return here from employment in Great Britain will also be discussed, but the matter appears to be regarded by the British authorities as one for consideration on the enactment of the National Insurance Bill at present under consideration by the British Parliament. Legislation will probably be necessary to implement any agreement that is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the serious danger to public health involved in the present practice of millers insisting on the return of sacks; whether he considers that this practice presents a fruitful medium for the spread of the germs of disease; and whether he has taken any precautions to ensure that such sacks are sterilised before being reused by millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the shortage of supplies of sacks and of the materials for their manufacture it was necessary to introduce the Emergency Powers (Sacks) Order, 1941, which renders obligatory the issue of sacks on a returnable basis.  I am informed that, on the return of flour sacks, the millers have them thoroughly cleaned and all reasonable precautions are taken to ensure that sacks are in a clean condition when repacked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that any sacks that go astray or get lost are charged for at the rate of 5/-; that this is a very big source of additional profit to millers and of loss to the consumer and retailer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as there is a profit to millers, that is taken into account in determining the reasonable gross profit.  The charge is a penal charge intended to ensure that sacks will not be lost, but will be returned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the work of the compounding staff attached to the Galway Central Hospital and the Galway Nos. 1 and 2 Dispensary Districts is heavy and increasing; if he will state what steps are being taken to establish a proper compounding system in relation to these services, and also, what staff it is intended to employ on this work and what salaries it is intended to pay such staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the Deputy's two questions together.</P>
      <P>The compounding staff for the Central Hospital, Galway, and the Galway (Nos. 1 and 2) Dispensary Districts, consists of one permanent compounder of medicine.  I understand that he resigned towards the end of last month to take up duty as compounder for a dispensary district in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1943, in view of the extra work involved in the care of emergency reserve stocks of medical supplies (the property of the local authority and the Minister for Defence) a temporary assistant to the compounder was <Col N="1008" /> employed.  The assistant was continued, with a break of some six months in 1944, until the end of March last.</P>
    <P>Instructions were issued by my Department by circular dated 18th October, 1945, that the reserve supplies belonging to local authorities should be taken into current consumption and use and it was accordingly considered that there was not any necessity for the continued employment of the assistant on the service of the local authority beyond the end of March.</P>
    <P>As regards the compounding system for the services in Galway the only proposal submitted by the manager was one for the continued employment of an asisstant compounder beyond the end of March, but an adequate case was not made for this appointment. If convincing reasons are put forward for a permanent assistant compounder the matter will be fully considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter rests, in the first instance, with the manager. We have had no representation from him in regard to the remuneration of the permanent compounder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJRogers" hpid="Mr. Rogers Mr. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that a number of milk suppliers in Sligo have been prosecuted for supplying to creameries milk which, although unadulterated, was found to be deficient in fats; and if he will consider introducing legislation to exempt milk suppliers from prosecution in such cases unless adulteration of the milk can be proved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister contemplate introducing legislation for the purpose of varying the present standards relating to fats in milk?  As the Minister is aware, several prosecutions have taken place in various parts of the country during recent years. Many farmers have been brought into court and proved, at all events to the satisfaction of the justice, that it was not their fault that their milk was under the standard.  As the Minister is aware, as a farmer, these deficiencies are largely due to seasonal causes and farmers cannot be reasonably held responsible for them.  The Minister will also recall that a test carried out on a Government farm last year revealed that many of the cows on that farm produced milk that was under the legal standard, notwithstanding the fact that these cows were fed and treated under the very best conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are carrying out the law as it stands. There is a test that is not very long known and it appears to be possible under that test to find out whether milk is adulterated or not.  If it is established that this test is reliable, I think amending legislation would be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Uá Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state whether he is aware that the population of Dunquin parish, County Kerry, who are largely dependent on agriculture for their subsistence, are severely handicapped by the absence of creamery facilities; and whether he will take steps to see that travelling creamery facilities are provided to connect <Col N="1010" /> the milk supplies of the area with the neighbouring creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dunquin district is served by the separating stations at Ballyferriter and Ventry.  The number of suppliers who are not in a position to avail of either of these stations is too small to warrant the provision of an extra separating station or a travelling creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say how many persons would be necessary to avail of these facilities in the Dunquin area before the service could be provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the estimates for my Department go, there are only 12 farmers who find it difficult to deliver their milk at Ballyferriter and Ventry.  If a station were established at Dunquin the number who supply Ballyferriter and Ventry would go to Dunquin, with the result that there would be three stations, two of them uneconomic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister seen the list of the people in the Dunquin area anxious to have a service there?  Has he recently investigated the situation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farthest away in Dunquin would be five or six miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a considerable distance for a small area where they have not any great transport capacity either in the way of asses or horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is admittedly a long distance for a supplier with a small amount of milk, but I do not see any way out of it.  The effect would be, perhaps, three uneconomic stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken into consideration that Dunquin <Col N="1011" /> is a small, compact area where the Irish language is entirely the language of the people, where the people are entirely dependent on agriculture for their subsistence, and that difficulties of this kind tend to reduce the number of the population there, and will he consider balancing any expenditure in respect of the third separating station against the desirability of helping to maintain the people in a small, concentrated Irish-speaking district, in one of the few places in Kerry where the language exists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the desirability of sending a lorry through the district to collect the milk each day&mdash;send a lorry from the Dingle creamery and collect at Dunquin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position at present&mdash;a travelling creamery goes around that area.  The difficulty about the travelling creamery is that in order to be economic it must have about three stops.  To do this would mean an additional travelling creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not bring the milk on a lorry to the travelling creamery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that this matter is being continuously investigated.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if the export price for turkeys for the coming season has been fixed and if so, if he will state the price; further, if he will state what was the levy per lb. on turkeys in 1945 and what was the total amount collected by way of levy in that year.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 26, to delete the words &ldquo;Joint Labour Committee&rdquo;. and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;Joint Employment Committee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the suggestion to use the term &ldquo;joint employment committee&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;joint labour committee&rdquo; is to avoid confusion.  It is generally accepted that where the word &ldquo;labour&rdquo; is applied to machinery or to matters relating generally to the industrial field, it is regarded as applying to workers on the trade union side. In this case, we are dealing with a joint committee of workers and employers and the Minister might consider that the term suggested would be more satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I can see some objection to the term &ldquo;joint employment committee&rdquo; as being perhaps confusing to workers, in so far as they might regard the committee as having functions in the matter of finding employment.  I was anxious to get away from the old name of trade board, mainly because the proposals here enlarge the functions of the committee to cover workers in a class other than trades and it seemed to me that &ldquo;joint labour committee&rdquo; was as good a phrase as I could devise.  I prefer it to &ldquo;joint employment committee&rdquo;, but it is of no great importance, and if somebody can think of a better name between now and Report, I shall be glad to have it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 77:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 35 to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The court shall not make an establishment order in respect of any workers and their employers unless the court is satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in case the application is made by an organisation or a group of persons claiming to be representative of such workers or such employers, that the claim is well-founded, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  there is substantial agreement between such workers and their employers to the establishment of a joint labour committee, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  the existing machinery for effective regulation of remuneration and other conditions of employment of such workers is inadequate or is likely to cease or to cease to be adequate, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  having regard to the existing rates of remuneration or conditions of employment of such workers, it is expedient that a joint labour committee should be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view was expressed here during the discussion on Second Reading and was also expressed to me by the organisation of trade unions that it was desirable to increase the opportunities for the establishment of joint labour committees.  As the Bill was introduced, the court could agree to the establishment of a committee on the grounds that the existing machinery for the effective regulation of remuneration and conditions of employment was <Col N="1024" /> inadequate and likely to remain inadequate or to cease to exist and that the existing rates of remuneration and conditions were such that it was desirable to set up such a committee. It was considered that the field was too limited by that phraseology and this amendment will empower the court to make an establishment order if there is substantial agreement between the workers concerned and their employers with regard to a committee, or if the existing machinery for the regulation of remuneration is inadequate or conditions in the industry are such that it is desirable that such a committee should be established.  The view seems to be fairly general that it is desirable that the court should not be unduly restricted in considering applications of this kind.</P>

      <P>On this question of periods and days, in Section 36 there is a period of 45 days after the date of publication prescribed with regard to the holding of the inquiry and it is now provided that the setting up of a joint labour committee will take place within 14 days after making the order; but there is a gap between the holding of the inquiry and the making of the order.  The Minister will be aware that, on previous occassions, that gap was fairly considerable and I think it should be kept in mind that there should not be delay on the part of the court itself in considering its decision on the completion of the inquiry.  There is no point in putting in periods with regard to publication and the setting up of a committee if the court itself can give rise to delay.</P>

      <P>This part of the Bill concerns trade board industries.  It deals only with trade boards.  It has nothing to do with dockers or with any similar class of workers.  The Deputy does not understand what his amendment sets out to achieve.  If his amendment was carried it would apply only to trade board industries.  It would not affect dockers or any other classes that, in the past, were not subject to trade boards.  The purpose of this part of the Bill is to extend the <Col N="1030" /> functions of the trade boards, so as to give power in future to deal with conditions of employment and rates of wages.  If the Deputy understood that, he would realise that for the first time we are giving trade boards power to prescribe conditions of employment, including holidays for workers in trade board industries.  I am quite certain that the Deputy flatters himself he has achieved his purpose of putting down this amendment in which he was very largely motivated in blowing his own trumpet.  Now that the matter has been explained to him, I am sure he will realise how invidious it would be for us to put in a provision of this kind and apply it only to the very limited class of workers to whom this amendment relates.  If there is to be a statutory obligation to provide longer holidays with pay that can be done by amending the Holidays (Employees) Act.  I think it is far more desirable to have joint labour committees with power to prescribe these conditions and give them the force of law, according to the circumstances of each industry, and that is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>

      <P>On the section, a question arose previously in regard to trade boards and possibly the Minister might give some consideration to it now, that is, the existing regulation that where an alteration is made in existing conditions and a new schedule is issued a further change cannot be made for a period of six months.  There is a good deal of objection to that among the workers covered by trade boards.  Possibly we shall not have the same radical changes in the future as we had in the past six years, but we might have radical changes in relation to working conditions and I think some discretion should be allowed to the committee in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue that arises here is, I think, clear.  If the State puts the authority of the law behind rates of wages for a particular class of workers there should, at the same time, be a reasonable assurance to the employers that there will not be further changes in a very short space of time. Employers are obliged to publish notices and maintain records and so forth and it is not unreasonable to give them an assurances that, if we prescribe new rates and make them legally enforceable, <Col N="1033" /> these rates will not be changed for at least six months.  There were exceptional circumstances during the war because conditions fluctuated rapidly but that will not be so in normal times.  We would not regard it as unreasonable to provide that where new rates are made they should hold for at least six months before they are again changed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.96:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 20, to delete paragraph (a) in line 19, and substitute therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the cost of maintaining in that area a normal family in a condition of working efficiency.</P>
      <P>This particular section requires that the court may, on its own motion, on the application of any interested party, fix in respect of an area a minimum rate of wages which, although not enforceable, will be regarded as a kind of moral standard.  Under sub-section (2), in fixing the standard wage, the court will have regard to the most recent cost-of-living number.  The purpose of the amendment is to try to give some reality to the work of the court in its effort to arrive at what would be a satisfactory standard rate.  I think it it quite clear that in this case the court will be going into an area to try to arrive at a rate of wages related to the conditions in that area which may be regarded as a fair rate.  In many cases, there will be no previous standards to guide them and, certainly, such existing standards as may operate will, in most cases, at least so far as existing experience is concerned, have very little relation to the actual needs of the persons working under these standards and, certainly, not very much relation to the actual needs in relation to the requirements of a normal working-class family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only direction that it is sought to give in paragraph (a) is that of the cost-of-living index figure.  That figure may be to some extent a guide, even if a very unsatisfactory guide, in relation to changes in existing rates. Where there is, say, a rate of wages of 50/- related to an index number of 100, if there is a change in the number of to 120, there may be some basis for an alteration.  But, to take the cost-of-living index figure as a basis on which an entirely new rate should be arrived <Col N="1038" /> at, I think is misleading and will add either to the difficulties of the court, or will take away from the value of any figure they may subsequently fix.</P>
    <P>The amendment, therefore, suggests that, in fixing the standard wages, the first consideration should be to have regard to the cost of maintaining in that area a normal family in a condition of working efficiency.  That would, I take it, have regard to what has been laid down by the Minister himself when discussing the Children's Allowances Act&mdash;the size of the normal family in this country and relating the size of that family to a particular area and the housing conditions and cost of food and try to arrive at what would be an adequate figure to provide for the family normal conditions of life which would enable them to maintain themselves in average comfort and in a reasonable state of health and to rear and educate their children.  There is, undoubtedly, a great deal involved which cannot be very well defined.  It seems to me that, if we are to seek from the court a guide to the fixation of a standard rate and that rate is to have any value whatever in relation to the normal requirements of a working-class family, we should provide the court with some indication of the way in which our minds are running when we formulate this section.</P>
    <P>I submit that to give to the court the cost-of-living index figure as a guide will not be helpful in this problem, though it may be, in ordinary negotiations taken as a guide in relation to existing rates of wages.  Here we are asking for a new rate to be fixed.  I suggest we would consider the fixation of that standard and therefore the guide which the court proposes to give to employers and workers should have relation to what in effect should be the basis of all wage rates, namely, maintenance of an average family in ordinary comfort and working efficiency, and the possibility of raising children and educating them.  That would give the court a basis on which to carry out inquiries, and when it made a decision, it would be of greater value than a decision related merely to the formal index figure.</P>

      <P>While the ideal sought to be achieved by this amendment will commend itself to all Deputies, I think every member of the House must be aware of the practical difficulties which will arise if it is implemented. This amendment suggests that the cost of maintaining a normal family in a condition of working efficiency should be taken into consideration.  We have to remember that there is in existence legislation which fixes a minimum wage for agricultural workers.  Is it proposed, by this amendment, to set up two bodies working together, and possibly not in agreement with each other, for the purpose of fixing minimum standards?  If we accept this amendment, will it mean repealing the agricultural wages code completely, leaving to the labour court the function of fixing a minimum standard?  If it is intended that this court will have the power to fix a minimum wage, it will require to be given additional power, because you cannot fix a wage higher than it is possible for an industry to pay.  If an industry is in a condition of deep depression and you fix a wage which is higher than the industry can pay, it means that the industry must close down.  Therefore, if we are to give this additional power to the labour court, we must also give it power to regulate the price of the produce of the labour; otherwise this amendment would be unworkable.</P>
      <P>It is about time the House should face this problem.  You cannot fix a minimum standard of wages for those engaged in agriculture unless you fix a minimum standard for prices.  Over the past 20 years workers in agriculture, both labourers and farmers, have been working for wages which did not enable them to maintain a normal family in a condition of working efficiency.  But they had to do it because prices were uneconomic.</P>
      <P>This is a good amendment if it is carried right through and if provision is made in the Bill to secure that the prices of the products of this efficient labour shall be such as will enable this minimum wage to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very unsatisfactory section and sub-section (2) is particularly <Col N="1040" /> unsatisfactory.  Deputy Larkin rightly pointed out that a reference to the cost-of-living index number as a means of maintaining a standard is a very unreliable guide.  The purpose of the cost-of-living index figure is to ascertain the cost of maintaining unaltered the 1914 standard&mdash;in our case, the 1922 standard adjusted to 1914 prices.  Obviously, such an index figure presupposes the existence of some standard, any increase in the cost of maintaining which can be measured by reference to the index figure.  But an index figure which merely measures the increased cost of maintaining that standard is not obviously a good yardstick to use for the purpose of creating a standard.  It would be all right if you had already a standard and if the purpose was to ascertain in what way that standard was to be increased by reference to wages so as to maintain its previous level.  That is difficulty No. 1.</P>
      <P>Difficulty No. 2 seems to arise from compelling this court to have reference to the statutory minimum wage for the time being in force for the agricultural worker in that area.  Phraseology like that seems to go down on the scales against the town worker.  Nobody could agree that the wages paid to agricultural workers are decent wages. The miracle is how the agricultural workers manage to exist on the appallingly low rates of wages paid them to-day.  I do not want to stir up any contention on this Bill, but Deputy Corry, who will not be accused of any want of love for the Government Party &mdash;at least in public&mdash;recently described the condition of agricultural workers. He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What is the use of giving them holidays?  They would not have 5/- in their pockets, and the only place they could go on holidays is the county home.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He said further:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The poor devils have not a decent suit of clothes on their backs on Sundays.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was Deputy Corry's portrayal of the economic condition of the agricultural worker.  That is the poor fellow we are going to take as one of the <Col N="1041" /> yardsticks to be applied in the measurement of wages for town workers.</P>
    <P>Nobody, unless he has a jungle philosophy, can justify the rates of wages paid to agricultural workers.  They cannot be justified by reference to any ethical standard.  They cannot be justified by reference to the cost of living. It is no wonder the position of the agricultural worker is worse than it ever was.  You may give him 44/- a week, but you must remember £1 is worth only 10/- &mdash; if it is worth that.  If you want to buy clothes, the evidence is that your £1 is scarcely worth 10/- from the point of view of pre-war value.  It is most unfair to regard the conditions of agricultural workers as a yardstick to measure the rates for town workers.  I never could understand why an agricultural worker, who is as skilled as any factory worker, is selected for the purpose of paying him a particularly low wage.  Very few factory workers could do the comprehensive type of work an agricultural worker can do. Unfortunately, we have a rotten tradition for paying the agricultural worker a very low standard of wages.  We ought to recognise that he is a skilled agricultural operative.  His skill takes as long to acquire as it takes an industrial operative to acquire his skill.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have a warped sense of values with reference to the agricultural labourer.  From the point of view of national economy he probably plays a bigger part than any other worker.  He certainly did in the last six years and nobody can suggest that they were not the years in which to apply the most reliable of all tests, namely, whether the nation could survive without the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>The amendments will still leave the section in a bad way.  I do not like the ring of the section.  Perhaps the easiest way to meet the difficulty would be to give the court power to fix a standard rate which, in its opinion, should be paid to a male worker.  Do not tie it down to adverting to certain things, but give it power to exercise its collective wisdom in fixing a rate. It may if it likes advert to these factors or any other factors, but it <Col N="1042" /> ought to have wider discretion than to be tied down to an examination of the cost-of-living index number, which is meaningless now, because you have a national figure and not a local figure. In fact, in a number of small towns there never was a local figure ascertained and it will require a special inquiry to ascertain what was the cost-of-living index figure.  For instance, in regard to Naas or Newbridge, there was never a local index figure.  At present there is a national figure and that national figure has existed for the last 26 years.  It is apparently not contemplated to go back to local figures.  For the phrase to have any meaning it would be necessary to have an examination of what the local index figure was, not what the national figure was.  I suggest the Minister would get whatever valuable effect he is striving for by deleting sub-sections (2) and (4).  Whatever value is in the section is thereby preserved and some of its most objectionable features would disappear by the deletion of these two sub-sections.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be no harm if I indicated the origin of this section.  In the operation of Emergency Powers (No. 260) Order, it seemed to me, and my impression was confirmed by many trade union officers, that the making of a standard rate Order prescribing a rate of wages for unskilled workers in small towns, even though that rate was not legally enforceable, had nevertheless the effect of securing that that rate was paid to unskilled workers in these towns. The employer was under no legal obligation to pay, but once the Order was published, he felt himself under a moral obligation to pay and in a large number of cases did, in fact, pay the standard rate.  That experience of the operation of the Emergency Powers. Order seemed to me to indicate the desirability of having some similar process operate in future and I therefore framed this section to give the labour court power to say what was a reasonable rate of wages for an unskilled adult worker in a town without making that rate legally enforceable. By doing so not merely was it <Col N="1043" /> likely that employers in the area would feel under moral pressure to pay the rate fixed by the court but that rate could also be used as a yardstick in the determination of remuneration for other classes of workers, juvenile workers, female workers or workers doing work that required some element of skill.</P>
      <P>If, however, the court is to be given power to determine a local standard rate in that manner, it is clear that some terms of reference must be given to it and I contemplated giving it the obligation of examining the conditions prevailing, the rates actually being paid in the area.  I do not think it would be desirable to ask the court to undertake the inquiries that would be involved in the adoption of the amendment.  I do not think the court could ascertain without a very detailed inquiry what the prices of commodities in a particular area are and what quantity of these commodities would be required by a normal family to maintain it in a state of working efficiency.  I thought it was reasonable to ask the court to find out what rates are being paid to certain classes in the area, to agricultural workers in the vicinity of the town and to skilled workers in the locality and, having regard to these criteria, fix a rate that in their opinion would be reasonable for unskilled workers in the area.  The rate fixed by it would not necessarily be the rate which the court would consider adequate to maintain a normal family in a state of working efficiency.  They would not have to take into account the reasonableness of the agricultural rate or the skilled workers' rates.  They would only have to take into account what these rates were and relate their proposed rate for unskilled work to the actual rates being paid to these other classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever views may be held as to the adequacy of the present minimum agricultural rates, they do not really count as arguments against the section because, if circumstances should permit of a doubling, trebling or quadrupling of the present minimum rates, the section would still apply and the court would still have to have regard, if sub-section <Col N="1044" /> (2)  remained unchanged, to the standard minimum rate for agricultural workers.  The argument against the proposal in the Bill on the ground that the minimum agricultural rate is now too low presupposes that the minimum agricultural rate will always be too low. Without accepting the views expressed concerning the present rate, I would point out that we need not necessarily assume that conditions in agriculture will not permit of the payment of higher rates at some time and the circumstances will not necessarily mean that that agricultural rate would be regarded as a fair standard.</P>
    <P>However, there is the section.  It caused me more trouble that any other section in the Bill, in private discussions prior to its introduction, and it was quite obvious, when Deputy McGilligan got going here on the first day the Bill was introduced, that it was going to be the cause of possible misrepresentation in future as well.  There was certainly no intention in framing the section to adopt a policy of relating all the wage rates to the agricultural rate and I came to the conclusion some time ago that perhaps the best course to adopt is to take the section out of the Bill altogether.  I would do so with some reluctance.  I think there is some advantage to be gained by unskilled workers in local towns by having this function given to the court, but rather than enact the section without giving the court some terms of reference, or take the risk that the retention of the section in the Bill would give cause for misunderstanding, or may lead to misrepresentation as to the purpose of the Bill as a whole, I would take the section out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Can you really ask the court to fix a rate &ldquo;in the blue&rdquo;? Must not they have some terms of reference, or quite clearly they will make terms of reference for themselves? Any court sitting down to deal with this matter must have some standards by which to arrive at their conclusion, and it does not seem to me that it is possible to ask the court to do anything else except to have regard <Col N="1045" /> to the conditions prevailing in the towns, find out what skilled workers get, what unskilled workers get, find out what the general wage structure of the area is and fix a rate for unskilled adult workers, which will have a reasonable relation to the other rates. If it had not a reasonable relation to the other rates, then it would be completely inoperative.  That section can only produce the results I have in mind if everybody regards the rate fixed by the court as a fair rate having regard to the conditions prevailing in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference to the cost-of-living index number is not intended to provide for a &ldquo;hay and fodder&rdquo; rate, which I think is the phrase used professionally to describe sliding scale arrangements, but is intended to give the court the right to vary the rate that it may fix having regard to local conditions and if there are changes in general circumstances such as might be reflected in the cost-of-living index number.  The cost-of-living index number may not be a reliable guide to the actual cost of living at any time, but alterations in the number are, I think, a fair enough guide as to changes in the cost of living from time to time.  Certainly it is the only guide we have, and therefore it is appropriate enough to say to the court: &ldquo;You can fix a standard rate for unskilled workers in local towns, and then, from time to time, if the cost-of-living index number changes, you can vary that rate&rdquo;, but primarily that rate, to be effective, must have regard not to the cost-of-living index number and not to such other considerations as I have mentioned but to the general level of conditions in the locality and to the willingness of everybody there to accept it as a practical and workable basis.  Therefore, while I would not necessarily oppose the suggestion that the section might go through with sub-section (2) out altogether, we would only be deceiving ourselves if we thought that the court would proceed on any other basis except the basis I have indicated, namely, the actual conditions prevailing and, if that is so, there is no reason why we should not avoid misunderstanding <Col N="1046" /> by providing in the sub-section that the court, in fixing these standard rates, shall have regard to the rates being paid in the area at the time.</P>

      <P>Picture for a moment what is likely to happen.  The court may, on its own motion or on the application of an interested party, fix in respect of an area the wages to be paid to a male worker of the age of 21 years or upwards, so that if the court gets a motion in that respect, it can also accept a motion to proceed on a survey of what wage rates should be paid in a particular town to unskilled workers.  One would imagine that a court consisting of three or five people would say: &ldquo;Before we fix the rate for unskilled workers, let us get a picture of what the wage levels are at the moment, and let us look not merely at what the rates are in the town but at what they are in neighbouring comparable towns&rdquo;.  That is not even suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the intention in the matter.  The court, in the course of its survey to ascertain what reasonable rate should be fixed, will have regard to every consideration. It will know what the industries in the town are, and an industry can often fix a wage standard much more effectively than anything else in the town, because in a town in which there is good employment in the form of one or two main industries, that employment fixes a wage scale for that town more effectively than a court could fix it.  The court will take cognisance of that fact when surveying the wage position and will probably also ascertain what the wage rates are in neighbouring towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is satisfied with that, that the court should have regard to the rates paid in the town or in neighbouring towns, I am satisfied.  I can see this court exercising this function so long as it is confined to deciding a wage which has a reasonable relation to the prevailing wages in the area, but I can see it <Col N="1047" /> declining to exercise the function if it is asked to decide what is the wage which would keep a working family in reasonable efficiency, because that is bringing them into a very controversial field which they would normally be inclined to avoid entering.  I know that, no matter what wage they may fix in that regard, there will always be some people prepared to contest its adequacy and others who will relate it to conditions in perhaps completely different areas.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if this section is to be effective, we must confine the court not to questions of theory, or what might be regarded as questions of theory, namely, the diet which an unskilled worker would require, the varieties which should exist in that diet and the alterations which might be necessary in it from time to time, but to the ascertainable facts of the wages rates workers are getting, what other workers of different classes are getting in the locality and, if it is declared to be the standard rate, what rate will likely be accepted by employers and workers generally as reasonable in all the circumstances, because if it is not likely to be accepted by employers as reasonable, they will not pay it, and if it is not likely to be accepted by workers as reasonable, they will not be satisfied.  It has to be a wage which, in the opinion of the court and having regard to the circumstances of the area, will be accepted as a reasonable rate and, therefore, become generally operative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new wage-fixing machinery for what is admitted to be a very deserving section in the matter of protection of the character suggested, and I suggest that, in fixing terms of reference, the Minister would be wise to allow a little more scope than he is allowing.  He says that the court would not be rigidly tied down but would have regard to circumstances in the locality, but a very serious restriction is being placed on the court when the provision is confined to a male worker of 21 years or upwards.  That seems to visualise merely a single person.  Our amendments suggest that <Col N="1048" /> a man, whether he is 21, 22 or 23 years of age, in a rural area or a small town ought to have some prospect of getting married and rearing a family.  As I read the terms of reference in the section they refer only to individuals and we know what happens in their case.  They are employed at very low rates of wages at all types of work and are unable to get married.  I do not think we should perpetuate that system. If this is to be new wage-fixing machinery, designed to work harmoniously as between employers and workers, the Minister would be setting a very good headline by enlarging its scope.  There would be no difficulty in the court having regard to the cost-of-living figure and relating it to what the maintenance of a man, his wife and three children would demand.  Deputy Cogan has spoken of the agricultural labourer, and I suggest that all the industries will have to be brought up to a standard which will enable them to pay a rate which will keep a family in decency and frugal comfort.</P>

      <P>The court will find no insuperable difficulty in making its inquiries around the locality and in ascertaining, having regard to the cost-of-living figure then prevailing, what would be necessary to maintain a family of three or four.  That, I suggest, will be the basis on which they will operate rather than on the basis of perpetuating what we consider to be a grievance, an inequality.  The amendment does not tie the court down, but it will enable them to have the proper outlook and will create no additional difficulty in the matter of making the necessary inquiries and coming to a decision as to what ought to be the minimum.  Surely there is nobody in the House but will hope for the fixing of a standard rate which will enable Irish boys and girls to get married and to bring up their families in this country.  Many of them at present are unable to get married because of the paucity of the wages paid, with the result that they are <Col N="1049" /> driven out of the country.  There is a very important principle underlying this amendment, and, while it will not put any restrictions on the court, it will provide a foundation sufficiently broad to enable the court to do a good job of work.</P>

      <P>I regard this section as one which might be made the most important in the whole Bill, because it is the first attempt so far in any legislation of this character at bringing about what might be generally regarded as a reasonable minimum wage.  It is, unfortunately, circumscribed here by conditions which will nullify the effect of sub-section (1) and we are particularly anxious that sub-section (1) should stand because of its broad principle, provided we could get terms of reference on the lines of the amendment now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated that if there was controversy about this particular section he would prefer to drop it altogether, but the terms of reference suggested in the amendment might be suitable.  Economists, who might be described as having a good social background, have always lamented the fact that we have not had a proper wage standard here.  The whole approach, so far as wages are concerned, has been the value of a certain amount of work to the employer, without any regard whatever to the commitment of the individual who is selling his labour.  A new effort is being made here.  It is suggested that there is something more than the mere volume of labour sold, that there are the requirements and the necessities of the individual who is selling that labour.  The acceptance of sub-section (1), with suitable terms of reference, would be a corollary.  We believe that that particular section is <Col N="1050" /> peculiarly proper to a court of this description, and that it would not be impossible to round it off generally in this respect.  If the court indicates that in a certain area, either in Ballydehob or Ballina, certain wages are not being paid, and that that carries this responsibility, that a man, if married, should get for his labour what would ensure the certainty of being able to bring up his family under decent conditions, it does not carry compulsion, but there is a tremendous moral value behind what it would do.  I am particularly anxious to see that section stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference must be such as will not involve the court in an inquiry outside its functions. I would dislike putting upon the court the obligation of expressing any opinion as to what would be regarded as the adequacy of any particular amount of money per week to provide a proper diet for a family of any particular size.  The court will have the benefit of the dietetics survey which is being carried out by the Department of Local Government and other relevant information.  In determining standards we should have regard to the fact of conditions in the locality. There should be something, not so much as a guide to the court, as for the purpose of protecting the court against the charge of having fixed a rate insufficient to provide for the dietetic needs of a family, and to keep the family in a condition of proper working efficiency, when the court is only trying to improve the actual conditions prevailing and to relate wages to those of other workers in the locality.  I wonder if it would meet Deputies' point of view, if sub-section (2) were altered to read, &ldquo;In fixing the standard wage for any area the court shall have regard to the prevailing level of wages&rdquo;.  There should be an indication on the face of the Bill that the court is dealing solely with actual rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It has been laid down by the Popes in the Encyclicals that the least any worker has the right to expect is a wage which will maintain him and his dependents in frugal comfort.  The amendment falls far short of this.  Why not give some lead to indicate to employers that they must differentiate between the human being and the animal?  The animal will be fed in order that it can work. Efficiency is all right when talking about animals.  But I think when drafting legislation we ought to live up to what we talk so much about when referring to human beings.  I hope the Minister will indicate to the Parliamentary draftsman that we would like to have something in the Bill dealing with that question, so that the court would be free to develop a policy on the line of treating the worker as a human being.</P>

If this section were phrased in such a way as to fix rates of wages for people under 80 years of age I would prefer that approach rather than to stipulate &ldquo;21 or upwards&rdquo; because that lays emphasis on the 21 and the impression <Col N="1053" /> is given that rates of wages are being fixed for youths, without any cognisance of the possibility that some of those may be married men with four, five or six children dependent upon them.

      <P>On the section, I would like to say that, first of all, I agree with the Minister about the moral force of a standard rate in areas. Even where it is not obligatory, it has an effect quite outside the possibly narrow circle within which it is applied.  I think the Minister very aptly used the expression &ldquo;yardstick&rdquo;; and until rates of wages are made more uniform that will serve a very useful purpose.  I would like to call the Minister's attention to line 16 where he puts in &ldquo;unskilled work for 48 hours in a week&rdquo;.  Deputy Norton has called attention to the expression &ldquo;21 years of age or upwards&rdquo; and he wants the word &ldquo;adult&rdquo; to be put in there instead.  I would like to see that &ldquo;48 hours in a week&rdquo; taken out and the words &ldquo;normal week&rdquo;, or something like that, substituted because where it is 48 hours a precise amount of work is specified and anything over or under that would be looked upon as a plus or minus.  I would suggest to the Minister that the easiest way would be, when fixing the standard, to say for so many hours.  I think that would improve this section.</P>

    <P>The next matter to which I wish to call attention&mdash;it is only a minor one &mdash;is that this seems to me to be somewhat out of place here and that it should have come much earlier.

      <P>(1)  The tribunal established under Section 9 of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, shall be deemed to be a Joint Industrial Council for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Nothing in the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, shall operate to prevent the setting up of a similar tribunal for the purpose of determining for the purposes of this Act, the relations between the board and (a) the salaried employees of the board entitled <Col N="1055" /> to superannuation and (b) the casual manual employees of the board.</P>
    <P>Under Section 9 of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, there is power for the establishment of a tribunal, one member of which shall be nominated by the board of the Electricity Supply Board and another member by the manual workers, and the chairman either on the agreed nomination of the two ordinary nominees or, in default, by agreement with the Minister.  That tribunal has to deal with all matters of disputes arising between the manual employees and the board.  I would suggest that, in view of the provision in Part V of this Bill for a joint industrial council, that tribunal established under that Act should be regarded for that purpose as a joint industrial council in order that the casual manual employees, or the other employees, who are entitled to superannuation would be regarded as employees entitled to consideration under this Bill.  I would suggest that the Minister should accept that amendment. The Minister has a later amendment himself, but I do not think it meets the same point.</P>

      <P>My amendment meets the point in sub-section (1) of Deputy Mulcahy's amendment in full.  It puts the tribunal established under the Electricity Supply Board Act, 1942, in precisely the same position as a joint industrial council.  I am not quite clear as to what Deputy Mulcahy intends by sub-section (2).  If he intends that the court established under this Bill can intervene in disputes between the board and those of its staff who do not come under the tribunal set up under the 1942 Act, that is covered. If it is intended to provide that the Electricity Supply Board Act, 1942, will be amended so as to establish a second tribunal for workers, other than manual workers, then it would hardly be in order here.  An amendment would have to be made to the Act itself.  I am not quite clear as to what is meant.  It may be that he doubts whether this court can intervene <Col N="1056" /> in disputes affecting employees of the Electricity Supply Board who do not come under the tribunal set up by the Act of 1942.  If that is the position, then I can remove his doubts because such disputes are not outside the scope of this Bill and this court can intervene.  In so far as the court itself is concerned, my amendment, No. 102, is intended to do exactly what is contemplated by sub-section (1) of this.</P>

I am taking out the manual employees for whom this tribunal was set up under the Act of 1942.  We are putting the tribunal in the position of a joint industrial council so that a dispute would have to be referred to this court by the tribunal as it would by a joint industrial council.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 99:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where a trade dispute exists or is apprehended, the court may, and shall at the request of a person concerned therein, investigate the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was suggested during the course of the Second Reading debate.  It was argued then that it was undesirable that the court could intervene in a dispute only at the request of a person concerned in the dispute <Col N="1057" /> and that there might be circumstances under which neither of the parties concerned in the dispute would, in fact, take the initiative to have such a dispute referred to the court.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is to enable the court to intervene in the dispute on its own initiative.  This amendment might be regarded as linked up with that in the name of Deputies Norton and Larkin to delete sub-section (5).  The original scheme of the Bill was that the court was obliged to intervene in a dispute if any party concerned requested the court to intervene.  It could not refuse to intervene in a dispute at the request of a party, except in the circumstances contemplated in sub-section (5), namely, if the parties concerned refused to make some temporary arrangement which would avoid a stoppage of work until the court had expressed its opinion.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the provisions of sub-section (5) have created some suspicion that the court will act upon the principle of no negotiations until work is resumed.  That certainly was not intended.  It was intended to give the court power to ask or even to require, as a condition of its intervention, the parties to restore the <i>status quo</i> until they had reported on it.  If, however, there is suspicion as to the effect of sub-section (5) and a desire to delete it, I would be agreeable to its deletion. That agreement to its deletion is influenced by the fact that we are now proposing to amend sub-section (1) to give the court power to intervene in a dispute on its own initiative and, presumably, not to intervene if it thinks its intervention might not do any good.</P>

In other words, if there is a <Col N="1058" /> dispute involving a large number of workers, one individual worker could not on his own initiative secure the intervention of the court if the others did not want it.

      <P>I would suggest to the Minister to consider the question of compulsory reference to the court of an impending dispute, while placing no obligation on either the workers or the employers.  Much stress has been laid during the debate on the effect, particularly on the trade unions, of an unofficial strike.  I think it is desirable, in the event of a dispute arising, that before strike action takes place, the matter should be compulsorily referred to the court, putting no obligation on either of the parties to the dispute, and no obligation on the court to make any order in the matter. That might have the effect of preventing a strike and, possibly, reaching an agreement before the strike takes place.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 100, 103 and 104 have really all the same idea.  I do not know why the court should be tied up as to the terms on which they could look into a trade dispute.  If they have any common sense, they will not intervene unless they can be helpful.  There is often a certain amount of difficulty in the case of a dispute, especially a protracted one, as to the question on whose authority a meeting has been called.  I think it would be better if the Minister wiped out sub-sections (2), (3) and (4).  I would also suggest to him that he should amend sub-section (5) to meet the difficulty of the Labour Party.  I certainly would not suggest that the court should refuse to have anything to do with a dispute if it is an unofficial one.  It certainly should not be outside their competence to consider what recommendation they ought to make.  I suggest that this whole section ought to be redrafted and the court left as free as possible to intervene, no matter who asks them, and impose whatever terms or conditions they like, which, in their judgment, will be in the best interests of everybody concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be a good Bill, but it is not this Bill.  The whole scheme of this Bill is to put the emphasis on negotiation and conciliation in the first instance, not to bring the court into an industrial dispute until efforts to avoid it or settle it by the ordinary methods of negotation and conciliation have been tried and <Col N="1061" /> failed.  Therefore, we provide in this section that, if there is a joint industrial council registered&mdash;and it cannot be registered unless the rules of the council provide that any dispute arising will be referred to the council and settled by the council&mdash;and if the officials of a trade union show that they have an agreement with the employers which provides for some other method of negotiating and settling disputes, or if there is a registered agreement which contains a procedure for negotiating the settlement of disputes, this court cannot intervene under this part of the Bill.  These sub-sections tend to provide that where there is established a recognised and working system of avoiding or settling disputes, it should be allowed to continue, and the court should not intervene unless its services are really necessary.  They would not be necessary in the case contemplated in sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) until the alternative machinery already existing, or which may come into existence, has been tried and failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Dockrell may have departed somewhat from the machinery envisaged in the Bill, there is something in what he says, and there should be some consideration given to these three sub-sections, not because they interfere with the purpose of this section, but because they fail to take account of certain things.  Take sub-section (2). The court does not interfere if there is a joint industrial council composed of an equal number of representatives. Suppose we have a deadlock.  We make no provision in that connection. One of the parties must initiate the movement.  I am merely pressing this matter to indicate some of the difficulties which will flow from the section. Sub-section (3) says that the court shall not investigate a trade dispute in which a trade union is concerned if there is an agreement providing for another method of determining the dispute. There is no indication there of what may happen if that particular method has been tried and has failed.  The sub-section says that if there is an agreement the court is precluded from intervening. <Col N="1062" /> Similarly, in regard to sub-section (4), the court shall not investigate a trade dispute between persons to whom a registered agreement applies except at the request of any party to the agreement.  All that has to be brought into conformity with the amended sub-section (1).</P>
      <P>In so far as the main purpose of the Bill is to provide machinery in order to avoid or to settle disputes, I suggest that any hitches that might give rise to difficulty should be ironed out where they are noticed while the Bill is going through the House.  It is conceivable that, although you have a joint industrial council, there might be a deadlock on the question of whether the court should be invited to intervene. Again, the court might find difficulty in interpreting sub-section (3) in relation to whether a method of determining the dispute existed under an agreement. We could also envisage the position that a dispute may be developing. There is machinery to deal with that dispute under an agreement, but for certain reasons the operational machinery is delayed, both parties being reluctant to give effect to it.  The court would be precluded from intervening although the parties to the agreement would be doing nothing to prevent or settle a dispute.</P>

It is not really a question of letting the court decide whether it will publish it by means of advertisements in the newspapers, announcements on the radio, or letters to the parties, but that it shall have discretion as to the manner of publication, whether newspaper publicity is necessary at all or <Col N="1066" /> whether mere publication to the parties alone will suffice.</P>

This is the section which deals with unofficial strikes.  There may be some objection in theory to giving the court power of intervention in relation to unofficial strikes but it seems to me we must have some means of dealing with them and that there is something in Deputy Dockrell's contention that an unofficial strike is a strike which a trade union did not originally promote or assist rather than one which no trade union is promoting or assisting at a particular time, because there are, as the House is aware, possibilities that the circumstances may change in relation to a strike during the course of the strike. If the court is to have the power of intervention under this section in relation to a strike which began as an unofficial strike, it would be sufficient, and that I think is what Deputy Dockrell is aiming at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be quite legitimate.  Deputies will often mention cases where the workers go on strike in circumstances which are not justified, where they should have gone <Col N="1069" /> to the executive with their complaint but, having gone on strike, the employer says, &ldquo;Because this strike has taken place, I am now going to alter the agreement or regard the agreement as ended,&rdquo; in which case the union will say, &ldquo;Even though we do not approve of the action of the workers in going on strike in the first instance, we now must make it an official strike so that we can participate in the negotiation of a new agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not only that point to be considered; there is also the point that, while there is general condemnation of unofficial strikes, we do not want to make the condemnation too wide.  There can be, and there are, cases where, no matter how expeditiously or efficiently the machinery of trade unions may operate, a situation can develop in a particular employment in which strike action would be taken by the workers and not only will the union stand over it but every reasonable-minded man and woman will stand over it.  We should not pre-judge these cases, and that is what this amendment will do, in effect.</P>
      <P>The ordinary procedure in the trade union movement&mdash;Deputy Morrissey is as well acquainted with it as I am&mdash; is that if a body of workers do move out, without the knowledge or instructions of the executive committee, the committee examines the merits of the case, and, on occasion, may decide that, for certain reasons, they are justified in stepping in.  On the other hand, they may decide to keep aloof from the whole thing and will possibly be brought in only on the suggestion that somebody is required to assist in the negotiations and to get the dispute adjusted.  They, because of their contacts and their machinery, are helpful in that respect, but it should not be taken that, while there is this general condemnation of unofficial strikes, there cannot be occasions when workers will be driven to take immediate action, whether they like it or not. The trade union movement has to take cognisance of that fact and to allow for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> In the ordinary course of industrial relations between employers and workers, these cases are exceptional and rare, but I do not think there is any reason why this amendment should be pressed upon us because the Bill, as drafted, is quite sufficient to meet the case.  If we are to have machinery to adjust labour disputes, on one side of which there are to be representatives of the trade unions, individually or collectively, we must take it for granted that they have sufficient commonsense and understanding to have regard to their responsibility, not only to their members but to the community, and not to take it for granted that every unofficial strike will be made official by the intervention of the union.</P>
    <P>We should not say that, regardless of the conditions under which workers work, once they have gone out unofficially, all advice and all representative power, so far as union machinery is concerned, shall be denied them and they shall be completely subject to what is, in effect, a penal section merely because they have taken unofficial action, because very often the onus for the unofficial action rests not on the workers but on some foreman, ganger or manager who is completely removed from the scene of the conflict.  Yet the workers who have had to have recourse to this objectionable action, very likely without prior notification or without any attempt to adjust the dispute, are to come immediately under the operation of the section, although the union itself, having investigated the whole matter, felt it was a case which should be considered by means of the ordinary machinery of negotiation and possibly under some of the earlier sections.  I suggest that we leave it stand, because it is quite adequate as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that Deputy Norton, Deputy Larkin or any other responsible trade union leader is more against unofficial strikes than anybody else because they get more trouble and worry from them than anybody else, but I think it is true to say that unofficial strikes generally take place in <Col N="1071" /> essential services, and while we are doing our best here to protect the interests of both workers and employers, there is the interest of the community to be protected.  I want to put this to Deputy Larkin, that there is such a thing as an unofficial strike starting against the express wishes of the union and a weak executive being coerced afterwards into making it official.  The Deputy knows that that has happened, and, so far as I am concerned, I want to see taken whatever measures can be taken to put an end to unofficial strikes, which not only bring tribulation to those involved in them, but very often are the cause of great sacrifices having to be made by the ordinary community who have no voice whatever in the matter.  It will not be contested that, generally speaking, lightning or unofficial strikes take place in essential services upon which the community are absolutely and completely dependent and in respect of which the community are completely helpless.  We know that the community for the greater part are made up of other workers, and I do not think that acceptance of this amendment will cause any hardship or injustice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It could involve a departure from the very principle on which the Bill is founded.  It is that a trade union cannot be coerced by any of the provisions of the Bill, unless it has voluntarily accepted the position that it is subject to the coercive clauses in it.  Any trade union of workers which comes under the Bill comes under it voluntarily, knowing its obligations. If we accept the amendment, conceivably a situation could arise in which a trade union, against its will, would be subject to coercive direction by the court under the circumstances mentioned here, namely, of a strike which began as an unofficial strike but which was subsequently made official. That is one of the things which the Bill set out to avoid doing.  We built it entirely on the basis that nobody is subject to any of its provisions, unless he voluntarily agrees to submit himself to it, and we depart from that principle if we adopt the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than two parties to this machinery. There are more than two interests concerned in this matter, and I do not believe that any trade union, which genuinely wishes to take advantage of this machinery, will refrain from doing so merely from the point of view put forward by the Minister.  I think this amendment will probably be more valuable to some of the trade unions than the Bill as it stands.  It will probably strengthen their hands.  In any case so far as I am concerned, the sooner we get machinery which will put an end to unofficial and lightning strikes, the better.  The community deserves some protection as well as other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with Deputy Morrissey's stand in the matter of the unofficial strike.  As I said yesterday, the trade unions and trade unionists have to recognise that their whole reputation for responsibility is bound up with the avoidance of sporadic and indisciplined action, and to recognise that, in these matters, the interests of the movement demand that there should be some kind of authorised control of unions, and that control ought not to be exercised except in the regularised way provided for by the rules of a union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, that Deputy Morrissey in supporting Deputy Dockrell's amendment is weighting the scales against the union.  You may have a situation in which a union learns this evening that yesterday morning its members in Donegal went on strike without any authority from the executive. The union probably did not approve of the arrangement at all, but the conditions may have been such that the union members there were almost goaded into going on strike&mdash;perhaps, as Deputy Larkin has said, by the <Col N="1073" /> truculent attitude of a foreman or ganger, or by what they regarded as some particularly mean approach to a problem.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the rules of the union, that would be an unofficial strike, but suppose that, on hearing of it, the union sends a representative down to investigate matters on the spot and he comes back and says: &ldquo;It is true that these people went on strike without authority, but it is also true that they had no alternative, unless they were prepared to put up with what I regard as very inhuman and unreasonable treatment. Here are the facts of the case.  In my view this strike is one which would be approved of if they proceeded to have it called in a regularised way.&rdquo; If Deputy Dockrell's amendment is carried it means that the court could intervene in that case because the union did not originally promote the strike.  In a case of that kind the court would be entitled to ignore the fact that in view of the full circumstances it was one on which a strike would be normally covered.  I do not think it is the intention of Deputy Morrissey to prevent a union regularising a strike when it learns the facts.  If Deputy Dockrell's amendment is accepted it means that a strike, once having been declared unofficial, could never be regularised, no matter how much justification there would be for doing so.  I think the Bill is preferable to the amendment and, on closer examination, Deputy Morrissey will probably see that he is tilting the scales somewhat unwittingly on one side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question whether there is or is not discipline. You may have a type of case of which I can give personal experience, where something happens and, exasperated by a ganger or an overseer, men pitch discretion to the winds and declare a strike.  Where are you going to close the door?  Take the present position of trade unions.  Supposing that to-morrow 500 or 1,000 workers in Dublin, belonging to a certain union, go on strike unofficially, and that a threat is put up to the executive of the union that if they do not recognise it as an official strike they are going to march into <Col N="1074" /> another union.  That might be a reason why the strike would be treated in a certain way.  The Minister seems to be satisfied that the interests of the community would be better safeguarded by the other procedure.</P>

      <P>In paragraph (a), line 4, to delete the words &ldquo;one year&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;six months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the period should be reduced to six months.  This brings in the question of the next two amendments.  That device was adopted to deal with unofficial strikes.  The court may resort, if it thinks it wise, to the making of an order prescribing the wages and conditions which the employer of the workers concerned may maintain, and he may maintain no other conditions either better or worse.  That device is intended to end the types of unorganised or unofficial strike where there is no body with whom there can be an agreement negotiated, or it can accept or reject any particular terms on behalf of other workers.  The device is intended to secure a period&mdash;it need only be a comparatively short period&mdash;of peace in the occupation pending the re-establishment of trade union control over the workers, and some other development which may lead to a more orderly approach to the position.  The amendments seek to provide that the conditions will be minimum conditions. It ignores that particular aspect of this proposal, just as Deputy Dockrell's amendment withdraws the protection of the Trade Disputes Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This device of having an award which is binding on the employer is an alternative to the same device that Deputy Dockrell suggests.  It would be defeated if the other amendment were accepted.  I do not think that <Col N="1075" /> would be regarded as a practical method of dealing with an unofficial strike or with unorganised workers: It is intended to apply only in circumstances where the court cannot get a settlement by any other means, because of the state of disorganisation among the workers concerned, and enables it to ensure that certain prescribed conditions will for a period&mdash;it need only be a short time&mdash;prevail until the difficulty is resolved.  It was suggested that one year was too long and that six months would be the best period.</P>

      <P>I am against this.  It is a complete reversal of the principle on which this part of the Bill was built up.  The intention is to give the worker and only the worker that right. If he records it he pins himself for the time being not to take strike action for a higher rate, but if he thinks a higher rate justified he can apply to the court.  Quite clearly, if you give the employer the right to record a standard rate order you are thereby giving the employer power to prevent the worker adopting the alternative of leaving himself free, which it is intended to do.</P>

      <P>On that question, I cannot see any reason why there should not be equality as between the employees and employers in matters of this kind.  Is it not possible that a union might make demands upon individual employers and might completely ignore any organisation which employers would have, and the employer would then have no redress?  At the present time a demand is being made on the farmers in Counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath for an increased wage and a threat is being held out that there will be a complete stoppage of work on the 1st of August if those demands are not met.  Although the farmers have an organisation, their organisation is not being recognised by the workers.</P>

      <P>The Act will come into force in respect of the other provisions on an appointed day, which I hope will be in September.  But this part of the Bill is intended to provide abnormal measures which will operate for a year&mdash;that is, the year of transition from emergency to normal economy. The device adopted here is intended to give trade unions an opportunity of securing stability of wages, and in an orderly manner of getting increases during that period rather than run the risk of innumerable trade disputes which might be difficult of solution. If we were to adopt Deputy Dockrell's amendment and give this right to the employers, then we would be departing completely from what is contemplated here; because by recording the order, without the agreement of the trade union or without consulting the workers concerned, an employer could tie up the union to that particular rate and compel them to adopt this particular machinery, even though they did not want to do so.  Certainly that is not what is intended by the section.  This transition year will undoubtedly give more power to the workers than to the employers, but it is deliberately designed in that way to facilitate the process of transition and to have a period during which longterm agreements can be negotiated and registered, without the risk of interruptions through strikes, while such negotiations are proceeding.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2), in page 23, to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Before recording under this section a wages (standard rate) order and a bonus order, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the court shall cause information relating to the application for such recording to be given to every organisation of employers and organisation of workers which, in its opinion, is likely to be concerned in the application;</P>
      <P>(b)  the court shall publish in at least two newspapers a notice giving particulars of the application and of the nature of the orders to which it has reference.</P>
      <P>(3) If within 14 days after the publication of the notice mentioned in the next preceding sub-section, objection is made to the court to the recording of the orders aforesaid, the court shall consider the objection and if it is of opinion that the objection is not frivolous it shall cause an inquiry into the application to be held as soon as may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Having considered the report of the inquiry mentioned in the next preceding sub-section, the court shall, at its discretion, record the <Col N="1079" /> wages (standard rate) order and bonus order, the subject matter of the inquiry or refuse to record such orders.</P>
    <P>Section 72, as it stands, is rather undefined and it was felt there should at least be provision in respect of notification to other organisations and so far as publication in newspapers might be concerned.  We are immediately concerned with the question of the effect the amendment might have&mdash;that is, if sub-section (3) of it were put into operation and the orders might be recorded within 14 days.  That might be met if the recording took place in the ordinary courts where the courts could deal with any objections that might arise as a result of the publication.  We felt that provision for notification to interested parties should be made.  There is no such provision here except in the sub-section of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to make the procedure for recording the standard rate order as simple as possible because there are something like 2,000 of them and it would not be possible to have an inquiry by the court in relation to each one of them.  Therefore, we provided that the workers concerned could record by the simple process of posting a copy of the order by registered post.  It is then recorded.  To meet the point which, I think, the Deputy has in mind I introduced amendment No. 130, which is designed to enable anybody to claim that the recording of an order was done on the initiative of somebody who was not really representative of the workers concerned, and the court can then annul the recording if it is satisfied such is the case.  I thought that was the point the Deputy had in mind and I think that is the best way to meet it, without setting up an elaborate machinery which would, in fact, clog the work of the court at the very outset.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 118:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 73 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  An application may be made to the court by a trade union or other body for an order fixing rates of remuneration for a class of workers to whom, immediately before the commencement of this Act, no wages (standard rate) order applied.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where an application is made to the court under this section in respect of a class of workers, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if the applicant appears to the court to be representative of workers of that class, the court shall publish notice of the application in such manner as, in the opinion of the court, is best calculated to bring the application to the notice of all persons concerned;</P>
      <P>(b)  the court shall consider the application and shall hear all persons appearing to the court to be concerned and desiring to be heard;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  the court may, as it thinks fit, refuse the application or make an order providing for such rates of remuneration for the said class of workers as the court thinks fit; <Col N="1081" /> (d)  where the court makes such order:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the applicant notifies the court, within sixteen days after the making of the order, that the order is not acceptable, the court shall thereupon revoke the order,</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the applicant does not so notify the court the order shall, as on and from the expiration of the said sixteen days, have the like effect as if it were a recorded wage (standard rate) order and bonus order, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  references in the subsequent sections of this Part to wages (standard rate) orders and bonus orders shall be construed as including references to orders under this section, with the modifications that references to recording shall, in relation to an order under this section, have effect as references to the making of the order, and references to cancellation of a recording shall have effect as references to the revocation of the order.</P>
    <P>This is a recasting of the provisions in accordance with the views expressed during discussions on the Bill on the Second Reading.  The new section will provide that an application may be made by a trade union, or a body of workers, for an order fixing rates of remuneration for a class of workers for which there was no standard rate order hitherto.  The court shall consider the application and make an order which will prescribe the rate of wages which will then become effective, as if there had been a standard rate order for these workers recorded by the court.  There are many cases where a standard rate order was not made under the Emergency Powers Act because I deemed it to be impracticable, or undesirable, to make it, due to the complicated nature of the arrangements for payment in operation. There may be other cases where a standard rate order was not made because no application was forwarded. In order to enable the workers of every class to take advantage of this Part of the Bill it is necessary that some provision <Col N="1082" /> of this kind, by which the absence of a standard rate order can be met, should be made in order to give the court power to, in effect, make a standard rate order.  That is the purpose of this new section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any objection to the purpose which the Minister is trying to achieve in regard to this amendment.  But there are one or two points as to which I am not quite clear.  First of all, to begin at the end, in paragraph (ii) of sub-section (d) reference is made to the effect of making an order under this amendment in so far as subsequent Parts of the Bill are concerned.  It appears to me that what is intended is that an order will have the same effect as a recorded wages standard rate or bonus order.  A recorded standard wages order is, in effect, a record of a fact, <Col N="1083" /> namely, of the rate paid on 8th April, 1941.  But, in dealing with the application as set out under this amendment, that is not quite clear.  Is it envisaged that the union making the application will apply to have the rates as paid on 8th April, 1941, or some other date, paid, or will they apply to have an increased rate paid or such rate as they may embody in their application?  I raise that because in paragraph (c) of sub-section (2) it says that the court may, if it thinks fit, refuse the application.  If the court refuses the application, how is the union left in reference to the later sections of the Bill where the proceedings are based on a recorded standard rate or bonus order?  We are, in effect, dealing with another matter here and, while the implication is that, if there is an application for an increase in wages&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended that the court should endeavour to ascertain what rates were paid in April, 1941.  I thought of that, but I considered it impracticable, because in the great majority of cases where this section will be utilised, I have already decided that a standard rate order would be impracticable.  I thought it wise to leave the court a special discretion to prescribe the rates which the court thought should apply to the circumstances, having heard the parties.  It seems to me that you must have some provision which would enable the court, having heard the parties, to refuse the application. If the application is refused, it merely means that the class of workers concerned cannot come under this Part of the Bill.  The court would, in all circumstances, endeavour to avoid a situation in which they would refuse an application.  But it could happen that a case might be made that the class of workers concerned did not constitute a group to whom a common order could be made applicable, or some other type of objection to the making of the order could be advanced which the court would regard as reasonable and which would justify them in refusing it. <Col N="1084" /> I do not see that there is any way out of that.  The result would be that the individual workers concerned just could not come under this part of the Bill and they would have to use some other part of it.  On the other point, it would not be reasonable or practicable to require the court to do what we found ourselves unable to do at a time much nearer to the date of the original Emergency Powers Order, and, therefore, the only practicable thing is to give the court complete discretion in the making of an order.</P>

      <P>The application was not made.  I take it, therefore, that the whole basis of this section is, where possible, to take the application, in effect, as recording, where possible, the rates as paid, so that there could be no dispute, and only where a difficulty exists in getting a satisfactory form of application the court would proceed to deal with the application as an application for entirely new rates. I can see the difficulty there.  As the section stands at the moment, it is an invitation to look for an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That could, in fact, be the case.  It could be that the rate fixed would be the standard rate, plus bonus, plus the increase allowed by the court.  I will consider whether we might not put on the court an obligation to relate the order here to the rates actually paid in April, 1941, in cases where no standard rate order was made because no application was made, and to leave this to apply only to cases where there was a former decision by myself as Minister when it was inappropriate to have a standard rate order.  Such cases will be very few, I think, because I notice in the last few weeks that many classes of workers who had not applied for a <Col N="1085" /> standard rate order are now applying, in anticipation, no doubt, of availing of this Part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>To insert before Section 74 the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a wages (standard rate) order and bonus order have been recorded, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) application may be made from time to time by trade unions and other bodies for an increase in the rates of remuneration specified in the orders;</P>

      <P>(c) the court shall consider the application and shall hear all persons appearing to the court to be concerned and desiring to be heard;</P>
      <P>(d) the court may, as it thinks fit, refuse the application or make an order providing for such increased rates of remuneration as it thinks fit;</P>
      <P>(e) if the court makes such order. it shall specify in the order the trade unions or bodies (in this section referred to as interested parties) who shall be entitled to accept or reject the order in accordance with this section;</P>
      <P>(f) if any interested party notifies the court, within sixteen days after the making of the order, that the order is not acceptable, the court shall thereupon cancel the recording of the wages (standard rate) order and the bonus order;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(g) if an interested party does not so notify the court, the wages <Col N="1087" /> (standard rate) order and the bonus order shall, as on and from the expiration of the said 16 days, have, for the purposes of Section 73 of this Act, effect as if they were amended in accordance with the terms of the order so made by the court;</P>
    <P>(h) if the court refuses the application it shall specify the trade unions or bodies who shall be entitled to reject the refusal, and, if within 16 days after the refusal, any such trade union or body notifies the court that it rejects the refusal, the court shall thereupon cancel the recording of the wages (standard rate) order and the bonus order.</P>
    <P>This amendment achieves two or three changes which were considered desirable. It meets the case Deputy Larkin referred to, where the court refuses to grant an increase.  It provides in such circumstances that the same consequences follow as if the court granted an increase, if the applicant decides to accept that or not, and with the same effect.  An objection to the original section was also advanced on this ground, that where two trade unions were catering for the class of workers concerned in a standard rate order, one trade union, by applying for an increase and accepting the increase, might tie up the other trade union and prevent it having the freedom of action desired if it was not prepared to accept the increase.  In order to meet that situation the court will publish notice that it has got this application and will hear any other trade union or any other party appearing to be interested and will decide, when announcing its award, what unions must accept it; so, if there are two trade unions, it will require that both will accept before the award becomes binding.</P>
    <P>These are the three main changes: it provides for the case where the court refuses the application; it provides for the court hearing another body than the applicant body on the matter of the application, and it provides that the court will decide what bodies must accept to make the award right.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (a) sets out that an application may be made from time to time by trade unions and other bodies for an increase. That will apply only in the case where the application is granted. If the application is rejected, that carries with it the annulling of the recording of the orders.  In amendments Nos. 128 and 129 we try to provide that a second application could be made after a period of three months and that, in effect, where an application is made to the court, the court could grant it and the applicant union would accept or reject, but in rejecting it they would still have an opportunity of coming forward after a lapse of three months and renewing the application, or they could regain complete freedom by rejecting the application and electing to proceed by ordinary direct negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest it would be well to allow for the possibility of a second application being entertained by the court after a period.  There may be very good reasons why the court would have to refuse an application and the union, while quite prepared to accept the decision at that moment, might not desire that the refusal would carry with it the annulling of the recording of the orders.  The implication there is that if a union applies to the court for a variation of wages and does not get it, they will have recourse to direct action.  That does not always follow. A union may be quite prepared to accept the court's decision, but they <Col N="1089" /> might feel that conditions might alter and they would be in a position to have their application entertained by the court rather than be forced, as they could under the amendment, to have recourse to direct action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If they accepted the refusal of the court to consider it, they could apply again.  There is no limitation on the number of times the union can apply, provided they accept the court's decision on each occasion.  It is only where they refuse to accept that there is a limitation.  Deputy Larkin may have in mind a disinclination to accept in a formal way and at the same time a desire not to have the standard rate order annulled and the union to retain its right to go back to the court.  In the case mentioned by Deputy Larkin, a union need only accept the decision of the court in order to preserve its right to go back to the court at a later time.</P>

      <P>From our experience of the Wages Tribunal that would not be a very acceptable procedure. We have had a certain difficulty with the tribunal.  There is the possibility that if the union sought a bonus of ten shillings and the court awarded five shillings, the union might feel that in accepting the five shillings it would be prejudiced in its later application for ten shillings and would prefer to reject the award and preserve its case intact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Tadhg Ó Murchadha Tadhg Ó Murchadha">
      <NameTxt>Tadhg Ó Murchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>I am availing of your permission, Sir, to raise, briefly, the subject of the following question that I addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on Wednesday last:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the Bantry Bay steamship service, from Bantry to Berehaven, is about to be suspended, following the initiation of a road transport service by Córas Iompair Éireann; that this change will have the effect of cutting off Bere Island from securing supplies directly from Bantry and other trading centres, with consequent hardship to the residents of the island; and whether he will arrange for the retention of the steamship service to Berehaven, calling at Bere Island.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply is in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am aware that the Bantry Bay Steamship Company have suspended their weekly sailings and that Córas Iompair Eireann, in response to a demand for direct road transport, are providing a daily lorry service between Bantry and Castletownbere.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The traffic formerly consigned to Bere Island by the steamer service amounted to about 25 tons per month, and I understand that there are small boats available which are capable of dealing with this traffic. In the circumstances, I see no reason to intervene in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has had a fairly hard day and I will be as brief as I possibly can.  I propose, therefore, to confine the presentation of this case to three main aspects.  May I give the House some information about the history of the Bantry Bay Steamship Company that is concerned?  The company was originally founded in November, 1883, and since then they have provided a service to this isolated part of the constituency of West Cork, consisting <Col N="1094" /> of transport of passengers, goods, live stock, etc.  They provided a steamer for that service weekly.  I want to give the House some particulars of the traffic carried.  Bere Island has figured in this matter because I hope to convince the Minister that the peculiar position that Bere Island will now find itself in is a serious matter for the inhabitants and one that should have his attention as Minister supervising the question of transport changes and similar matters.  In the year 1936 there were 500 tons of traffic carried to Bere Island, in 1937, 488 tons; in 1938 485 tons; in 1946, 365 tons.  As commodities were rationed and consequently smaller parcels of the various commodities only could be sent, the reduction in the traffic is quite understandable. In the same periods the traffic to Castletownbere was represented by the following figures: In 1936, 3,274 tons; in 1937, 3,200 tons; in 1938, 3,436 tons; in 1946, 3,035 tons. I am also in possession of certain figures with regard to transport of passengers which I do not consider entirely vital to the presentation of this case and I shall not therefore trouble the House by giving the figures.</P>
    <P>Bere Island is in an extremely unfortunate position as a result of this change.  May I quote from a letter which I received from one of the traders there:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I wish to let you know that after 43 years of hard work to build up a business I find that there will be no alternative for me in a short time but to close it down.  This is due to the initiation of a road transport service by Córas Iompair Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The manager of Córas Iompair Éireann wrote to me to have arrangements made with a trader in Castletownbere to store my goods which would be dumped there by their lorries.  I could not do that easily.  There are no means now of getting goods into this island and I would also have to pay the trader for storing the goods in Castletownbere&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of the Minister that <Col N="1095" /> various small boats owned by local people would be capable of handling this traffic seems quite unsatisfactory to the people of the island and to represent a position that cannot be at all satisfactory to the people concerned. When this boat that plied between Bantry and Castletownbere was laid up each year for the annual overhaul required by Board of Trade regulations, the goods coming to Castletownbere could be conveyed to Bere Island by means of military tender.</P>
    <P>The military tender, which was the main means of communication between the island and Castletownbere, has now gone, because Bere Island, one of the ports which figured so largely in our discussions in recent years, including our election speeches, has been completely abandoned.  The entire military personnel in Bere Island has been removed, and I understand that the only military remaining there is a maintenance party consisting of four men. The military tender, therefore, is not available, and there is no means by which goods can be conveyed to the island, except in whatever way it can be done by small row-boats which may be available to residents and some of the merchants living on the island.  This man says that it seems to him that a position is rapidly developing in which the island will be completely isolated, and he does not see much point in being compelled to pay taxes in a quarter of the country in which no services are available to the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate the fact that in regard to certain goods, such as paraffin, sugar and commodities of that kind which are on demand as soon as they are available, and, in fact, some days before they are available, it is necessary that there should be some service by which they could be made available speedily.  I suggest that the position of these people in Bere Island &mdash;some 300 or 400 people live on the island&mdash;will be extremely difficult.  For one thing, they will have to face higher costs for the goods they receive, and, for another, the service will be irregular, unsatisfactory, inadequate and, I am afraid, infrequent, because it seems that, at certain parts of the <Col N="1096" /> year, it would not be possible for small row-boats to convey goods to the island because the passage is not quite easy. I do not think the arrangement would be at all satisfactory.</P>
    <P>So much for the position of the people there.  Let me come now to the position of the employees of this company &mdash;not a great number, but, still, all of them bread-winners and the supports of households&mdash;who are concerned with this change.  There was a crew of seven or eight on the boat and a number of other people were directly employed by the Bantry Bay Steamship Company.  I understand that every single one is now out of employment. Furthermore, I am informed that it is very questionable whether, under any existing legislation, they have any pension rights, or any rights to get alternative employment, and though the number of people is not very large, a great deal of hardship is involved for the people concerned, a number of whom have spent the best years of their lives in the service of this company. May I suggest that that aspect of the case, at least, ought to have the earnest and special consideration of the Minister who does not wish, I am sure, to add to the number of people who are deprived of employment and who may be compelled to exist by some other means in the absence of that employment?</P>
    <P>I suggest further to the Minister that a transport service by road to Castletownbere is a very uncertain undertaking, from the point of view of giving service to the people.  The distance from Bantry to Castletownbere is 33 miles and the road is rather perilous and difficult.  That is well known to most road-users and I think it a great pity that some alternative cannot be found to putting this old-established company, which, in a modest way, gave a certain amount of employment and which, in a general way, gave good service to the people concerned, completely out of business.  May I suggest that he may be able to devise some means by which a restricted road service could be permitted, together with this service for the period for which it is available to the people, that is, one run per week and that, in addition, he <Col N="1097" /> should examine the question of whether the alternative service provided is capable of carrying the same amount of traffic and the same bulk of traffic as was carried by the other service? It seems to be rather difficult to understand that live stock can be carried as easily by a road service as they were carried by the service which now goes out of commission, the steamship service.  I have been informed, though I cannot personally vouch for it, that on the occasion of the last fair in Castletown, a number of cattle could not be removed by lorries and had to be driven by easy stages along the road between Castletownbere and Bantry.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have the advantage of certain arguments in this matter&mdash; that the people will be getting a daily service and a more up to date service. I feel that, while that may look all right on the surface, it is not at all clear that the service will be either up to date or satisfactory, having regard to the peculiar geographical position of the area concerned and to the adjacent island of Bere which will be in a position of special difficulty.  I urge the Minister, not in any spirit of controversy or any spirit of Party advantage, to examine the matter further to see whether there is any possibility of meeting what I believe to be a fairly strong local view that it it a most unfortunate act which deprives them of this service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances of this case are easy enough to understand, but it is not quite so easy to devise a remedy for the particular problems which may arise for individuals, by reason of the change which has taken place.  In the past, goods were brought by ship from Bantry to various points along the Castletownbere peninsula.  The Bantry Bay Steamship Company provided this weekly service by steamer which called at Glengarriff, Adrigole, Castletownbere and Bere Island.  Early in this year, Córas Iompair Éireann provided a lorry service and the popularity of that lorry service resulted in a very substantial fall in the amount of goods available for transportation by steamer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> It could be said, therefore, that the immediate cause of the steamship company's difficulties is the operation of a lorry service by Córas Iompair Éireann, but that would be a very inaccurate description of the problem, because Córas Iompair Éireann provided the lorry service when it became clear to it that the goods were going to be moved by lorry anyhow, that the traders concerned with the movement of the goods would provide their own lorry service, if a service by Córas Iompair Éireann were not provided for them, and, consequently, although the decline of the company's business can be traced to the beginning of the service by Córas Iompair Éireann, it is obvious that it would have lost the business anyhow, if not to the lorries of Córas Iompair Éireann, to lorries operated by private traders.</P>
    <P>I think there can be no doubt that the lorry service is immensely popular in the area.  It began as a tri-weekly service, but so great was the demand for it that it is now operated three times daily.  There is a lorry service three times a day from Bantry to Castletownbere, and the advantage of a daily service at lower cost is obviously greatly appreciated by the residents in the peninsula area.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in relation to Bere Island.  The steamer service was of exceptional advantage to the residents on the island, and the manner by which goods can reach the island or be transported from the island now involves the use of this lorry service from Bantry to Castletownbere, and the movement of the goods over the mile of sea between Castletownbere and the island.  In that regard, I understand that some small boats are available.  Córas Iompair Eireann accept the obligation to provide an alternative service, but they would like to be assured that such a service is needed and that local opinion would prefer the service to be provided by it rather than by the local business people who might find provision of such a service a remunerative occupation to engage in.  There are some boats there now and these boats would <Col N="1099" /> be adequate to move the inward traffic.</P>
    <P>There is a problem, and there is likely to be a problem, concerning the movement of cattle from the island, by reason of the unsuitability of the facilities for discharging cattle at Castletownbere, in relation to which I intend to have some further inquiries made.  Personally, I cannot see what I can do.  It is not practicable to restore the old position merely by persuading Córas Iompair Eireann to withdraw its service of lorries.  I feel certain that the withdrawal of the lorries would be unpopular in the locality.  In any event, it would not settle the problem.  It seems obvious that it would merely mean that goods would travel on the lorries of private traders rather than on the lorries of the Transport Company.</P>
    <P>The reason for the withdrawal of the steamer service was the fact that there was no business for it.  On July 5, the company wrote to my Department that while the usual traffic offered was close on 100 tons weekly, since the lorry services began in June, the traffic offering was on June 6, 25 tons; June 13, 35 tons; June 20, six tons.  At that stage, the company decided to suspend the service.  On the facts of the case, it appears to me that there is a better transport service being provided at lower cost.  It is not merely a cheaper service, but a better service than the area enjoyed through the steamship company.  Inquiries I have made indicate that the service is popular, and that there is no local demand for its withdrawal.  On the contrary the demand has resulted in its expansion. The problem of the islands and the provision of boats for the transporation of goods to the islands will be considered by Córas Iompair Éireann, if that is desirable.  If the local service is capable of handling the business Córas Iompair Éireann would prefer that. They do not deny that they have obligations to provide a service if it is not provided by other people.</P>
    <P>As regards the crew, Córas Iompair Eireann informed me that they would consider sympathetically other alternative <Col N="1100" /> employment for the men concerned. The captain of the ship has already been employed by the company, but they explained that it is not very easy to find employment suitable for the men in the locality.  They cannot, therefore, say definitely that they will be able to provide employment for all the men concerned, but they are prepared to consider their applications as sympathetically as possible, and to make every effort to get them into some suitable employment in the locality. Personally I do not see that there is anything I can do about it.  Some years ago there was a number of these coastal services from Sligo to Ballina, and Limerick to Westport, all of which have ended.  They could not compete with road transport.  While the Bantry Bay Steamer Company lasted longer, it looks as if the time has come when the business it formerly obtained has passed to the roads.</P>
    <P>In some cases it might be necessary, for reasons of public safety, for the State to take special measures to ensure that coastal shipping services are maintained, and following some disasters on the west coast, a committee was set up to examine the law and the obligations of the Government in regard to shipping services to islands off our coast.  That committee has not reported.  They dealt primarily with shipping to Tory Island, and to other islands where there is a much more definite problem involved than in the case of Bere Island.  It is only one mile from the mainland, and there is no reason to expect exceptional danger in making the passage as in other cases. It seems to me that the problem of the transportation of goods to Bere Island is a matter for organisation in Castletownbere with some sort of store accommodation for goods.  I think it would be better, from every point of view, that services between Castletownbere and Bere Island should be provided locally.  Córas Iompair Éireann state that if they are not provided they will see what they can do.  Personally, I do not see that anything else can be done.</P>
