      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that petrol is 9½d. a gallon cheaper in Great Britain and Northern Ireland than it is in Éire; if he can state the reason for this difference in view of the fact that there is now no war risk insurance payable, and that petrol for Éire arrives in the same tankers as those which supply the United Kingdom; and if he is further aware that there is widespread dissatisfaction among private and commercial petrol users about the high price of petrol in Éire.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that in recent times, in the dairying districts of Éire, mainly for economic reasons, an abnormal number of dispersal sales of dairy herds has taken place, that several dairy herds have been substantially reduced in numbers and that there is a growing disposition amongst farmers, in those districts, to stock beef bulls in preference to dairy bulls; if so, in order to ensure that there may not be an acute shortage of milk and butter in future years, he will revise the price paid for milk to creameries so as to permit of 1/- a gallon being paid during the summer months; and, if not, if he will arrange that the month of April may be included in the winter period so that 1/- a gallon may be paid for creamery milk during that month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that in recent times an abnormal number of dispersal sales of dairy herds has taken place, and if, as suggested in the question, several dairy herds have been substantially reduced in numbers others must have been increased as the number of milch cows in the country on 1st June, 1945, was greater than in any of the previous four years.  Although the buying at recent sales of bulls of the beef breeds has been brisk, the demand for dairy bulls has been equally good and I do not anticipate any shortage of heifers suitable for dairy purposes in future years.  I do not propose to revise the creamery milk prices which have been announced in the recent White Paper on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the discussion on this amendment last night, there appeared to be a good deal of misunderstanding.  Deputy McGilligan was very much concerned as to the far-reaching effect of sub-section (3), which sets out that a person who knows that he is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease shall not expose himself in any street, public place, club, hotel or shop.  Deputy McGilligan was anxious to know what constituted a public place in the legal sense and if it included a place of worship.  I might reply that a public place to-day appears to mean what it meant in 1878.  Various changes have taken place all down the years since then, but I think a public place has remained a public place.  The Opposition Parties are concerned as to whether a place of worship should be considered to be a public place.  Well, I would suggest, in all sincerity, that that particular aspect of our difficulties in the control of infectious disease and any question of ethics in relation to it might be left with safety to the ecclesiastical authorities.  I do not want to pursue that further than to say that I dislike lay theologians as thoroughly as I do quack doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is safe to assume that if, by our legislation or proposed legislation, we interfere with religious liberties and right of freedom of worship, we can depend upon the hierarchy to keep us right.  I am not aware that the ecclesiastical authorities in this country feel any concern as to the effect of this particular proposal, but I would point out again that the law to-day and the law when this Bill will be passed, in <Col N="726" /> relation to this particular matter, will be very much the same as it was in 1878 and as it has continued all down the years since then, including the period during which the Opposition Party were the Government in this country.  Once again I would put before the House the terms of Section 142 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, and I would ask the House to relate them to the proposed terms of sub-section (3) of Section 19.  Section 142 of the 1878 Act sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) While suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder wilfully exposes himself without proper precautions against spreading the said disorder in any street, public place, shop, inn, or public conveyance, or enters any public conveyance without previously notifying to the owner, conductor, or driver thereof that he is so suffering, or</P>
    <P>(2) Being in charge of any person so suffering, so exposes such sufferer, . . . &rdquo;</P>
    <P>shall be liable to a penalty.  The phrasing is the same.  Whatever a public place has meant all down the years, it appears to have the same meaning now.  It is clear that, under this Bill, a person who knows he is a probable source of infection cannot appear in a street or public place; and I confess right away it is going to be very difficult to get to Church, even if you are supposed to go, if you cannot appear in the street.  I assumed that, when I did not interfere with the law, as it has stood the test of ages in that particular respect.  I would not be open to criticism.  Clearly, there can be no divergence of opinion on the principle at issue&mdash;that a person who is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease must not incur the risk of transmitting it to anybody else.  We have dealt with that particular matter fairly thoroughly over quite a long period here.</P>
    <P>I might mention, in case it may not be clearly understood already, that it is proposed in this co-ordinating measure to repeal Section 142 of the 1878 Act.  If we did not repeal it, the <Col N="727" /> law would be there, but, having repealed it, we have to give ourselves the corresponding power in the Bill before the House.  Notwithstanding the fact that that section is 68 years old, it seems to have stood the test of time and is still going strong.</P>
    <P>I have just dealt with sub-sections (3) and (4).  Sub-section (5) of the amendment sets out that the parent of a child shall not send the child to any school, or permit the child to attend any school, if he has reason to believe the child is a probable source of infection.  I will refer Deputies, in relation to that particular provision, to Section 146 of the Public Health Act, 1878, which, too, is being repealed.  Section 146 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person who shall knowingly or negligently send a child to school who, within the space of three months, has been suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, or who has been resident in any house in which such dangerous infectious disorder shall have existed within the space of six weeks, without a certificate from some duly qualified medical practitioner that such child is free from disease and infection and unless his or her clothes have been properly disinfected, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding 40/-.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (9) of the amendment is the counterpart of Section 57, sub-sections (1) and (2) of the Public Health Act, 1907.  The relevant sub-sections set out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No person being the parent or having the care or charge of a child within the district of the local authority who is or has been suffering from infectious disease or has been exposed to infection shall, after a notice from the medical officer that the child is not to be sent to school, permit such child to attend school. . . . &rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then comes the penalty clause.  The fact of the matter is that the law is not being changed in this particular sub-section, in principle, at any rate; any changes made are of a drafting or verbal nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> Deputy McGilligan tells us that he thought that the medical profession could have been relied upon to compel parents to keep their children from school.  The medical profession has not been relied upon in the past.  There has been a statutory obligation in relation to the matter.  Deputy McGilligan also complains that the family doctor is now being placed under an obligation, in sub-section (6) of this amendment, to notify the medical officer of health if he is aware that a child is a probable source of infection with infectious disease.</P>
    <P>We are accused, by making these provisions, of converting the medical profession into spies.  I can only say again that the statutory obligation on a medical practitioner to notify the medical officer of health is not of my making.  It was made before I was born and it has continued through the years since with universal application. It is scarcely necessary to take up the time of the House in reading it.  So far as the terms and provisions of this amendment are concerned, they are substantially the statutory provisions in our existing law that we propose to repeal.  Having repealed them, we have to arm ourselves with corresponding powers if we are to discharge effectively the responsibilities placed upon us.</P>
    <P>I rather think, in connection with the question raised by Deputy Mulcahy at Question Time to-day, and to which he referred last night, it will be necessary to break up that amendment on the Report Stage, but not introduce any new principle.  From the closer examination I have been able to give to that matter, I am satisfied that the group of diseases that would apply to particular portions of it would not properly apply to the whole of the section and I think the most satisfactory way of dealing with that position is to break it up on Report Stage into different sections and we will then be able to show the House the particular diseases it is proposed to include in the operation of the different constituents of the present amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is making it very difficult <Col N="729" /> for the House.  This Bill, as originally introduced, provided for the repeal of Section 142 of the Act of 1878.  When we come to the Committee Stage we find a new amendment introduced which, admittedly, introduces into the Bill in a positive way some of the matters that were provided for under Section 142 of the Act of 1878. Why this matter was thought of only when we were coming to Committee Stage is more than I know, particularly in view of the importance of the provisions contained therein.  We discussed last night sub-section (3) of the new amendment, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who knows that he is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease shall not expose himself in any street, public place, club, hotel or shop.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gave a review of the places outlined in the Act of 1878 and he covered it in what he would call a realistic kind of way when he was dealing with the provisions of Section 21.  He specifically dealt with any school, any place of public worship, any theatre, concert hall or cinema.  These are the places marked down, no doubt, as the public places specifically named by him in the original Bill.  In view of the fact that the ordinary person attending places of public worship specifically mentioned in Section 21 was never, to the recollection of anybody that we ever met or, I suppose, anybody in this House, charged with an offence under the Act of 1878 for attending a place of worship when he might have been in contact with infectious diseases, naturally we had to take cognisance of what was apparently a substantial change in the mentality of the Minister and the Government towards either the law or the administration of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, while making that move, which appeared to have had, and which must have had, some significance, is now going back from that position to a phase that existed in the Act of 1878.  We are still labouring under thoughts that were brought into our minds when we saw the Parliamentary Secretary's draft in the original Bill, under <Col N="730" /> Section 21.  A place of public worship was specifically mentioned.  I think we are entitled to know whether it is intended that there should be any change in the administration of the Public Health Acts with regard to the attendance of people at places of public worship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say &ldquo;no&rdquo; right off.  May I also say that a person suffering from an infectious disease should never have been allowed to attend a place of public worship.  The law is that he cannot appear in a street or public place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that they cannot have been attending there, or we would have greater epidemics than we have had up to the present, or it may be, perhaps, that the ordinary curative effects of sun and air on the way to the church may have had a kind of protective influence that some of the doctors are not able to provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the section as originally planned.  In Section 21, the Parliamentary Secretary now declares that the phraseology which he has introduced into it had no significance with regard either to a different approach from the Government or a different approach from the Department in the matter of attendance at places of public worship.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in asking us to accept this amendment, and further to wait for the Report Stage to be told whether a person is going to be guilty <Col N="731" /> of an offence if he goes into the public street suffering from mumps, ringworm or whooping cough, is asking the House to delay too long over a matter that it ought not to be asked to delay over, except in the light of the plain facts. As I said earlier, there was no provision in the Bill as originally drafted to prevent a person going on the street or into a public place, into a club, hotel or shop, even if suffering from an infectious disease, except in relation to the regulations that the Minister proposed to make under Section 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Deputy know that a person appearing in the public street and suffering from any infectious disease was, at any time, during the last 60 years or so, committing a breach of the law?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Parliamentary Secretary mean then by saying that he is going to break up the list of these infectious diseases which are referred to in Section 19?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reason that some of the minor diseases, some of which have been mentioned by the Deputy, can be exempted from the more rigid restrictions.  It is not necessary to apply these rigid restrictions to every disease that is classified as an infectious disease.  That is the only reason. If I did not do that, then every disease, including the minor ones scheduled under the regulations as infectious diseases, would have to be set out in every section and every sub-section in the amendment and in the reconstructed Section 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has broken up the diseases between the ones that are going to be regarded as infectious and the ones that are not going to be so regarded in respect to Sections 22 to 29, inclusive, but, in respect to Section 19, he gives us a list which we object to, because it contains whooping cough, tuberculosis, scabies, ringworm, mumps, and certain venereal diseases.  According to the proposals now put before us, the passage of the Parliamentary Secretary's <Col N="732" /> amendment would mean that a person suffering from these diseases would not be able to go into a public street or into any public place.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary must be stuck in some cobwebs that have not yet been swept away from the past.  I certainly oppose the insertion of a new amendment to this Bill which would prevent a person with whooping cough going out into the public street, or a person with scabies or ringworm, or even with mumps, if he was able to move about, or with tuberculosis.  These are only some of the diseases that are mentioned in the list of 34 that we have before us.</P>

      <P>I think this is a valuable sub-section, especially in so far as it deals with the health of children. It is protective in the case of children whose parents take proper care of their children's health, and even more so, of children whose parents are careless about their health, particularly when the children are suffering from infectious diseases.  If you take the parents who can afford to send their children to a boarding school, as soon as the children arrive for a new term at a properly run boarding school, there is a medical inspection of them. If any of them are found to be suffering from an infectious disease they are isolated and put in the school infirmary. They are not allowed to mix with the other school children, and certainly are not allowed to attend classes, school entertainments or the school chapel.  I think that all sections in the community should be able to benefit from medical inspection in the same way as the children of those better-off parents benefit from going to a boarding school.  The children of to-day are the men and women of to-morrow.  They are the nation's greatest asset.  The mothers of the country who have the welfare of their children at heart are doing a very valuable job, and because they are doing it unobtrusively, and because everybody thinks it is their duty, they do not get any special credit <Col N="733" /> for it.  I think that they should get all the help that the nation can give them to do their job effectively.  That is why <Col N="734" /> I think this sub-section is so valuable from the parents' point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 19, Sir. What I am about to say should probably have been raised on the last amendment, but I missed the point, and I should like to raise it now on the section.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that in effect this was doing no more than making a drafting change in the relevant part of the Act of 1878.  In the 1878 Act the phrase used is: &ldquo;A person suffering from an infectious disorder&rdquo;.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the new phrase: &ldquo;A probable source of infection&rdquo;, amounts to much more than merely a drafting change?  We have now the question of a person knowing himself to be a probable source of infection.  In the 1878 Act it was a question of an individual who might be affected, but now, possibly, a whole family might be concerned, and for that reason I think that to say that this is merely a drafting amendment is going a little bit beyond the mere <Col N="735" /> question of drafting.  For instance, if you take a family living in an isolated house in the country, if one member suffers from an infectious disease, the probability is that every member of the family will become a source of infection.  Under this section we are providing that if the family lives in an isolated place there may be nobody to do the shopping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to try to redraft this section, so that it will, at least, have some common-sense provisions when it leaves this House.  As framed, I think it would be just as obsolete as some of the sections of the 1878 Act.  To my knowledge the provisions of the 1878 Act were never enforced or, if they were it was rarely. If there are any statistics of prosecutions <Col N="737" /> for those tried for offences under that Act I should like to hear them.  I have measles in my house at present and, as the section stands, I could not go to the doctor, if I had not a telephone.  I cannot expose myself in the street under the Act of 1878.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Street&rdquo; includes any highway, and any public bridge, and any road, lane, footway, square, court, alley, or passage whether a thoroughfare or not.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned with the religious aspect at all.  I do not want to be accused of being a lay theologian or a quack doctor.  If there is an outbreak of measles in my house can I go out for the doctor without infringing this section?  As I read it I cannot, because I cannot expose myself in any of these places and, in addition to these places, in any church, chapel, school, cinema or football ground.  I cannot go anywhere outside my house. I cannot even open my own door and look out in the street to hail the doctor.  If my head was so far outside the door that my body was held to be on the thoroughfare, I should be offending against the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extraordinary provision. I do not think we should reduce legislation to absurdity.  On the strict interpretation of the section as it stands, I cannot go out of my house because I am a probable source of infection.  I am a contact.  I think measles are air borne.  Take any disease that is not air borne.  I see a difficulty in the section there, if it is not going to be reduced to a farce, because a working man or a farmer who has not a telephone, strictly speaking, cannot leave his house.  He must take not only the statutory precautions which the Department of Local Government prescribes, but every other reasonable precaution, whatever that may be.  There is a whole bundle of these precautions.  We have had all this already, and I do not want to go over the ground again.  The Parliamentary Secretary is trying to create the impression that he is making no change.  He is making a definite change.  Section 142 prescribes the penalties in the case of persons <Col N="738" /> who expose themselves in the public street.  The phraseology is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person who while suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder wilfully exposes himself without proper precautions against spreading the said disorder in any street, public place, shop, inn, or public conveyance&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>That is certainly an entirely different provision from the provision we are getting here.  The word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; has been dropped before &ldquo;exposes himself&rdquo; and after &ldquo;himself&rdquo; the words &ldquo;without proper precautions against spreading the said disorder&rdquo; have been dropped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>How would he expose himself other than wilfully?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; in that sense would mean culpably, that he did it recklessly without regard to the consequences.  But under this provision he is prevented from going out, or any member of his household, to fetch the doctor or a nurse and, if he does that, he is committing an offence. How is he to get out to tell a neighbour to do the needful for him?  May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary is he going to wipe out the corporal works of mercy?  Is visiting the sick now to be a penal offence in this glorious Republic?  That is what you are getting to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure you do.  So do I.  We are not going to enter into the merits of our religious fervour or practice, but I say you are perpetrating a legal absurdity and you are asking the Gárda Síochána and the medical constabulary to enforce legal absurdities in respect of a statutory offence which will have no practical effect once it is written into the Statute Book.  It cannot simply be enforced.  My objection to this is that it is absolutely and utterly unreasonable and incapable of enforcement either by the medical profession or the Gárda Síochána.  It is utterly absurd. Any common-sense man reading that section as now amended can only come to one conclusion, that once there is infectious disease inside a household then every person, member of the family and servant, in that household, is a probable source of infection, and from that moment they are all bound to take these prescribed precautions and every other reasonable precaution and must stay within the household; they cannot move; they must all proceed to get themselves interned in the detention institutions.  That is the position and I think that will be simply a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> in practice. I want again to stress that aspect of the matter.  Look at the inconsistency. The parent of a child may not send the child to school, but apparently the parent of the child may let the child out on the street.  You want to be very clear as to the legal effect of this provision. In sub-section (3) you start off by saying that a person who knows that he is a probable source of infection may not go into any street, public place, club, hotel or shop, and I take it that there you are referring to an adult person, but in sub-section (4) you say a person having the care of another person&mdash;you again refer to a person&mdash;shall not permit that person to go into the street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday evening, when this section was first before the House, I appealed to the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw the entire section and to see if he could revise it before the Report Stage.  The Parliamentary Secretary would have saved much Parliamentary time if he had taken my advice.  We spent the greater part of yesterday and will probably have to spend some part of to-day trying to straighten out this matter which the Parliamentary Secretary failed to put right in the original draft and in the amendments.  We laymen would be inclined to place a <Col N="741" /> good deal of confidence in a member of the medical profession as long as he adhered to any decision which he had taken but when we find the Parliamentary Secretary changing the original draft to a very considerable extent, when we find him in the position of a doctor attending a patient who changes the medicine from day to day, we naturally feel that he has not a grasp of the position and that he is floundering from one blunder to another.  Evidently the section as originally introduced was all wrong because the Parliamentary Secretary has introduced seven entirely new subsections. In sub-section (3) it is stated that a person who knows he is a probable source of infectious disease shall not expose himself in a public street or a public place.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not attempted to define the word &ldquo;exposes&rdquo; in this case.  It would, apparently, be no offence for a person to be in a public place if he were not exposed; if the night was very dark, he could probably proceed to any place he wished, but the Act prohibits him, in broad daylight, from being in any public place.  The Parliamentary Secretary admitted that he took that particular section out of an Act that is 60 years old.  He probably did not consider all its implications. He states now that he will leave it to the courts to define.  That has been in existence for 60 years and it has not been defined simply because nobody attempted to enforce it because they realised it was futile and absurd.  It was left to the Parliamentary Secretary to perpetuate that absurdity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other objectionable sub-section is that which imposes a severe penalty upon a medical officer who fails to notify the district medical officer of the existence of the disease.  That penalty is not necessary or desirable. We should have sufficient confidence in the medical officers of this country and in the medical profession generally to acknowledge that if an infectious disease is brought to their notice or comes to their notice in the course of their practice they will take all possible steps to deal with it.  It is wrong that a medical officer attending a private patient should feel himself <Col N="742" /> obliged by law to seek out an infectious disease and, if he finds it, to report it immediately.  The compulsory provisions of this sub-section are a grave reflection on the honour and integrity of the medical profession.  I suggested when the section was introduced that the first obligation which should be placed on a person who believes that he is a probable source of infection is to get in touch with his medical doctor as speedily as possible and report his condition to him or, in the case of a member of his family, the condition of that member of his family, and leave it to the medical doctor to do the best that can be done in the circumstances and accept his advice and instructions.  Now, in this peculiar section we have the ordinary citizen prohibited from getting in touch with his medical doctor.  He cannot go out into the street or in any other way get in touch with him unless, as Deputy Coogan said, he has a telephone in his house.  There are so many absurdities in this section that the Parliamentary Secretary ought to agree to have it considered before the Report Stage.  It is a pity that he has been so stubborn and thus has wasted so much time.  I am afraid his bedside manner is not impressing this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal objection I have to this section, or to the amendment which has been included in it, is that the object is to try to throw dust in the eyes of Deputies and the public.  When the Bill was originally discussed there was general criticism by Deputies and also outside the House and in the Press of certain provisions in Section 21.  The Parliamentary Secretary evidently was so impressed by the criticism in this House and outside it that he felt bound to make some move to obviate a repetition of the criticism when we came to discuss the Bill in Committee.  He proceeded to try to bamboozle the people by changing these provisions from Section 21 to Section 19.  He has in this amendment of his all the things that were objectionable in the original Section 21; in fact they are probably more objectionable now than they were originally, because there was one merit <Col N="743" /> in Section 21 as it stood originally, namely, that the places that infected persons might not go to were specifically defined.  Section 21 provided that the parent of a child suffering from an infectious disease could not send the child to any place to which that section applied, namely, any school, place of public worship, theatre, concert hall or cinema.  Under the amendment which the Parliamentary Secretary has substituted for Section 21 a parent could not send such a child to any place whatever.</P>
      <P>Take this list of diseases to which the sub-section applies.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that persons suffering from infectious disease were already prohibited from attending certain places, such as places of worship, schools, etc.  I do not profess to be a lawyer or to know anything about the law or the Act of 1878.  I have so little knowledge of that Act that it might not have existed so far as I am concerned and I think there are many other people in that position.  But I do know that I myself, and I am sure a lot of Deputies, from time to time have suffered from many of the infectious diseases mentioned in this schedule, and we never thought we were injuring anyone very much by going to Church or attending school when we were youngsters, or going to many other places.  I venture to say that when the Bill becomes law we will do so still, but we will probably be hauled up by the Parliamentary Secretary and fined £50.</P>

    <P>Every Deputy who has anything to do with a farm knows that in dressing ringworm in cattle you very often get ringworm on your hand.  There is hardly any person connected with a farm who has not got it at some time or other.  I got it several times.  I always put some dressing on it and bound up my hand as well as I could and proceeded on my ordinary business and I do not think I ever gave it to anybody.  I went to Church and met the people there.  Nobody prevented me from going to Church.  I was not held up by a Civic Guard and told that I had broken the law and that they would proceed against me.  That is <Col N="744" /> one particular disease that everybody knows was very common.  There is another disease which might be more serious and that is anthrax.  A member of my family some years ago got boils, as they call them, and they were treated at home.  After some time he went to the doctor who said he was suffering from anthrax.  The doctor applied dressings of cotton wool, etc. He did not tell that member of my family that he was not to go to Church or anywhere else.  That particular member of my family proceeded to go to the places that he was accustomed to go to and, so far as I know, nobody else suffered as a result of that.  That is the sort of thing we have to meet in this Bill.  Deputies criticised it severely on the Second Reading, and the general public, Church representatives, and everybody else are up in arms against it.  The Parliamentary Secretary in a backhand way is trying to put it over on the public by putting in this amendment in Section 19.  I do not think that either the House or the country will stand for it.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the discussion on this section for a long time and I feel that Deputies are without some of the relevant information that they require in order to see what the section proposes to do.  When we started discussing this section we did not know what diseases were included under it.

      <P>I did not think of it; it was there all the time.  It has emerged.  I will tell you what the objection is to&mdash;the regulations.  The Parliamentary Secretary by steepening the regulations can very much tighten up this section or, by leaving them more open, he can very much reduce the force of the section.  I suppose nobody is more aware than the Parliamentary Secretary that, if the general public do not accept laws as being proper laws that ought to be enforced, it will not be very long until they have no force of law.  I would like to put <Col N="745" /> that matter before the Parliamentary Secretary.  We sympathise with his effort to improve the public health. You can go too slow or you can go too fast.

      <P>I want to make my third attempt to obtain information from the Parliamentary Secretary as regards the impact on a family or a household when one of its members gets an infectious or contagious disease.  According to the definitions, &ldquo;infectious&rdquo; includes &ldquo;contagious&rdquo;. We all agree that a person with such a disease is a source of infection and that there ought to be some restraint on his movements.  This section, as drafted, and when assisted by stern regulations which we have not yet seen, may result in a house in which there is an infectious or a contagious disease being converted into something like a quarantine camp.  The people will not be allowed out.  I should think that the milkman who steps inside the door to deliver the milk for the family and the butcher who brings in a tray, which he may use in other places, will be affected by the regulations and I have several times asked the Parliamentary Secretary what the impact will be on a father or mother <Col N="746" /> one of whose household has an infectious disease.  Will limitations be imposed on their going out and coming in?  If that is so, a more serious issue will have arisen for this House than this Public Health Bill.  All sorts of questions will arise.  Who is going to maintain those people?  I renew my request to the Parliamentary Secretary for the third time for information regarding limitations to be imposed on a father or a mother in a house where there is infectious disease.  May the father go to his work or is he liable to a penalty if he leaves the infected house?</P>

We hope that she will join the small band of workers who take part in the proceedings in Committee and that she will give us the benefit of her realistic woman's mind on the problems before us.  It gave me great pleasure to hear the Deputy and I should like to give expression to that pleasure.  Deputy Dockrell has put a plain question to the Parliamentary Secretary and the fact that he should have to put that question at this hour illuminates the whole position.</P>

He will be discussing the anatomy of it and the proceedings in the Department of Local Government which preceded the debate.  The <Col N="747" /> approach of the Department to the framing of this measure was, indeed, extraordinary.  To deal with Deputy Dockrell's point, what is to be required under this section of the father or mother in a house where there is infectious disease, so declared for the purpose of this section?  It is important to have that information from the point of view of the individual, but it is also important having regard to Section 34.  That section provides that, where a person is suffering from an infectious disease and because of requirements in that connection is unable to carry on in business and maintain his dependents, the country or county borough in which the person ordinarily resides shall make provision to maintain his dependents.  That is where the person himself is suffering from infectious disease.  When a person is a probable source of infection, he may not be able to go about his business and maintain his family because of the operation of this section and the county or county borough will have to maintain himself and his family.  In the interest of the individual, of the local authority and of the State, or whoever will ultimately bear the cost in this connection, and for the benefit of Deputies who, when they pass laws, should know what they are passing and what their effect will be, we should have a reply from the Parliamentary Secretary to the question put by Deputy Dockrell.</P>

      <P>As far as we can understand, what the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to convey, is that as far as whooping cough and contacts are concerned people affected under the new dispensation will not be allowed to go out to the streets.  We have to consider the effect of that on both their social and economic life and on local and State finances.  Our difficulty in trying to interpret the Minister, even with the small chance he gives us, is increased when he makes use of statements such as he used when interrupting Deputy Bennett. When Deputy Bennett was describing what would happen when a man suffering from infectious disease went into the street, the Parliamentary Secretary intervened to say: &ldquo;He should take proper precautions.&rdquo;  In sub-section (3) there is no question about a person taking proper precautions. The section expressly states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who knows that he is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease shall not expose himself in any street, public place, club, hotel or shop.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no question about taking proper precautions or precautions of any kind there.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We apparently did not approach the matter in the new administrative spirit in which the Parliamentary Secretary is approaching it.  We did not make elaborate provisions to see that persons affected <Col N="750" /> should not only keep to their houses if they suffered from these diseases, but that, if necessary, they should be forcibly taken away to institutions. Now with a great sweep to clear up the whole infectious disease situation in the country, we are going possibly to saddle the rates with the maintenance of their families.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given no review of the situation or no outline of his approach to the situation that would persuade us that we are not going out in a mad wild kind of way, to do a thing that can only be done by public education, using the whole of the nursing and medical services to persuade people in a reasonable way as to how infectious disease is to be treated.  The Minister has come here and behaved in a most peculiar and uneven way. When we read the stuff that he has put before us and listen to what is said, when we realise how lopsided the whole approach to this situation is, when we consider the way in which Section 19 as amended is now being pieced together and built up, we get some idea of the administrative mind that is behind the present scheme. When we consider the build-up of this section, the inevitable peep we have to give in our imagination as to what went on behind the scenes in the Department before this section was framed, gives us some insight into the most astonishing episode that ever took place in the framing of legislation in any Parliament.</P>

      <P>I have listened very carefully to the debate and I must say that I am not at all impressed by the arguments which have come from the other side of the House.  Deputy Coogan's argument about inability to go for a doctor in certain circumstances falls to the ground unless he first puts himself in the position of being the medical officer who diagnoses the disease.  Surely most diseases have certain breeding stages during which a person takes precautions.  Surely, nobody is going to be debarred from leaving his house until a medical practitioner diagnoses the disease and has advised the people why it is in their own best interests and the best interests of the community that they <Col N="751" /> should remain in the house.  Surely the normal precautions which any family will take for the safety of their own members and the safety of the community in general will not be considered an offence?</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question. He said that the regulations for which I was looking, had been in operation for the past 20 years. Under Section 20, the Minister may make regulations for preventing the spread of infectious disease.  Are these the old regulations that are going to be brought in holus-bolus or is the Parliamentary Secretary going completely to alter those regulations by, as I previously said, stiffening them?  That is why it is so difficult to consider this section without seeing the regulations with which it is going to be interpreted.  I take it that if a question comes before the courts, the courts will look up this section and look also at the regulations.  At present we are looking at this section but we are waiting the advent of the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that some changes will be required in this section.  It is practically a new section <Col N="752" /> of a very elaborate kind, and containing proposals which were not in the original Bill, and I ask if the Dáil can go into Committee on Report Stage in respect of this amendment.  There are two sections in respect of which it appears to me that the Dáil should go into Committee on Report.  We have a very large number of amendments down to Section 21 on somewhat the same lines and of the same type as those which we would desire to put down to the new part of Section 19 from sub-section (3) to sub-section (10), but, apart from that, the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that he has some amendments to introduce dealing with the types of infectious diseases which will be dealt with under various sections, and I ask whether, in relation to Sections 19 and 21, the House will be able to consider them in Committee.</P>

      <P>I quite approve of this new sub-section, for the simple reason that it will be a deterrent to those members of the better-off classes who can afford to isolate cases of disease in their homes.  I happen to know of houses in which scarlatina and diphtheria broke out and in which the people concerned were able to isolate the patients, but the maidservants and other attendants in those homes went into shops and places of worship.  If anything, the fine of £50 prescribed is not sufficient in respect of people convicted of that offence. When we turn to another section prescribing penalties in relation to the masses of the people for breaches of the law, the Bill is very moderate in fixing a fine of £5.  Deputy Costello last night recommended a walk round the gasworks as a cure for whooping cough.  I wonder if the Deputy and his wife and family take a walk around the gasworks when their family is suffering from whooping cough?  Evidently that is good enough for the families of workers.  The fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has made it known that there were no less <Col N="753" /> than 54,000 notifiable diseases last year and no fewer than 6,000 deaths does not seem to have impressed itself on Deputies, and particularly on opposition Deputies.  One Deputy wanted the Parliamentary Secretary to be a prophet and to tell him what percentage could be saved.  It is beyond all imagination that people in these days should ask the Parliamentary Secretary to prophesy what effect these diseases have on the community and to what extent it will be prevented. Time and time only is the test of that. For these reasons, I support the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>We can all sympathise with the Parliamentary Secretary in his efforts to make the people as healthy as possible and his efforts to take all possible steps to reduce to a minimum the spread of disease and the sources of infection.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary must be aware, when he mentions the 50,000 cases of notification and the 6,000 deaths, that all that took place at a time when exactly the same law was in operation as is proposed here, and therefore it does not follow that if and when this Bill passes, the health of the people will improve.  We all hope it will, but, being a realist, I fancy that the Irish people as a whole will just carry on as if this Bill did not exist. I feel that much more effective work could be done through the medium of propaganda and instruction of the people.  The Parliamentary Secretary was keen on that.  He called for co-operation and personally I should be <Col N="755" /> prepared to give it to him.  Candidly, these different things about a person &ldquo;knowing&rdquo;, etc., etc., cannot possibly be carried out.  All a person has to say is that he does not know and who is to prove that he does know?  Again, I was sorry to hear my colleague, Deputy Walsh, propounding the view that certain people would be fined £50 and others £5.</P>

      <P>It applies to particular sections.  In so far as the notification is concerned, there should be no differentiation.  I would go so far as to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that the commonsense of the Irish people themselves&mdash;the parents, especially&mdash;will be the greatest help he will receive in making this Bill effective. Therefore, I suggest that the fine be left out altogether.  I think Deputy Walsh is quite wrong in saying there is a fine of £50 for one class and £5 for another.  There is not, and I would be sorry if there were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tendency, unfortunately, when certain legislation is passed here, to try to give the view throughout the length and breadth of the country that that legislation is only for a certain class of people.  We should get away from that.  The better class, so to speak, may not be so numerous as the poorer class, but we pride ourselves on the fact that once legislation is passed it must be obeyed by the millionaire as well as by the labourer.  I remember a case in my own family and I had not the slightest hesitation in notifying the authorities and using the public conveyance provided.  I would be long sorry to go for a private car in that case.  It did not turn out to be an infectious case, but even so I carried out the law as it existed and <Col N="756" /> brought the public van to the house.  I would think bad of allowing such a member of the family to go out and mix with the general public.  The Parliamentary Secretary should rely more on the commonsense of the people and, in time, he will get the co-operation he hopes for.  Therefore, I do not like this coercion business and think he should leave out the question of fine altogether.  After all, £50 is rather a heavy penalty to impose on somebody who may not know he is committing an offence.  It should be left out or reduced, so as not to create the impression that there is any such thing as differentiation in regard to offences which may be committed under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 107, standing in the name of Deputy Costello:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete all words from the word &ldquo;therefrom&rdquo; in line 38, and substitute the words &ldquo;and such regulations shall provide only for the matters specifically mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 20 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations providing for the prevention of the spread (including the spread outside the State) of an infectious disease or of infectious diseases generally and for the treatment of persons suffering therefrom and the regulations may, in particular, provide for any of the matters mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;and the regulations may, in particular, provide for any of the matters mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act&rdquo; and to replace them by the words &ldquo;and such regulations <Col N="758" /> shall provide only for the matters specifically mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;  Following the discussion on Section 19 and on the amendment to that section moved by the Minister, to insert therein all the new sub-sections from (3) down to (10), we have seen certain provisions put into the Bill dealing with the precautions that must be taken or the things that are forbidden in the case of persons who are probable sources of infection.  The new sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A person who knows that he is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease shall not expose himself in any street, public place, club, hotel or shop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained that that was a provision contained in Section 142 of the Act of 1878 which this Bill, as originally drafted, repealed.  As far as we can understand, if there was not a complete forgetfulness on the part of the Department or the draftsman of the fact that it was desired to hold the terms of that Section 142, then the only way in which the important powers of that Section 142 could be introduced into the Bill was by regulations under Section 20.  This gives us a greater sense of what it is possible to do under regulations made under Section 20.  If it was not contemplated when the Bill was drafted, that the regulations it was proposed to take power to make under Section 20 would include power to prevent persons suffering from an infectious disease from exposing themselves on the streets or in public places, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary where else in the Bill he proposed to take those powers.</P>
    <P>Under the Second Schedule, very elaborate powers are taken in 14 different paragraphs to make regulations covering all kinds of things.  Now that the Minister apparently has brought out into the open, in a definite section of the Bill, the powers he wanted in the shape of the new sub-section (3) of Section 19, I think that, if there are any other powers of any like kind, they should either be put as additional paragraphs into the Second Schedule or should be embodied in <Col N="759" /> some section of the Bill.  We ought not to pass this Section 20 in the form in which it is, giving the Minister authority to put into regulations apparently very extraordinary powers.  We ought to know what powers he proposes to take while we are in the process of discussing the Bill in Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>What strikes me is that the Second Schedule does envisage a very wide field of operations. I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what other operations he foresees, having regard to the words used in this section in particular.  It is obvious that there must be at the back of his mind a number of other operations and I think the House would be interested to hear what they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again I have to point out to the House that in the section we are not seeking any powers that we have not at the present time. Why are we to be restricted in a manner in which the previous Government was not restricted, in a manner in which an alien Government was not restricted here before our own institutions of government were set up?  Why are we to be so restricted in this important matter of the control of infectious diseases?  What is the idea behind it? While Cumann na nGaedheal was in office the sky was the limit in so far as power to make regulations to govern and control infectious diseases was concerned.  I will try to satisfy the House on that&mdash;that is, if the members can be satisfied.  I will satisfy any impartial, interested person, either inside or outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, when these matters are being discussed, and they arise on different sections of the Bill, every Deputy who is interested is not here. It is rather a trial to ask me day after day to explain in detail the principles which I have explained the day before, and perhaps on two or three other occasions.  Yesterday I occupied a considerable portion of the time of the House in trying to satisfy Deputies&mdash; and I succeeded to a very great extent &mdash;that there are certain circumstances <Col N="760" /> and certain contingencies relating to infectious diseases that cannot be provided for, either by law or by regulation. I was challenged to give examples, and I gave examples.  I do not know how many of the Deputies who are listening to me now were listening to me yesterday when I gave these examples.</P>
    <P>I cited the difficulty of dealing with the typhoid carrier who, after a period of institutional treatment and training and advice, could, with safety to himself and his neighbours, be released, provided he continued to observe certain practices and certain hygienic observances which it would be very difficult to define in regulations. I referred to the case of trachoma, where a sufferer might go into a public lavatory and subsequently use a towel there and convey that rather dreadful disease to some innocent person who, perhaps, might use the same towel.  I referred to the same set of circumstances regarding venereal disease, and I told the House, to the astonishment of many people listening to me, that innocent people have contracted venereal disease in that way.</P>
    <P>Why should we be restricted in trying to save the community from these visitations?  Why should we be restricted in a manner in which no Minister has ever been restricted who has had to accept responsibility for safeguarding the people in relation to these matters?</P>
    <P>Where do we get our power from for the purpose of making regulations? Where did Deputy Mulcahy get it in his time?  How were the people protected in the past, in so far as they have been protected?  They got the power in Section 148 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  We got unlimited power there, absolutely unrestricted power in the matter of making regulations, and if that Section 148 were not being repealed in the present Bill I might drop the half of it because there would be enough power in that section, if I were not trying to coordinate the law, to serve the purposes of any Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be necessary to put the terms of that <Col N="761" /> section on the records of the House.  It is quite apparent, at any rate, that it is necessary that some of the outstanding features of that section should be referred to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Local Government Board may from time to time make, alter and revoke such regulations as to the said board may seem fit&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Will Deputies allow these words to sink in&mdash;&ldquo;such regulations as to the said board may seem fit&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;with a view to the treatment of persons affected with&rdquo;</P>
    <P>the diseases that are cited here</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and such other diseases as well on the seas, rivers, and waters of the United Kingdom, and on the high seas within three miles of the coasts thereof, as on land; and may declare by what authority or authorities such regulations shall be enforced and executed.  Regulations so made shall be published in the <i>Dublin Gazette</i>, and such publication shall be for all purposes conclusive evidence of such regulations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not only had we unrestricted power as to what we might incorporate in these regulations, but we were under no obligation to place these regulations on the Table of the House.  Now we are deliberately accepting that statutory obligation, so that whatever is in the regulations will be subject to review by the House.  Then we are asked: &ldquo;Why cannot you think of every possible contingency and cover it by the regulations you place before the House?&rdquo;  Because it cannot be done, and because Deputies know it cannot be done, but, apparently, they think that this is of some value, but what on earth value it can be to pursue this line of conduct is beyond my comprehension.</P>

We are asking him in the amendment to put into the Second Schedule any additional serious things in respect of which he thinks it may be necessary to make regulations. Personally, I think it is important that the House should accept Deputy Costello's amendment.  I do not know on what line Deputy Costello wanted to approach this matter.  I approach it from this point of view, that it would appear to me that if the Parliamentary Secretary did not bring forward amendment No. 103, containing the extraordinary powers taken from the Public Health Act of 1878, he intended to secure these powers by regulation.  I think that powers of such magnitude should not be secured by regulation.</P>

I again put this question to him: is it not a fact that, if he did not introduce amendment No. 103, he would have had, under regulations, to provide <Col N="763" /> himself with those powers, if he wanted them, under Section 20?</P>

If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks that it is necessary for me to brush up my recollection about some old things, and gives me notice of that, I shall do my best to assist him.  The Parliamentary Secretary has come here with his Bill.  He has a whole Department behind him. All that we have been asking from him is a clear exposition of what his intentions are.  We did not get that from him.  We had to drag things out of him in discussion.  That, in spite of all our experience, not only surprised us but shocked us.  The Parliamentary Secretary is taking extraordinary powers here, powers that we never knew of until he disclosed some of them when he introduced amendment No. 103.  Section 20 can, apparently, be very powerful in its operation, even though it is quite innocuous looking. In view of that and the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has been able to put such a considerable amount of information into the Second Schedule as to what he proposes to do, I am suggesting to him that he should tell us what other things, outside those that are in the Second Schedule, he proposes to do?  I am asking him to give us the main lines of his thought, and that if we find that we are not satisfied, he will assist the House by enabling us to put down amendments for the Report Stage to secure that we will not give him the extraordinary powers that he is seeking under regulations, even should these regulations be put before the House.</P>

      <P>The necessity for including this provision in regard to the enforcement and execution of the regulations in a free airport is that the officers of customs and excise and of the Minister for Justice will not be in attendance at such airport.  The officers of customs are first line defence against the introduction of infectious diseases by aircraft coming from abroad.  They have the duty of questioning the masters of aircraft in regard to any suspicious illness which may have occurred amongst the passengers or crew on the voyage.  It is necessary, in the case of a free airport, to employ for a similar purpose officers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who will be in attendance at the airport.  This is really a machinery amendment. There is no contentious principle at stake.</P>

      <P>No person shall be required to submit to immunisation, inoculation, or any other form of special treatment provided for in this section and the Second Schedule of this Act where such person objects to such treatment on grounds of conscience, or in the case of a child where his parents so object.</P>
      <P>I intend to speak only briefly on this amendment.  I notice that Deputy Cosgrave has put down an amendment which is similar to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  Deputy Cosgrave's amendment deals with the question of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, my amendment deals, not only with children, but also with adults.  It is intended by the amendment to give to any person who is expected to comply with the regulations under this section and the Second Schedule of the Act the right to object on conscientious grounds if they believe, conscientiously, that the treatment prescribed would be injurious to health, or if people have an objection on any ground to inoculation or immunisation.  We all know that there are many people in this country who have very strong objection <Col N="769" /> to inoculation or immunisation. We know that there are people who believe that such treatment is injurious to health, and we should give consideration to their views, particularly to those of parents in respect of their children.  It is natural that parents should feel very strongly about the health of their children, and it is right and proper that the State should recognise that they have a special interest in their welfare.  If a parent considers that inoculation or immunisation exposes a child to the danger of a certain type of infection or disease, the State should be prepared to recognise a reasonable objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is drafted rather roughly, and if the Minister is prepared to accept the principle of it I should like to see it elaborated.  What I intended was that the right to object on conscientious grounds should be definitely outlined, as well as the procedure under which objection could be made.  If a person is prepared to assert on oath that he believes such treatment is injurious to the health of children, that objection should be accepted.  Provision was made for the exemption of conscientious objectors under the Vaccination Acts.  I see no reason why such a provision should not be made in this Bill.  There is not only a conflict of opinion amongst lay people, which may not be considered seriously by the medical profession, but there is also a conflict of opinion amongst the medical profession regarding the wisdom or unwisdom of certain forms of immunisation, inoculation and vaccination.  We know that vaccination against smallpox was compulsory for 100 years.  Under the present Bill it is proposed to suspend that compulsory provision for the time being.  When we find that the medical profession can be so mistaken on such a question for such a long period, is it not reasonable to assume that the medical profession, and the medical authorities attached to the Department, could make a serious mistake regarding the immunisation and inoculation that is now prescribed? We know that a serum was provided for immunisation against diphtheria, and that it has been changed from <Col N="770" /> year to year.  That does not indicate that the medical authorities are very confident about the position.  Until there is a greater measure of confidence as to the usefulness or otherwise of immunisation, or its effects, it should not be made compulsory, without having some means of exemption for those who feel very strongly on the matter.</P>
    <P>It is only a few years since a number of children immunised against diphtheria were, in the course of the treatment, infected with tuberculosis, and I think one or two of them actually died. It must, therefore, be acknowledged that there is grave danger in such immunisation. Take the case of the average parent, who has a perfectly healthy child, surely that parent is entitled to ask for exemption when the State proceeds to inoculate the child with what is, I think, admitted to be diseased matter.  It may be a preventative of diphtheria, but there might be a grave doubt.  If the Minister accepts the principle of the amendment he will be able to put it into more appropriate form.  I want to draw attention to a distinction between this amendment and one in the name of Deputy Cosgrave.  My amendment makes provision for the doing of whatever is required by law for objecting on conscientious grounds, in the case of a parent who feels that he has a healthy child, and that he should have the right to object to a form of treatment which he considers to be dangerous to health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to intervene at this stage, but it might be more profitable and less laborious if we had the views of other sections of the House.  I should like first to make the point, if necessary, that the immunisation or protective measures taken are for the protection and safety of the community, that is, if we are satisfied at all that such measures have protective effect.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the compulsory vaccination <Col N="771" /> law is being repealed in this Bill.  I am not aware of any volume of informed medical opinion in this country that holds the view, either that immunisation against diphtheria is not effective, and does not bring about an effective form of protection, or that vaccination against smallpox is not an effective weapon against that disease. I do not deny that there is a certain number of societies and organisations and individuals and even medical people who take the opposite view, but I do not know any medical people of any scientific repute who hold that viewpoint.  The reason why the Vaccination Acts are being repealed in this Bill&mdash;and everybody might not agree that that is a wise step either&mdash;is, either by reason of immunity that our people have developed or by reason of more hygienic conditions under which we are living, whatever the reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so&mdash;smallpox has become almost unknown in this country and to me, at any rate, it did seem illogical that when we compulsorily vaccinated a child we did not revaccinate periodically in order to maintain the immunity that scientists agree is brought about as a result of vaccination.  At the same time there is the possibility, at any rate&mdash; we all hope that it will never become a reality&mdash;that smallpox might make its appearance again.  Consequently, it seems prudent to have power to enforce compulsory vaccination should circumstances arise under which it would be desirable to adopt that course.  As far as immunisation against diphtheria is concerned, I can only say that no decision has been taken to make immunisation against diphtheria compulsory but I do say, and Deputies on all sides of the House are aware of it, that most of our medical scientists in this country&mdash;and we have medical scientists of high repute in this country in relation to infectious diseases as we have in relation to every other branch of medical science&mdash;strongly believe that immunisation against diphtheria ought to be compulsory, particularly in the areas, <Col N="772" /> such as the City of Dublin, for example, where unfortunately we have had a very heavy incidence rate and a very heavy death rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Diphtheria, we are talking about at the moment.  Deputy Cogan has some doubts as to whether these scientific preventive measures are in fact effective and I presume he will tell us in so far as smallpox is concerned what propagandists tell us, that we did not get rid of smallpox by reason of compulsory vaccination; we got rid of it for other reasons.  We can leave that anyhow because, thanks be to God, it is not a problem of to-day.  The figures in regard to diphtheria are impressive.  I have in recent times in one way or another delivered quite a number of lectures in this House on public health matters and I have succeeded, so far, with short intervals of storm, in generally getting the support and the understanding of the House in relation to these matters, but it would be too much to expect me, I think, to satisfy lay Deputies on a purely scientific problem like this that is rather puzzling even to men with substantial scientific training.  I want to put some figures at any rate that are indicative, even to the lay man, that there is something in this matter of diphtheria immunisation.  In 1940, in the whole of the State, we had 1,891 cases of diphtheria notified.  We have been carrying out immunisation on a fairly extensive scale.  I can give the figures later on, if necessary, in the different years.  In that year we had 178 deaths from diphtheria; 177 of them were amongst persons who were not immunised; there was one death of a person who was immunised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this 1940?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>1940.  In 1941 there were 1,447 cases, four deaths amongst immunised persons, 161 deaths among unimmunised persons.  In 1942 there were 2,853 cases, six deaths amongst immunised persons, 261 deaths amongst unimmunised persons.  In 1943 there were 4,585 cases, 11 deaths amongst immunised persons, 299 deaths amongst unimmunised persons.  In 1944, the <Col N="773" /> latest firm figures that are available, there were 5,086 cases, five deaths amongst immunised persons, and 288 deaths amongst persons unimmunised. The argument might be put forward that here we appear to have a rising incidence notwithstanding the fact that immunisation schemes were being fairly extensively carried out.  The only reply I can give to that is the obvious reply, that from time to time we are struck by waves of outbreaks of infectious diseases.  It seems to move in cycles.  But what does appear to be established, by these figures at any rate, is that when we are struck by such a wave, the death rate amongst the immunised is very small as compared with the death rate amongst the unimmunised.  That lesson seems to be brought home pretty strongly.  Dublin City has been particularly badly hit with diphtheria over a number of years.  I hope I am not keeping the House too long but I think it is a rather important matter.  Taking Dublin City which, so far as diphtheria is concerned, is, I suppose, the worst area in the State: in 1940 we had 720 cases in Dublin City; there were 56 deaths, all of them of unimmunised persons; no death of an immunised person.  In 1941 there were 450 cases, 53 deaths, one of an immunised person. In 1942, 624 cases, three deaths amongst immunised persons, 54 deaths amongst unimmunised persons.  In 1943, 1,351 cases, two deaths amongst immunised persons, 83 amongst unimmunised persons.  In 1944, 1,330 cases, no death amongst immunised persons, 72 deaths amongst unimmunised persons.  That is the picture as we see it.  The outbreak for some years past in Dublin has been of a particularly virulent nature.  There are particular outbreaks in many other areas where the infection is not so virulent and the fatal consequences, of course, are not so widespread.  But Dublin has been very severely hit.  It was, of course, mostly children and young people who were struck by this disease.  Thirteen hundred is a staggering figure for one disease.  I need not say that a matter like that must be a cause of considerable concern to people who have responsibilities and who are immediately interested.  It <Col N="774" /> has been of concern to public representatives and to both local authorities and the central authority, and it has been of very serious concern to me. But, at any rate, I would not like to be disarmed of the power to immunise compulsorily in a particular area at a particular time in particular circumstances. Such a scheme would not be put into compulsory operation without the most careful consideration and only after consultation with people who are very competent to advise on these matters.  I do not think I can be of further assistance to the House in this matter.  That is the picture as it is presented to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is in my name on the Order Paper later a somewhat similar amendment to this amendment, but I think wider in scope.  In that amendment I had intended to put forward, not my own personal views, but the views of certain of my constituents who expressed themselves strongly on the subject of compulsory vaccination and immunisation.  The amendment in my name is much wider in scope and, accordingly, I will deal only with the amendment here which refers to immunisation and inoculation.  So far as my own personal views are concerned, I am, speaking broadly, always guided by informed medical opinion.  I am prepared to take the views of people who are experts in their job, who devote their lives to it, and who are, particularly in our own country as, I think, the Parliamentary Secretary has said, very highly skilled in all branches of pathology and that part of medicine which deals with immunisation and inoculation.  These are my own personal views.  At the same time, it must be recognised that there is a very small minority which, from conviction in many cases and conscientious scruples in other cases, object to the particular type of inoculation and immunisation which may be put into force under the provisions of this Bill. It is on their behalf that I speak on this amendment and that I hope to speak at some greater length on my own amendment, No. 212, when we come to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of my own constituents did communicate with me on this <Col N="775" /> matter and I felt that I would be lacking in my duty as their representative if I did not put forward their views in this House.  There may be a number of people who would endeavour, without any conviction and certainly without any conscience, to evade the provisions of a Bill of this kind.  For that class of people I have no sympathy whatever.  But for those people who do genuinely object on grounds with which medical men or scientists might not agree, from motives of conviction and, very frequently, from motives of conscience, I make the appeal here. There is only a very small number who would be affected.  I do not think that it would be beyond the wit of the Parliamentary draftsman so to frame provisions dealing with these people as to make it quite clear that people who were not genuinely convinced or who had not genuine scruples of conscience in this matter could get away with evading the law.  I think it would be simple enough to provide safeguards against evasion by resort to so-called conscientious objections or so-called convictions against inoculation or immunisation.  But I think that there ought to be something put in the Bill to safeguard the principles and views of these people who do genuinely hold the views that they advocate.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said that he is unaware of any volume of individual opinion in this country which is contrary to compulsory vaccination or immunisation. That probably is so; it may be so.  But in the circular sent to me there was certainly an impressive number of medical gentlemen with all sorts of degrees after their names&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who had subscribed their names.  I am not in a position to say whether in the scientific or pathological world they carry any weight at all, but the Parliamentary Secretary may be in a position to assess the value of their opinions. Whether they do carry any weight or not, there is a very small number of people in this country who do genuinely believe that it would be against their convictions and their <Col N="776" /> consciences to submit to compulsory immunisation or inoculation.  A lot of people will refer to them as cranks. Most medical men will refer to them as such in contemptuous terms.  But, whether they are or not, they are individual citizens with a right to their own private views and, so long as the expression of those views and the practical effect of those views do not sensibly injure the well-being of the community, I think it would be fair and just to provide for them in this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene briefly in reply to what the Parliamentary Secretary said.  I think that in all parts of the House we are agreed that everything possible should be done to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, particularly of such a disease as diphtheria which takes such a toll of human life.  At first glance, the figures which the Parliamentary Secretary has submitted appear to be very impressive; they appear to be almost devastatingly impressive.  But they do not carry any conviction unless they are related to the total number of persons immunised.  For example, if the Parliamentary Secretary said that only 1 per cent. of the persons who died from diphtheria were immunised, it would appear very impressive.  But, if we were to learn that 1 per cent. of the total population were immunised, it would completely demolish the force of his argument.  Therefore, in addition to giving us the number of people who have died from diphtheria, he should also give us the total number immunised or the percentage of the total population that has been immunised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another factor which would occur to me at first glance and that is: amongst the number described as non-immunised would be many infants and very young children.  The mortality might be very high amongst that section. A large number of the tiny infants would not be immunised.  Until we get the proportion of the total population who are immunised and the proportion of those who are not immunised, there is very little point in comparing the death rates between <Col N="777" /> the two.  If the Minister and his Department are fully convinced of the effectiveness of immunisation or inoculation, it is not easy to oppose that opinion, but we might be prepared to consider the small section of the community who have a conscientious objection to this treatment.  The number of persons likely to avail of such a provision as is embodied in this amendment would be small and would hardly affect the general usefulness of immunisation or inoculation.  The fact that a small percentage of the population might remain non-immunised as a result of this amendment would hardly affect the general position.</P>
    <P>Another point which strikes me is that if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department of Health succeed in convincing the public of the efficacy of immunisation against diphtheria we may have a campaign for immunisation and inoculation in regard to all kinds of diseases.  We may be inclined to go too far in that respect.  Nothing, we are told, succeeds like success and it might be desirable to have some little check in regard to the enthusiasm or extravagance of the medical profession. Whatever the medical profession in this country may think or believe&mdash;and we are generally inclined to accept their opinion&mdash;we know that, behind inoculation and immunisation, there is a strong vested interest.  There is money in the business&mdash;particularly the business of manufacturing sera of various kinds.  I remember hearing of a person in charge of a laboratory in New York who claimed that he had made a profit of £48,000 out of one horse which he named &ldquo;Old Faithful&rdquo;.  It was certainly a very faithful animal.  I am sure the Aga Khan would be jealous of so profitable an animal.  A very considerable profit is to be made out of the manufacture of sera and there may be a strong vested interest in such an industry.  While immunisation in respect of the diphtheria may be as effective as the Parliamentary Secretary claims, that does not prove that every form of immunisation and inoculation is equally effective.  The Parliamentary Secretary should clear up the point which I have raised in regard to the figures quoted.  He should give us the exact proportions <Col N="778" /> of the total population who are immunised and non-immunised, so that we could see how these figures compare with the death rates he has mentioned.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Costello said, it is very difficult for the ordinary layman to have an opinion on subjects of this character which would be deemed to be of any great value. We cannot, however, ignore the importance of the statistics which have been given to us.  Deputy Cogan was not satisfied because the ratio was not given, but I happen to be in touch with those who are running the immunisation scheme for diphtheria in the city. I know that their opinion is that that scheme is of tremendous value to the health of the city.  Because of that opinion, I should not care to do anything to obstruct the granting of the powers regarding immunisation provided for in this Bill.  I recognise the point of view of those who have conscientious scruples on this matter, but I see a difficulty in implementing a proposal to meet their point of view. Individuals might, for frivolous or other purposes, seek to avail of that concession and might negative the whole value of the immunisation scheme.  So far as a personal opinion goes, I favour retention of schemes of immunisation as, in the light of my experience and the knowledge I have gained, such schemes are of immense value to the public health.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 116:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (7), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  no parent of a child under 16 years of age shall be liable to any penalty under this section, if within 14 days of the receipt of a notice or regulation made under this section, directing such parent to present such child for treatment in the manner set out in the notice or regulation, he makes a statutory declaration that he conscientiously believes that such treatment would be prejudicial to the health of the child and within seven days thereafter delivers or sends by post the <Col N="779" /> declaration to the chief medical officer of the county authority;</P>
    <P>(b)  a statutory declaration made for the purposes of this section shall be exempt from stamp duty;</P>
    <P>(c)  a statutory declaration for the purposes of this section shall be made in the form set out in the Third Schedule to this Act, or in a form to the like effect.</P>
    <P>I entirely subscribe to the view that, in matters of this kind, we should be guided by informed medical opinion. I put down this amendment because representations were made to me, as Deputy Costello stated they were made to him, by people who hold certain opinions on this subject.  Some of them have very strong objections to compulsory immunisation or inoculation. Frankly, I accept whatever medical opinion dictates in this regard in respect of diphtheria or smallpox.  I put the amendment down because I think that the views of those who have a strong conviction concerning immunisation or inoculation should be considered.  It is true that immunisation and inoculation are for the benefit of the health of the community.  The statistics available would seem to show overwhelmingly that they have been successful, although, according to the figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary, there has been an increase in recent years in the incidence of diphtheria, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>On the other hand it is obvious that the number of deaths amongst people treated for or immunised against diphtheria was considerably fewer than the number of deaths amongst those who were not so treated.  There is at any rate this obvious result, that if immunisation did not eradicate diphtheria entirely, it mitigated the severity of the disease.  The statutory declaration which I have provided in this amendment is taken from an earlier Act, the 1907 or 1909 Public Health Act, where a similar provision was made.  I have modified it slightly to meet this section.  In fact, it may be too wide, because it covers matters other than immunisation and inoculation. Paragraph (b) which provides <Col N="780" /> that the statutory declaration shall be exempt from stamp duty, might conveniently be deleted because it would test the sincerity of the person by whom the declaration is made if he had to pay some duty.  I have put it down for the purpose of getting the Minister's opinion on it.  I do think that when people hold these opinions as a number do, though I am not prepared to say that there is a big amount of either lay or medical opinion on this matter, that is evidence of the necessity for a provision of this kind.  If people hold these views some provision should be made to cater for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I understood from the Parliamentary Secretary that he thought that generally the medical profession believed in vaccination against smallpox and in immunisation against diphtheria.  I think that is generally the case but there is a section of medical opinion which stresses the case in regard to vaccination much more than in regard to the case of diphtheria.  The problem of diphtheria is a complicated one and has shown certain aspects in different districts that are not quite fully appreciated as yet by the medical profession.  The figures quoted by the Minister in regard to deaths show that as between 1940 and 1944 the deaths have increased considerably, from something like 178 to something like 288.  I wonder if there is any particular explanation for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary provided us earlier in the year with the figures in regard to the number of persons immunised in the various county health districts and the number of cases reported in these districts. These figures would refer to the whole country outside the county boroughs.  The figures show that, in 1939, the number of persons immunised against diphtheria in the county health districts totalled 14,353, and the number of cases reported was 821; for 1940 the number of persons immunised was 15,460 and the number of cases reported 762; for 1941 the number of persons immunised was 58,646 and the number reported was 621; for 1942 the <Col N="781" /> number of persons immunised was 43,799 and the number of cases reported 1,191; in 1943 the number of persons immunised was 62,982 and the number of cases reported was 2,112; and in 1944 the number of persons immunised was 43,551 and the number of cases reported 2,611.  There are indications that, as immunisation has been carried out in rural districts, the number of cases of diphtheria has tended to rise.  That has been rather marked in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>There is also the position reported in the journal of the Medical Association for January last, by Dr. R. A. Q. O'Meara, who, in an article on diphtheria, with special reference to this country, writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Diphtheria in Eire, and more especially in Dublin, is a disease of many problems and absorbing interest.  Its most striking features are the relative failure of modern diphtheria antitoxin to cope with the severer forms of toxaemia frequently encountered in cases occurring in the city and the comparatively poor results which have been obtained in prevention by the use of current diphtheria prophylactics.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This question has been investigated for Dublin by Gaffney (1943) who finds that in some years the prophylactic influence of artificial immunisation is of a low order.  Thus in some years the protection afforded by immunisation is such that the chances of an immunised child contracting the disease are only reduced to one in three whereas in other years they may be reduced to as little as one in ten.  There is not much doubt, however, that the use of prophylactics lowers substantially the fatality-rate in those who contract the disease following immunisation and for this reason, if for no other, the administration of diphtheria prophylactics is justified.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position shown by Dr. O'Meara from this point of view and the experience in rural districts, would show that the case for immunisation against diphtheria in a widespread way has not been proved at all as clearly as <Col N="782" /> the case appears to have been proved for vaccination against smallpox. Those who object to vaccination are able to mobilise a particular kind of case against vaccination and they are even able to have the support of a very considerable non-political and political opinion that has a kind of medical halo around it.  If people are able to do that with regard to vaccination, there is under present circumstances a lot more material on which people who object to immunisation against diphtheria might make a case.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be very sensible to understand that there are people who take a conscientious line upon these matters and I think he should make some arrangement by which there would be some kind of a court of appeal, or some means by which people who genuinely object to treatment of this kind would be able to state their conscientious objections and have them respected.</P>

      <P>There is not much more that I can usefully say on this very interesting subject.  Deputy Mulcahy in relating the immunisation figures to the number of notifications is liable, I think, to reach unsound conclusions. The figures for immunisation will rise as a consequence of the spread of diphtheria for the reason that an epidemic generally has made considerable headway in an area before immunisation schemes are initiated.  It is because of the fact that diphtheria is spreading in various areas that there is an intensification of immunisation.  In that way the immunisation and the incidence figures are sometimes misleading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of serum potency and the potency of prophylactics, as Deputies will appreciate, this is a highly technical matter.  All I need say at this stage is that we have had more than one conference in the Department on that very matter, and that Professor O'Meara himself participated in these conferences, in association with a number of other medical scientists in and around <Col N="783" /> Dublin, and indeed from as far away as Cork, who have particular knowledge of this problem.  We have got, as a result of that, the joint advice of these medical scientists as to the best prophylactic in present circumstances which we can use, the intervals between the doses, the amount of the dose and so on.  There is a difference of opinion even amongst the scientists on these matters&mdash;on the finer points, but not on the general principle of the propriety or desirability of carrying out immunisation, but on such other technical aspects as the particular agent which ought to be used, the interval which ought to elapse between the doses, the number of doses which ought to be given, the size of the dose and so on.  All I can say on that is that the best advice, in addition to the advice available to the Minister through the medical personnel of his Department, from medical scientists in this country has been secured, and consequently we may hope for the best results possible within certain limitations.</P>
      <P>On the particular point raised in Deputy Cosgrave's amendment, I thought it referred to treatment rather than immunisation.  The section of the community about whom Deputies are concerning themselves in these amendments have made their case to the Minister, and as a result of their presentation of their viewpoint, which is, that it is a matter of conscience, amendment No. 122 to Section 29 was introduced.  That amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 17, to insert before paragraph (j) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(j)  medical or surgical treatment shall not be given to the patient in such hospital or other place without the consent of the appropriate person,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt that, having fully considered the views of these conscientious objectors, there was a strong case in so far as compulsory treatment is concerned, but I felt that I could not concede the case so far as trying to prevent the disease is concerned, which is a different matter.  Immunisation is for the purpose of preventing the disease <Col N="784" /> and consequently there is more at stake than the individual concerned. There is the community and the danger to the community if people contract this disease and pass it on to other people and refuse to co-operate in the preventative measures which can be carried out.  I thought we had disposed of that problem when we had conceded to them that, while in the interest of the community we would ask them to submit to protective measures, we would not claim any right to enforce treatment upon them, either of a medical or surgical nature, without their consent.  That is the position.  I think it is not an unreasonable position and we might nearly all stand together on it.</P>

      <P>I think that is what the Parliamentary Secretary implies.  If it misrepresents him, I think we ought to get a little clarity as to the processes of immunisation and in respect of what diseases the Parliamentary Secretary stands for taking compulsory power to immunise.  The Parliamentary Secretary implies that he wants compulsory powers of immunisation and that he will not recognise that conscientious objectors may object to it.  He looks for powers to persist in carrying out the process of immunisation on people who may have conscientious objections to being so treated.  What are the diseases in respect of which he demands such powers against every person in the country?</P>

      <P>The Deputy must see clearly that I cannot bind myself to any set number of diseases in advance of the knowledge of how medical science may advance in these matters while responsibility rests upon me. Immunisation against diphtheria was not in general operation not so very <Col N="785" /> many years ago and protective measures against typhoid are of comparatively recent discovery.  The future may provide us with protective measures against other diseases.  If Deputy Mulcahy seeks to bind me in such a way that, if medical science should make such discovery or such advance, I will not be able to avail of it without coming to the House, I am not prepared to concede it.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that, not so many years ago, a few cases occurred which caused considerable public alarm and, flowing from that public alarm, created a certain amount of apprehension in the minds of the parents in the whole matter of immunisation.  To my mind, it is one of the things which might be considered as a ground for a parent having a conscientious objection to this process being inflicted on his child.  There have been notorious cases of mistakes and there have been deaths, both in this country and elsewhere.  Apart altogether from that aspect, the figures which the Parliamentary Secretary has given just now indicate that, despite the increasing numbers of children who are being immunised, we are getting an increased outbreak of diphtheria year after year.  The figures are going up steadily.  As a layman, I cannot follow that and think it should be in the reverse order.  Incidentally, I understand that the deaths per 100,000 of the population are showing a steady increase in the case of diphtheria. It may be very small, but nevertheless there is an increase.  I believe these factors should be taken into consideration while we are on this question of conscientious objectors.</P>

      <P>I think the House will agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that, in this matter of immunisation, we are not considering only the views, the feelings and the rights of the individuals concerned but also those of the entire community.  Immunisation is designed to protect not only the person <Col N="787" /> immunised but the entire community. Even taking that view, however, we must admit that there is a reasonable ground for providing for the conscientious objector.  When conscription was introduced into Great Britain at a time of national danger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in almost the same position.  The object of conscription was to safeguard the whole community, yet in the Conscription Acts provision was made for the conscientious objector.  In a matter of such grave importance to the entire community as compulsory military service, it was found desirable to allow for the conscientious objector.  Surely, in a matter of this kind there is an equal right to the individual to object on conscience grounds, if he so desires? I am not suggesting that there should be an easy way out for anybody or that exemption should be made particularly easy, but I think it should be possible to find a means by which a person who feels very strongly on this matter could obtain exemption.</P>
      <P>Recently, a decision was taken to confer the Freedom of the City of Dublin upon an English writer named Shaw.  I can envisage the feelings of that particular individual if he were submitted to inoculation or immunisation. I know that he has expressed his views frequently very strongly on this matter and I am sure there are other people in this and other countries who feel equally strongly.  Such people should be allowed their right to obtain exemption on reasonable grounds.  I do not think it would be in the interests of public health that people who feel very strongly on a matter of this kind should be made, by this statute, into martyrs and thus, perhaps, help to build up public opinion against this particular form of treatment.</P>

There is a discretion in the court to inflict imprisonment, or both fine and imprisonment.

    <P>&ldquo;If any person wilfully neglects or <Col N="791" /> refuses to obey or carry out, or obstructs the execution of, any regulation. . . he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £100, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty not exceeding £50 for every day during which the offence continues. . .&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 120:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (8).</P>
      <P>Sub-section (8) seems to me to be entirely too drastic in its proposals. The sub-section provides that where-ever the Act makes specific provision for special precautions, regulations can still be made dealing with the same subject-matter as the section.  I do not understand the necessity for that.  If the Act requires special precautions to be taken, why should it be necessary to enable the Minister to make regulations dealing with the same subject-matter?  I do not know whether sub-section (8) can be related to sub-section (2) of Section 19 of this Part of the Bill.  I had an amendment down which, unfortunately, I was not present to move, with the view of ascertaining what was the necessity for the provision in sub-section (2) of Section 19.  Perhaps I should refer to sub-section (1) as covering the same point.  That sub-section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who knows that he is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease shall, in addition to taking the precautions specifically provided for by or under this Part of this Act, take every other reasonable precaution to prevent his infecting others with such disease by his presence or conduct or by means of any article with which he has been in contact.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wanted to point out on that amendment, and I think it is tied up with the present amendment, that if the House, on the recommendation of the Minister, provides in this Bill for the taking of special precautions, and if <Col N="792" /> there are regulations also providing for other precautions, then apparently the unfortunate citizen has himself to discover something else that the Minister and the House has not discovered and he has to take that other precaution or be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I object to sub-section (8).  These are very drastic provisions.  The individual who is supposed to carry out the law must know what he has to do.  The views of medical men change from day to day. I am not casting any reflection on the medical profession by saying that. They would be a very poor profession if they did not have the courage to change their views from day to day. What is fashionable one moment, what is believed to be scientific truth one day, may be disproved&mdash;I will not say debunked&mdash;perhaps in a few years. What is the position of the unfortunate layman, the unfortunate citizen who has under penalty to do what the Act says, to do what the regulations say, and who has to find out for himself some other precautions?  I think there ought to be some limit in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to talk on it until the cows come home.  I want the position to be remedied in the Bill.  Perhaps I might use the jurisprudential cliché that we learned as students&mdash;that it is better for the law to be certain than just.  This Bill provides everything possible to enable the Department to catch unfortunate citizens.  Apart from the fact that its provisions are drastic, this legislation is not going to succeed by its enforcement in the criminal courts.  If this legislation has to be enforced in the courts, it will be an abject failure. There will be no success for those portions of the Bill when it becomes an Act which many people believe to <Col N="793" /> be an essential for the public health of the community unless public opinion is solidly behind its enforcement.  If the provisions are such as not to commend themselves to the citizens, then, rightly or wrongly, you will not get behind it the public opinion that is necessary and essential.</P>
      <P>Criminal law will never enforce legislation of this kind.  Every case brought before the criminal courts in an endeavour to enforce it is, in my view, a milestone in the direction of its failure.  Public opinion must be informed and educated, not coerced. That is the point of most of my amendments. We are in favour, on this side of the House, of the necessity for taking adequate and proper and reasonable precautions to safeguard the public health, but we think that can best be achieved by the education and the informing of public opinion and getting public opinion behind the people who are endeavouring to secure the maintenance and the improvement of the public health.</P>
      <P>I think the introduction of the criminal law into every line of every section of this Bill will secure the failure of the Bill if the Parliamentary Secretary persists in the attitude he has taken and if, for the enforcement of the Bill, it is necessary to clutter up the criminal courts with prosecutions then, even though this may be the law of the land, you may as well resign yourselves to the fact that it will never be really enforced, or, if enforced, it will not be enforced with the goodwill of the people.</P>

I think it would be a great pity if, after the way in which Deputy Costello, with all his knowledge and experience, with his general approach to the work of this House as well as his knowledge of the courts, has spoken that we were to pass the Bill without any reconsideration of all that by the Parliamentary Secretary.

There is a reference in sub-section (3), paragraph (b), to &ldquo;specified officers of that Minister&rdquo;, the Minister being the Minister for Justice.  I take it that officers of the Minister for Justice would mean members of the Gárda Síochána.  The point that I want to put is this, that in the House recently I heard the Minister for Justice disclaim that the members of the Gárda Síochána were his officers.  He said that they were under the direct control of the Commissioner, and that all that he could do in the matter that was under discussion at the time would be to make a recommendation.

      <P>(5)  Where a school medical officer finds, on inspection of a child, that the child is verminous, he shall so inform the district medical officer for the district in which the child resides.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading I think I made a convincing case as to why steps were necessary to deal with the problem of infestation, and the particular dangers arising out of it. The provisions relating to infestation were contained in Section 21 and submitted to the House.  Already, we have transposed portions of Section 21, which deals with infectious diseases, <Col N="797" /> into Section 19, and I am now presenting to the House a new section which is confined to infestation, and which reduces infestation, for the purposes of this Bill, to the types of body lice that are set out in sub-section (9).  Infestation, in the original section, had a much wider meaning.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading, Deputies were very critical of the possible uses that might be made of the powers sought in the original Section 21 because of the wide meaning of infestation as it there appeared.  Consequently, we have come down in this new section to the particular type of infestation that is looked upon as a potential danger to the community at the present time.

      <P>The Financial Resolution is being moved because it might appear that the contribution which a licensee will be required to pay towards the expenses of the administration of the public services relating to forestry under a contributing condition attached to a limited felling licence granted under Section 40 of the Forestry Bill represents a form of levy imposed on the people or on a section of the people.  The Forestry Act, 1928, established the principle that an owner of trees had an obligation in respect of those trees to the community, and that if he desired to fell the trees he should be required to discharge his obligation to the community in respect of them by expending part of the profits of the sale of the timber felled by him on the establishment of a new plantation under a replanting condition attached to a felling licence granted to him under the Act.  Section <Col N="799" /> 42 of the Forestry Bill is concerned with the discharge of the obligation of an owner of trees to the community in cases where it would be impracticable or unreasonable to require the owner to establish a fresh plantation, by attaching a replanting condition to a limited felling licence granted to him under Section 40.  Section 42 proposes to do this by requiring the licensee to pay a contribution towards the expenses of the public services relating to forestry.  The contribution will be assessed by the Minister for Lands, who will have regard to the costs which would have devolved upon the licensee in the fulfilment of replanting conditions attached to his limited felling licence, if the attachment of such conditions to the licence were practicable and reasonable and if the Minister had, in fact, so attached conditions to the licence.</P>
      <P>The contribution which will be so exacted is not, strictly speaking, a levy, and the power which Section 42 will give to the Minister for Lands to attach a contributing condition to a licence will, even in some cases, be utilised to the advantage of the licensee.  For instance, in a case where a person is desirous of clearing trees from certain land with a view to utilising the land for other purposes, and where the Minister is satisfied that the use of the land for such other purposes is reasonable and should be permitted, then the Minister will attach a contributing condition to the licence instead of attaching thereto replanting conditions which would be objectionable to the licensee.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There are two ways of serving it: one by personal service and the other by post.  There are certain cases where persons might not be available and the Land Commission might not be able to reach them.  Apart from that, however, the notice must be inserted in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> and I think that that is also the best way of giving notice, since <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> will be in the hands of solicitors, land agents, and so on. Accordingly, I think that that is the best way of conveying the information to a person in a particular locality&mdash; at least, it can be conveyed to him in that way through the land agent or his solicitor, in case the person concerned might not be there at the moment.</P>

A document of this kind should be brought to the notice of the agent or of the landlord's representative.  The amendment is a reasonable one, and I suggest to the Minister that he should accept it, so that there would be publication locally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1928 Act provided that proceedings for offences there under should be instituted only with the consent of the Minister personally. Sub-section (1) of this section provides that proceedings under the Bill may be instituted with the consent of the Minister personally or of any officer of the Department, not below the rank of an assistant secretary, nominated by the Minister for the purpose.  The object of the change is to obviate the necessity of specific approval by the Minister of the institution of proceedings for trivial offences.  Sub-section (3) provides that the normal statutory limit of six months for the institution of summary proceedings for offences of the type which arise under this Bill shall be extended to 12 months for the purposes of the Bill.  In the administration of the 1928 Act, the application of the six-months' limit, settled by Section 10 of the Petty Sessions <Col N="803" /> (Ireland) Act, 1851, had been a source of difficulty, as offences in relation to the illegal felling of timber did not come to the notice of the Department for some time after their commission, and it has frequently happened that time did not permit of the institution of proceedings in such cases.</P>

      <P>When speaking on the Second Stage the Minister said that he was quite satisfied that his present advisers on forestry knew all about it, as they were experts.  For that reason he did not think it necessary to get expert advice from outside the country. It was then suggested by two or three Deputies that it might be advisable to bring in experts from outside who specialised in forestry work to assist members of the consultative committee. I should like to know if the Minister gave any consideration to that suggestion, so that there might be a more go-ahead and thoroughgoing forestry policy here.</P>

      <P>I think we have the best advice that it is possible to have in the Department.  We already had the advice of an outside expert, and that advice, and the work he did, are practically the advice that we now get from our forestry expert.  The work they are doing is exactly the work he did, and that he proposed to do.  There may, possibly, be changes as the years go on, but, at present, there is no need for any outside advice, because our <Col N="804" /> experts are competent people, and are fully abreast of research work in other parts of the world.</P>

      <P>The war has created a new problem, inasmuch as a great deal of timber has been cut down, and there is a new problem of restocking to make up for the wastage of war.  I agree with the Minister that those who are advising him in the Forestry Department know as much about the subject as any experts from outside. I believe they are very competent men, but, nevertheless, in view of the situation which now exists in this country, it might be advisable to bring in some outside expert who has probably more experience than the Minister's advisers in making good the depredations of war and making up for the wastage created by the cutting down of so much timber during the emergency.  I imagine that is a new problem and, for that reason, probably the Minister would require views other than those of the men whose advice he is so accustomed to getting, weekly or monthly, or whenever he seeks it.  I suggest there is a problem in which the knowledge and experience of outside experts could be utilised with considerable advantage to the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 12, before the word &ldquo;enter&rdquo; to insert the following words &ldquo;with the consent of the owner, the tenant purchaser or purchaser or his agent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) is very wide and very drastic.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Any authorised officer may enter on and survey any land for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is <Col N="805" /> suitable for afforestation or for the purpose of inspecting any timber thereon or for any other purpose in connection with the exercise of the powers of the Minister under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are the powers that the Minister requires in respect of land other than power to inspect as to its suitability for afforestation?  I should like to hear from the Minister why he wants to have land inspected as to the timber that may be on it.  I take it the timber is the property of the man who owns the land.  I do not see why the inspector should be allowed to go in on a man's land whenever he likes. This sub-section should be reconstructed and modified.  Really what is happening in this country is that we are being inspected to death.  Every Department of State may have at one place three, four or five inspectors on the same morning.  The House should de-limit these powers to some extent. If the Minister gets power to inspect land to see whether or not it is suitable for afforestation, that is all he requires.  With regard to the cutting down of timber, that is already provided for in other parts of this Bill and in the existing law.  It cannot be cut down without a licence from the Minister.  I do not see what power the Minister requires other than power to inspect as to suitability for planting. This sub-section is far too wide.  It should be de-limited and, if necessary, there should be a provision that they could not enter on the land without the consent of the owner.  Sub-section (2) says that the authorised officer will produce his authority.  Of course he will.  That is quite a simple thing.  You could give him authority to raid a man's house.  Give him a letter of authority and all he has to do is to produce it.  These authorities with regard to interfering with people's rights and people's property should be restricted as far as possible.  We should have some respect for the old maxim of the common law that a man's home was his castle, and so was his land, and that any man who put his foot on it was a trespasser without legal right.  The Minister wants legal rights to the extent of inspecting as to <Col N="806" /> whether land is suitable for afforestation or not but I think there the Minister's requirements end for all practicable purposes.  We should hold the rein a bit tighter on this business of letting loose inspectors with absolute powers to do this, that and the other thing, to enter when and where and at any time they like.  I think the sub-section is very wide and drastic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as little inclined as the Deputy is to infringe on any man's right or on his property, but this power already exists in the 1919 Act.  This Bill, as I pointed out to the Deputies before, is a consolidating Act, which takes up the 1919 Act and the 1928 Act and gets them into one statute.  If this amendment were accepted it would be just as well to have the clause out of the Bill altogether.  For instance, you want these powers in various ways.  During the emergency it was found very necessary to make a general survey of all the woodlands of the country for the purpose of ascertaining what was the amount of commercial timber and timber suitable for firewood and other purposes in the country.  That meant an inspection both of private woodlands and of State woodlands.  It was not at all unreasonable, as a matter of fact, it was quite necessary, and such necessity might arise again.  We are looking for nothing new.  We already had the power in the 1919 Act.  We merely want to continue the power for such purposes as might arise and as arose under the survey of the Irish woodlands during the emergency. There is no desire to infringe on the liberty or the property of the individual.</P>

    <P>The acquisition of a considerable portion of land might involve a very considerable sum of money in some of these cases, because I take it the Department are going in rather extensively for afforestation and propose to take considerable tracts of land in some places.  Perhaps that land may be reasonably good.  Perhaps it is land that, with hard work and industrious use of it, would make reasonable arable land.  The question of value would therefore arise and a considerable amount of money might be involved. In that case, if there were a dispute between the Department and the owner of the land it would be wise that an opportunity should be given to the owner to appeal to the High Court.  He could take advantage of that or not take advantage of it as he liked, but he could not say afterwards that the Minister had held both ends of the stick; that he was tied down and that justice was not done. A man from whom land was taken might feel that it was arbitrarily taken and that he had not got justice owing to the fact that the Minister was one of the parties to the matter at issue and that officials of the Department were adjudicating on the matter.</P>

      <P>Under the Land Purchase Acts there is no appeal whatever from a decision of the appeal tribunal on questions of fact.  On points of law, where the judicial commissioner is supreme over the lay commissioners, there is an appeal to the Supreme Court, not to the High Court. Deputy McMenamin made a statement which I think it would be wise to answer, that is in regard to prejudged cases coming before the lay commissioners. The lay commissioners acting on the appeal tribunal have no pre-knowledge of any case which comes before them.  The lay commissioners on the appeal tribunal have no knowledge of any case that is appealable. <Col N="811" /> They come to the case when they are on the appeal tribunal with the same lack of knowledge of the parties or anything else as a judge in the law courts.  That being so, if Deputies will realise it and understand it and make it clear to the public, there can be no idea that the case is being prejudged by people who have full knowledge of both sides of it before they hear it in court.  There is no appeal to the High Court and it would seem to me to be very peculiar that a decision by a judge of the High Court should be appealed again to his own court.  It would not make sense.</P>

      <P>I would rather that the Minister would not mention the things that took place under the Land Acts.  I have recited in this House cases that occurred ten or 12 years ago.  I do not want to refer to them again.  They are too disgusting to think about them.  One could not imagine that in any country such an injustice could be perpetrated under the law as occurred in connection with the fixing of the price of land under the Land Acts in this country.  The thing was most appalling.  If it occurred under the old landlord system, I suppose there would be a regular war.  I would rather that these things should not be referred to.  We know the atrocious things that happened and the robbery which took place in connection with the fixing of the price of land under the Land Acts. Poor people were treated in a monstrous way.  I would not like any of these things to occur again.  It may have been thought when the Land Acts were going through that these things would not occur, but we know now that they did, in fact, occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House should take precautions to ensure that a thing like that will not be repeated in this Department, which is a branch of the same Department. The Minister talks about the commissioners approaching those cases with impartial minds.  I know that.  I know that they are able men and men of the highest integrity.  What I said was that the law should not only be just but should give the appearance of justice.  I know those men well.  They <Col N="812" /> are men to whom I would entrust my own case but I am not the poor man down the country whose land is being taken.  He sees things in a different light.  His geese are all swans.  This particular piece of land is the apple of his eye, though it may be of very poor quality.  For hundreds of years, the place has been in possession of his ancestors who toiled and sweated on it.  If that man's land is taken, he should be awarded such a price as will convince him that justice has been done.</P>

      <P>We had the case of a farm in Westmeath.  The estate duty authorities valued the farm at £7,000.  Estate duty on that amount was collected, the owner having died and left a widow and one child.  The widow endeavoured to work the farm for some years.  Ultimately, she was driven to auction it.  At the auction £3,500 was offered for it and she refused to accept it.  The Land Commission acquired the land and gave her a £5 note.  Does the Minister know nothing about that case?  Did he ever hear about it, or does he think that such a thing should happen in the Department of which he is now the head?</P>

      <P>On the section, the Minister is taking power not merely to acquire land but to acquire timber. While the appeal tribunal and the Land Commission staff may be very good judges of land, I do not think that even the Minister would claim that they were expert judges of the value of timber.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister.  There are very few men who would regard themselves as experts respecting the value of timber.  I doubt very much if even those men who are engaged in the trade would claim that they were experts in this respect. I am not aware that the Land Commission staff get any special training which would fit them to value timber in the modern way.  They will have to fix not alone the price of land but the price of timber, if timber is purchased instead of land.  In these circumstances, there should be some discrimination <Col N="814" /> between the present functions of the Land Commission and the appeal tribunal and their functions in relation to the acquisition of timber under this measure.  Some provision should be made for the individual who may feel that he has been unjustly treated in regard to the value placed on timber acquired by the Forestry Department. The value of timber is a matter which is really outside the scope of the knowledge of the appeal tribunal.  I admit that they are specialists regarding the acquisition and value of land but I do not think that the Minister would have the hardihood to stand up and say they were expert also in their knowledge of the value of timber.  For that reason, I say there is a difference between the functions of the lay commissioners in relation to the acquisition of land and the functions of the lay commissioners in relation to the acquisition and valuing of timber acquired under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I think that there is some point in the case made by Deputy McMenamin that, where timber is purchased, the person concerned should have a right of appeal to some other tribunal than the appeal tribunal for the purpose of ascertaining whether the price placed on the timber represents its real value or not.  I do think that the Minister should, in fairness to these people, consider the amendment moved by Deputy McMenamin and see if something cannot be done to ensure that fair play will be meted out to those people from whom timber is acquired. I am satisfied that, as the Bill stands, they have a legitimate grievance.  I am not satisfied, and I do not think that any member of the House is satisfied, that the appeal tribunal is as expert in its knowledge of the value of timber as it is in its knowledge of the value of land.</P>

I do not think that the Deputy <Col N="815" /> need be unduly worried about this section, because I know of no case, so far, in which the Forestry Department has acquired forests or timber in any quantity on land.  The type of land we are purchasing is plantable, mountain land, which has no timber at all.  The difficulty the Deputy foresees has never arisen and is not likely to arise.  The buyer and seller of timber know its exact value.  People used to timber know its exact value.  The question does not arise at the moment, because the price of timber is fixed.  Ordinarily, it should never arise.</P>

      <P>That is the point I was going to put to the Minister, that wherever the Forestry Department propose to acquire any land on which there is any considerable quantity of timber, the owner of the land should get leave to sell the timber before it is acquired by the Department.  The Minister gives me to understand that is the usual practice, and I think that is the proper practice.  The owner should be allowed to dispose of the timber before the land is acquired by the Department.</P>

You have people who are in a sense subject to him, his officials, passing judgment <Col N="816" /> on these matters.

    <P>(5)  Where the grantee under an order made under sub-section (1) of this section constructs a road over the portion of land over which the right of way granted by the order is exercisable, the occupier or owner of such land may, within one month after the expiration of the period during which the right is exercisable, serve on the said grantee a notice requiring him to remove from such portion the materials used for the construction of such road, and thereupon the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the said grantee shall, not later than one month after the service of the notice, remove the said materials,</P>
    <P>(b)  if the said grantee fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this sub-section, the occupier or owner may remove the said materials and, in that case, may recover from the said grantee as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction the expenses incurred by him in such removal.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where the land, over which a right of way is granted by an order under sub-section (1) of this section, is registered under the Act of 1891, the Minister shall send a copy of the order to the registering authority under the Act of 1891 and the said registering authority shall register the said right of way as a burden affecting the said land.</P>
    <P>(7)  No stamp duty shall be payable on any order under sub-section (1) of this section, nor shall any fees be payable in respect of any proceedings in the Land Registry under sub-section (6) of this section.</P>
    <P>The principal change in this section which it is proposed to insert is that, instead of the Minister making orders under the section, the orders will be made by the lay commissioners, and the Minister will not come into the picture unless he happens to be a person requiring facilities for the haulage of timber.  There may be people other <Col N="825" /> than the Minister, private individuals, seeking haulage facilities, and that is the reason for the change.  The change is designed to bring the section into alignment with the other sections, and particularly Section 21 which is concerned with the creation of permanent rights of way appurtenant to State forests over adjoining lands.</P>

      <P>Why does the Minister impose on the grantee the duty set out in sub-section (5) with regard to requiring a grantee to remove a road which has been constructed? If he does not remove it, he can be sued and the expenses incurred in removing it recovered as a simple contract debt.  It is very strange that a man should be asked to remove a road.  It may be a very difficult job, if the road has been constructed of stones and then macadamised.  It might involve a heavy cost and if the Forestry Department are to exercise powers to assert rights over land, they should accept responsibility for the road as well.  An obligation of this kind should not be imposed on a man. It might take him a very long time to do it and he might not be in a position to do it at all, if he had not a horse and cart.  A man might have no money to employ labour and could not do the job himself because of the necessity <Col N="826" /> to attend to his own farm work. If the Minister proposes to assert rights over land, he should accept the liabilities, and this would be a very small liability.</P>

      <P>I regard this sub-section as desirable.  I take an entirely different view from that taken by Deputy McMenamin.  This sub-section compels the Forestry Department, or whomever gets a right-of-way across a person's land, to remove a roadway immediately their term of use has expired. I think it is desirable, because otherwise there will be disused roadways across land which would be an obstruction and an injury to the landholder.  That is my understanding of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan is right. The point is that we acquire haulage facilities over a man's land and put down a roadway.  When we are finished, the Forestry Department has to put the land back into its original condition.  If the owner of the land wants to have the roadway, he may have it, but, if he does not want it, the land must be put back in its original condition.  It seems to me to be quite reasonable.</P>

      <P>It is, with regard to the Forestry Department, but what about the grantee?  Suppose a grantee has to make a road and take it up again, what is the position?  The Minister knows what can happen to a road in bad weather.  Many tons of stones may be put on the road, and they sink down and down, and no money could put the land back into condition again.  It would require a fortune to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion is that it would impose an impossible burden on the grantee.  There could be roads laid down with rough timber, with rails such as a contractor uses on virgin soil where he is working on a scheme of houses and the subsoil is soft.  He throws a few logs across and puts the rails on them.  It would be simple enough <Col N="827" /> lifting that type of road&mdash;it would come under the heading of a road as well&mdash;but everyone knows that where carts are going across soft virgin soil it is physically impossible to put that soil back in its original condition. There may be common sense used on this point and the grantee may not want the land brought back into the same position as it was in before.  I can see the impossibility of restoring it to its former position, though I suppose he could put some soil over the road and submerge it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (b) requires a person to furnish, &ldquo;if he has any such interest, an abstract (with copies of all abstracted documents) of his title to that interest.&rdquo;  Of course, if he does not do that, he is subject to a penalty of £20, whether he has any interest in the land or not.  Why take that power in regard <Col N="830" /> to a person who has no interest in the land?  If you serve a notice on somebody and he says he has no interest in the land and is not going to submit an abstract of title because he has no interest, why should he be fined £20? Nothing could be more ridiculous.  The man may say he will not bother going to a solicitor to get an abstract of title, because he has nothing to do with it. The Minister is going to prosecute and convict that man and the penalty is a fine not exceeding £20.  Notice may be served on someone who has nothing to do with the property.  He will, of course, be convicted if he does not return an abstract.  That is provided in the sub-section.  Surely, it is ridiculous to take that power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point is to make certain of title.  Where there are many interests involved, it is foolish to ignore any of them.  The acceptance of the amendment would negative generally the provisions of Section 22. This is intended to enable the Minister to ascertain the persons entitled to an interest in land which he considers it desirable to acquire.  The machinery is based on the assumption that the Minister will be able, by the exercise of his powers of requisition under Section 22, to ascertain the names of all persons entitled to an interest in the land which he proposes to acquire compulsorily and the extent of the interest of each particular individual in the land.  It is not the man who has no claim and does not suggest he has a claim that we are trying to get to clarify his position; it is those people who are claiming interest in land, who may at any time claim interest in the land, and there is no particular grievance on their part because they will be paid for any expenses they go to in regard to the matter.  I think it is only fiar, because it is to make titles certain, so that, when the agreements are signed, there shall not be any difficulty afterwards through some person saying he had an interest and was not consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very peculiar kind of section.  It seems to be a strange type of procedure to make application to a number of <Col N="831" /> people who are suspected of having rights in certain land which the Minister proposes to acquire and, if they fail to supply him with the necessary information, he proceeds to penalise them or fine them, actually. I do not think there is a precedent for that.  I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me to be a peculiar type of procedure to adopt.  In the ordinary case, where you try to find out who has claims on property, the usual procedure is to advertise and allow claimants to come forward.  If they fail to do so, they suffer a certain loss.  I have never heard of such a procedure as this in which you fine people for failing to come forward to make their claims.  I should like to know if there is a precedent for it.</P>

      <P>It says here &ldquo;any person, who appears to&rdquo; the Minister. How is the Minister to know?  What steps will he take to find out those people who may appear to him?  I can see in paragraph (a) that a person is simply asked to make &ldquo;a return in writing&rdquo;.  I suppose if they write and say they have no interest, that finishes the matter and the Minister takes no further action.</P>

      <P>I would hardly read that into it.  I take it that it is a man who will have an interest in the land, but possibly is too careless to return in writing the nature of his interest in that holding and he does not go to the trouble of producing his abstract of title.  Then afterwards he may come to create trouble.  I presume that is what is in the Minister's mind&mdash;that if a man came in such circumstances and desired to upset the whole procedure, he could be fined.  There could be something in that point.  There are some people who are possibly a bit contrary and they do not want to agree to anything.  They might stay away and later kick up some trouble.  In that case I think it would be necessary for the Minister to fine any man who gets a reasonable chance to put forward his claim in a specified time and does not do so.</P>

      <P>Again, it is the question of certainty of title.  Generally, what is purchased for forestry is the mountainy type of land or moorland and much of this land is held in commonage and is generally used for sheep grazing and so on.  It is quite possible certain people have very definite rights, but in commonage many rights are claimed that have no legal basis and many a small farmer on a mountainside who has no actual rights of grazing on the mountain may, if he is a strong-willed individual, muscle-in on the rights of others.  As to the people who have actual rights, these rights must be considered, but as regards the man who has tried to make a right for himself and appears to be using the land for his own purposes, we have to try to ascertain what particular legal right he has.  If that man continues to claim a right on the land and affects adversely the work of the Forestry Department, we are entitled to insist that he will produce a document that entitles him to that right and, if he cannot produce it, if he is recalcitrant, then we are entitled to punish him for a false statement or for making our work impossible.  I think it is a reasonable proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>At first glance this section appears to be very unfair to the person with rights on a mountain but, on reconsideration, I think it may have advantages for such a person, because definitely if you are to carry through a policy of acquisition you must ascertain who are the people who have rights and you must try to ascertain it as quickly as possible.  If you adopted a procedure of penalising persons who fail to make claims by debarring them from compensation you will be imposing a greater hardship upon them.  This section seeks to impose a limited hardship, a fine of £20, so that I think it might be justified on that ground.  I was comparing this procedure adopted here with what might be adopted in regard to a deceased person, when a creditor failing to make a claim would lose his claim.  If the same procedure was adopted in regard to a grazing right, it would be a much more severe penalty than is provided in this section, so I think it is justified on that ground.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will understand the difficulty of farmers protecting rights in commonage, and the section is really directed to ensure that the people who actually have rights of ownership shall be paid and not those who have no such rights.  There is no imposition in the matter because the Minister will pay whatever fees are necessary for the ascertainment of rights.  There is no imposition of a financial disadvantage on any of these people.</P>

      <P>The section is ambiguous in some ways and difficult for the ordinary Deputy to understand.  If the Minister had explained the intention at the back of his mind, it would have saved a good deal of discussion.  I agree with the Minister that people lay claims to a portion of a mountain commonage to which they are not legally entitled.  Every Deputy, and especially Deputies from western constituencies, have experience of that.  I take it the persons who will be asked to submit these particulars will be persons whose names are submitted to the Minister by the local commissioners and who claim they have certain grazing rights.</P>

      <P>Then if a person who claims to have such a right has a notice served on him and he does not reply to that notice, he will be proceeded against and fined according to the procedure laid down in this section.  But it may be also that a notice will be served on a person who never at any time laid claim to rights on a mountain and that individual will be treated exactly in the same way as the man who said he had a claim but, as it subsequently transpired, had no claim whatever.  There is no discrimination exercised between the bogus claimant and the other type of man who has never at any period laid claim to such grazing rights and never in fact used the mountain for grazing purposes.  The section gives the Minister too much power.  I am satisfied the Minister does not want all the power that he is given in the section.  It is his desire to discriminate between the bogus claimant <Col N="834" /> and the innocent person upon whom such notice may be served.  According to the phrasing of this section, the innocent person is going to be treated in exactly the same way as the guilty. I am perfectly certain from what I know of the Minister's conception of justice that he would not desire that to happen.  But, if the procedure laid down here is followed out to the letter, that is exactly what is going to happen, according to my interpretation of the section.</P>

      <P>In the acquisition of land for forestry, there is bound to be a very detailed inspection of the land offered to the Forestry Department as well as a very strict inquiry as regards those who claim rights to the land. Now, surely, any man who has a right to the land will be very glad to assert his right, particularly when he is paid for proving it.  Why should the Forestry Department go to all and sundry, to people who have no rights and who have made no claims?  The only reason for this action is because the people affected have claimed on some basis: on the basis that they have rights.  The people who do claim and who are regarded in some sense as having a claim, consequent on an inspection and an inquiry, are asked to prove their rights at the expense of the Forestry Department.  If a man claims to a right at the time an inquiry is being made, and later fails to submit for the inspection of the Land Commission the documents, etc., which give him that right, then the best way to prevent him from asserting such a right again is by punishing him for making a wrong statement.  There is discrimination in this for the benefit of those people who have actual rights as against those who have no rights.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the section again between this and the Report Stage, and see if he cannot amend it to ensure that no injustice will be done to an innocent person, because, quite conceivably, the <Col N="835" /> Land Commission officials might submit to the Forestry Department the names of persons who never made any claim whatever to rights in this matter. They might be guided by information obtained from local people.  It would be very unfair in such a case that the person concerned should be punished in the manner in which the section prescribes. On the understanding that the Minister will look into the matter to see if he cannot do something to prevent the possibility of such a thing happening, we are prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-sections (2) and (3) and substitute the following two sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister shall, immediately upon making an application for an acquisition order in respect of any land, do the following things:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  publish the prescribed notice of the application in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in one or more newspapers circulating in the locality in which the land is situate, and</P>
      <P>(b)  serve a copy of such notice on the occupier (if any) of the land and on the person who appears to the Minister to be the owner of the land, if it is reasonably practicable to ascertain that person.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where an application for an acquisition order in respect of any land has been made, the lay commissioners shall hear the application, after publishing the prescribed notice of the hearing in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in one or more newspapers circulating in the locality in which the land is situate, and may, subject to the subsequent provisions of this section,&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> (a)  make the order, or</P>
    <P>(b)  make the order with the exclusion therefrom of any specified part of the said land, or</P>
    <P>(c)  refuse the application.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to clear up a number of points of detail in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 23 in regard to the steps to be taken by the Minister in relation to any application made by him for an acquisition order in respect of land and by the lay commissioners preliminary to the hearing of such an application.</P>
    <P>The new sub-section (2) which is proposed for insertion instead of sub-section (2) in the Bill as circulated provides for the publication in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and in local newspapers of notice of an application for an acquisition order, instead merely of providing for the giving of notice in the locality in which the land is situate, a requirement which might be difficult to interpret.  It provides for the service of copies of any notice so published on the occupier and apparent owner of the land, whereas the present sub-section (2) provides for the giving of notice only to the apparent owner.</P>
    <P>The new sub-section (3) differs from the present sub-section (3) in so far as it is specifically stated that the lay commissioners will hear an application for an acquisition order, thus providing an opportunity for representations to them for or against the making of the order; they will publish notice of the hearing of the application in the <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and in local newspapers.</P>

The substituted application of the definition now inserted in Section 12 for the definition contained in sub-section (17) will have the effect of enabling the tenant purchaser or purchaser of land which is vested under the Land Purchase Acts in the Land Commission but not yet revested in such tenant purchaser or purchaser, to act as owner for the purposes of Section 23 although he is not, in fact, the legal owner of the land.  He will thus be entitled to be heard on the hearing of any application or appeal under the section in relation to the land held by him under the Land Purchase Acts, and will be entitled as &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the land to appeal in suitable cases to the appeal tribunal against an acquisition order made by the lay commissioners.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some explanation from the Minister of the meaning of paragraph (a) of sub-section (4) of the section.  It provides that no acquisition order shall be made in respect of any land &ldquo;which, in the opinion of the lay commissioners, is required for the amenity or convenience of a dwellinghouse&rdquo;.  Would the Minister say what is really meant by the words &ldquo;amenity or convenience of a dwellinghouse&rdquo;?  I presume that if a dwellinghouse is allowed to remain on lands which are acquired by the Land Commission it would be regarded as an amenity or convenience, and would include the exemption from acquisition of so much land as would make the holding economic.  This raises a rather difficult question because the land might be suitable for afforestation. If, say, there was a small amount of agricultural land convenient to the dwellinghouse, that small holding would be an uneconomic holding unless there was attached to it a certain amount of grazing land or other land suitable for grazing but which it would be necessary to leave with the holding in order to make it economic.</P>
      <P>The words: &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; or &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; do not seem to be comprehensive enough to cover such a situation. I am referring to a large holding which, perhaps, the Land Commission may have acquired and on which they may have decided to leave the dwellinghouse and also a certain amount of arable land attached to the dwellinghouse.  Suppose, however, that the amount of arable land attached to the dwellinghouse is not sufficient to make the holding an economic holding, would this sub-section compel the Land Commission to leave a sufficient portion of land there to make it into an economic holding?</P>

      <P>Before Section 28 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a vesting Order is made in <Col N="840" /> respect of any land (in this section referred to as the acquired land) which, immediately before the vesting date, was subject, in conjunction with other land, to a State annuity,&mdash;</P>

    <P>(i)  apportion, with effect as on and from the day immediately preceding the vesting date, the State annuity in such manner as the said authority consider proper between the acquired land and such other land,</P>
    <P>(ii)  declare the whole of the State annuity to be exclusively charged, with effect as on and from the day immediately preceding the vesting date, on either the acquired land or such other land.</P>
    <P>The section which this amendment proposes to insert before Section 28 will replace Section 26, which is being deleted from the Bill.  It provides that where a vesting Order has been made by the Minister under Section 27 in respect of any land which before the vesting date was subject in conjunction with other land to a State annuity, the Minister will notify the Land Commission or the Commissioners of Public Works as the case may be, of the making of the vesting Order, and the Land Commission or the Commissioners, whichever body is concerned, will then apportion the State annuity between the acquired land and the other land subject to the annuity, or charge the annuity exclusively on either the acquired land or the other land.  The apportionment or exclusive charge, as the case may be, will have effect as from the date immediately preceding the vesting date and under Section 27 (5) (a) (i) the vesting Order will operate to vest the acquired land in the Minister subject to the State annuity to the extent to which the annuity was apportioned or charged on the acquired land.</P>

      <P>To insert at the end of the section the following two sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  land is vested under the Land Purchase Acts in the proprietor thereof or is vested under the said Acts in the Irish Land Commission but not in the tenant-purchaser or purchaser thereof, and</P>
      <P>(b)  trees growing on such land are reserved to the Irish Land Commission,</P>
      <P>the Irish Land Commission shall be deemed, for the purpose of this part (except Section 44), to be the owner of such land.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  land (not being land to which sub-section (2) of this section applies) is vested under the Land Purchase Acts in the Irish Land Commission, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such land is occupied by a person (being a tenant-purchaser or purchaser) under an agreement for purchase entered into or deemed to have been entered into under the said Acts,</P>
      <P>such person shall be deemed, for the purposes of this part (except Section 44), to be the owner of such land.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to provide for interpretation of the provisions of Section 37 and other sections in Part IV of the Bill in certain special cases in which the Land Commission have an interest in land on which trees are growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first case, dealt with by the new sub-section (2) which it is proposed to insert in Section 35, is that in which the land has come under the Land Purchase Acts and is either still vested in the Land Commission or has been vested in the proprietor thereof but where the trees growing on the land have been reserved to the Land Commission <Col N="842" /> under the terms of the relative purchase agreement.  In such cases it is necessary that the Land Commission should be treated as the owner of the land for the purposes of Sections 37, 39, 40 and 41 of Part IV of the Bill.  It is the Land Commission who should have the power to give a felling notice under Section 37; it is the Land Commission on whom a prohibition Order if any, should be served by the Minister under Section 39, and it is the Land Commission to whom a limited felling licence, if any, should afterwards be granted.  The new sub-section (2) of Section 35 proposed in this amendment will have the effect of providing that the Land Commission shall be deemed to be the owner of land in these special cases and will therefore be dealt with instead of the actual owner of the land for the purpose of the giving of felling notices, etc.</P>
    <P>The new sub-section (3) which it is proposed to insert in Section 35 deals with the case in which special provision is necessary for another party to be deemed to be the owner where the Land Commission, in the absence of such special provision, would have to be treated as the owner.  The case is that in which, there being no question of the reservation of trees to the Land Commission, land is vested under the Land Purchase Acts in the Land Commission and is occupied by a tenant-purchaser or purchaser who will, in due course, be the vested owner of the land, but who, although at the moment the equitable owner, is not the legal owner. It is considered that in such a case the tenant-purchaser or purchaser should have the right to give a felling notice under Section 37, that it is on him a prohibition Order, if any, should be served under Section 39, and it is to him that a limited felling licence, if any, should be granted under Section 40.  Sub-section (3), proposed for insertion in Section 35, will bring about that position.  In the absence of the special provision proposed the Land Commission who would be the legal owner of the land would have to be treated as owner thereof for the purposes of Part IV of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In connection with paragraph (d) of this section, I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that I understand trees, standing on land purchased before the 1st day of April, 1928, where the whole or some part of the purchase money was lent on the security of the holding, when they are within a certain distance from the centre of the road cannot, by agreement with the Department of Defence, be cut down.  If that is so, it seems to be a source of grievance amongst people who own trees.  My information is that a large number of these trees are useless as they stand, but might be used for domestic fuel which is now very scarce, or for commercial purposes.  The Order was issued by the Department of Defence during the war period.  I suggest there is no necessity to continue it now, and that the Minister might see about its removal, so that a licence could be granted to owners of these trees to have them cut down.  I am aware, from information given me by people in the timber trade, that supplies are very limited.  They know where there are large numbers of trees standing but, for the reason stated, they are not allowed to cut them. Before the Bill leaves this House the Minister might do something to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 38 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a felling notice contains a statement that a tree is intended to be uprooted for the purpose of transplantation, it shall not be lawful for any person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to use or deal with the tree or cause or permit the tree to be used or dealt with, if uprooted in pursuance of such notice, for any other purpose, or</P>
      <P>(b)  to cut down the tree or cause or permit the tree to be cut down during the period of two years commencing on the date on which the felling notice was given.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every person who, in respect of any tree, acts in contravention of sub-section (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall, subject to Section 53 of this Act, be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £5 for every such tree.</P>
      <P>Section 38 in the Bill as circulated is intended as a corollary to a provision in sub-section (1) of Section 39 that the Minister may not make a prohibition Order under that sub-section in relation to a tree stated in the relative felling notice to be intended to be uprooted for the purpose of transplantation. The section as it stands in the Bill provides that where it was stated in a felling notice that it was intended to uproot a tree for the purpose of transplantation it will be illegal for any person to use or deal with the tree, if uprooted, in pursuance of the felling notice, for any other purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to replace Section 38 by a new section having the same effect but going further to provide that it will also be illegal, where a felling notice contains a statement that a tree is intended to be uprooted for the purpose of transplantation, to cut down the tree during the period of two years commencing on the date on which the felling notice was given. In the absence of this elaboration of the provision under Section 38 it would <Col N="847" /> be possible to evade the restrictions of Part IV by stating in a felling notice that it was intended to uproot a tree for the purpose of transplantation, whereas in fact the owner of the land had no such intention.  Having given his felling notice and made such a statement therein he would have to wait for 21 days with the full knowledge that in view of his statement the Minister could not make a prohibition Order in respect of the tree; after the lapse of 21 days and until the expiration of a period of two years he would be quite free to cut down the tree without contravening Section 37.  If he uprooted it, Section 38 would bind him to transplant it, but there would be nothing to prevent him from cutting it down.  The amendment of Section 38 as proposed will rectify this position.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 37 provides that any person guilty of an offence under that section, that is, any person who cuts down or uproots a tree without duly lodging a felling notice, will be liable on summary conviction of his offence to a fine not exceeding £5 for every tree which he uproots or cuts down.  It is provided, however, that the liability to a fine not exceeding £5 for every tree will be subject to Section 53 of the Bill which provides that where the commission of an offence under Section 37 was due to a <i>bona fide</i> mistake of fact there is to be a maximum penalty of £100 in respect of the total number of trees concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of Section 39 provides that any person convicted of an offence under that section, that is, any person who illegally cuts down or uproots a tree notwithstanding the fact <Col N="848" /> that a prohibition Order in relation thereto has been served upon him, will also be liable to a fine of £5 for every tree so uprooted or cut down, but in the Bill as circulated it is not provided that the maximum penalty clause in Section 53 shall apply also in this case.

It is the intention that the amount of the contribution to be levied under a contributing condition will be assessed having regard to the expense which the licensee would have had to incur in complying with replanting conditions attached to his licence if the attachment of such conditions had, in the circumstances, been practicable and if the Minister had in fact so attached replanting conditions to the licence.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 44 deals with the right of an owner of land in certain circumstances to require a district planning authority to acquire the land on which a tree, the felling of which the Minister has refused to license on the grounds of preserving amenities, is situate.  The preamble of the sub-section says that where an owner of land so requires a district planning authority to acquire land from him, then, unless his request is withdrawn under sub-section (4) of Section 44, the provisions embodied in paragraphs (a), (b), etc., of sub-section (3) will have effect.  It is not correct to say that the provision in paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) will have effect only &ldquo;unless the requisition is withdrawn&rdquo;; that paragraph must apply whether or not the requisition is withdrawn.  It is therefore proposed in this amendment to delete paragraph (c) of sub-section (3).  Amendment No. 47 provides for the incorporation of the provisions of the paragraph in sub-section (4).</P>

That paragraph has been deleted because the draftsman believed its terms were not satisfactory.  The sub-section will provide for the application, subject to certain conditions, of the machinery of the Public Health Acts 1878-1931, as amended by various other Acts relating to the acquisition of land by sanitary authorities, to the acquisition of land under Section 44 of the Bill by a district planning authority.

It would be better.  There is this about it.  The ordinary farmer as a rule does not keep books or accounts and he may not remember exactly when he made the application and there is a possibility that he may proceed to fell timber before the 21 days have elapsed and thus incur a penalty.

The Land Commission does not send a forester along nor do I expect them to go to that expense.  I assume the Gárda sends a report about the tree to be cut.  If the Gárda has a grudge against me, then I do not get permission to cut the tree.  There is <Col N="855" /> something very week about it.  If you do not get a refusal in 21 days, you can cut.

      <P>Section 49 empowers the Minister, in sub-section (1), to grant to persons who are conducting forestry operations on private lands general felling licences freeing them from the obligation of giving felling notices under Section 37 in relation to the intended felling of individual trees.  Sub-section (2) provides that the Minister may revoke a general felling licence at <Col N="857" /> any time.  This power of revocation is necessary to prevent the wholesale abuse of privilege to which an ill-disposed person might put a general felling licence.  Sub-section (3) provides that there shall be attached to every general felling licence which authorises the felling of trees for the purpose of clearing land with a view to replanting afforestation conditions requiring the licensee to replant the land as contemplated by him.  The purpose of the general felling licence is to convenience those who are conducting forestry operations on estates in accordance with good methods of sylviculture so that they shall not be put to the inconvenience of applying for a felling licence in regard to every tree they cut down.  The question of the revocation is where some ill-disposed person gets such a licence and proceeds to clear the land generally without adopting proper sylvicultural methods.  Sub-section (3) is the replanting condition.</P>

      <P>This section seems to contain entirely new legislation.  An owner of trees is prohibited from cutting any boughs or branches off the trees.  I think this is a piece of legislation which will require some explanation and will also require some publicity <Col N="858" /> because the ordinary person would not regard himself as compelled to make an application for a licence to take a branch off a tree.  This section would place a very severe hardship on owners if they have to make application for a licence in respect of every branch they had to cut.  So far as paragraph (a) is concerned, regarding ring barking or damaging trees, I can well understand that provision.  In some cases it might be done maliciously by trespassers and in other cases the owner of timber might do it in order to get the timber condemned or in order to ensure that the timber would decay so that he would be able to cut it.  That, as I say, might happen in some cases but I think it would be very undesirable to restrict the cutting of branches.  That is an operation that would require to be done from time to time, and I think it should not be interfered with.</P>

This provision is intended to deal with cases where a man cannot get a permit or is not entitled to it and he then proceeds to deal with the tree in such a fashion as to bring it down without actually cutting it&mdash;ringing it or destroying it in some such fashion.  That is really what the section is directed against, not the ordinary cutting of branches.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> (1)  Where the Minister is satisfied that trees or tree plants, growing on any land (in this sub-section referred to as the planted land), are being, or are likely to be, damaged by rabbits or vermin present on any land (in this sub-section referred to as the infested land) in the vicinity of the planted land,&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Minister may serve on the occupier (if any) of the infested land a notice in writing stating&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that trees or tree plants growing on the planted land are being, or are likely to be, damaged by rabbits or vermin present on the infested land, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  that, within three months after such service, either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(A)  such rabbits or vermin should be effectively destroyed, or</P>
    <P>(B)  effective steps should otherwise be taken for the prevention of such damage;</P>
    <P>(b)  if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the infested land is unoccupied, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the infested land being occupied and a notice under paragraph (a) of this sub-section having been served on the occupier thereof, the occupier does not, within three months after such service, either effectively destroy the rabbits or vermin present thereon or otherwise take steps which are, in the opinion of the Minister, feasible and effective for the prevention of damage by the rabbits or vermin to trees or tree plants growing on the planted land,</P>
    <P>the Minister may authorise in writing any person to enter on the infested land and kill and take the rabbits or vermin thereon during any specified period, not exceeding 12 months;</P>
    <P>(c)  the Minister or the person so authorised may recover from the occupier as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction <Col N="861" /> any expenses necessarily and properly incurred under paragraph (b)  of this sub-section.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 58 of the Bill as circulated requires the Minister, before authorising entry on land to destroy rabbits or vermin thereon, to afford the occupier, if any, of the infested land an opportunity of destroying effectively rabbits and vermin, or otherwise of taking steps which are, in the opinion of the Minister, feasible and effective for the prevention of damage by the rabbits or vermin to trees or tree plants growing on planted land in the vicinity.  It has been represented that the condition that the Minister must first give the occupier an opportunity of removing the rabbits, or taking other steps for the prevention of the damage, is not satisfactory, in so far as the word &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; is vague and indefinite.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete sub-section (1) and to insert a new sub-section (1) which is on the same lines as the present sub-section, except that, where the sub-section at present provides for the Minister first giving the occupier an opportunity of removing the rabbits or vermin, or preventing them from causing damage, he is required first to serve on the occupier of the land infested by rabbits or vermin notice giving that occupier three months within which to destroy the rabbits or vermin, or take steps to prevent them causing damage, and he will be empowered to authorise the entry of some other person on the land to destroy the rabbits or vermin only if the occupier fails to take suitable action himself in consequence of the notice served upon him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises the whole problem of vermin and game protection.  The Minister very glibly talks of throwing the onus in this matter on the adjoining land-holders, when it is his plantations and new forest areas that will be the breeding grounds for rabbits, hares and foxes. It is certainly a very audacious power to seek to throw the whole responsibility on the adjoining land owners in the matter of the destruction of vermin. Anybody who knows anything about <Col N="862" /> these matters knows that dealing with rabbits is a very technical matter, and, as a matter of fact, I have never known a farmer who could either trap or snare a rabbit.  I am prepared to have a gamble with the Minister that he could set neither a snare nor a trap that would catch a rabbit.  He will have to get his experts to deal with them if the farmer does not destroy them and he will then charge the farmer the cost of destroying them.</P>
      <P>The Minister will hear more of this. It has been raised previously in relation to game protection, and I know places in my constituency which were planted only a few years ago by the Department and which are regular warrens of the most dangerous form of vermin, that is, foxes.  Nobody can go into them, because, if he does so, he is a trespasser.  The areas are wired in and if a man goes in with dogs to chase the foxes, he is liable to damage the young trees.  The result is that the foxes are in there and can come out at night.  There are gateways on roads leading into these new plantations and drains and streams running through them, and by any of these means hares and rabbits can get into the plantations, and, once inside, they are perfectly safe because nobody can get at them.</P>
      <P>It is inside these planted areas that I see the menace of the propagation of all kinds of vermin, and it will have to be dealt with in some way other than on the drastic basis which the Minister proposes.  If he wants to take power to destroy vermin, let him do so, but let him not impose the liability on the adjoining land owners.  Nobody but an expert can destroy rabbits.  A man must be an expert trapper, expert at setting a snare to destroy them, or it can be done by leaving the places open to young fellows to go in with lamps and greyhounds and have them destroyed in that way.  There are not 12 farmers in the whole of Ireland who could destroy rabbits on their land, if they are there in any substantial numbers, and, as I say, I have never known a farmer who could set a snare for, or trap, a rabbit.  I have never done it myself.  I would never be capable of doing it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is ridiculous that the Minister should seek this power to compel farmers to destroy rabbits on their land, because it cannot be done. It is these new plantations which will be the source of all the trouble.  They will be regular preserves for the breeding of every kind of vermin, apart from rabbits, such as foxes, weasels and badgers, as well as magpies, crows and hawks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the problem the Department will create in the matter of game preservation. It is a very big problem, and will be very big in the future, and some official steps will have to be taken with regard to it.  When the landlords had their houses throughout the country, they kept a head-keeper and under-keepers on the estates to destroy vermin.  Now these people have all disappeared and the Land Commission have taken their place, but the Land Commission has done nothing to destroy vermin.  Within the last week, I notice that steps have been taken in the city to form an organisation to deal with this matter, but, if we are to preserve game, we shall have to take some other active steps, to which the Department of Lands and the Forestry Department will have to be parties and very active parties.  Very substantial sums of money will have to be found for anything that is to be done for the tourists in the matter of preserving game.  These sections raise this whole question, which is not a one-sided one.  The Minister is passing the baby on to the owners of adjoining land, whereas, in fact, his new plantations will be the root of all the trouble. It would be monstrous for the Minister to take powers to throw all the blame on the owners of the land surrounding these new plantations.  If they refuse or neglect to destroy the rabbits and vermin, the Minister is going to get experts to do it.  The experts are <Col N="864" /> available to him, as he has the money to pay for them, but farmers have not the money.  Then he is going to charge the farmer for the cost of destroying the vermin, whereas the vermin have emanated from the plantations.  I would like to see the Minister take up this whole problem, not in a narrow, but in a broad sense, in relation to game preservation.  At the moment, the country is full of vermin of all kinds&mdash;foxes, scald-crows, magpies, and so on.  As a matter of fact, game is being extinguished&mdash;both grouse and partridge&mdash;in parts of the country as a result of this.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us about taking power to shoot deer.  If deer come out of some deer forest like Glenveigh in Donegal, and go roaming about my land, and jump the wire into the Minister's plantation and destroy trees there, I wonder how he expects me to dispose of the deer, which belong to the owner of Glenveigh.  Then we have the other wild animals he refers to, other than hares and rabbits.  I would like to know what they are.  The question of rabbits and hares is only a minor matter, but something will have to be done about the major thing.  Otherwise, there is no use in putting up a huge sum of money to make the country attractive for tourists, as there will be nothing for them.  When a man takes a stretch of river at a very excessive figure and stays at a tourist hotel, and it is dry weather unsuitable for fishing, he likes during those days to go out to shoot, since he cannot go fishing.  Where is the use in getting a gun and ammunition if when he wanders around the moors he never sees a solitary bird? That is absolutely true now.  Those plantations the Minister is planting up and down the country are amongst the greatest enemies of the tourist traffic, as they are destroying game.  I would like to see the Minister dealing with that, but not in the fashion proposed in this and the subsequent section.</P>

      <P>I am in concurrence with much of what Deputy McMenamin has said.  Some parts of the country are badly affected by foxes.  In my native country, there is a big tract of <Col N="865" /> land&mdash;usually hunted by the Duhallow, Limerick, the Black and Tans, Tipperary and West Waterford packs&mdash; where there is country 40 or 50 miles wide and no hunting.  There is any amount of forestry and woods and the foxes are a perfect nuisance.  There is one story of a fox who sits on the windowsill and listens to the wireless at night.  We are in a bad way with foxes and the hunting men do not want to say anything about them.  They are getting too plentiful in that tract of country.  No hunting is done and these vermin should be done away with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Second Stage of the Bill.  This section, in its amended and original forms, gives the Minister power to compel the owners of land adjoining plantations to rid the lands of vermin &mdash;and vermin here includes deer and all kinds of wild animals.  It is a very serious injustice on people with farms adjoining plantations if they have to carry out these drastic provisions.  It is not very easy to clear land of all types of vermin, particularly when it it is adjoining a plantation.  It might be a costly operation.  If a farmer fails to comply with this section, the Minister may send his own agents in on the land and charge the farmer for the cost of destroying the vermin.  In addition, those agents may do considerable damage.  We know it is very easy to exterminate rabbits completely if you set out to destroy the fences in the process; and if the Minister's employees do that there is no provision here for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question raised on the Second Reading was the damage which vermin, protected in the plantations, may do to farmers' poultry and gardens.  There is no provision in the Bill for compensation for such farmers.  I had to make application on behalf of farmers who complained in this respect some years ago and I learned from the Forestry Department that they had no power to provide any compensation for the damage done. We have now a Forestry Bill going through the House and should take steps to provide the Department with power to compensate farmers for any <Col N="866" /> damage done by vermin protected in the forest?</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to have it one way, to impose a penalty on the farmer for raising vermin which damage his plantations, but he cannot have it only one way; he should also compensate the farmer for any damage done by foxes or other vermin protected in the woods.  I am referring particularly to foxes, as there have been very grave complaints in many parts of County Wicklow in regard to this particular damage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this particular question of destruction of vermin, we had tourists and the &ldquo;hunting, shooting and fishing&rdquo; crowd.  I wonder if we are to regard these as vermin.  There is the difficulty in regard to forestry development that we are bound to have certain wild animals protected as a result of the shelter they get in forests. The only provision that can be made against that is the provision of trappers.  I think we must develop the trapping system more adequately.  That would be the best guarantee of compensation for farmers generally.  In view of the fact that there is no compensation to farmers for destruction of vermin which find shelter in forests, it may be well to consider on the Report Stage the views expressed by Deputy Cogan, and I will give the matter consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister anything to say about the destruction in these plantations?  What steps will be taken with regard to the destruction of the foxes that are taking cover in these plantations?  These animals that are swarming all over the country come out of these plantations and this is becoming a serious matter.  Something will have to be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these things usually what is everybody's business is nobody's business. I wish the Minister and other Deputies would express their views.  I know that Deputy Halliden is interested in this matter, and I should like to hear an expression of opinion from him. He is deeply interested in this subject and knows all about it, not only from a local point of view, but because of <Col N="867" /> the information he may obtain from all over the country.  I should like an undertaking from the Minister that he will see that every effort will be made to take care of the young forests and that he will supply the foresters, if necessary, with guns and ammunition for the purpose of destroying the foxes and badgers that take shelter in the forests.</P>
    <P>There is no use in placing responsibility on the owners of the land in the vicinity, the owners of adjoining land. That is no good so long as you have these places practically preserved, wired around and made places of absolute security for these animals.  They are perfectly safe in these forests that are wired in.  They have perfect breeding dens there and the little animals swarm out and destroy everything in the countryside&mdash;poultry and young game.  These animals walk around in daylight&mdash;I have seen them myself&mdash; and they have not left a solitary game bird in the country.  So far as experts in these matters can calculate, I am told a dog fox and a vixen, with their pups, can destroy 300 head of game.  That is a huge amount of destruction. A vixen, a dog fox and three pups will destroy as many as 300 game birds.  When you take into consideration how plentiful these animals are, you will realise how much destruction can be caused.  The young forests are so protected that they are perfect breeding grounds for those animals that play such havoc through the country.</P>
    <P>The foresters are intelligent, competent fellows and if they were given guns it would be a good thing.  It would be well worth while paying the foresters to enable them to take out a firearms licence and also supply them with ammunition.  They would quickly put an end to the foxes and the badgers.  Why not take such steps now before the country becomes infested with these animals?  There is nobody to look after them.  Those little forests are their hiding places, their main sources of security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I see in paragraph (c) that the Minister may recover from the occupier as a simple contract debt in <Col N="868" /> any court of competent jurisdiction any expenses necessarily and properly incurred under paragraph (b); that is, any expenses incurred by the Minister through the failure of the owner of the adjacent planted land to remove the vermin.  I assume the Minister, if and when he takes such steps, will see that value is given for the money expended. Possibly he might employ trappers to trap the rabbits.  I presume the officials of the Department will see that that is done within a reasonable time and that the amount of money expended will not be so big as to make it practically impossible for the occupier of the lands to pay; in other words, we do not want people to get it into their heads that because they trap rabbits for the Forestry Department, they can spend a month where a fortnight would do and thereby penalise the occupier.  He may not be possessed of very much money and he may not be in a position to pay what is demanded of him by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The other point I would like to be clear on is, who will dispose of those rabbits and where will the money that will be realised as a result of the sale of such rabbits&mdash;let the quantity be large or small&mdash;go?  Would I be right in assuming that the money realised will go towards the payment of the men engaged, or will it go to the Forestry Department and they will pay the wages of the men, subtracting one amount from the other, and retaining what is left, if there is anything left? In the event of the money received as a result of the sale of these rabbits being greater than the amount that would be demanded from the occupier, will he get the difference?</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explain what steps he intends to take.  I am always assuming there will be a certain amount of discretion in the hands of Departmental officials and they will not make things too awkward for the occupier of the land adjacent to the plantation; but it is as well to have made clear what the Minister's intentions are.  In the event that he will have to employ men, what steps will be taken to see that the work will be done within a reasonable period and that there is no rubbing in, say, to the occupier of the adjacent land?</P>

      <P>The Minister has already given an undertaking to Deputy Cogan that if it can be demonstrated that the vermin come from one of the Minister's plantations, then the Minister will consider the question of compensating the party who will suffer as a result of any depredation caused.  But whether, as Deputy McMenamin says, the foxes come from the Minister's plantations or from other plantations, the fact of the matter is that the country is overrun with foxes and they are doing an enormous lot of destruction. If the Minister can assist in helping to exterminate these vermin, I am sure the country people will appreciate his efforts very much.  I have heard that foxes in great numbers frequent some of the forestry plantations in Donegal&mdash;two of them, at all events. What truth there is in that, I am not quite sure.  However, that is a small point.</P>
      <P>The important thing is that some steps should be taken to destroy the vermin, and prevent the depredations they are carrying out on poultry-runs and young game.  No doubt, the cutting down of so much timber during the emergency is responsible for the number of foxes at large.  In any event, I am satisfied to allow this section to go through if the Minister gives an undertaking that between now and Report he will look into the question of compensation for the people who suffer as a consequence of the depredations of vermin coming from forestry plantations.  That is the only essential point in connection with this section.</P>

      <P>Foxes are found not alone in the woodlands of the Forestry Department.  Any amount of foxes are to be found in every isolated area in my constituency.  I have seen particular parts of the country absolutely covered with foxes.  Deputy McMenamin made an appeal to Deputy Halliden.  I know that Deputy Halliden would love to have a few foxes for the hunting people in his part of the country.  In the Forestry Department we have a number of trappers, and the number is growing.  Each forester is supplied with a large number of traps. All lettings of shootings are made to <Col N="870" /> people whose interest it is to destroy vermin.  Deputy Roddy said that owing to the cutting down of trees, foxes had become more prevalent. Other Deputies said that the more trees we grow the more foxes we produce. I do not know, but anyhow I think that the only Deputy who made any important points was Deputy Cogan, and I will have them examined before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>On the section, I desire to call the Minister's attention to the fact that campers do a considerable amount of damage on the Dublin mountains by leaving fires lighting at the end of a day's outing, or by throwing the ends of lighted cigarettes around.  These outbreaks cause a good deal of trouble to the Guards.  There is no means of dealing with damage of this sort.  It is not covered by the Malicious Damage to Property Act of 1861.  The damage, of course, is caused by those campers through negligence.  Perhaps the Minister would look into the matter between now and Report Stage, and see if it would be possible to prevent fires being lighted by those people unless on a roadway or in some other approved place.  It has been pointed out to me by some of the Gárda authorities that they have considerable trouble in connection with these outbreaks and that the section as it stands does not meet the situation.  Neither is it met by the Act to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell me what is the distinction that is meant to be drawn by the words in the section &ldquo;some person other than the owner of the property&rdquo;?  I take it the intention is to protect the forest from the danger of fires. Surely, the owner of the land where the fire is started would be as big a menace to the plantation as anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section, as I read it, asks that the owner of land adjoining woodlands would give notice of his intention to destroy vegetation.  It is only reasonable that the foresters and workers should get due notice of that in order that they may protect the woodlands against fire.  That does not seem an unreasonable imposition to put on anybody, particularly in view of the damage that is being done by those people who start fires on mountain sides.  I know that in the County Wicklow a tremendous amount of damage has been done, not through malice or <Col N="872" /> anything like that, but through carelessness. The object of this section is to ensure that the foresters will get notice so that they may protect the woodlands from the result of such carelessness. I do not think I could deal in a Bill like this with campers or hikers.  A good deal of damage may be done by carelessness on their part.  I think the only remedy for that is to try to promote a spirit of good citizenship, or perhaps something might be done through organisations such as An Oige.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section deals with the removal or destruction of vegetation on land adjoining woods, and provides that where the Minister is satisfied that a wood is liable to be damaged by fire originating on uncultivated land adjoining such a wood, by reason of the presence thereon of vegetation, the Minister may serve on the occupier of the land a notice stating that such vegetation constitutes a potential danger to the wood and should be removed or sufficiently destroyed within a certain period.  Now, under paragraph <Col N="873" /> (c) the Minister or the person whom he authorised might recover from the occupier, as a simple contract debt, any expenses necessarily and properly incurred under paragraph (b) of the section for the removal or destruction of vegetation, and so on, as a measure of fire protection in relation to the wood.  It was felt that it would be unreasonable that such expenses should be borne by the occupier in the circumstances set out in paragraph (b), and accordingly paragraph (c) is being deleted.</P>

      <P>On the section, Sir, take the case of a farmer who keeps on the summer grass in order to fill a gap during the winter time: what will happen to him when that grass dries up?  Surely the Minister will not take power to compel a farmer to <Col N="874" /> destroy a crop of grass that he is preserving for his cattle for feeding purposes in the winter time.  I can quite understand that being done if it is a question of rank grass, weeds and so on, but in this country it is the general practice for a farmer to keep a certain amount of grass land available, which might become inflammable during the warm season, so as to be able to feed his cattle in the winter, but the farmer himself generally takes precautions.  I think there should be a distinction made there, and that he should be allowed to keep a crop of, say, 40 or 50 acres of grass for feeding purposes in the winter.</P>
