      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state to what extent and under what agreement Imperial Preference operates between this country and Great Britain, and whether we enjoy preferences with Great Britain to the same extent as all Commonwealth countries.</P>

      <P>Under the Trade Agreement of 1938, goods produced or manufactured in this country are entitled, on importation into Great Britain, to the preferences specified in that agreement. They also receive the benefits of the other preferential rates of duty provided for in the British customs tariff. Reciprocally, under the agreement of 1938, goods produced or manufactured in Great Britain are entitled, on admission into this country, to the preferences specified in the agreement, and also to such other preferential rates of duty as may, from time to time, be in force.</P>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether any examination has been made, by the Prices Section of his Department or by any other machinery, of the profits of contractors employed by Fuel Importers, Limited, for the haulage of turf to Dublin; whether any such examination has included a consideration of the terms of the contract entered into between the contractors and Fuel Importers, Limited, the manner of selection, the qualifications and experience required of the contractors selected, the conditions imposed by contractors on the lorry owners employed by them, including conditions as regards the purchase by the lorry owners of petrol and oil; and if he will state whether any standard rate of profit has been fixed; and, if so, its basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No examination of the profits of contractors employed by Messrs.  Fuel Importers (Eire) Limited, on the haulage of turf to Dublin has been made in my Department nor is such examination considered necessary in the case of contracts placed, as these have been, on the basis of open competitive tender.  Before a contract is placed Fuel Importers (Eire) Limited, satisfy themselves, so far as is practicable, as to the ability of the contractor to undertake the work but their inquiries have no regard to the conditions of employment as between contractor and lorry owner.  While the element of open competition obtains in the placing of these contracts the fixation of a standard rate of profit is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why, in view of the extraordinary cost of haulage of turf, no examination into the cost of the various processes in hauling has been entered into?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A reasonable cost for the haulage of turf was estimated departmentally. <Col N="304" /> So far as I know, the contracts have been placed by Fuel Importers, Limited, at or below that cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is considerable complaint that contractors have been appointed who had no experience of haulage of any kind; that some of them had no experience of motoring matters except that they owned a petrol station; and that part of the conditions that they impose on lorry drivers who take haulage contracts from them consists of a requirement that they will buy all their oil and petrol at the petrol station of the contractor, involving, so far as the contractor is concerned, substantial profits on oil and petrol, and involving, so far as the lorry drivers are concerned, unnecessary mileage and use of petrol in travelling to such petrol station which is normally out of their way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information on these matters.  I approved of Fuel Importers, Ltd., placing these contracts by open competition.  The matters to which the Deputy referred do not appear to be either my concern or the concern of Fuel Importers, Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the concern of the Minister in conserving petrol supplies and in keeping down the price of turf to see that the practices that are in operation in the placing of contracts and the hauling of turf and the collection of petrol and oil are such as will eliminate every possible waste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but there is a limit to which the Government can interfere in these matters.  I am surprised to hear the Deputy arguing in favour of Government interference; I should have thought he would favour the system of placing these contracts through open competitive tenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misses my point.  The Minister has very elaborate powers from this House to keep down the cost of living, including the cost of turf, and he is aware that nothing has stood out more in the cost of things than the cost of turf, and particularly the cost of the transport <Col N="305" /> of turf.  Surely he cannot avoid his responsibility to investigate in every possible way what are the reasons for the high cost of turf and what are the processes that give rise to the extraordinary cost in the transport of turf.  The Minister surely must be responsible for considering whether there are practices in operation as between the fuel importers and the contractors, or the contractors and the hauliers, that give rise to unnecessary costs and unnecessary profits to the contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract is awarded to those contractors who undertake to do the work at the lowest cost.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether any proposals for the haulage of turf to Dublin have been made by the Irish Lorry Owners' Association to Fuel Importers, Limited; and whether, in view of the desirability of reducing the cost of transport charges on turf, he has had these proposals examined and compared with the costs of transport which have hitherto been incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Experience has shown that the most effective method of reducing the transport charges on road-hauled turf is that adopted by Fuel Importers since 1944 of placing haulage contracts on the basis of open competitive tenders.  I understand such a tender was received from the Irish Lorry Owners' Association for current haulage work but that the terms quoted were less favourable than those of other concerns with whom contracts have been placed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether there is only one firm manufacturing sheet lead in this country; if he is aware that the price of old lead is controlled by his Department and that scrap lead dealers are not prepared to sell scrap lead at the controlled price; that, at the present time, there is a serious shortage of sheet lead; and if he will either withdraw the controlled price <Col N="306" /> or take alternative steps to make supplies available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one firm in the country manufacturing sheet lead, supplies of which are very scarce.  The price of scrap lead is controlled but increased production of sheet lead depends not on supplies of scrap lead but on supplies of imported pig lead, of which there is a world scarcity.</P>
      <P>I have had no application from the scrap merchants for an increase in the price of scrap lead, and I know of no reason why such an increase should be sanctioned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is a serious shortage of fish barrels in this country, and that the fish merchants are unable to procure same; and if he will state if any timber merchants have made applications to his Department for shipping space for the importation of barrel staves.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a general shortage of fish barrels.  I have not received any applications for shipping space for staves for fish barrels.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="307" /> if he is aware that a consignment of electrolytic condensers was ordered from the United States in January last, by Messrs. L.R. Wood, Limited, Cork; that the consignment was shipped on the 26th April, per the <i>Irish Alder</i>, which arrived at the Port of Dublin on the 18th May and at the Port of Cork on the 23rd May; that the consignment became subject to customs duty by reason of the fact that, from the 18th May, a customs duty of 75 per cent, was imposed, and that the firm have been informed that he is not prepared to recommend the issue of a licence to import the consignment free of customs duty; if he will have the matter reconsidered; and, if not, if he will state what are the reasons, in the circumstances of this consignment, that the customs duty will not be waived.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why, in the case of a firm that got permission from the Government to use dollars to import a certain number of articles, and got permission to get space in Irish shipping to import the articles, the number and value of which were previously conveyed to the Government, the Government waited until the ship was outside the harbour before they increased the customs duty on the goods that were being imported under these circumstances?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly, this firm were unfortunate by reason of the fact that the duties were increased while the goods were in transit, but to put them in the position of getting goods duty free would give them an advantage over other firms which import goods and pay the duty.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a number of unemployed dock workers not involved in the stoppage or dispute at Dublin docks resulting from the demand for holidays, were refused unemployment benefits at the employment exchanges although in full benefit and their insurance cards were stamped up to date; if he will make a statement on the matter; and if he will take the necessary steps to prevent a repetition of such refusal to pay <Col N="311" /> benefits which has resulted in hardship to the families of the dockers during the week ending Saturday, 6th July.</P>

      <P>The law provides that an insured contributor who has lost employment owing to a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at the premises at which he was employed, is disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit.  Any person who is aggrieved with the decision given on his claim has a statutory right of appeal to a Court of Referees.  That right has been exercised by the dock workers referred to in the question and several appeals are listed for hearing by the Dublin Court of Referees to-day.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he has seen the county manager's statement of the circumstances touching his refusal to appoint, as clerk of works to Woodford water scheme, the person recommended by the consulting engineer; whether he can state that the discussion, stated to have been held in the county offices, took place, and if so, whether it was with his prior knowledge and consent; whether it is correct that, as the county manager's statement suggests, his chief engineering adviser participated in this discussion and agreed to and approved of the action of the manager in disregarding the terms of circular letter 50/34; whether the chief engineering adviser's suggested procedure was within the terms of the aforementioned circular letter, and, if not, if it was previously authorised by him; whether the county manager was empowered to confine the consultant's choice to one of two named applicants; and if he will state who is the authority for issuing regulations governing these appointments, and what are the main provisions of these regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a Press report of a statement made by the county manager at a meeting of the Galway County Council recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the chief engineering adviser of my Department did not participate in any formal discussion regarding the appointment of a clerk of works for the Woodford water supply scheme.  The discussion, at which the chief engineering adviser was present, did not take place in the county council offices.  I was not aware beforehand that any such discussion was to take place.  The chief engineering adviser took the opportunity of explaining to the county manager and the consulting engineer the Department's view on the making of such appointments <Col N="313" /> generally and the reasons underlying the procedure laid down in the Department's circulars.  No departure from that procedure was recommended or approved by him.</P>
    <P>All the applications were submitted in the first instance to the consulting engineer for his recommendation.  It would appear that prior to making his selection no limitation was imposed on the consultant by the county manager. Subsequently, however, the consultant would appear, in deference to the opinions of the county engineer and county manager, to have withdrawn his first recommendation and to have agreed to recommend a candidate who was acceptable to them.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a clerk of works is a matter in the first instance for the local authority.  In order to ensure that responsibility for the selection of clerks of works should be given to the engineer or architect in charge of the works a procedure was formulated by my Department in 1934 and was set out in the circular letter referred to by the Deputy.  This procedure has since been followed generally.  It prescribes that applications shall be invited by advertisement; that they shall be submitted for examination to the engineer or architect responsible for the scheme, who shall submit a report to the local authority with his recommendation as to the person to be appointed.  The local authority, that is to say in present circumstances the manager, shall then make the appointment in accordance with the recommendation subject to the Minister's sanction.  The Minister for Local Government is the authority for issuing regulations or formulating procedure in matters of this kind.  On the 17th ultimo I issued instructions to county managers that &ldquo;when the recommendation of the consultant is received it should be formally referred to the county engineer to report whether he is aware of anything which would indicate that the candidate recommended by the consultant is unsuitable in any way for appointment.  If the county engineer is not aware of any objection the candidate recommended should be appointed.  The county engineer should not himself be asked to recommend a candidate&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out that it would appear that the consultant, in deference to the opinions of the county engineer and county manager, withdrew his first recommendation and agreed to recommend a candidate who was acceptable to them.  I am not able to say whether the withdrawal was made as a result of actual pressure brought to bear upon the consultant to depart from his first recommendation or not.  With regard to the second supplementary, I shall have to consider whether these regulations would apply to the appointment now under discussion.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the form of a tabular statement which, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission, will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that the term &ldquo;deputy&rdquo; has in this connection a very narrow connotation.  It refers only to deputies appointed under Article 17 of the Dispensary and Vaccination (Rules and Regulations). Order, 1934, and under Article 10 of the Local Government (Officers) Regulations, 1943.  The duties of officers of local authorities are, in a number of instances, performed not by deputy, but by substitute.  I should also make it clear that my permission is not required in all cases where an officer of a local authority wishes to act through a deputy.  The manager <Col N="315" /> may from time to time, without reference to me, authorise a medical officer of a hospital or of a dispensary district to perform his duties through a deputy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my statement to the Dáil on the 12th ultimo, I pointed out that on the 31st March, 1932, the number of audits in arrear was 516, and on the 31st March, 1944, it was 466.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the number of accounts for periods up to and including 31st March, 1945, still to be audited is 31.  It is expected that the greater number of these will be completed before the end of the present month.  With the exception of seven bodies the accounts to 31st March, 1944, of all local authorities have now been audited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of authorities where only the audit for the year ended 31st March, 1945, requires to be completed is 13, comprising six county councils, two boards of assistance, one county borough corporation, one borough corporation, <Col N="317" /> two mental hospital boards and one harbour authority.</P>
    <P>The number of audits completed during the year ended 31st March, 1944, was 320; for the year ended 31st March, 1945, it was 289; for the year ended 31st March, 1946, it was 642, and for the period from 1st April, 1946, to date it was 66.</P>
    <P>Forty-four current audits, that is audits relating to periods to the end of last September, December or March, have been completed.</P>
    <P>The number of abstracts of accounts of public bodies which had not been received on 1st July, 1932, was 107; on the 1st July, 1944, it was 111.  The number outstanding now is 48.</P>
    <P>The growth in the amount of grant-aided expenditure incurred by local authorities which has arisen mainly from the considerable expansion of social services has increased the work of auditors, who in addition to their normal audit duties have to undertake the certification of this expenditure. Under the present arrangements for having as much as practicable of this certification work carried out in the course of the statutory audit considerable saving of the auditors' time has been effected.</P>
    <P>It should be understood that whilst a few extra auditors have been employed during the past year the clearance of arrears has been effected in no small measure through a general and systematic reorganisation of the work as a whole.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the fees fixed are £1 1s for less than three hours and £2 2s for more than three hours?  The use of the word &ldquo;more&rdquo; surely means that if a man works for 24 hours, he gets no more than the £2 2s. laid down by the regulations? Does the Minister, as a man of common sense and justice, apart altogether from his Ministerial capacity, consider that a fair rate to pay to these men who have often had to remain in session for as long as eight and a half hours?  From cases within my own knowledge, I know that men have had to remain working for much more than three hours, and, as I say, the word &ldquo;more&rdquo; can mean 24 hours, or any other number of hours you like.  We know, and I am sure the Minister knows&mdash;I ask if he does know in order to put myself in order&mdash;that when these Circuit Court judges go down to the provinces, the court may continue in session for eight or nine hours.

      <P>I do not think this Bill will give the Dáil any great difficulty. The main purpose is to facilitate the completion of the ratification of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation.  That convention was signed, as the House is aware, by the Irish delegation to the Chicago Conference, and was subsequently approved by the Dáil on 19th April, 1945.  The convention provides that it will come into operation when ratified by 26 <Col N="328" /> States.  It has already been ratified by eight States.  The Assembly of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation set up under the interim agreement which was made at Chicago to bridge the period between the Chicago Conference and the coming into force of the Chicago Convention recently recommended early and simultaneous ratification by all other signatory States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give them later. The ratification of the Chicago Convention by the Government cannot be undertaken until legislation has been enacted which is necessary to permit of compliance with its provisions.  That purpose is met by this Bill.  When the Chicago Convention comes into force it will replace the Paris Convention of 1919 to which this country is a party. The aviation regulations at present current in this country are based on the Paris Convention.  Power to implement the Paris Convention by regulations was vested in the Government under the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.  This Bill proposes to empower the Minister for Industry and Commerce to bring the Chicago Convention into operation on an appointed date, and also to make the Orders and regulations necessary to implement the Convention.  It also proposes to transfer to the Minister the powers to make Orders and regulations vested in the Government under Sections 10, 11, 12 and 63 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.  The transfer of powers from the Government to the Minister is necessary because the civil aviation practices and standards, which are the subject of regulations, are developing rapidly and are liable to constant changes and modifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Part of this Bill arises out of the air transport agreement recently concluded with Great Britain. The provisions of that agreement require certain changes in the law and in the memorandum and articles of association of the air transport companies. The main air transport company, as the Dáil is aware, is Aer Rianta Teoranta.  The maximum capital <Col N="329" /> of that company, as provided in the Act of 1936, is £1,000,000.  The inter-company agreement, recently concluded between Aer Rianta Teoranta and the British Overseas Airways Corporation, provides for the increase of the nominal capital of Aer Lingus from £100,000 to £1,000,000, 60 per cent. of which will be held by Aer Rianta Teoranta.  Aer Rianta Teoranta will operate the proposed transatlantic service and the capital required for this project is estimated at £750,000. Other developments by the company are also contemplated.  The Bill accordingly proposes an increase in the nominal capital of Aer Rianta from the existing limit of £1,000,000 to a new limit of £2,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the capital of Aer Lingus is being increased from £100,000 to £1,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The nominal capital of £100,000 is being increased to £1,000,000, of which Aer Rianta Teoranta is obliged to supply 60 per cent.  The Principal Act set a limit of £500,000 to the amount of subsidy payable to Aer Rianta, and prescribed that the subsidy might be paid for a period of five years from the passing of the Act.  The amending Act of 1942 extended the period during which the subsidy might be paid to the 25th May, 1947.  It is anticipated that there may be an increased demand for subsidy, arising out of new air services, and particularly the proposed transatlantic air service, for some years.  It is, accordingly, proposed to increase the over-all limit of subsidy payable to £750,000, and to extend the period over which it may be paid to five years from the date of the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the amendment of the memorandum and articles of association of Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus so as to permit certain changes in their constitution, which have become necessary mainly in consequence of the inter-company agreement between Aer Rianta, Teoranta, and B.O.A.C., and because of other projects which Aer Rianta have in hand. Provision is made for the appointment <Col N="330" /> to the Board of Aer Rianta of not more than seven nor less than three directors, instead of the five directors specified in the Principal Act.  The memorandum of association of Aer Lingus contains provision as to the nationality of shareholders, and as to the powers of veto by the Minister for Finance, which are incompatible with the inter-company agreement between Aer Rianta and B.O.A.C.  The Companies Act, 1908, does not provide for the amendment or deletion of clauses of that type, and rather than wind up Aer Lingus, and reconstitute it on a new basis, provision is made in Section 28 of the Bill for the deletion of the clauses.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the payment of contributions and for the charging of fees on licences and certificates issued under regulations applying the convention.  I do not think the House will regard it as necessary for me to deal in any detail with the provisions of the British agreement, as there were references to that agreement during the course of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, and full publicity has been given to its terms. If discussion should arise on the matter, it is necessary to point out that the main feature of the agreement is the establishment of a joint operating company.  The alternative arrangement for air services between this country and Great Britain would have involved the operation of such services by two companies&mdash;one Irish and one British&mdash; possessing equal rights mutually conceded.</P>
    <P>It was considered that a joint company would be more efficient and economical in operation, which is a matter of importance, and that, therefore, our interests were best served by having such joint company.  The provisions of the agreement ensure that the joint company will be Aer Lingus Teoranta and that the majority of the directors of that company will be appointed by Aer Rianta, which will hold 60 per cent. of the total capital.</P>

      <P>Under the inter-company agreement the British company, or companies, will have the right to nominate three of seven, or two of the five, directors of Aer Lingus.  The actual number of directors on that board at present is five but it may be increased to seven; if it is increased to seven four will be nominated by Aer Rianta and three by the British company, or companies, which are parties to the agreement.  The agreement also gives commercial rights in the United Kingdom to Aer Lingus in respect of certain routes between Shannon and Dublin and points on the continent, including Paris.  Services to Paris have already commenced by virtue of the agreement made recently with the French Government.  Following the agreement signed with the Swedish Government services to points in Sweden are contemplated in the near future.  Services to other points in Europe named in the agreement with Great Britain cannot commence until agreements with the countries concerned have been concluded.  The points named in the agreement are Oslo, Brussels, Amsterdam and Copenhagen. The economic importance of the Shannon airport is recognised by the provision in the annexe to the agreement that all B.O.A.C. aircraft on the route London-Shannon-Newfoundland and Canada, or the United States, and points beyond in both directions, will stop at Shannon on the east-bound and west-bound flights.  The wording of that provision in the agreement is the same as that in the Irish-American agreement made in 1945. The duration of the agreement is indefinite. It is terminable, however, by either party giving 12 months' notice. The inter-company agreement between Aer Rianta and B.O.A.C. has just been signed.  As I have indicated, the heads of the agreement provide for the establishment of a single unit, which will be Aer Lingus, with a capital of <Col N="332" /> £1,000,000 of which 60 per cent. will be held by Aer Rianta and 40 per cent. by B.O.A.C.  The text of the inter-Government agreement has been circulated to the House.  The principal purpose of this Bill is to get the necessary powers to permit of the ratification of the Chicago convention and to effect changes incidental to that British agreement to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister could have been a lot more helpful in his statement if he had taken Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta and told us clearly for what specific purposes they have been formed and the capital upon which they are working, together with some information as to where that capital is found.  Nobody could get any kind of clear picture from the Minister's statement as to what type of air companies we have, the type of passengers they are going to carry, and the places to which they will carry them. There has been a good deal of confused publicity in connection with discussions about air agreements and disputes as to the ways in which they are worked.  We have had a good deal of confused information about our own air endeavours.  I think the Minister should give us a simple statement of our air organisation here, the purpose for which it is set up, the way in which it is being capitalised and the extent to which financial responsibility of a contingency kind may rest on the country.  First of all, I would like to ask the Minister what is Aer Rianta? Is it a company formed entirely for the purposes of carrying passengers inside or outside the country?  Can he give us any information as to the personnel of the board of directors, how they are appointed and how the governing board is set up?  To what extent is the capital of the company furnished by the State here?  To what extent are private investors interested in investing in Aer Rianta?  In respect of Aer Lingus, in what directions is it anticipated that this company will work throughout the world?  To what extent has Aer Lingus been set up for the purpose of carrying Irish passengers? To what extent will it facilitate air traffic in regard to people from other <Col N="333" /> countries on routes which involve this country?  Is the capital in Aer Lingus going to derive from Aer Rianta?  To what extent, if that is so, is the capital in Aer Rianta Irish capital, with a contingent liability for further expense upon the State here?  I think it is desirable that the Minister should clear up that situation to some extent.  Until the situation is clarified it is impossible to ask any other intelligent questions which follow as a natural corollary to those I have already asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that Aer Lingus is a purely Irish company, fully controlled in this country and with the prime purpose of carrying on air services to the world outside, am I right in understanding that we intend to carry on air services to Great Britain and the United States, on the one hand, and to Europe on the other?  When the air pact was signed with the United States it was arranged that the air lines of Ireland, authorised under the present agreement, were accorded within the territory of the United States rights of transit, common traffic stop, and commercial entry for international traffic at specific airports in connection with such route, or routes, as would be determined at a later date.  Is Aer Lingus the company which is going to have identical rights of entry into the United States as the United States lines have here?  Are we going to have the same right of entry into Great Britain as we are going to have into the United States?  Into what countries in Europe is it intended that we shall have the same rights of entry?  Incidental to that, what other countries in Europe are likely to require the same rights of entry here?  Until we get a simple exposition of the organisation and the work of the two companies I do not think we can usefully discuss these matters here.  Then as to the B.O.A.C., with which Aer Rianta is co-operating to form Aer Lingus, will that company be given the same rights as a separate company here as Aer Lingus will be given in Great Britain; or does the fact that Aer Lingus exists as a joint company between ourselves and the British operate to cut out the personal services <Col N="334" /> of the B.O.A.C. entering this country?</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of criticism about narrowness in the use of flags which I think ought to be cleared up.  As I understand it, Aer Lingus is a purely Irish company operating under the Irish flag and that it is not a gesture of aggression towards, or want of esteem of any country into which our planes go that we simply carry on our services under one flag. There has been a certain amount of confused criticism and confusion of mind on the subject arising out of criticism made, perhaps, in ignorance or made in order simply to create a certain amount of difficulty and irritation. I think that a clear statement from the Minister would clear the air and silence any criticism that might arise from ignorance or even prejudice in the matter.  As I said, the Minister's statement has not been very helpful and it would be desirable if in replying he would approach the matter in a simple way, because a lot of people are very ignorant as to what is being done when we ring the changes between Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that some Deputies who expressed some concern as to whether we were doing something unwise when we signed the agreement with America and ratified it in this House will be gratified to know, so far as I can gather from the Minister, that under this new arrangement British planes will be getting the same facilities here as American planes operating in the same way.  I take it that that is so.  I think I can take it that, if at any time it is considered desirable and judicious, the same facilities can be extended to planes of other countries.  There is nothing in this, any more than the original agreement, which precludes us from doing that.  I think that is clear but it might be no harm if the Minister would clarify it a bit further when replying because, perhaps for the reason which Deputy Mulcahy has given, that we have not got much information and certainly the country has not got much information as to the actual set-up and working of the various companies here, <Col N="335" /> there is a good deal of ill-informed criticism outside.  There were certain fears expressed in the first instance that we were tying ourselves up exclusively to America, while other people are now afraid that we are tying ourselves to the British by allowing the British to come in on this new company.</P>
      <P>I think it is a very important matter from many aspects, not the least of which is the financial aspect.  Apart from giving authority here to have the capital of the company increased from £1,000,000 to £2,000,000, there is, of course, from the point of view of the taxpayer, the consideration that we are increasing the subsidy by £250,000.  I do not think anybody will grudge that amount, or even a larger amount, if we are to get, as we ought to get, a pretty fair return from it.  The matter is confused, however.  Am I right in saying that Aer Rianta is a holding company and that Aer Lingus is the operating one?  Is that the position?  What are the functions of Aer Rianta?  What was it set up for and what does it do? How do its functions and operations differ from Aer Lingus?  How did they differ in the past and how will they differ in the future?</P>
      <P>It seems to me from what the Minister stated that Aer Lingus is being completely transformed; that we are to have a new company with completely new powers and with approximately double the capital of the old one.  That is the position as I understand it.  I may be wrong.  Like other Deputies, I have no desire other than to see this working out in the most successful way possible; but I should like an assurance that we are paying as much attention to the getting together of the machinery for operating our companies and our services, the staffing of the various offices, the provision of trained personnel, as we are to the matters that are immediately before us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other people, I hear a good deal of criticism.  Some of it, perhaps most of it, may be ill-informed, and some of it may arise from the fact that this is a completely new service and we know very little <Col N="336" /> about it.  Perhaps I speak with more ignorance than the average person, because I am one of those who have not yet had the pleasure of being either at Rineanna or Collinstown.  But I have heard, I suppose in common with others, various complaints.  I would be surprised, with the new service such as this one, that has expanded enormously in such a short time, the expansion coming, it is only fair to say, sooner than anyone could have anticipated, if there were not criticism and complaints.  To what extent these are well-founded I do not know.  I am sure that it will be the Minister's wish that, so far as the cause for complaint can be removed, it will be removed as early as possible. One of the complaints&mdash;it is better to mention it so that we can have a statement from the Minister&mdash;is that there is not sufficient staff to handle the rapidly-growing traffic; that the staff employed by Aer Lingus are overworked and are expected to work hours that, to say the least, are not fair.  In relation to the payments which are being made to the staffs of other companies employed on the same work, and side by side with them, their pay is totally inadequate.  There is a difference, not only in relation to what is paid to the employees of other companies, but in relation to the work which they have to perform.  That is the sort of general complaint that I have got.  I can see at certain periods, principally owing to weather conditions, that you will have a very big rush of work when planes will be held up for two or three days, and there may be other periods when you will have long gaps, when few, if any, planes arrive.  However, these are matters of detail.</P>
    <P>I think I understood the Minister to say that eight States had already ratified the convention and it must be ratified by 26 States.  Can the Minister give us any information as to when it is expected the 26 States will ratify the convention, or at what stage the other States are towards the ratification of the convention?  I think it would help not only towards the smoother working of aviation in this country, but it would remove a lot of criticism, and perhaps a great number <Col N="337" /> of the complaints that have been made. The complaints may be considered as of a petty type, but we are now getting into this country people from all over the world and it is up to us to have things done here as well as it is possible to do them.</P>
    <P>Our obligation, and particularly the obligation of the operating company, does not begin and end at the airport. If we simply wash our hands of any further responsibility towards people who come to this country once they step off the plane at Rineanna, and if we feel that we have no concern as to how they are to reach whatever part of the country they may be travelling to from Rineanna or Collinstown, we are not doing our duty.  People may get a very wrong impression of things in this country.  We know there have been very serious complaints, and I think they have some foundation, over the way in which people have been treated when they arrive in this country.  That is something that will not be conducive either to the good name of the company or to the good name of the country.  I should like that matter to be kept in the forefront of the operation of the company.</P>
    <P>I have considered it desirable and my duty to put those complaints and points before the House.  I should like to say, in connection with the signing of the American agreement, that I think the people who were charged with the negotiations, particularly in connection with the international convention, have upheld the prestige of this country while attending those international conferences and they have performed their work in a very fitting way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some more information from the Minister. As other Deputies have remarked, there has been considerable confusion in regard to this matter.  Can the Minister indicate the necessity, for the future, of maintaining both companies? It appears to many people that there is no good reason why two companies, Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus, should be maintained.  I suppose there are certain reasons, but I should like to hear about them from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While most members of the Dáil and <Col N="338" /> the public generally are anxious to see this country taking a prominent place in air navigation, it would be wrong to imagine that they could subscribe to this country joining in anything like a race for air supremacy.  We see at various times statements made in Britain or America that one or the other is not competing satisfactorily, and in Britain certain people have expressed disappointment that the British are not taking a sufficiently adequate place in the development of civil aviation.  While we are anxious to establish our position and provide adequate facilities here, it would be wrong for a small country such as this to attempt to launch itself into a campaign which would involve the country in heavy expenditure.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether the increased subsidy is repayable and, if so, what are the terms; and, in the event of the Minister for Finance subscribing additional capital to the new company, whether that capital will be repayable and on what terms.  We should like to know also if the Minister for Finance is the largest shareholder in Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  If the Minister gave the House the prospects, in so far as he can see them, of air development here, it might help to allay the considerable confusion which exists and some of the doubts which the general public have. Have there been any negotiations or are any contemplated between either Britain or America, irrespective of the joint arrangement between Britain and here?  We should like to know whether there is any long-term arrangement for the use of the facilities at Rineanna or Foynes by an American company. One of the matters which has caused a certain amount of doubt is that no period in which these facilities can be made available has been decided.  Perhaps the Minister will say if any arrangement has been made and, if so, what are the details.</P>
    <P>The only case in regard to which I have heard any complaint is where people who are anxious to avail of our air facilities have found difficulty in booking seats.  That may be due to the services being overworked.  I have found considerable satisfaction in dealing <Col N="339" /> with the officials of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, but visitors to this country and others anxious to travel to Britain or America have been disappointed occasionally when they cannot be provided more quickly with travelling facilities.</P>
    <P>I think the House should feel grateful to the officials of the Minister's Department&mdash;I do not wish to mention any officials by name, but all of the officials&mdash;who undertook, over a protracted period, the carrying on of negotiations.  They travelled abroad on a number of occasions in order to conclude the agreements to which this country has become a party and we should feel very grateful to them for all they have done.</P>

      <P>To enable Deputies to get a clear picture of the organisation of air transport in this country as it will exist from this on, I would ask them to regard Aer Rianta as the senior company.  Aer Rianta will be completely Irish-owned.  The whole of its capital will be subscribed by the Minister for Finance.  There will be no private shareholders.  The function of Aer Rianta will be to contribute the appropriate proportion of the capital of Aer Lingus, to manage the Dublin airport and to operate transatlantic air services.  It may get other functions later but these are the functions that are foreseen for it in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Aer Lingus is a joint company constituted by agreement between Aer Rianta and the British Overseas Airways Corporation, owned as to 60 per cent. by Aer Rianta and 40 per cent. by the B.O.A.C., which will operate services from Ireland to Great Britain and services from Ireland to the Continent of Europe. That is the position as it will exist from this on.  Aer Rianta was established originally as a separate organisation <Col N="340" /> from Aer Lingus, which was then the only company operating air services here, because of an agreement which was made some ten years ago between ourselves and Great Britain, Canada and Newfoundland, to provide for a transatlantic air service by a joint company constituted by the main operating transport companies of these four States.  That agreement lapsed. The functions of Aer Rianta tended for a time to become obscured and it might not have been necessary to maintain it as a separate organisation if this proposal for the operation of services to Great Britain and Europe by a joint company had not emerged.  As that proposal has emerged and been implemented, it is clearly desirable that we should keep in existence a completely Irish-owned operating company to carry on services which are not operated for the joint company, the principal of which will to be to the United States of America.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is no transatlantic service in operation at the moment.  The planes and the equipment for the operation of the transatlantic service are on order but it is unlikely that the services will begin before the spring of next year.  Aer Lingus, which is the joint company, will operate the services from this country and Great Britain, and will also operate services between Ireland and Europe.  It is given, under the British agreement, the right to operate services across Great Britain to certain designated points in Europe.  It is given the right to land in Britain and to take up traffic there for transportation to these points in Europe.  At some stage services to this country, operated by companies of the nationality of the countries to which we shall run services, will also have rights to land here. The French agreement contemplated the operation of a service between Dublin and Paris by Aer Lingus and by a French company.  The French company has not yet begun its service. Before services can be operated on the routes specified in the British agreement, <Col N="341" /> it is necessary also to have agreements with the countries where these routes will terminate.  Agreements have been concluded so far with France and Sweden and, with other countries concerned, negotiations are in progress. Under the British agreement, the British air company operating the transatlantic route is given the same right to use the Shannon port as is given to American companies.  Similar rights have been given to a French company under the French agreement and to a Swedish company under the Swedish agreement.  It is our intention to give these rights on terms which are mutually agreed to companies of any European country that desires to procure them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Morrissey referred to certain statements that were reported to have been made in the British House of Commons regarding our alleged objection to British planes flying here.  There was no such objection on our part.  Until the 1st May last, the air services between Great Britain and Ireland were operated partly by an Irish company and partly by a British company designated by the British Government for that purpose.  Conceivably we could have arranged for the maintenance of these services by two separate companies dividing the traffic between them on a 50-50 basis, the Irish company operating under the authority of the Irish Government and the English company operating under the authority of the British Government.  That arrangement would be similar to that we have made with France and similar to that which existed prior to the most recent agreement. There was no objection on our part to the continuation of such arrangement but, in the course of discussions with the British authorities, it was suggested and agreed that a more efficient and economical service could be provided for the public by the establishment of a joint company, that is to say, the operation of these services by one single organisation instead of by two separate organisations, however cordial the relations between them might be.  We accepted the suggestion that efficient and economical operation would best be <Col N="342" /> served by a joint company and authorised our company, Aer Rianta Teoranta, to conclude an agreement with the British Overseas Airways Corporation for the operation of this service by Aer Lingus and the reconstitution of Aer Lingus as a joint company on the basis I have indicated.</P>
    <P>Some reference was made to British planes carrying the British flag.  As a matter of fact civil air transport planes do not carry a flag.  The phrase was used in the colloquial sense, associated with maritime matters.  There is in our view a great deal to be said for the operation of the service between this country and Britain by a joint company but if the British authorities had desired to maintain the other system of operation by two separate companies, of which one would have been a British company, no objection would have been forthcoming on our side.  British planes operating on the transatlantic route will have all five freedoms, to use the phrase which originated at the Chicago conference, at Shannon airport.  Deputy Morrissey inquired at what time it was anticipated that the requisite number of States will have ratified the Chicago Convention.  The recommendation of the council of the provisional organisation was for simultaneous ratification by the countries concerned by the 1st March next year.  It was urged that ratification on a fixed date by all the States concerned would facilitate the transfer from the provisional organisation, which was established at Chicago, to the permanent organisation contemplated by the convention.  The countries which have ratified the convention to date are Canada, China, the San Domingo Republic, Nicaragua, Peru, Poland and Turkey.  There may be some ambiguity concerning the ratification by Poland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to certain complaints which he stated he had heard concerning the services provided at the airports and by the air operating companies.  It is, I think, impossible to arrange any system of staffing in present circumstances which would avoid the necessity of air transport control staffs and similar essential staffs from having occasionally to work overtime, or from going on duty at <Col N="343" /> exceptional hours.  I think we must face up to the fact that we cannot hope at any time to be able to pay many classes of workers employed on air transport by ourselves on scales which have been established by the American companies.  I think that, having regard to the remuneration available in comparable walks of life here, the salaries paid either in connection with airport management or air line operation are not open to criticism. There may be some basis for criticism of the arrangements made for the transportation of passengers to and from Shannon airport in present circumstances. I think I can say, however, that they are far superior to the arrangements at present existing at most other airports in Europe.  No doubt arrangements elsewhere will be substantially improved in the course of time, and so will the arrangements at the Shannon.  Most of the passengers arriving at the Shannon on international routes express appreciation of the facilities there as compared with the lack of facilities which they find elsewhere.</P>

All the capital in Aer Lingus is held by Aer Rianta.  It is not intended that private capital should be sought for either company.  I think these were the only matters that were raised.  The necessity for a separate company arises out of the fact that Aer Rianta will have separate functions to perform and will in any event continue to be 100 per cent an Irish-owned company.</P>

Then there is Collinstown, which has been built at the expense of the State, and is maintained by the State.  It is using the machinery of Aer Rianta to manage it.  Outside the management of Collinstown by Aer Rianta the State has practically no part in its management.  In Rineanna the position is that State machinery for capital development was and will continue to carry out the management. As far as Aer Rianta or Aer Lingus or anybody else is concerned the position is that they simply use the airports which were capitalised and managed by the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph &ldquo;c&rdquo; and substitute therefore a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  to supervise and control the testing and analyses of commodities intended for sale or for use by the <Col N="348" /> public and where necessary or expedient for such effective supervision and control, to test and analyse such commodities and to publish the results of such tests and analyses.</P>
    <P>I think I raised on the Second Stage a question as to the implementation of paragraph (c) which defines the functions of the institute.  That paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To test and analyse commodities intended for sale or for use by the public and to publish the results of such tests and analyses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The difficulty in that section as it stands is this, as an enabling section it is certainly wide enough to cover whatever powers the Minister wants, and as a mere enabling section it is not objectionable.  But, in my opinion, it is rather too wide.  The clause is wide enough to embrace as part of the functions of the Research Institute the whole gamut of analyses under the Food and Drugs Acts and so forth.  In fact, it is wide enough to constitute the institute a super public analyst, in fact a State institution for carrying out the duties of a public analyst.  I think I am right in saying that that is not the Minister's intention, that the intention is to set up a bill of standards, which will define the necessary standards, and that this clause is simply to enable him to make that function effective.  For that reason, I am moving this amendment.  It all boils down to this: does the Minister intend to set up a very elaborate public analyst department, or is it simply to enable the section to give effect to the standards laid down by the bill of standards?</P>
    <P>I see another difficulty in this Bill as it stands.  It is so wide that I can see it applying itself to such matters as food regulations under the Public Health Bill, when it becomes law, or the Food and Drugs Acts as they stand.  There is a big question as regards the existing public analyst.  Does this measure, as it stands, encroach upon the functions of public analysts as they exist?  For the information of the House, I might mention what probably every Deputy knows, that it is mandatory on every local authority to appoint <Col N="349" /> a public analyst.  These public analysts, in fact, fulfil an important function. They carry out analyses referred to them, either by these bodies or by private persons, with a view to seeing that commodities conform, or otherwise; and they further carry out a useful function of general analyses for the convenience of the public and of industrial firms.  As this paragraph stands there is a threat to these public analysts. I do not think it is the Minister's intention to act in any way to the detriment of these analysts but, for the purpose of clarifying the situation, I move this amendment.  I think the function that is required is merely one of supervising and making sure that the standards laid down are effective.  In actual practice the normal way would be that public analysts would function as heretofore, determine the agreement, or otherwise, of the commodities with the standards laid down and the function of the institute would be to co-ordinate and control these standards.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, which is of no little interest to the House, in this connection.  It is the question of finance.  If, on the one hand, the intention is merely to have a bureau of standards with the necessary machinery for making it effective, while the work of analyses is carried out by public analysts, then the size of the institute and the equipment involved need not be excessive.  If, on the other hand, it is visualised that the institute will itself carry out such analyses and will itself arrange for control I can see a much greater expenditure being involved&mdash;a much greater expenditure as regards staff, equipment and accommodation, for work which is being done now as economically as it can be done under the present system of public analysts.  In other words, the routine of analyses and the implementation of the standards laid down in their application to ordinary commodities is no part of the ordinary function of an institute like this and, therefore, that work should be left to the public analyst.  It is for that reason that I move this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy de Valera's amendment to this section.  What we want to find out is <Col N="350" /> if it is the intention of the Minister in this respect that this Industrial Research Institute should engage in public analyses or should it confine itself to the setting up of standards? I think Deputy de Valera has put the case very clearly.  Is it the Minister's intention that this Research Institute should carry out the work which is at present being carried out by public analysts and analytical chemists.  I personally do not imagine that is the Minister's intention.</P>
      <P>I have the greatest sympathy with the section as it stands in order that the Research Institute should have widest possible powers, but I would be very averse to giving it powers which would conflict with people who are earning their bread and butter on this particular type of work at the present time.  I would also ask the Minister if this is likely to interfere with the administration of the Food and Drugs Acts and the Fertilisers and Feeding-Stuffs Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that public analysts and analytical chemists are somewhat perturbed at the prospect that the powers given to the institute under paragraph (c) of Section 5, might be availed of to give the public a free service for which they now have to pay when employing public analysts and analytical chemists and that their livelihoods may thereby suffer some interference.  I tried to explain in a brief form when introducing the Bill on Second Reading what the motives were in providing, as in paragraph (c), that the institute would have the function of testing and analysing commodities intended for sale and publishing the results of them.  It is quite clear that the institute must have power to test and analyse commodities offered for sale.  It may need to do so arising out of its research activities.  It will certainly need to do so arising out of its control of standards; and I think it is desirable it should also do so on its own initiative where it believes the public welfare will be served by making known the results of tests or analyses of goods offered for sale.  It is not intended, however, that it should do in circumstances where a public <Col N="351" /> analyst would be now employed.  I do not think this amendment meets the case.</P>
      <P>However, I am prepared to consider to what extent it is possible to provide a legal assurance to the public analysts and analytical chemists that the powers of the institute will not be used to their detriment in the manner they fear.  It is necessary that the institute should have functions and powers given to it in this regard.  It may, however, be possible to devise some form of words which will be of more value to the persons concerned than my assurance as to the manner in which the powers shall be used and which will provide an effective safeguard for them.  This amendment as it stands will not do that but if Deputy de Valera will allow the matter to stand over I will consider to what extent it is possible to get into the Bill limiting words which will have the effect of giving the institute the functions and powers it should have but will, at the same time, ensure that these functions and powers will not be used to the detriment of public analysts and analytical chemists who are gainfully employed now in those fields.</P>

      <P>Reference was made to that in the Second Reading.  The position is that the State is going to give £15,000 to this institute to carry on its administrative work and meet its ordinary routine outgoings.  In order to minimise the extent to which the State would control or exercise power of supervision over the functioning of the committee, or the expenditure of the council, we propose to leave it to themselves to determine what their own remuneration should be.  We will <Col N="352" /> endeavour to get a responsible committee which will not act in a foolish or irresponsible manner.  I thought it desirable, however, to leave that matter to themselves rather than that we should take power to fix remuneration and thereby exercise a more detailed supervision over the committee.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 18, to delete the words &ldquo;nine members&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;six members in addition to the director.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Very little need be said about this because the matter was dealt with to some extent on the Second Reading of this Bill.  The reason for inserting the director here is tied up with Section 15. We are dealing with Section 8.  The reason for moving the reduction in numbers is because the Minister wishes this to be a working committee or an executive committee which will get work done and not merely an advisory body.  From all our experience of large committees I think it is desirable that the number here should be limited.  I think the work will be done more expeditiously and more effectively by six men than it could be done by nine men. That is the net reason for this.  Six members would also allow for representation of the various scientific interests that would be necessary, such as physicists, chemists, engineers, etc; perhaps you will want a biologist too. So much for the number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the inclusion of the director, I do not wish to press that point on the Minister, but I should like to go back to the point made on the Second Reading Stage of the Bill, that the position of the director was anomalous and that, to my mind, there were two solutions, not perfect, but the best that could be got.  One was to make him the chairman of that committee; the other was to make him the executive. I am moving that he should be <i>ex officio</i> chairman of the committee in the later amendment and, therefore, the committee would consist of the six members mentioned together with the <Col N="353" /> director.  That is the reason for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not at all sure that it is wise to seek to reduce the size of the committee, because it may be necessary, in order to give representation on this committee to the various interests that should be represented on it, to have a committee of nine.  Nor would I agree that a committee of nine would be necessarily slow and cumbersome.  I would, however, be prepared to leave the matter in a more open form by amending sub-section (2) so as to provide that the committee would consist of not more than nine members, so that it would not be necessary to have the full nine members appointed at any one time. I would not regard it as desirable, however, that the size of the committee should be necessarily restricted below nine, because in matters with which this committee will deal I think there is a good deal to be said for the point of view that wisdom lies in a multitude of counsel.</P>
      <P>I doubt very much that the functions of this institute will be facilitated by restricting unduly the size of the committee. It is a somewhat different type of organisation from the more commercial type of body where small numbers lead to quick decisions and prompt action.  That will not be so essential so far as this committee is concerned, where it is important that there should be brought to bear on the problems with which the committee will deal the minds of people who have a specialised type of training or individual points of view.  Therefore, I feel strongly that the number should not be changed in sub-section (2), but I will consider submitting to the Dáil on the Report Stage an amendment which will provide that the committee will consist of not more that nine members.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  The director shall be <i>ex officio</i> the chairman of the Industrial Research Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net point is that in the section as it stands, taking it in conjunction with Section 15, the director of this institute is in a peculiar position.  He is subordinate, apparently, to the research committee and he cannot even vote there.  He must carry out the research decided on by them and the directions of the standards committee. In addition to that, he is empowered to act independently on behalf of the institute.  As Deputy Hughes said on the Second Reading Stage, I think that this makes for friction, because you <Col N="355" /> will have two heads, and the question is, to my mind, whether the director should be the chairman of the research committee, which will be the committee that will be getting work done in the sense of executive work, or whether he should be the executive of it.  I am moving the amendment in the form that he should be the chairman of the committee.  But, of course, the other solution is equally desirable.  There is no reason for delaying the House further except to press the point of view on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that it is a matter which has been fairly fully considered and that the type of organisation contemplated in the Bill was decided upon after that full consideration.  It is a matter upon which it must be recognised that individual judgments may very easily differ.  I would not agree at all that the director should be chairman of the committee.  I think a chairman independent of the director is a better system of organisation.  It has proved to be so in private business and is likely to be so in an organisation of this character.  It is necessary in that connection to bear in mind that we are really setting up two institutions. There will be one building, one staff, and one set of equipment, but two separate authorities using the building and the equipment for somewhat divergent purposes and having this director as their executive officer in the performance of their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The research committee and the standards committee will stand in relation to the director on an equal footing. If you make the director chairman of the research committee it would, I think, necessitate a reconsideration of the whole scheme of the Bill, because he would then be in a somewhat different relationship to the standards committee than is proposed here.  It is true that we are establishing a research committee not merely as the body in charge of the research activities of the institute, but also as the financial authority of the institute.  It will control the funds and, to that extent, it will rank superior in the organisation of the institute to the standards committee. <Col N="356" /> But, in so far as the standards committee have separate functions to perform, they will be independent of the research committee in the performance of those functions and will be entitled to get the services of the director and the staff of the institute to whatever extent is necessary for them.</P>
    <P>There will be a situation which will be somewhat unusual, in having two separate bodies using the same institute, the same equipment and staff, and, because of that, it was preferable that the position of director should be defined clearly in relation to both.  The intention is that the Research Committee will have full power to decide how the funds available to the institute will be spent and what individual items of research will be undertaken there.  We are proceeding with a different machine from that we had previously in the Industrial Research Council.  The Industrial Research Council had nothing except a library, and the disposal of certain funds.  In order to get certain research work done, it had to enter into an arrangement with the university colleges or other persons in control of equipment so as to have the equipment available for the purpose of its researches.</P>
    <P>In the future this institute will have its own laboratories, equipment and staff and it will be necessary for the director to have control of the staff. We clearly set him up as the authority which controls the staff.  He is responsible for discipline of the staff and for the proper running of the institute. One of his duties will be to see that work is always there for the staff, even if there are gaps in the research programme, or if, for any reason, researches have to be delayed or suspended or postponed for a period.  It is for that reason we give the director the power to carry on and direct activities independently of the committee. We do not give him the power to refuse to obey the instructions of the committee, to refuse to do anything the committee may direct him to do, but we give him power on his own initiative to employ the staff and the resources and the equipment of the institute on research activities which he thinks worth while and which can <Col N="357" /> be fitted into the inevitable gaps which will occur in the programme of the research committee.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to be dogmatic in a matter of this kind.  I think this is the type of organisation that will work best.  I may be wrong and it may be necessary to reconsider the matter if difficulties should arise, but I think they are less likely to arise in this type of organisation than in an organisation of a different kind.  There may be friction.  I do not think anything we can put in a Bill will avoid friction if there are personal incompatibilities.  I hope it will be possible now and in the future to get officers who will work harmoniously one with the other and thus eliminate the possibilities of friction. If friction should arise between the director and the committee or any of the staff of the institute, I do not think we could eliminate it by changing the provisions of the Bill.  We may eliminate it by changing the director or the committee or the staff, and that step might have to be taken.  I think it is much wiser to leave the Bill as it is.</P>
    <P>I gave the matter careful consideration. Various people advocated alternative forms of organisation.  Deputy de Valera suggested one and there have been even different types of organisation suggested from that contemplated by either of us.  Having regard to the experience of the Industrial Research Council, and some experience of other organisations of this character, and information as to how such institutes have been organised elsewhere, I think the scheme provided for in the Bill is really workable and is likely to prove satisfactory.  That hope may prove to be unfounded, but I prefer to leave the Bill as it is and see how it works rather than proceed on the other basis of having the director an <i>ex officio</i> chairman of the committee or clearly subordinate to the committee in all respects.</P>

There will be no question of the director having any power to refuse to carry out the instructions of the council.  These instructions must be carried out by the director but, if the opportunity offers, he may carry on independent research through the institute.  That is the one respect in which he is given independent status.  He is independent of the committee in his appointment and it will be appreciated that the probability is that the director, if he proves satisfactory, will remain there for life, whereas the personnel of the council might change.</P>

      <P>I see a difficulty in the words, in Section 15, &ldquo;the conduct of research&rdquo;.  These words in the Bill seem to me to give him a wide scope independent of the body which is intended to conduct research.  What will be the machinery for referring problems to this institute?  Is it visualised that the institute or the committee or the director, if he has separate powers, will decide on problems, or will it be a question of having problems referred to them?</P>

The practice will be that the committee will come at the beginning of a year with a research programme for the year, to be financed partially out of the £15,000 annual grant and partially by means of special grants for which the Bill provides.  The adequacy or suitability of the research programme will be considered and there will be agreement on behalf of the committee to limit activities in certain directions and on behalf of the Minister to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in the Dáil to provide for whatever grants, over and above the annual allocation, may be required.  In practice that is what will happen.  We provide that the institute shall carry <Col N="359" /> out whatever researches may be requested by the Minister and they may carry out researches in addition which they themselves consider worth while.</P>

      <P>The actual wording of the section is &ldquo;The institute shall carry out such researches, including researches on a laboratory or on a pilot plant scale and such investigations,&rdquo; etcetera.  Later on it says &ldquo;and may in addition carry out such researches... as the said committee or the directors may from time to time think proper.&rdquo; The amendment proposes to insert before the word &ldquo;such,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or cause to be carried out.&rdquo;  The section would then read &ldquo;The institute shall carry out or cause to be carried out such researches,&rdquo; etcetera, and again in line 7 the section would read &ldquo;carry out or cause to be carried out such researches.&rdquo; My reason for moving the <Col N="361" /> amendment is that although it is the Minister's intention to have a very elaborate institution, and as far as possible to have this institution self-contained, in the problems which in practice will confront any major research, there will be side-lines which may be more easily dealt with in some other laboratory than in the laboratories of the institute.</P>
      <P>To make the matter more specific, supposing in the conduct of a research, the need for a specialised spectroscopic examination arises.  In the course of some research on metal, or it may be on some chemical, there may be some need for a detailed investigation of a spectroscopic nature.  That is a highly specialised business and even if the institute might have certain spectroscopic apparatus available, it might not be able to cater for that problem. If it were decided to equip itself to cater for just that problem it might find itself confronted with quite unnecessary expenditure, on the provision of equipment which would not normally be wanted and which would not normally be used.  Not only would it be confronted with the difficulty and expense of obtaining that equipment, but it would also be confronted with the difficulty of getting an actual specialist in spectroscopy.  It might not be economic in the ordinary running of the Institute to maintain a spectroscopic department so what is the institute to do?  On the other side of the picture you have in University College, Dublin, a relatively well-equipped school of spectroscopy, with the gratings and other equipment in charge of a very experienced person. In such a case like that, the research committee and the director might like to refer the problem to such an experienced and trained school.  It might be the most economical way of doing if and it would probably be the most expeditious way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken one example but it can occur in a great number of lines.  Any Deputy can use his imagination.  For that reason I move the insertion of these words in the section for the sole purpose of leaving it open to the director or the research committee, as the case may be, to refer problems of that nature to the laboratories where <Col N="362" /> they can be more expeditiously and economically dealt with.  This in no way cuts across the functions of the institute itself.  I would strongly recommend the Minister to accept the amendment because, no matter what happens, in actual fact the institute will have to avail itself of outside resources. There is no use in talking of it as completely Sinn Fein with a wall around it.  Even in the matter of a library, the institute may have to rely on the library of the Royal Dublin Society, of University College, Dublin, or other libraries.  There is nothing wrong in that.  I am not advocating a new line of procedure at all but circumstances will arise in which recourse to outside facilities may be necessary.  I therefore move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill which prevents the institute from arranging with universities, colleges or other authorities for conducting on its behalf specific inquiries or furnishing answers to particular queries which they are in a position to give, or on matters which they are equipped to explore. I want to be clear, however&mdash; and perhaps this is where Deputy de Valera and myself are in disagreement &mdash;that it is intended that this institute will set up its own building and its own laboratory.  It will spend its money on buying equipment for itself.  It is not intended that it should be merely empowered to make arrangements with university colleges, to subsidise university laboratories or to work through the college laboratories as the present Industrial Research Council does. Clearly and definitely, the one lesson we have learned from our experience in industrial research is that if any effective progress is to be made it can be done only by an institute.  A committee which does not control its own laboratory and which operates on the methods by which we have been proceeding heretofore, is not likely to be productive of results on a sufficient scale.  In so far, therefore, as the amendment is designed to empower the institute to arrange for a specific task to be done for it in university laboratories or other research works, it is unnecessary.  In so far as it is intended to suggest an alternative policy to that on which the Bill is framed, I <Col N="363" /> would be against it.  I think it is clearly desirable that the obligation should be on the committee of the institute, once it is set up, to get moving as rapidly as possible to the stage where it will have its own laboratory. In the meantime research work may be done under the supervision of the institute in some other laboratory, but it must be clear that the principle on which the Bill is framed is that industrial research requires an institute and that it is intended that the institute will do its work through its own laboratories and staffs, not through the laboratories and staffs of university colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with the Minister that he must set up an institute that will do the work itself and will have facilities for doing it, but that is not my point. I would, perhaps, go further than he has gone.  I suggest that the only way to get research of this nature done is to set up your institute with your own staffs and laboratories.  Section 18 provides that it shall carry out such research.  The difficulty is that certain small problems may have to be settled elsewhere.  As a safety precaution, I want to make the intention completely clear&mdash;that the institute will have full power to deal with research, and that it will not be hampered in any way. It is in that sense that I have moved the amendment and not with any desire that the work should be sent to the university or other laboratories.</P>

The functions of the institute are defined in Section 5.  They are to undertake, encourage and foster scientific research and investigation.  It seems clear to me that there is nothing in the Bill which limits the committee as regards the research work done in its own laboratories.  It can, in fact, arrange to assist and foster research work done elsewhere.  In so far as that is the purpose of the amendment, I can assure the Deputy that it is not necessary.</P>

If a manufacturer applies for the right to attach to a commodity produced by him a standard mark, then certain consequences follow under the section. The person who attaches the standard mark to goods or sells goods in some <Col N="365" /> form which would lead people to believe that they are of standard specification when they are not, commits an offence.

      <P>The object of the section is very properly to promote the training of people in research, and without some encouragement for the training of research workers the institute would very quickly suffer for want of staff.  Proceeding further, if it is going to be research worthy of the name, whether industrial or applied, taking it most realistically, persons engaged on that work, and particularly with the higher aspects, will have to be graduates of a university. There is no use in thinking that you can take a man, give him an elementary smattering in physics or chemistry, then put him in as a type of specialist and make him a full-scale research worker.  That will not work.  Work in research presupposes a general broad background of knowledge, applicable to a wide range, that can be brought to bear on the problem, but that knowledge must be broad enough to embrace all the ways around the problem as well as directly through it.  That particular education can only be secured by going through the equivalent to a university course.  Therefore, the basic training of our research workers, whether in so-called pure fundamental research or industrial research work, must be the same.  For that reason, I suggest that the limitation should not be there, that the actual first stages of training, and the best type of training that can be given for research work, is broader research training as given in our colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is going to be practically impossible to train a research worker on the actual job of research work itself because of the preliminaries involved. The question is: what does this word industrial research mean?  To every gentleman sitting in an office it may be easy to say, or even for lawyers to say.  In practice, the situation is very different.  The fact is that industrial application to industrial work has invariably originated in the laboratory, <Col N="368" /> and is so-called pure research work.  On the other hand, as I mentioned on another section, there is hardly an industrial problem of any size that is undertaken as industrial research, which does not involve some &ldquo;pure research&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In 1939 it was, shall I say, only the most theoretical physicists who were at all interested in uranium.  Uranium was merely a chemical curiosity to theoretical science, and the phenomenon of nuclear fission was important to theoretical physicists and mathematicians, and beyond that nobody was very interested.  In 1945-46 there is a very different situation.  Quite apart from the question of its application to war, arising out of the mathematicians' calculations you are faced in the bigger countries with a revolution in power production&mdash;a revolution of a magnitude which could not have been foreseen when such things were being considered in their initial stages of experimentation. If ever there was pure research, it was the research of the physicists and the mathematicians at that stage.  If ever there was a practicable job of industrial research, involving all the organisation necessary for research, it was the work done on the American continent in connection with nuclear fission which culminated, not only in the so-called atomic bomb but in other chemical discoveries as well.</P>
    <P>Where did radio start?  Where did the whole field of wireless start?  It started with Maxwell's equations.  It seems, perhaps, pedantic to labour this here, but I do want to drive home the very crucial point that you cannot draw a line between pure research and applied research.  Not only can you not determine what is of practicable application or what is not, but in the actual solution of your problem you will constantly have to go back again to pure research standpoints.</P>
    <P>Now, I want the institute to be absolutely free to endow research where it knows that such will be of benefit to it in the carrying out of its functions.  The Minister has pointed out, in dealing with another section, that this institute will be composed of commonsense, responsible members. Everybody subscribes to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> If they are going to be commonsense, responsible members they are not going to fritter away the money placed at their disposal to carry out research on wild-goose schemes.  They can be trusted to that extent.  But, apart from the question of training for research work and the grants necessary for that, there is the wider question that your research worker must be trained in general research.  Scholarships and other awards should be made available for that.</P>
    <P>I must touch now upon another problem mentioned by the Minister in his reply on the Second Reading to a point I made in relation to electro-chemists. The Minister said that at the moment electro-chemical industries would be uneconomic here.  The point is that if we are going to undertake industrial research in this country we want some place where we can train at least a percentage of electro-chemists. At the moment we have none.  We must train those, not with a view to establishing an electro-chemical industry but in order to have them available to assist in the problems which will arise in industrial research, such as corrosion and rusting.  Rusting is a problem which will be of immense practical importance.  It is a problem which is very closely tied up with industrial research.  Corrosion and rusting are also tied up with electrochemistry.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the institute will have a responsible director and will itself be a responsible institute, with problems upon which to spend the money placed at its disposal and with facilities for carrying out the work for which it is founded, I think it should not be restricted by this misleading word &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; but that it should be free to promote its own interests and facilitate its own functions, for instance, if it appears to the institute that it would be of assistance to them to endow some piece of research work which, on the face of it, appears to be purely academic, or in the training of staff, or the prosecution of its own researches, I would strongly urge upon the Minister to delete the word &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; in sub-section (1).</P>

      <P>It is not necessary for me to enter into a discussion as to where pure research ends and industrial research begins.  It is not necessary to assert that all industrial progress has its origins in the laboratories of the pure research workers.  Nobody is disputing that.  What I am determined upon is that the very limited funds available to this institute are going to be spent on industrial research and on nothing else.  I am not dealing with the research organisations available to the State.  It is no part of my function to subscribe to the view that more money must be spent on training research workers or on the training of electro-chemists.  That is the function of the Minister for Education and the universities.  I am strongly opposed to this amendment.  I want to make it quite clear that any awards made by this institute or any scholarships provided under Section 33 will be confined to industrial research and will be used for no other purpose except to facilitate the training of industrial research workers.  Any case that has to be made for improving the present educational facilities or the giving of better training in scientific subjects to university graduates must be addressed to the Minister for Education.  That is his function. The function of this institute is to carry out industrial research and Section 33 is designed to ensure that its funds will be spent on matters directly relevant to the training of industrial research workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hardly think that is necessary.

I think the wording of Section 5 is quite adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  The institute may, with the approval of the Minister, purchase or procure apparatus and equipment for the use of universities and institutions where persons are trained in research, provided that such apparatus and equipment shall remain the property of the institute and provided that the industrial research committee are of opinion that such purchase or procurement will encourage or foster, directly or indirectly, scientific research as in Section 5 hereinbefore set out.</P>
      <P>This amendment runs very much on the same lines as the amendment which I have just moved.  It is for the purpose of enabling the institute to purchase equipment and apparatus, to be used by another laboratory if necessary, for the training of research students in the prosecution of its own functions.  A problem might arise similar to the problem I mentioned in relation to a laboratory of spectroscopy.  In the course of some research, which the institute has undertaken, it may be necessary to get some such apparatus. The difference is merely between the procuring of this apparatus and working with existing facilities, or the procuring of a whole laboratory.  That is the first reason for this amendment. The second reason hinges upon what I have already said.  I still feel that there is grave danger the institute will not be as independent as the Minister hopes it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its independence will ultimately depend on the flow of graduates, the training of graduates, and the supply of research workers within the State. If they are to be suitably trained for the purposes of the institute it will be necessary to set up or endow training <Col N="372" /> schools.  There are two solutions: either the institute will find itself blossoming out into a super-university or else provision of the necessary facilities will have to be made in the existing schools.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (3) to add the words &ldquo;with all the privileges as to the number of days of sitting in each week and otherwise in fact enjoyed by him in the discharge of his duties before the operation date.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that those Dublin metropolitan magistrates who have been serving for some years past in that capacity will continue to have in their new appointment the same privileges, if that is the proper word, as they have in fact enjoyed from the practice of the court and the tradition of the court since it was established as a District Court, but going back years before the establishment of the District Court, when it was the Dublin Metropolitan Court.  I think it will be agreed that the district justice practising as a Dublin metropolitan justice has imposed on him in the discharge of his duties a much <Col N="374" /> severer strain than any other justice practising throughout the country.  It has been the tradition and the practice in this court from before it became the District Court and when it was the Dublin Metropolitan Court that the presiding magistrate should not have to sit more than a given number of days a week; four days a week, I think, was the number required in each case.  That was found to be the maximum which any magistrate could be reasonably expected to stand, having regard to the number of cases, the volume of the work that came before him, and the type of cases with which he had to deal. I think there can be no doubt that the Dublin District Court has a huge volume of business of a type which imposes a very great strain on the mental balance of a presiding justice. For the purpose of securing that the conditions existing for many years past will not be changed in this Bill this amendment is put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change proposed. As a matter of fact, the powers in this section are contained in Section 5 of the Court Officers (Amendment) Act, 1937.  In practice, the Minister for Justice delegated to the senior justice the fixing of the hours for the court sittings.  The reason that Section 5 was included in that Act and the provisions continued in this Bill is that if a justice went a bit queer and said, &ldquo;We will only sit two days a week&rdquo; or fixed hours which would not be suitable, the Minister could fix the times.  All we are doing in this section is continuing that power.  In practice, the same thing will happen.</P>
      <P>The intention is to delegate to the principal justice in each case the arrangement of the hours in order to suit the convenience of the court. The presumption is that it will be found satisfactory.  If, however, what I have stated should happen, it would be outrageous to think that someone should not have authority to say: &ldquo;This will not do at all; solicitors and other people are complaining.&rdquo; That has not happened, but it could happen.  It is for that reason that the safeguard was inserted in the 1937 Act and is continued in this Bill.  For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is merely to provide that the Minister will not act without the consent of the presiding justice of the division.  Section 7 provides that an ordinary justice may from time to time be transferred by the Minister from his division to another division.

      <P>I think the Minister should reconsider this matter.  The Bill gives him considerable powers as to the manner in which business will be dealt with by the District Courts. All courts, certainly all superior courts, have complete control in ordering their own business, and it is a matter within the discretion of the judge as to how business will be dealt with.  It is a reflection on district justices that they are unable to manage their own affairs if the Minister must regulate in what circumstances the work will be carried out.  Under this Bill you have a principal justice in each division.  If this section is enacted it will mean that the principal justice will be without control over the management and distribution of business in his court.

      <P>There is no use in the Minister saying that I can accept his assurance that certain practices will be carried out.  That binds nobody, not even the Minister, however honourable his intentions may be.  The section contains the bad principle to which I adverted on the Second Reading.  It gives the Department control over the judicial business of the courts.  I referred to the dispute that arose in 1926 over that very same matter when the Courts Officers Act was going through the House.  This section will enable the Minister to transfer an ordinary justice, not merely without the consent of the head of the division, but without his own consent.  In principle that is entirely wrong and the Minister should accept, if not this amendment, at least an amendment which will provide that the man himself should give consent to his transfer before the Minister operates this power.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with <Col N="377" /> that.  If you look at Section 6 (1) you will see that the principal justice shall arrange for the distribution of business amongst the several justices of the division.  He has power to do that.  It could happen that a justice might not have a full day's work or a week's work and he might take things easily and say, &ldquo;I am all right where I am and in another section there might be too much work.&rdquo;  That might be his attitude and the right to remedy that position should rest with the Minister.  If anything goes wrong with a court, it is here the matter is ventilated.  A Deputy may put down a question to know why a court adjourned at 2 o'clock when business was in arrears in another area.  That could occur.</P>
      <P>We assume we will have reasonable people to deal with and that these things will not happen, but you might get some crotchety person who may say, &ldquo;I am all right here; I have only one or two hours a day and that is quite enough for me.&rdquo;  Other people might not think so.  An average day's work should be done.  I am quite satisfied that in practically every case it will be done, but, should it not be done, the right should rest with the Minister to see that the work is fairly allocated. One section might be overworked and the principal justice might say, &ldquo;We have too much to do here.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That might be said from the bench and the next thing would be: &ldquo;Why not appoint someone to help him?&rdquo;  In an adjoining section there may be some slackness in the work and should we leave a man there with not enough to do while another justice would have too much to do?  The alternative would be to appoint a temporary district justice.  We should not be prevented from having the power to insist on a change being made and I must resist this amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the House should not countenance the suggestion that any person appointed to a judicial office will be inclined to shirk his work or do anything improper.  We must act on the assumption that every person appointed to judicial office, even the lowest in the judicial hierarchy, will act properly and in accordance <Col N="378" /> with the law.  The insertion of this power for the Minister in a section of this kind is an abrogation of the principle of the independence of the judiciary. It is a matter of principle so far as I am concerned, and for this House to say that because some district justice may at some time not do his duty, therefore the Minister, in his political capacity, should have power to interfere with the courts of justice is a thing that the House should not give any adherence to.  The section clearly gives power to the Minister to interfere with the conduct of judicial business without the consent of the person whose duty it is to conduct that business.  The Minister says he is afraid some Deputy will ask a question.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>Before Section 14, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>A barrister or solicitor, who actually practised his profession for not less than six years, shall not be ineligible for appointment as a justice by reason only of the fact that he is for the time being not practising his profession, if he holds for the time being an office in respect of which it was (at the time of his appointment thereto) required by statute that every person appointed thereto should be or should have been&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> (a)  a practising solicitor, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a practising barrister or a practising solicitor.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to provide that when the appointment of a district justice is being made, if there is a man in full time employment as an official, who has the qualifying period of six years, acting either as a solicitor or a barrister, he shall not be precluded from the appointment by reason of the fact that he is not practising at the time the vacancy occurs.  An examiner of title in the Land Commission may be a solicitor or a barrister.  He may have been six years practising but took an official post.  The same would apply to county registrars.  The object here is to enable the Minister if he thought fit to appoint any such persons district justices.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 7, to delete the words &ldquo;sixty-five&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;seventy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister has no objection to my amendment.  I think it is undesirable that district justices should be retirable at 65 when judges in the other courts are allowed to continue in office until 70.  In fact, in recent years the Act was amended and the age extended to 72.  The extension of the age limit in the case of judges in the High Courts, the Dublin Metropolitan Courts and in the County Borough of Cork was from 65.  I see no reason why district justices should not be capable of carrying out their duties after 65 in the same way as other judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I do not see any reason why a district justice is not likely to be as fit to carry out his duties at from 65 to 70 as any other official.  In the case of a sheriff, an office that <Col N="384" /> requires much more activity, the retiring age is 70.  While I am not prepared to press the amendment, I strongly urge the Minister to consider it, and if he cannot accept it, to make some provision whereby a man who reaches 65, and is fit to carry on, should be allowed to remain at least until 70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be utterly opposed to any discretionary power being given any Minister to allow any particular justice to remain on after a given age.  The same rule should apply whether it is 65 or 70, and there should be no discretion whatever to allow a particular person to continue on, merely because he happened to be <i>persona grata</i> with some Minister or political party.  I support the amendment. Presumably there is not much difference between the position of a district justice and a judge of the Circuit or High Court.  I have already ineffectively drawn the Minister's attention to another matter.  The Minister has the added power in connection with district justices, that he can in accordance with Section 7, to which I took strong objection on the Second Stage, appoint a judge of the High Court or the Circuit Court to inquire into the health of a district justice.  If he has that power in this Bill then the retiring age should be 70.  If, after 65 a man is not capable of carrying on then that power could be exercised.</P>

      <P>Apart altogether from that, there is a recognised rule in the public service&mdash;and in my opinion it is a very good rule&mdash;that all public servants should retire at the age of 65. I do not see why any exception should be made in the case of judges or district justices to that very proper rule.  If we are to solve the problem of unemployment in this country&mdash;I do not say that we will solve it to any great extent by employing more of the <Col N="385" /> legal profession on the bench&mdash;there must be a recognised rule in regard to the age of retirement from the public service and from public service companies. I fully support the present position.  I hope the lawyer Deputies will not press this to a division.  If they do, and the Minister stands over the 65 rule, I shall go out with the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment submitted by Deputy Cosgrave.  I am as interested in the workers as Deputy Davin.  My experience is that when men retire at 65 they immediately enter into competition outside.  I think the comparison made by him is not quite relevant in the case of district justices, or in relation to any possible solution of the unemployment problem.  District justices are not made every day.  Lawyers are not made every day.  It is a difficult matter to get a good, sound lawyer and the Government should be fully aware of the position there in view of the costly litigation which has taken place recently involving the State in an expenditure of tens of thousands of pounds. If you have a man who knows his work you should keep him.  There is nothing consistent in the action of a Government keeping a High Court judge on until 70 years of age and asking a district justice to retire at 65.  This country is not composed of millionaires. It is a small country and it is a comparatively poor country.  We cannot afford the luxury of retiring men at 65 years of age if at that point they are still competent to carry out duties which they have been carrying out for, possibly, 30 years previously.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one, and I think there should be no difference of opinion on it.  The Minister should see the force of the arguments submitted by the various Deputies in favour of the amendment.  The amendment has been subscribed to by Deputy O'Connor, though he introduced that we thing called &ldquo;discretion&rdquo;&mdash;in certain cases the Minister could if he so desired, extend the time.  That has been done in regard to the railways. There, men who have reached 65 have got an extension of time to 70 because of their usefulness and because of the <Col N="386" /> manner in which they discharge their duties.</P>

      <P>I could give you hundreds of cases of tradesmen having got extensions of anything from three to five years.  I know a man who retired last week at 73 years of age. However, I think the less said about the railway, the better.  It is a fact that the time has been extended.  From the practical point of view, I prefer to employ a man at 50 years of age than to employ lads who are knocking around at 25 or 26.  It is not a question of years.  It is a question of hard work.  It is a question of the stuff of which a man is made and the will power he has to carry out his duties faithfully and well.  I think there is much to be said in favour of the amendment submitted by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to keep ourselves right, I would inform Deputy Coburn that I myself am not very keen on this business at all.  As a matter of historical accuracy, he voted for a measure passed through this House setting up a company called Córas Iompair Éireann.  One provision in that measure makes it compulsory for all workers engaged in that industry to retire at 65.  I moved an amendment on the Committee Stage for the purpose of applying a similar provision to the directors and it was turned down. It is correct to state that, with the exception of the directors, all other servants of the company are compulsorily retired at 65.  Whenever the railway servants, however, are given an extension, they are given that extension only for a year and on the recommendation of the medical officer that they are physically fit.</P>

      <P>I wonder is Deputy Davin right in drawing an analogy between railway workers and lawyers.  Railway work, as Deputy Davin knows, is laborious, heavy work. The work done by lawyers is purely intellectual. Anybody who knows the history of our legal profession knows the greatest judgments of all time were given by men past 65, past 70, and past 75.</P>

      <P>Probably Deputy Davin did not pick up that bit of history. He says the same rule should apply to all public servants.  Surely, he is not serious in suggesting that there is an analogy between public servants and lawyers.  Lawyers consider themselves quite young when they are appointed on the High Court Bench at 65.  A legal training seems to have a peculiar effect; the training involved in it and their subsequent intellectual development has some reaction which seems to keep both their minds and bodies young and fresh.  I think it would be fatal to throw out such a man at 65.  Because of his experience he is a definite benefit to the community.  There should be no discretion. The time limit should be the same for all.  There should be no implication or suggestion of a possibility of wire-pulling in the administration of the law or in connection with those administering it.  I think the Minister would be foolish in insisting on 65 in the case of district justices when other <Col N="388" /> judicial appointments extend to 70. If anything, the district justice has an easier job.  His court is one of summary jurisdiction.  If there is any case to be made it is a case rather for shortening the age of retirement for High Court judges.</P>

      <P>I should like to have the Deputy's views on that subject.  It would be giving practical effect to his own principles in relation to his own job in the House.  There is no question of principle involved in this amendment. The real ground on which the amendment can be based is that district justices, in common with other judicial appointees, should be appointed after a fairly long period actively in practice. If that is so, then they will require a number of years before they can earn a judicial pension and the age of 65 would not normally allow them to earn that pension.  That, I think, is really the only ground on which an amendment of this kind can properly be based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a tendency to appoint to the District Courts very young practitioners who have not, in my view, sufficiently long experience for these responsible positions.  I think that is not right, because before a person is appointed to be a district justice he should have had far more than the statutory qualifications by way of experience. That is the only ground on which I support this amendment&mdash;in order that there shall be people appointed to the District Court bench after having had considerably more years of active practice than would merely qualify them for the position. If that is so, then by the time they <Col N="389" /> reach 65, they would not have qualified for a pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the point Deputy Costello has made, the fact is that the tendency is quite the other way.  It is only to-day that I happened to look at the list of names and the ages of those appointed district justices.  I was looking at it to see the average age at which district justices were appointed. I found that in the early days up to 1930 several district justices under 30 years of age were appointed.</P>
      <P>There has not been one of that age appointed under this Government.  One was appointed at the age of about 33 and most of the others were 36, 37 and 40.  Therefore, there is no foundation for Deputy Costello's statement.  If the Deputy wishes, I can get him the age of every justice appointed and he will find that what I am saying is correct: that the average age of those appointed in the last 14 years is higher than it was under the last Government.</P>
      <P>At the moment the position is that all justices, with the exception of those in Dublin City and Cork City, must retire at 65.  I am proposing that the same rule shall apply to the cities, with the exception of those justices who at present are to retire at 70.  In future, all district justices will retire at 65; that is, that district justices in Dublin and Cork will be put in the same position as the district justices in other parts of the country.  There certainly was a case for it when the last Government decided on that rule because, although there may not be so much brain work as Deputy McMenamin suggests, there certainly is more physical work required from a district justice. He has to travel all over his district in all sorts of weather.  I am sure that was in the mind of the Oireachtas when that was passed.  It is well known that in the City of Dublin the strain on the justices is far greater than it is on country justices, but a country justice has to travel to all sorts of places in all kinds of weather.</P>

I think the age of 70 ought to be sufficient for High Court judges.  I am putting all the district justices on the same footing. Deputy Cosgrave wants district justices, who at present must retire at 65, to retire at 70.  Of course, I cannot agree to that.</P>

      <P>I could not allow the Minister's statement with reference to the appointment of district justices during the earlier period of this State to pass.  During those years the conditions were entirely different.  When the District Courts were set up in 1923, a man who was appointed a district justice took his life into his hands. You had to get young men to do the work at that time.  That was the position from 1923 to 1930.  You could not ask elderly men to do it, or men who had passed the first bloom of their youth.  The conditions were entirely different and they are changed now. It is not a matter of very great importance to compare what was done from 1923 to 1932 with the conditions from then until 1946.  But the point must be stressed that the district justice appointed from 1923 onwards literally took his life in his hands.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give any assurance that he will do something about the maximum number of years required for a full pension? The Minister told us that the average age of appointment is from 38 to 40. A justice must serve 30 years before he gets full pension; so that in the large majority of cases justices cannot get a full pension.  The law provides that the full pension is given after 30 years.  A justice does not get a <Col N="391" /> chance to serve 30 years.  I suggest to the Minister that, if he retains the age limit at 65, he at least should reduce the number of years required for the maximum pension to 25, so that the majority of the men appointed would have a chance of getting a full pension.</P>

      <P>I said on the Second Reading I would look into that matter. I have been looking into it.  On the whole, I think the pension conditions are not bad.  Perhaps I can leave it open for some other time.  I cannot do it under this Bill.  I would have to consult other people before I could do anything about it.  I think most of the justices get a fair pension, if not the full pension.  Very few, I admit, will get the full pension.  There is something to be considered there, but I cannot do it under this Bill.  The average age of appointment, I think, would be about 40.  That would mean that they would have only 25 years' service and that they could not get the full pension.</P>

      <P>In line 21, to delete the words &ldquo;a judge&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;two judges.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to have two judges instead of one reporting on a district justice.  I spoke on this section on the Second Reading and I do not propose to repeat what I said then. The whole section is objectionable.  The objection may be softened if there were two judges instead of one reporting on the conduct of a district justice.  One judge may possibly be prejudiced and there will be a far greater degree of security and impartiality by two judges submitting a unanimous report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one judge is quite sufficient.  What the judge will be asked to do is to investigate the position of a district justice.  The President will be asked to nominate a judge of the High Court to make an investigation into some matter affecting the health or conduct of a district justice.  Deputy Costello, on an earlier stage, seemed to think that would worsen the position of district justices.  I pointed out it would do no such thing, that under the law at the moment the position is that a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, and <Col N="395" /> the Attorney-General will prepare a certificate and the Government, on that certificate, may dismiss a district justice.  Under this proposal a district justice can be dismissed only by a resolution of both Houses.  I think that is an added safeguard to the position of the district justice.</P>
      <P>The proposal is that an impartial, competent person, like a judge, will inquire into whatever allegations may be made affecting the health or conduct of a district justice, if there is any doubt about it.  This is giving an extra protection.  Two judges would not be satisfactory; you would need three to have a majority.  The judge will make a confidential report and, if there is no case, the matter will not be proceeded with.  If the judge decides there is a case, the whole matter will be brought before both Houses. The position of a particular district justice was mentioned here and I would be very glad if I had the right to ask the Chief Justice to appoint a judge.  The only way it could be dealt with at present would be to set up a tribunal of inquiry, such as we had recently.  I think that is too cumbersome and not necessary.  The provision in the section I would regard as a very good one.  If anything, it provides an extra safeguard for district justices.</P>

In any circumstances, it is undesirable to have one man delivering a decision on another man who has almost equal status. There is only a question of making a report to the Minister and, in order that there might be no doubt as to the impartiality of that report, two men should be appointed to carry out the work.  As Deputy Costello has stated, if there is only one man appointed to make the report, he might have a bias against the person upon whom he was reporting.  It is not likely that you would get two men who would be similarly biased.  I think the provision in this Bill is open to certain danger and the Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Even though the provision <Col N="396" /> in the section improves the present position as the Minister pointed out, the objection I have to it is that once the report is made, if that report is an adverse one, the Minister can hold the report over the head of the district justice and threaten to have a motion tabled in the Dáil and the Seanad to remove him from office.  The fact that it improves the position in the earlier Acts does not mean that it is a good provision.  If a district justice has the same tenure as a Circuit Court judge or a High Court judge, he should have the same rights and privileges.  It is in my view a serious commentary on the system under which people are appointed as district justices, that because of a certain suspicion of them provision must be made for an inquiry of this kind.  For that reason I support the amendment and oppose the section.</P>

      <P>Suppose we do get an adverse report, as the Deputy suggests, one which we felt would justify us in going to the Dáil and Seanad to ask that the district justice should be removed from office, would it not be much better to have that report, let the district justice know that we got it and inform him that unless he resigned we proposed to take the necessary steps in the Dáil and Seanad to have him removed from office?  I see nothing objectionable in that course.  There is provision in another section, which enables a district justice to retire at an age earlier than the normal age of retirement. I think this section, instead of being a defect in the Bill, will be a great help.  The position is that if a district justice does not resign after being requested to do so we can say to him, &ldquo;Well, you will have to be removed from office.&rdquo;  I think instead of this being an objectionable provision, as Deputy Cosgrave says, it is quite the reverse.

Deputy Costello, or those associated with him, may have done their best according to their lights in the circumstances prevailing at that time but it does not follow that because it was done then it should be adhered to.

      <P>I want to register my protest against this section.  I spoke, as I have already said, at length on the Second Reading Stage of the Bill in connection with this section and there is no point in repeating what I said. The Minister has just stated, however, that district justices were in a completely different position from other judges from 1924 onwards.  He seems to regard that as a justification for this section.  As Deputy Cosgrave has just stated, the mere fact that district justices were treated in an earlier Act differently from other judicial personages is no reason why that discrimination should be continued.  Actually strong exception was taken by a <Col N="398" /> variety of people to the provisions of the 1924 Act dealing with district justices.</P>
      <P>The conditions which existed in 1924 when these provisions about district justices were inserted in the Act were entirely different from those which now exist.  In 1924 the scheme had been in operation for only 12 months. It was a new scheme, an experimental judicial effort, something that this country had not before.  This country had suffered from what was known as removable magistrates under the British.  It was desired that these justices should not be removable, as far as it was possible to avoid that and it was hoped that, if the experiment proved a success, as it proved a success, they would be put on a parity and have the same constitutional position as Circuit Court judges and High Court judges.  The District Court has proved to be a success and the Minister has gone a little further than the Act of 1936, but I objected to the provisions of the Act of 1936 when it was going through.  In Section 19 of this Bill he purports to give the same tenure of office to District Court judges as High Court judges and circuit judges have.  Having given them that concession in Section 19 with one hand, he takes it away with the other hand in Section 20, in which he gives this power to report on the conduct of a justice to a judge.  I object to this section and register my protest against it as strongly as I possibly can.</P>

      <P>May I raise a point of order at this stage?  Amendment No. 70 on the Order Paper seems to me to be an amendment of first class importance and one that is out of order. One of the outstanding principles of the Bill, as introduced by the Minister, was that an endeavour would be made to establish harmonious relations between the rights of employers and workers without interfering in any way with the right to strike were sections outside to take either strike action or lock out action.  Amendment No. 70 seems to me to cut completely across that principle, and to introduce a principle which is entirely out of order in the light of the Bill as drafted.  It proposes <Col N="401" /> that, in Section 30, the court having made an order of a particular kind &ldquo;may by order declare the said strike unlawful&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), pages 4 and 5, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;labour&rdquo; in page 4, line 42 to the end of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>The section sets out the type of person to whom this Bill this refers.  It defines as a worker</P>
      <P>&ldquo;any person of the age of 14 years or upwards who has entered into or workers under a contract with an employer whether the contract be for manual labour, clerical work, or otherwise, be expressed or implied, oral or in writing, and whether it be a contract of service or of apprenticeship or a contract personally to execute any work or labour...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It goes on to indicate, however, that the term worker shall not include for the purposes of this Bill</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  a person who is employed by or under the State, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a teacher in a secondary school, or</P>
      <P>(c)  a teacher in a national school, or</P>
      <P>(d)  a person who is employed by a local authority in any office or employment, or</P>
      <P>(e)  an officer or servant of a vocational education committee, or</P>
      <P>(f)  an officer or servant of a committee of agriculture, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> (g)  an officer of school attendance committee, or</P>
    <P>(h)  an agricultural worker, within the meaning of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that, when considering the application of this Bill for the purpose set out in the Title, or when surveying the scope of this measure, and the classes which will be affected by it, we have to remember from reading this section that a large number of persons will be excluded from any resort to the provisions of the Bill, as a means of regulating wages and conditions of employment, which the Bill is primarily intended to deal with.  It seems to me that in respect to agricultural workers especially, the Government are excluding from the scope of this Bill a class of workers who ought to be the first to be brought within its scope.</P>
    <P>There is a large number of agricultural workers throughout the country. All the indications in recent months point to the fact that it will be necessary to provide some satisfactory alternative to the present unsatisfactory Agricultural Wages Board as a means of avoiding disputes in the agricultural industry.  Yet, in face of what the indications are, this Bill is drafted in such a way as to exclude from its scope agricultural workers, who will be thereby denied the right of access to the machinery set up under this Bill.  Similarly, civil servants are likewise excluded.  Teachers of all kinds are excluded.  Employees of local authorities, no matter how menial their employment may be, are similarly denied access to the machinery provided in this Bill.  I do not know on what grounds the State can say to industrial workers: &ldquo;We are going to provide machinery for the settlement of your disputes; we are not going to permit that machinery to be applied to our greatest sphere of activity, namely, the agricultural industry.&rdquo; Nor can we understand why the State, having recommended private employers to set up machinery of this kind for the settlement of disputes in respect of their employees and which arise out of their employment, at the same time denies to its <Col N="404" /> own employees, the State servants, the right of access either to this or to some closely allied machinery.  But that is, in effect, what the State is doing.  It is saying to the very large class of State employees, such as civil servants, to teachers, to employees of local authorities, and to hundreds of thousands of agricultural workers: &ldquo;You are not going to have any access to the machinery set up under this Bill.&rdquo;  I do not know on what grounds the Minister can justify excluding such a large variety of classes from the scope of this Bill.  Nor can I understand on what grounds he thinks he can morally justify a Bill of this kind to employers when he himself denies to his own employees&mdash;that is, the State servants&mdash;the right of access to this type of machinery.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be on much stronger ground, and the attitude of the State would be much more justifiable, if, having declared that the Industrial Relations Bill was essential to the preservation of good relations in the spheres of activity covered by this Bill, the Minister also indicated that the Government was willing similarly to introduce legislation for the purpose of providing an equally satisfactory method of settling disputes in those spheres in which the Government is the employer.  I move this amendment for the purpose of making it clear that the provisions of Section 4 ought not to deny access to the machinery of this Bill to the very wide categories of workers who are now excluded from the provisions of Section 4 because of the manner in which that section is drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that if this Bill is to be a success at all it should make no exclusion in relation to any particular section of workers.  In relation to civil servants, I indicated the viewpoint of the members on these benches on the Second Reading.  We understood then that a form of arbitration was to be made known to the Civil Service not later than the end of June by the Minister for Finance.  So far as I am aware, there has been no indication that that has been done.  We are discussing this Bill at a vital stage.  Quite obviously, we cannot depart from that section of <Col N="405" /> the Bill which excludes a large section of workers, rendering important service to the State, and leave them in the position in which they are now.  When the Minister is replying to this particular amendment we should be glad if, in the light of the information which I am sure he has, he would clearly indicate what is to be the future position so far as civil servants are concerned. Their position is on all-fours with teachers.  I cannot conceive the House departing from this particular section and leaving the teachers, whether they be primary, secondary, or vocational, in that position.  I think we must all agree that if we had had machinery of this kind the present trouble in relation to the primary teachers would not have occurred.  It is quite obvious that some measures will have to be taken to avoid a repetition of the present position.</P>
      <P>There is, however, no indication as to what the policy is.  The Bill deliberately excludes primary teachers from the scope of its function.  If we are to make this Bill the success the Minister desires it to be, surely it must indicate some form of machinery for all types of teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to have experience of the vocational schools and there you have another section excluded from this Bill &mdash;schools attendance officers.  As far as vocational officers are concerned it is true that they are organised into a trade union.  But they have their grievances.  They deal mainly with committees, which are, to a degree in any case, absolute in their jurisdiction except in matters appertaining to salaries and conditions of service, when they are subject to the overriding authority of the Minister for Education. I know that they have grievances in regard to their salaries and conditions of service.  The members of the local authorities are inclined to be sympathetic towards their demands but there is, as I say, the veto of the Minister over which the members of the committee have no control whatever.  I suggest that circumstances might arise where these vocational education officers would have grievances and where there would be no machinery to avert trouble. Apart altogether from any trouble which might arise, in common justice <Col N="406" /> to the individuals concerned some machinery should be placed at their disposal in order to adjust disputes.</P>
    <P>The section also excludes all workers under local authorities.  The Minister was not present in the House during a discussion on a very controversial Bill. Had he been here on that occasion he would have got the reaction of the members of the House as a whole towards a system which has developed and which is known as the managerial system.  The managerial system imposes certain restrictions on the local authority.  One of them removes public representatives from all contacts with the staffs.  To some people that may be a desirable state of affairs. From my own experience I know that so far as it relates particularly to the clerical staff the activities of the Department are hidden behind a veil of secrecy, so to speak.  The local authorities are cut away from administration; the staffs have no right of appeal; they have no tribunal.</P>
    <P>I always thought one of the great defects of the Managerial Act, as distinct from others, was the fact that it precluded anything in the nature of an appeals tribunal, composed of members of the local authorities.  The individual members have no rights.  No doubt they can make their applications or their appeals for consideration in the matter of increased remuneration or improved conditions to the county manager.  Unfortunately, we have only too many examples of where, even when the county manager makes representations favourable to the staffs, the Minister concerned either delays giving effect to these recommendations or only carries them out in part.  As a sample of that I can cite an example, which is within the knowledge of the Minister and which was given here only last week.  Deputy Norton, in relation to Kildare County Council, found it necessary to raise a question about a man who was allocated to a particular grade some 18 months ago under that council; he applied for the necessary adjustment upwards on his allocation to that grade.  It actually took a Parliamentary Question in this House by Deputy Norton last week to ensure that that man's grievance received attention&mdash;18 <Col N="407" /> months after the application was made.  No doubt, were it not for the fact that the individual in question had the means, through a Deputy of this House, to draw attention to this matter he might possibly have waited another 18 months.  Behind that is another aspect which is worthy of consideration: that the Minister for Local Government in a recent circular intimated to the staffs of local authorities that they must not approach public representatives, particularly with regard to the question of promotion or favours that might be related to promotion.  But there are other matters connected with the staffs of local authorities, such as the question of the right of transference from office to office, in regard to which they may feel justified in making representations.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the present position in regard to local authorities is distinctly unsatisfactory.  In the first place, a man may make application and the county manager may recommend it, and that is the last that may be heard of it for an indefinite period.  There is no Deputy here who could not quote cases of that kind.  So far as it refers to the clerical staff, this might lead to a very positive form of grievance in future, if the present policy is continued.  I suggest that, if there is one section more than another which is entitled to be protected at least from the reactions of the managerial system, it is the employees of local authorities.  The same thing applies to school attendance officers, although they are not so numerous as the other categories I have referred to. I want to underline what Deputy Norton said in order to indicate that we are anxious to have a declaration so far as arbitration for the Civil Service is concerned, that we are particularly anxious to see what machinery will be provided for the adjustment of disputes in the field of primary, secondary and vocational education in the future, and, particularly, that local authorities will have, if necessary, the machinery of this Bill to adjust their differences.</P>

      <P>If this amendment were accepted by the Minister, it would meet various amendments in the names of members of this Party.  Before we come to the discussion of these amendments, I should like to hear from the Minister why this series of employees are left outside any scheme of arbitration or conciliation machinery.  If, as Deputy O'Sullivan seems to suggest, there is some kind of machinery planned or promised for the Civil Service, then we ought to have heard of it before this.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>June has passed, and we are discussing a measure from which they are definitely excluded.  I think it is due to the House, before we proceed to the final discussion of this section, that we should have some indication from the Minister as to what plans are proposed in respect to civil servants.  Beyond what Deputy O'Sullivan has said, I have not heard anything of them.  The fact is that as long ago as 1932 the Government set up a commission of 17 persons to inquire into certain matters relating to the Civil Service.  They asked the commission to make an interim report on how arbitration could be arranged for the Civil Service.  The second paragraph of the report says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The letters from your Department in which we were notified individually of our appointment, indicated that the commission was expected to `consider first and to submit an interim report on that part of the terms of reference relating to the application of the principle of arbitration already accepted by the Government.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, as long ago as 1932, the Government accepted the principle of arbitration for the Civil Service and the 17 members of this commission reported on it, 12 signing a majority report indicating the lines on which arbitration <Col N="409" /> could be arranged, four signing a minority report saying that the majority did not go far enough, and the remaining member of the commission going still further in a minority report of his own.  I think it is worth while giving the names of the persons who composed that commission&mdash;Mr. Joseph Brennan, the Governor of the Central Bank, Rev. J.E. Canavan, S.J.; Mr. J. R. Coade, Mr. Luke J. Duffy, Mr. J. Condren Flinn, Mr. A.M. Fullerton, Rev. Brother Galvin, The Right Hon. Lord Glenavy, Senator T. Johnston, Mr. Joseph Johnston, Senator Sir John Keane, Mrs. Mary Kettle, Professor William Magennis, Mr. D. O'Donohoe, Mr. J.J. O'Leary, Senator D.L. Robinson and Miss N. Ryan.</P>
    <P>Now, when we are inducing employers and workers throughout the country to come together and set up machinery that will help them, by conciliation and arbitration, to avoid lack of harmony in the carrying out of their work and to avoid disputes which may lead to strikes, is the time for the Government to go back to their earlier enthusiasm and let us hear what they propose to do with regard to civil servants.  I suppose the Government are right in claiming that civil servants are people whom they use as their own direct machinery of administration, that they control all their actions and work, and that in that way they can regard civil servants as being in a special position.  Therefore, it is particularly desirable that we should hear what the Government have to say with regard to civil servants so that we may have a chance of arguing the principle of arbitration and conciliation with regard to civil servants.</P>
    <P>Teachers in secondary schools are in a somewhat different position, although the case for arbitration and conciliation machinery is quite as strong in respect to them as it is in respect to any other section of workers.  The same would apply to the other classes of workers who are excluded from the arbitration and conciliation scheme.  If we are to pass legislation to see that employers and workers will be more harmonious in their working, then surely the State and the State's subsidiaries ought to show how to be model employers, and <Col N="410" /> those who direct the State ought to indicate the lines upon which the best procedure can be adopted to secure harmony between workers and employers.</P>
    <P>If, in these days, when Governments require more power than they ever required, and want to direct more things than ever Governments directed and are, therefore, tending to approach things in a more arbitrary and dictatorial spirit, they are going to take up the attitude towards their employees that no harmonising machinery will come between the State servants or the employees of a local body and the Ministerial direction from on top, then they are certainly acting against all the principles and all the human experience that they appear to appreciate and espouse.  If it is necessary to get conciliation machinery between ordinary workers and employers who are much more close in human relationship than civil servants are to those who direct the Civil Service, there is a greater necessity for introducing some kind of machinery for conciliation and arbitration into Civil Service schemes or the schemes of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable that this proposal should be related to the provisions of the Bill.  There are three classes of workers excluded from the Bill, persons remunerated from public funds, employees of local authorities, and agricultural workers.  What are the provisions of the Bill?  Part III relates to registered agreements. Clearly, that part is completely inapplicable to Government employees of local government employees.  The scheme there is to provide, by a system of registration of agreements, voluntarily negotiated between representatives of workers and employers, first, an assurance of good faith in relation to the agreement and, secondly, an arrangement by which a majority can ensure that equal conditions will apply to all.  That does not affect the State or local authorities.  There is no other Government employing public servants and, therefore, any arrangement made in relation to the remuneration of public servants by the Government does not have to be registered as an agreement under Part <Col N="411" /> III of the Bill, in order to get compliance with the same conditions by other employers of the same class of workers.</P>
      <P>Part IV deals with trade boards and is obviously inapplicable to the employees of the State or employees of local authorities.  Part V deals with registered joint industrial councils and is equally inapplicable.  Part VII deals with standard rate orders and does not apply at all.</P>
      <P>The only part of the Bill that might be regarded as having any relationship to the conditions of employment of State or local government servants is Part VI, which deals with trade disputes&mdash;it could be said to deal with trade disputes of a minor kind.  Major issues affecting the remuneration and conditions of employment of large classes of workers will be dealt with by means of registered agreements or joint industrial councils.  It is mainly where disputes arise affecting groups of workers within a class, or individual workers, or unorganised workers who cannot benefit by registered agreements, that Part VI comes into operation.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that none of the provisions of the Bill is really applicable to the conditions of employment of Government servants or local government officers.  So far as civil servants are concerned.  I doubt if there are any Civil Service organisations which will agree that the provisions of the Bill are suitable to their employment.  I doubt if any Civil Service organisations will agree that the powers proposed to be given to the court to be established under this Bill are the powers that they want given to the conciliation or arbitration body which will deal with their conditions of employment.  The Minister for Finance has under consideration proposals relating to conciliation and arbitration for Civil servants.  He is committed to the introduction of proposals.  These proposals are, I understand, about to be the subject of discussion and consultation with the staff associations concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the purpose of the amendment is merely to get information as to the position in that regard, that purpose <Col N="412" /> is met.  If it is intended to bring civil servants under the provisions of this Bill, the Deputy should consult the Civil Service organisations, because I do not think they would regard the machinery of this Bill as applicable to their conditions.  Neither do I think they are applicable to the conditions of local government employees.  Deputies might indicate which parts of the Bill they think should apply to local government employees.  Part VII, dealing with the recording of standard rate orders, does not apply.  Part V, dealing with registered joint industrial councils, does not apply.  Part IV, dealing with trade boards, does not apply, and Part III, dealing with registered agreements, is hardly applicable.  I cannot see circumstances in which it would be applicable.  The only possible part that might be applied to the conditions of employment of local authorities is Part VI, dealing with trade disputes.</P>
    <P>Turning to the agricultural workers, they are in a somewhat different position. The problem of bringing them under this Bill relates to the diversified nature of their employment and the variation in the conditions of their employment in various parts of the country.  Four of these parts do not apply.  Part VII, dealing with the recording of standard rate Orders, does not apply.  There are no standard rate Orders for agricultural workers.  Their wages have been regulated, in so far as the State has attempted it, by the enforcement of minimum rates determined by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The provision relating to joint industrial councils does not apply; the provision relating to trade boards does not apply, and the registered agreement would be completely inapplicable to the circumstances of agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill might apply.  I must agree there are possibilities of industrial disputes affecting agricultural workers similar in character to those affecting workers in other occupations. I see no objection to amending the Bill so as to make Part VI apply to agricultural workers and permit such workers to have access to the court in relation to any form of trade dispute, although clearly the Agricultural <Col N="413" /> Wages Board must continue and the minimum rates prescribed by the board will in the future, as in the past, be enforceable by law.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in relation to the amendment, I would say that to include all these classes of workers would be inadvisable. So far as civil servants are concerned, this type of machinery is not suitable.  There are, in fact, proposals under consideration and about to be discussed with the staff organisations relating to conciliation and arbitration in the Civil Service.  I am not going to say that the proposals of the Minister for Finance will necessarily be accepted without question by the Civil Service organisations, but I am contending that the position of civil servants and machinery for determining the remuneration and conditions of employment of civil servants must be considered separately from this Bill.</P>
    <P>The same applies to local authorities. The law prescribes that the Minister for Local Government has certain statutory powers and obligations in relation to the remuneration of staffs of local authorities.  There is nothing in the Bill which would be of the slightest assistance to the staffs of local authorities, even if the amendment proposed were adopted and local authorities' officials were brought within its scope.</P>

They apply only to those who are directly employed by the State.  National teachers are remunerated out of State funds and secondary teachers are partially remunerated by the State, but they are not employed by the State; they are employed by the school managers.  The position of local government officials has to be <Col N="414" /> considered in relation to the provisions of local government legislation.</P>

I agree that agricultural workers are in a different position and that we have to reconsider the provisions of the Bill in relation to them. There are four of the five main parts of the Bill that do not apply to them. There is one part that does apply and in relation to that one part I am prepared to give the matter consideration.</P>

      <P>It seems that in order to make a case against the amendment the Minister has chosen the course of putting up a number of Aunt Sallies for <Col N="415" /> the purpose of knocking them down. The Minister proceeded to tell us that the Bill would not be acceptable to civil servants because the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no proposal for arbitration machinery here.  That is why I say that civil servants would not regard the establishment of a tribunal with the powers of the court under this Bill as meeting their demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come to that.  The Minister says that the Civil Service organisations have asked for arbitration, in other words, that they have asked for some type of tribunal to be set up whereby disputes between themselves and the Government may be adjudicated upon by some impartial tribunal instead of having these disputes adjudicated upon by the Department which is their employer or by the Minister for Finance who acts as a kind of super employer for them.  What they want is some type of machinery which would adjudicate on these disputes from time to time.</P>
      <P>This court can be had under Part VI of the Bill.  If the Minister takes the trouble to look up Section 67 he will see there is a provision made by which matters in dispute may be referred to arbitration.  Civil Service organisations have asked the Minister for Finance from time to time to set up some arbitration tribunal, an arbitration tribunal which will adjudicate on their grievances. Although, as Deputy Mulcahy has said, they were promised a scheme of arbitration before the election of 1932, although a similar promise was embodied in the election advertisements prior to the election of 1932, and although the Government declared in 1932 that it accepted the principle of arbitration, the position to-day, 14 year's after the promise was made in public advertisements, is that they have no scheme of arbitration at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Minister says that the Minister for Finance has a scheme of <Col N="416" /> arbitration under consideration.  The last I saw of this scheme was about six months ago.  It was not a scheme of arbitration; it was a perfect fraud from beginning to end.  The Minister knows perfectly well that he would not get a trade union organisation in the country to recognise in it any of the features which are properly and universally accepted as essential features of arbitration.  The scheme which the Minister circulated gave him a prior veto over any matter which the staff wanted to have submitted to arbitration.  In other words, the Minister says: &ldquo;If a dispute arises, you have got to get my consent before you can submit it to arbitration and if I say that it is not to be submitted to arbitration there will be no arbitration.&rdquo; Again, the Minister says: &ldquo;I am free to select whom I like to represent me at that arbitration, but you are not free to select whom you like to represent you.&rdquo;  Then if the case does go to arbitration, the board has to treat its recommendations as a confidential document and send them to the Minister for Finance.  That is what the Minister for Finance is calling arbitration.  He called it a draft scheme of arbitration.  I told the House before that it was a daft scheme of arbitration.  In his own conscience the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows perfectly well that it is a fraudulent scheme of arbitration and did not try to put it over on intelligent people who see quite clearly it is not a scheme of arbitration at all, quite wisely having some knowledge of the boot rolled in the bouquet.</P>
    <P>In lieu of that dud scheme, which the Minister for Finance has in his cupboard, I assert to the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;and I challenge contradiction&mdash;that the staff service organisation will take this tribunal in preference to the Minister's dud scheme, in preference to his &ldquo;no&rdquo; scheme, because they see in Part VI, Section 64 and Section 67 that they can at least get somebody that is impartial or that we intend to be impartial to adjudicate upon whatever dispute arises.  At the present time they can get no one to adjudicate on any dispute which they have.  If the Minister does that, the Civil Service <Col N="417" /> organisations will take this as a substantial advance on the present position.  Let him offer it to them and I tell him the Civil Service organisations will take it because they see in it a vast improvement on the present unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of local authorities officials.  There have been disputes as to road workers' wages throughout the country.  Surely if a dispute arises amongst road workers, they have the right to get somebody to decide on the merits of the dispute?</P>
    <P>We are going to say now to the agricultural worker that we will give him some machinery to do it.  We are going to say to the carpenter, the plasterer, the builder's labourer, the docker and to every other class of industrial or commercial worker that if they have a dispute with their employers we will give them this tribunal to adjudicate on the merits of their claims, and that when the tribunal makes an award, that we will expect them to accept it and expect their employers to accept it as well.  If you give that right to these classes of workers, why not give it to the road worker or to the carpenter employed by a local authority or to the people employed at the Curragh Camp, general labourers there who are paid by the Army Corps of Engineers? Why not give it to these classes of workers, seeing that you are prepared to give it to the workers employed by large and small employers throughout the country?</P>
    <P>Is not the road worker entitled to get the same measure of justice from the State, if this is intended to be a measure of justice, and the same machinery for harmonising his relations with his employers as the carpenter and the docker and the other classes that I have referred to?  That is all that this amendment seeks to do: to say to those people that, if they have got into a dispute with their employers, there is a court which has been constituted in such a way as to make it generally acceptable to which they can go to get the merits of their dispute adjudicated upon.  In that court there will be sensible people to hear their case and to give a verdict upon it.  Why not say to the civil servant, to the teacher, to <Col N="418" /> the road worker or to the people employed by the Department of Defence at the Curragh Camp, that they ought to have a remedy of this kind?  The Minister will not give it to them.  If he wants to harmonise their relations <i>vis á vis</i> their employees, why does he refuse to do for them what he is doing in the Bill in the case of those who are in private employment?  I submit that Sections 64 and 67 provide a means for having all these disputes settled amicably. Would it not be better to do that than have industrial disputes with perhaps strikes dragging on for a considerable time?</P>
    <P>The teachers' strike has now been on for nearly four months.  If this piece of machinery had been in existence the matter could have been dealt with by it, or when it does come into existence the matter could easily have been referred to it.  The Minister, I think, has made no case at all for excluding the classes of workers set out in Section 4. I cannot conceive any valid ground for the Minister objecting to any class of worker in the community going before this court and saying &ldquo;I have got a dispute with my employer; will you adjudicate on the merits of it as you would adjudicate on the merits of any other dispute in which an industrial worker or a commercial worker is concerned&rdquo;? If there is any objection to that course being pursued, the Minister has not told us about it.  He merely talked about the unsuitability of the machinery without showing that the machinery suggested here is something less satisfactory than what the position is at the moment.  These folk that I speak of have no machinery at the moment.  This Bill will give them machinery.  Everyone agrees that it is an improvement on the present unsatisfactory position until something more substantial is put in its place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister replied to three or four of the main points made on the amendment: the question of the civil servants, the question of employees of local authorities and the question of agricultural labourers.  He made no reference to the case that had been made so far as the teachers are concerned. He did not indicate that there was any machinery in view so far <Col N="419" /> as that particular section is concerned. I mention that so that we may have his views on the subject.  The Minister challenged the inclusion of certain workers under the Bill, particularly the employees of local authorities.  He indicated that their inclusion would be in conflict with the provisions of the Bill, and asked what section they could be brought in under.  I gather from the Minister that he said that these local employees were paid out of State funds.  They are not paid out of State funds except in relation to certain grants and certain recoupments which the local authorities get from the State.  They are mainly paid out of moneys paid by the ratepayers.  I submit that their inclusion could come in under Parts V, VI or VII. I submit that they would come in under Part III which refers to the registration of agreements.  Their inclusion would be quite compatible under that part of the Bill.  They would also, I suggest, come in under Part VI, and, finally, under Part VII, where men have the right to seek an increase in their remuneration.  So far, the Minister has not made any case to convince us that these workers should not be included under the Bill.  I am particularly keen on the inclusion of the employees of local authorities because I know of no other section that needs the protection of these three parts of the Bill more than the employees of local authorities do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The case that I make is this.  So far as civil servants are concerned, there are proposals under consideration and, whether the proposals are good or bad, they are about to be discussed with the Civil Service organisations.  Whatever will emerge from these discussions will, presumably, from the subject of separate legislation. I do not suppose that anybody given the responsibility of establishing a court to hear the grievances of civil servants, even with the limited power which it is proposed should be given to this court, would propose to constitute it in the precise manner set out in this Bill.  In any case, civil servants are in a different position.  The proposals in relation to them will, if they emerge <Col N="420" /> from the discussions which are about to proceed in a form that requires legislation, be the subject of proposals to be submitted here.</P>
      <P>I should not like the provisions of this Bill to be altered by reason of what is an accidental situation&mdash;the fact that a strike of national teachers in Dublin was in progress at the time the Bill was introduced.  That might not have been the situation and the national teachers, if they had been wise, in my view&mdash;I am not going to press my view&mdash;would have accepted the offer that was made to them some months ago, and be now about to enjoy the very substantial increases in salary which were embodied in that offer.  I do not think that anybody will seriously suggest that the Government, in relation to the national teachers or any other class of officials paid out of public funds, any more than a local authority in relation to its officials, is in exactly the same position as a private employer in relation to his workers.</P>
      <P>The arguments relating to the difference in both situations, have been advanced before.  I do not want to repeat them.  A Government cannot go out of business.  It cannot put itself in the position that somebody constituting a court, such as the court proposed here, can arrive at a decision that might involve £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 in extra taxation, and accept an obligation to impose that taxation even though it considered the net result of doing so was going to be widespread unemployment or some other disastrous consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Government cannot relieve itself of its responsibilities and pass them on to a body such as that proposed here. It, in fact, stands as an arbitrator between the national teachers or public servants and their employers who are the taxpayers of the country.  It is in the position of a conciliator, an arbitrator, of one who has responsibility for deciding between their claims as against the claims of those who will suffer by any decision to benefit them. I am trying to avoid leading this debate into a discussion of the teachers' dispute. I disclaim any desire for such a debate on this Bill.  I am anxious to confine the debate to the narrow issue <Col N="421" /> of whether the particular type of court to be established here is a suitable tribunal for hearing claims, on behalf of a section of public servants, on the taxpayers' purse.  I do not think it is. I do not think that anybody seriously believes that it is.  This may be a suitable opportunity to ventilate grievances, but no one, I am certain, who had responsibility for framing legislation of this kind would seriously suggest that a tribunal of this kind could discharge that responsibility or would declare that the Government, irrespective of what that tribunal decides and of what the immediate consequences may be of its decision, must, never the-less, act upon it.</P>
    <P>So far as the local authorities are concerned, the circumstances are precisely the same.  There is no point in giving some external tribunal power to decide that the ratepayers are to pay more out of the rates.  It is the representatives of the ratepayers who are elected to the local authority who are to decided that.  You cannot relieve them of that responsibility by putting upon some body of this kind the obligation of considering these matters, and of deciding precisely how much the ratepayers should pay.</P>
    <P>The only firm case made here for the amendment related to the agricultural workers.  I agree that there is no logical grounds for excluding agricultural workers from Part VI of the Bill, and I am prepared to consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

      <P>Reference has been made to civil servants.  Let us take a better term: &ldquo;State employees.&rdquo;  At one period in my union we had a person employed by the Department and we had complaints in regard to the wages he had at Collinstown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be wrong, but I understood that this man was employed by your Department.  Have we <Col N="422" /> got to defeat the whole Government in order to get sympathetic and proper consideration for such men?  It is obvious that State employees, generally called civil servants, have their own associations.  I am not going to intrude on them.  As to the general term &ldquo;State employees&rdquo; or employees of local authorities, whose conditions require attention, their claims are submitted periodically in one form or another to trade unions.  If these claims are rejected by the State or by a local authority, for whom the county manager acts, there is no redress. There is no use in telling us that the State or the local authority stands between a group of employees and the ratepayers.  Everybody is sensible enough to realise that, if bodies of State employees have grievances, and if they cannot get justice through a particular Government Department or a particular manager, either a city or a county manager, it is not a practical proposition to expect them to get a change of Government or a change in the control of a local authority.  Elections involve a great many other questions than the particular employees of the State or a local authority.</P>
      <P>We start off in this Bill by setting out to establish harmonious relations between workers and employers.  It may be quite possible, as the Minister stated, that this particular machinery is not suitable for civil servants as a whole.  If we could accept the principle, that these people, especially small groups, are entitled to the same consideration, if employed by the State or by local authorities as workers employed by private employers, then we could find agreement.  At the present time we have the position, where we have two groups of workers employed by separate Government Departments, doing exactly the same work, where one is receiving the full bonus of 16/- while the other is in receipt of 10/-.  Is there no way in which we could redress that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister speaks of having arbitration machinery, and of having a claim heard before the arbitration court on behalf of employees of the State or of local authorities, and of having the State compelled to accept that decision, in practice there are <Col N="423" /> two forms of arbitration.  We who represent the workers go before the arbitration courts, and if we do not accept the decision we indicate our willingness to submit the case to examination. We then accept the decision of the court.  I fail to see why the State should not be prepared to do the same.  If the decision is such that they cannot logically give effect to it, then they can accept political responsibility. They should not deny to their own employees what they allow in the case of private employers.  The Minister stated that the State cannot run business. The Minister was on sounder ground when he spoke of another aspect.  In relation to the question of trade disputes, I think, even as to the practical application of the machinery, there is a good deal of argument on our side.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside groups of what are called civil servants, and using the other term &ldquo;State employees,&rdquo; large numbers of industrial workers are employed by Government Departments. The existing practice is to follow the rates of wages and conditions arrived at between employers and workers outside the Government service.  Another practice has been growing up, more especially since the operation of the Emergency Powers Orders.  There has been a lag between what private employers and the State are paying.  In some cases we have had Orders, affecting private employers, granting an increased bonus to particular individuals and as long as ten months have elapsed before that increased bonus was given to the same set of workers employed by local authorities and the State and no retrospective effect was given to it.</P>
    <P>There is ground there on which there could be inquiry before the court to determine whether, in fact, these workers were entitled to have applied to them what is in effect the result of an agreement.  That was the custom that existed for years, but because of a policy which seems to have developed recently in Government Departments, and amongst local authorities, it has largely fallen into disuse, and has created a good deal of criticism and complaint amongst workers.</P>
    <P>In so far as the registration of <Col N="424" /> agreements is concerned, one of the problems that have to be faced with regard to Government Departments and local authorities is what takes place regarding conditions or wages as a result of the agreement.  The evidence submitted is a copy of the agreement, and following upon that the Minister or city manager considers the matter. He then makes an Order applying to that particular employment.  Very often the question arises, whether the terms of that agreement do, in fact, apply to particular workers.  Here we have a proposal under which an agreement can be made, and we have also a court to which we can refer for interpretation of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Again, on the same question, if there is a difference of opinion between one employee, or a thousand employees, of the Government or the local authority surely these employees are entitled to some opportunity of presenting their case before an impartial tribunal in the same way as the employees of a private employer.  That is the only question and it seems to me in most cases, particularly in relation to the ordinary labourer, the skilled craftsman employed by Departments and the general run of manual worker employed by the local authorities, the machinery provided here would be most suitable and could be made available. Those of us who have the right to speak for the men and women affected by this would have no hesitation in utilising this machinery.</P>
    <P>In so far as the local authorities are concerned, we are placed here in a most invidious position.  It may be possible to change the Government to get a certain amount of equity granted to civil servants and teachers.  That is a very different thing to changing the Government to get some amelioration of the position of employees in Grangegorman Mental Hospital.  We are so removed from the centre of power in this country that those on the outer circles are left in an impossible position. Employees of local authorities and boards, such as the joint committee in a mental hospital or similar institutions, which come under the indirect control of the city or county managers should, at least, be provided with some machinery of this kind.  As <Col N="425" /> the position stands at the moment they have no other resource and they have no other way of having just consideration given to their claims.  They are completely dependent on the arbitrary and single-minded action of either the manager or, in the final resort, of the Minister who is himself very far removed from their particular conditions of service.  In this connection it is as well to point out to the Minister that, while we are setting up conciliation and arbitration machinery for large sections of the workers, outside of the employees of the State and local authorities, by the same stroke we are wiping out what small degree we already have of conciliation machinery in the form of a Conciliation Act and the Industrial Courts Act.  That means that when this Bill is passed unless the worker, regardless of where he may be employed, comes within the scope of this Bill there is no other machinery available which he can utilise.  I think we should pay due regard to that position.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to the agricultural workers it seems to me that they are in exactly the same position as any worker employed in a trade covered by a trade board.  It is correct that their wages and conditions can be fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board in the same way as a trade board fixes wages and, to a certain extent, conditions for the workers in certain trades.  But the benefit of this particular Act is only for those who are employed under the schedule fixed by the trade board.  The trade board rate is a minimum one. If any section of the workers wishes to improve upon that they can do so by registering an agreement under the Act.</P>
    <P>The only difference is that there are certain measures preventing them utilising in a direct from the present Emergency Powers (No. 260) Order. When that goes there is nothing to stop them having agreements granting conditions over and above and better than what are provided as minimum conditions under the Trade Board Schedule.  The same applies to agricultural workers.  The board fixes the minimum rates.  If any particular area, or group of employers, <Col N="426" /> wishes to give wages or conditions superior to those fixed by the board there is nothing in the Bill at present preventing that being registered as an agreement for the particular area or the particular type of agricultural worker.  There is, however, a distinction between that agreement being registered and the particular section of workers being brought under the Bill in the same way as any section of industrial workers governed by a trade board is at the present moment.</P>
    <P>As far as this machinery in relation to trade disputes is concerned it has already been suggested that we will require more than one court.  In arranging for the provision of subsidiary courts it should be possible to take into consideration the advisability of having certain persons available to constitute the subsidiary courts with ability, knowledge and experience to deal with agricultural problems.  It appears to me, however, that the Minister is sympathetic to the suggestion that this might be extended to cover agricultural workers.  We might accept the principle and then work out the ways and means of adapting the machinery to meet the demands of that very large section of workers.  The very fact that they are working in isolation, without guidance or experience of trade unions, and to the extent that the trade union organisation may develop among them, it is possible that we may have a considerable number of situations in which machinery of this kind would be welcomed, not only by the State because of the vital part played by agricultural workers but by the men themselves and their employers because both sides would feel that, owing to their lack of experience in industrial organisation of this type, this machinery would be particularly helpful in bringing both sides together and helping them to adjust whatever claims may arise in the light of given circumstances.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin mentioned the difficulty in regard to the grotesque situation in which one finds oneself when one sub-divides classes of people in different ways.  I think he stated that there was one <Col N="427" /> member of his organisation employed at Collinstown in respect of whom he felt he had a trade dispute with the Minister.  It is clear to those who were listening to the discussion on the air navigation legislation this evening how difficult it is to know what exactly is the position of anybody at Collinstown from the point of view of an employee. We understand now, however, that a member of Deputy Larkin's union engaged at Collinstown is, in all probability, an employee of Aer Rianta Teoranta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which I would like to draw attention in connection with this particular Bill. Under this Bill everybody affected by it will be able to pass on some portion of the burden.  Now, I am anxious, and more than anxious, to see the lot of the agricultural labourer bettered. Every class in the community, let it be the manufacturer or anybody else, who comes in for the purpose of getting an increased price can pass on some of the cost to the article he manufactures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a contractor who is brought under <Col N="428" /> this Bill gets his labour costs increased he can pass on that increase in his contracts and have it recognised and paid.  But the farmer is controlled.  One portion of the products of his industry is sold on an export market over which he has no control.  The balance is sold to the home consumer.  The farmer has no tribunal like the other industrialists before whom he can go to have his costings inquired into or his prices fixed. I think that these two things should go hand in hand.  It is time that all industries should be placed on the one basis.  The lot of the agricultural workers should be improved, but it cannot be improved as things stand.  As Deputy Larkin stated, on the one hand we have the wages board fixing wages. On the other hand, you have a fixed Government price for the articles produced by the farmer which has not been changed, although there have been three successive changes in wages made by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The farming industry, which is the biggest and most important industry in the country, should be dealt with side by side with the other industries.  Speaking as a farmer, apart from any other interest I have in them, I am anxious to see the lot of the agricultural labourers bettered.  But any improvement which applies to them, should apply also to the 400,000 who are not agricultural labourers but who work on the land.</P>

They have no court to which they can go, although the burden is passed on to them.  I suggest to the Minister that, if he is including <Col N="429" /> agricultural labourers in this Bill, he should also bring immediately into this House some Bill setting up some tribunal before which the employers of agricultural labourers, namely, the farmers, can go to have their costings fixed so that they can get the cost of production, plus profit, the same as the other industrialists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a point to put, not to the Minister, but to the House, because the difficulty I find myself in rather inclines me to the Minister's point of view.  I wonder, in respect to the excluded classes of workers from paragraph (a) to paragraph (g), that is, all those, except agricultural workers, is the labour court which it is proposed to set up under this Bill a suitable one if we are to agree that these workers should be included, because none of the employers of these workers could be represented on the labour court as it is proposed to be set up and some of the workers' representatives, I think, would probably be excluded also?  In other words, the court would not have the same relation in respect of these workers and their employers, that is, the State and the local authorities, as it would have in respect of private employers.  It is not my intention to make the Minister's case, but I think there is a difficulty there and perhaps some of the Deputies who want to have these workers included might be able to clear it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in an effort to show that it would not be satisfactory to have this labour court deal with cases referred to it by the State as employer said that one of the difficulties of the State in a matter of this kind was the fact that, if it submitted an issue to the adjudication of a labour court such as is envisaged here, it would have to pay the award and, instancing what he thought that would mean by a figurative expression, he said the State might have to go out of business, clearly indicating that the Minister contemplated that every time a labour court adjudicated upon an issue in which there was a dispute between the Government, on the one hand, and all or a section of its employees, on the other hand, this court, <Col N="430" /> which is to consist of two representatives of employers, two representatives of workers, and a chairman appointed by the Minister, will go completely daft&mdash;once they have to deal with a claim in respect of some group of State servants.</P>
      <P>The Minister will trust this court to deal with a matter affecting tens of thousands of people and will not worry about the decision.  He is willing to let them deal with building workers.  He is satisfied that every members of this court will maintain his normal ability when hearing such cases before the tribunal and he will be satisfied with their verdict.  He does not contemplate any catastrophic consequences so far as employers are concerned. But he imagines that a tribunal, composed of two seasoned and sober representatives of employers and two representatives appointed by national trade union organisations, with a chairman appointed by the Minister, cannot be trusted to give a fair and impartial judgment in respect of a claim on behalf of State servants. Is it not ludicrous for the Minister to argue that that body can be trusted in respect of every one of these cases, but it cannot be trusted in respect of a case affecting a few hundred or a few thousand lowly-paid State servants?  Why must he assume that the tribunal will go completely berserk in dealing with a claim in respect of State servants and maintain a normal condition of intelligence and mind when dealing with the claims of every other class?  Of course, no such thing will happen.  The State will not have to go out of business.  The mentality behind the court's awards in respect of outside workers will also impregnate whatever verdicts they give in respect of claims submitted by State servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows well, because the information can be got in his own Department or in the Library here, that the arbitration and labour court philosophy and ideology have been tried in many countries in the world between State servants and their employer, the Government.  Not a single one of these countries went out of business.  Every one of them is as <Col N="431" /> prosperous as, and some of them are much more prosperous than this country.  None of them went bankrupt because an arbitration or labour court functioned.  In every single one of them that has had the arbitration principle applied as between the Government and State employees, Ministers of all political complexions have paid tribute to that machinery as a means of satisfactorily settling disputes between the executive on the one hand and State employees on the other hand.</P>
    <P>This amendment simply proposes to have that scheme of adjusting disputes applied here.  One obvious remedy against the possibility that the State might be put out of business by paying an award of the tribunal is the simple device suggested by civil servants' organisations to the Minister for Finance long ago, namely, that every award of an arbitration tribunal should be subject to the overriding authority of Parliament.</P>
    <P>There is an arbitration scheme operating in Great Britain for State servants; there is an arbitration scheme operating in Northern Ireland for State servants.  Every award is subject to the overriding authority of Parliament.  The British Government has not gone out of business because of the Arbitration Board, and neither has the Six-Country Government gone out of business.</P>
    <P>These Governments still exist; they are still in business, and are doing pretty good business here&mdash;we wish they would do more.  The arbitration tribunals have not injured them or imposed upon the people burdens which the people were incapable of bearing. There is no fear that the award of the tribunal will put the State out of business here and, in any case, even if people fear that, if in 1946 there are people so simple as to imagine that will happen, you still have the device of stating that all awards of this tribunal in respect to State servants are subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That suggestion was made to the Minister for Finance 14 years ago and never once was it pleaded by him that it was not an effective safeguard, if he <Col N="432" /> wanted to utilise it.  He said, in respect of local authorities: &ldquo;You cannot have a court of this kind, dealing with the claims of a local authority and sending the bill to the local authority; you cannot put the responsibility on them.&rdquo; What other machinery is there for adjusting a dispute with a local authority? A local authority is composed of representatives of the ratepayers, but you will not allow those representatives to decide the scale of remuneration for their employees.  You say to the members of the local authority: &ldquo;It is not your business to fix the scale of wages for the persons employed by the ratepayers of the county; that is not your function.  We will bring in a manager.&rdquo; He is usually not a native of the county, knows nothing about the temperament of the people and is not sufficiently long enough there to trouble even to learn the outlook of the people as regards the remuneration of their employees.</P>
    <P>It is the manager and not the representatives on the local authorities who fixes the remuneration.  When the employees become dissatisfied with the decision of the county or city manager and when they take action to express disapproval of unsatisfactory rates of wages, you say to them: &ldquo;You cannot get a tribunal to adjudicate on the merits of the case.&rdquo;  You say to the manager: &ldquo;You, and you only, will decide this case.&rdquo;  You will not allow the labour court to decide it.  You want to thrust all the powers into the hands of a county manager.  Surely, in all equity, if there is a dispute between a county manager and the employees of a county council, and if you will not allow the ratepayers to settle the matter, you ought to be willing to refer it to a tribunal of this kind and allow this tribunal to do, in respect of the employee of a local authority, what you permit it to do in connection with commercial and industrial workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;I will let the tribunal fix the wages of a carpenter or any other craftsman, but I will not permit it to fix remuneration of a postman or a roadman.&rdquo;  What is the reason for the discrimination?  The latter two workers probably need this tribunal more than the craftsman who, <Col N="433" /> if he wishes, can ignore it and rely on economic strength as he has to enforce the payment of wages, which might be more satisfactory to him than he can get by reliance on this machinery.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no case for excluding these categories of workers. He says says it is not possible to allow teachers to have access to this court. Are we to contemplate a situation in which county council employees will have nobody but the county manager to fix their remuneration?  Most other classes in the industrial and commercial sphere can get a tribunal, but never will we concede that right to the roadman.  Must we contemplate a situation where you will have periodic teachers' strikes for remuneration and we will never set up this machinery for them?  Are we to visualise a situation where we can say to a commercial clerk: &ldquo;You can go to the labour court?&rdquo;  But we will not allow the roadman to go there.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given no reasons why such workers should not be allowed access to it.  He talked about the type of arbitration that might be discussed for the Civil Service.  Is it not obviously preferable to allow this machinery to operate until something more satisfactory takes its place?  If you get that mutually acceptable machinery, then let it replace this tribunal.  In the meantime, I do not think the Minister ought to deny access to this tribunal to State servants, employees of local authorities, and any other class of worker who says: &ldquo;I want to use it the same as the generality of workers will be permitted to use it when it becomes law.&rdquo;  I am willing to withdraw the amendment to give the Minister an opportunity of considering it, but I must have the right, of course, to resubmit it, if necessary, for the Report Stage.  Quite clearly, there is a demand from all sides of the House for the general application of the principle of this Bill to a wider category of workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that when the Minister and his colleagues thought fit to bring in this measure they considered the right of every employee engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce <Col N="434" /> to the protection which this measure is bound to give.  I cannot understand the reason for excluding from the operation of this measure such a large number of workers.  It is proposed to exclude eight different classes. I hope the Minister will indicate the number of workers in agriculture, under local authorities, amongst teachers, civil servants and others who will be excluded from the operation of the useful machinery provided here.  I am glad the Minister has given a sort of half-hearted promise to bring agricultural workers within the measure.  I hope he will do that by introducing an amendment on Report.  I think he will agree, if he has studied the working of the Agricultural Wages Board, that it has not given general satisfaction.  I am glad Deputy Corry agrees with the Minister about bringing agricultural workers within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am not saying that the conditions are unfair or cannot be complied with.  The framework of the Agricultural Wages Board is out of date.  The selection of representatives of farmers and workers is not on a democratic basis.  It may be the farmers and the agricultural labourers are not properly organised for that particular purpose.</P>
      <P>It is generally admitted or claimed in the country that this Agricultural Wages Board is constituted on a political or a semi-political basis. To that extent, it has not given general satisfaction.  It has given decisions in recent cases that I cannot fully understand.  In a case of an area board operating in portion of my constituency, a county board by a majority some weeks ago decided to recommend that agricultural wages in the County of Leix should be increased by 7/6 per week.  That recommendation was sent to the National Wages Board, and the figure of 7/6 was reduced to 4/-, for some reason, so far unexplained to me or anybody else. I endeavoured to frame a suitable Parliamentary question asking the Minister for Agriculture to explain the reason why the National Wages Board refused to accept the recommendation of the area board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> The Ceann Comhairle ruled that that question was not in order because, he alleged, the Minister had no function in the matter.  I know, and every sensible Deputy knows perfectly well, that the Minister for Agriculture appoints the Chairman of the National Wages Board and fixes the salary to be paid for giving arbitrary decisions. Yet I am told, in a letter, that the Minister for Agriculture has no function in a matter of this kind.  I am bound to accept the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle given to me in a letter, but I shall take another suitable opportunity to establish that the Minister for Agriculture has a definite responsibility for answering in that case for the activities of the Chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board in matters of that kind.  I think you could not have a more undemocratic board than the board which has been operating for some time.</P>
    <P>I certainly think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, having a much wider experience than the Minister for Agriculture in setting up trade boards and conciliation machinery, will be able to frame under this Bill a much more satisfactory type of machinery to deal with disputes in the agricultural industry.  We are facing a fairly uncertain future in regard to world conditions, markets and everything else.  I think that Deputy Corry, who reads his stuff, will agree that in any line-up of world conditions in the future there will be a keen demand in the export market and the home market for many years to come for agricultural produce.  If the farmer shakes himself up and establishes a better organisation than farmers have had in the past, he should be in a better position to pay agricultural labourers a decent wage than he has been up to the present time.  If agricultural labourers have not got a decent living wage up to the present, it is due to the fact that agricultural labourers and farmers have not been properly organised, but whether they are organised or unorganised, they are as entitled to the protection of machinery of this kind as any industrial or other worker.</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister before introducing <Col N="436" /> this section had a chat with the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government, and as a result of conversations or inter-Departmental collaboration, he decided that the employees of local authorities and agricultural labourers should be excluded from the machinery of this Bill. We all know the reason why the employees of local authorities are to be excluded from that machinery&mdash;simply because the little dictator in the Custom House wants to maintain the right, so long as there is power vested in him, to dictate the wages that are to be paid on schemes operated by local authorities. I put it to every Deputy here that workers under local authorities have the same rights under the Constitution as every other worker who is going to get the benefit of this measure when it comes into operation.  We are told sometimes&mdash;at other times we are told something different&mdash;that the representative of the ratepayers have one right and that is the right to strike a rate, that rate to include a sum sufficient to provide for efficient administration of local services and to pay the wages of the workers who work under local authorities.  If the representatives of the ratepayers on local authorities still have that right, they should also have the right to fix the wages that are to be paid to employees of local authorities and that right should never be given to the Minister for Local Government. If the workers employed by the local authorities are not satisfied with their wages, they should have the right to appeal to some tribunal&mdash;the Minister for Local Government is not a tribunal&mdash;he is a dictator in matters of this kind&mdash;such as is provided for in the Bill, where their cases will get a fair hearing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry seems to think that there is danger in going to a tribunal of this kind.  I should like to disabuse his mind on that because the chairman of the tribunal will be appointed by the Minister and is bound to pay due regard to the public interest when he is considering the claims of people coming before him.  In considering the public interest, he will consider also the ability or otherwise of the farmers to pay the rates of wages demanded by <Col N="437" /> the organisation catering for the agricultural labourers.  Deputy Corry overlooks one fact.  I do not see how he could do so because he is a very active member of the Beet Growers' Association.  He is one of the most eloquent representatives of the farmers in this House, and every time he gets the opportunity, he is well able with his colleagues to put the case in favour of a higher price for agricultural produce of any kind in order to meet the increasing demands that may be made on farmers, either for increased wages for workers or because of the increased cost of the raw materials which they have to purchase outside the country.</P>
    <P>At any rate, the chairman of the labour court will represent the public interest and will pay due regard to these matters when he is making up his mind as to the wages to be paid.  A clear case has been made for the inclusion of some of the groups of workers which the Minister is not prepared to bring within the scope of the Bill.  When discussing rates of wages paid by local authorities on a recent occasion, the Minister for Local Government made it quite clear to the House that in exercising his authority in matters of this kind, so far as employees of local authorities were concerned, road workers and others, he wanted to relate the wages to the wages paid to agricultural labourers in the same area.  The Minister for Local Government as such should have no dictatorial powers in matters of this kind.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce has seen fit&mdash;I think he has agreed&mdash;to bring within the scope of the measure agricultural labourers, I hope that for the same reason he will also see his way to bring in employees of local authorities and give such employees, whenever they feel they are not being fairly treated, the right to go to a court of this kind to get fair play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess in speaking to those amendments that I am somewhat bewildered in making any contribution to this discussion because while one may admire the motives that influenced the Minister in introducing this Bill, I am still <Col N="438" /> strongly of the opinion that the more he interferes in matters affecting trade unions with a view to securing peace and harmony, the more chance there will be that disharmony and disunity will result.  I do not attribute that to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have very strong views as to the propriety of introducing Bills of this nature.  I say that from my experience of the trade union movement and of workers generally which goes back almost half a century, I find that the best way of settling disputes and of having peace and harmony is for the men concerned and their employers to sit down and to discuss their grievances.  I think that where that is done a settlement is effected in 99 cases out of 100.  When that was the practice we had not a Trade Union Act or an Industrial Relations Bill to guide us, but we had common sense.  Having listened to the speeches here this evening, I must admit that this Bill has been introduced with a view to settling disputes and to creating harmony. My difficulty is to know the class of worker that the Bill really refers to. I think that if all its sections are examined one will have a difficulty in finding out the classes of workers that come within the scope of it.  The local employees of such important bodies as the Dublin Corporation, the Cork Corporation, the Waterford, Limerick, Wexford, Sligo and other borough bodies as well as those employed by urban councils, plus agricultural workers, teachers and civil servants are all outside its scope.  In view of that how are you going to have peace and harmony?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that the Minister has so many duties to attend to that he could not be aware of all the pitfalls likely to confront him in preparing a Bill of this kind.  He forgets that, long before any of these Acts were passed, a certain number of these employees that I speak of were members of the old craft unions which had been in existence for at least 50, 60 or 70 years. These included bricklayers, plasterers, carpenters and the old type of labourer who was attached to the old local union.  Now, a great many of these will come under this Bill, but on the other hand a number of other <Col N="439" /> employees of local councils will not. Therefore, when those who come under the Bill want an increase of wages and get their claims settled before the labour court&mdash;they may get an increase of a few shillings a week&mdash;a good deal of dissatisfaction is bound to prevail amongst those who are not entitled to the increase.  That may result in a strike.  That is one difficulty that I am afraid will confront the Minister and that at the moment he does not see. You will have other employees who will be affected in the same way.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that if he wants peace and harmony he is not going to get it while that situation obtains.  I say the same with all respect to the Labour Party and to the leaders too of the various workers' organisations.  The workers will say that they will agree to everything but that they must be in a position to strike.  We had better be straight and honest about this.  There is no use in going a bit of the road with everybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry wants an increase of 2/6 for agricultural workers provided he gets an additional 5/- for his agricultural produce.  The one thing that came out of this discussion is that Deputy Corry has now admitted for the first time that there is such a thing as an export market to which he can send his produce.  In all his speeches up to this he has been ignoring the export market and stressing the value of the home market.</P>
    <P>But, if he is to get another 10/- to enable him to send his produce to the export market he will consent to give half of it to the agricultural labourers. We do not want that class of speech on a Bill of this nature.  We should try to be honest and do the best we can in the interests of the country and of the working classes.  I am prepared to say that the Minister, no matter what Act he passes, is not going to have harmony, human nature being what it is. We cannot control and regiment people. We cannot even regiment the members of our own households not to speak of regimenting hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens.</P>
    <P>We know what has happened in relation to certain Acts passed by this House, what the decision of the <Col N="440" /> Supreme Court was last week in regard to the liberty which a worker claimed as to the particular union he should join.  I heartily agree with the decision of the Supreme Court.  There are certain labour men in this country who do not agree that a man should have liberty in regard to the union he will join.  I am glad that the Supreme Court came to that decision.</P>
    <P>With regard to the various arguments put forward on this Bill, I hope they will have some weight with the Minister especially in so far as they apply to agricultural workers.  Long before Deputy Corry spoke about agricultural labourers I was defending them in this House some 20 years ago.  I maintained at that time, as I maintain now, that the genuine agricultural worker is a scientific tradesman, and as such should be given a decent standard of living. I said then, and I say now, that I never could see the reason why a man in a city or urban area should have £3 a week and an agricultural labourer only 30/-.</P>
    <P>It may have been unpopular at the time to say that, but I said it then and I say it now.  I think that the Minister would be wise in not excluding agricultural labourers from the scope of this Bill.  He gave me the impression that his reason for excluding certain classes of local employees, civil servants, teachers, etc., was that the labour court might possibly agree to give these classes salaries and wages that would be out of all proportion to the work they do or that would impose an impossible burden on the ratepayers and taxpayers of the country.  If that is his view, then apparently he does not mind what happens to private employers, industrialists and others, whose workers will have the right to go before this labour court.  It can fix any wages it likes for these workers, but that does not appear to matter to the Minister. That seems to me to be inconsistent.  I do not think the Minister was on very firm ground when he put forward that argument in favour of the exclusion of certain classes of workers as against others.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendments that are before the House, I wish them every luck.  I know what is going to <Col N="441" /> happen&mdash;that we are not going to have the peace and harmony to which we all subscribed on the Second Reading. That can only come if we are all really in earnest.  It will not come if the exceptions provided for in this Bill, which affect so many thousands of workers, are adhered to.  You cannot have peace if certain sections of workers are to be excluded from its benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to create harmony and understanding between employers and employees.  I think it is acknowledged on every side of the House that, owing to the fact that so many sections of workers will not come under the Bill, it will not be a success.  I am particularly interested in two sections, the employees of local authorities and agricultural workers.  As a matter of fact, a motion was tabled in the House by this Party some time ago asking the Minister for Agriculture to set up a tribunal to go into the cost of agricultural production so that we would be able to come to some understanding as to the prices that should be paid for agricultural produce and as to what the producer could pay in return to his employees.</P>
      <P>I am rather amused to think that Deputy Corry is now so interested in the agricultural worker when the Minister wants to include them under the Bill.  If he does, it will be on condition that he will take into consideration the employers of these workers, and that he will take good care to see that, if the workers are brought under the protection of the Bill, their employers will also be protected.  There is no other group so victimised as agricultural workers.  If they come under this Bill they will be the first group to seek its protection.  If the board is at all fair it will sanction a considerable increase in their wages.  By doing so that will mean, I suppose, according to Deputy Corry, a burden on their employers&mdash;the farmers.  It is for that reason Deputy Corry is seeking protection for farmers.  Deputy Corry did not give much support to a similar proposal which was made some months ago.  He voted against it.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to give full support to the amendment.  Otherwise, it might be thought that the mover of the amendment was alone, as far as the grievances of agricultural workers and employees of local authorities are concerned.  The Minister is aware that road workers and bog workers have been victimised.  We must make every effort to see that they come under this Bill and are protected. We hope the protection they receive will convince the Minister for Local Government that they are not, as they were described a few months ago, a privileged section.  For that reason every Deputy should make an effort to convince the Minister of the necessity of having employees of local authorities as well as agricultural workers brought under this Bill.  I was rather amused at Deputy Corry's remarks and wish to congratulate him as far as his conversion goes.</P>

      <P>I want to intervene now in the hope that we will be able to get some conclusion on this amendment to-night.  A large part of the discussion had no very definite relationship to the actual position we are dealing with.  Deputy Norton must not represent me as arguing against the principle of arbitration or conciliation for civil servants.  That is not the issue.  The issue is whether arbitration or conciliation for civil servants is to be provided under the machinery of this Bill or under separate proposals which are being considered.  I am telling the Deputy that proposals relating to civil servants are being considered, and when completed will, presumably, be the subject of separate legislation, on which the House can express freely its opinion as to its adequacy or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that <Col N="443" /> makes much difference.  Apart from other considerations, the intention of the Government to repeal the Standstill Order on the coming into operation of this Bill, does not necessarily apply to the bonus stabilisation in the Civil Service.  I do not want to introduce issues which are primarily ones for the Minister for Finance.  The reasons why civil servants are not in this Bill is, because separate proposals are being considered for the Civil Service, and will be introduced in due course. Whether the proposals that may be adopted for civil servants will be applicable to the officers of local authorities I cannot say.  I do not know enough about the particular problems of local authorities, to express an opinion as to whether the same type of machinery would be as suitable for them as for the Civil Service.  I think, probably, it would be.  If it should be generally agreed that that type of machinery is applicable to the employees of local authorities, then it is reasonable to assume that, having adopted proposals for civil servants, they would in due course be extended to local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know the proposals for civil servants do not exclude any classes of persons employed by Government Departments.  It may be that certain classes are employed for specific jobs, and are not permanent officials of local authorities, in relation to whose employment separate considerations would apply.  So far as civil servants or employees of local authorities are concerned, my argument is not against the principle of arbitration or conciliation by a special organisation in some form.  So far as agricultural workers are concerned, as I informed the Dáil, they will be brought under the portions of the Bill applicable to them.  A large part of the Bill does not apply to them in any case.  I could not now, in reply to Deputy Norton, undertake to say that my answer would be any different on the Report Stage.  This part of the Bill had of necessity to be discussed with other Government Departments and with the Government itself.  The <Col N="444" /> rest of the Bill, as I said on Second Reading, is open to amendment and I hope that we shall get agreement on its provisions and anything that tends to its general acceptance will be acceptable to me; but the scope of the Bill and its applicability to Government and local government employees are not so simple.  Clearly, I would not be in a position to commit the Government in that regard.  I can tell the Dáil what the position is, but that must not be interpreted as meaning that the principle of arbitration or conciliation for Government employees or local government employees is not accepted.</P>

      <P>I think I have created something in the nature of an upheaval in advocating that, if the agricultural labourer is included under this section, the agricultural industry should at the same time be placed in the same position as industrial employers generally who will be affected by this Bill. Deputy Cogan, who is a rural Deputy, seems to have no knowledge at all of rural conditions or agricultural conditions, or as to the manner in which they might be affected by this Bill. Deputy Cogan, apparently, has lost sight of the fact that four years ago the price of beet was fixed by arbitration and conciliation with the Minister for Finance.</P>

The road worker employed by the local authority as a rule gets from seven to eight months' employment in the year.  He spends at least three months in the year completely idle, because during those three months no money is available to cover work on the roads.  Therefore the road worker gets nothing.  There is no analogy between the position of the road worker and the position of the agricultural labourer.</P>

He should be placed on an equal footing with the other industrialists in this country. He should have a tribunal before which he can go in order to have his costs fixed.  If a board increases his labour costs in the morning he should have the same opportunity as the other industrialists of going before some tribunal and getting for his products an increased price, comparable to the cost of production plus a profit.</P>

      <P>I asked to-day whether the Minister is aware that certain electrolytic condensers were being imported from the United States in the <i>Irish Alder,</i> arriving outside Dublin on the 18th May and delivering its cargo at Cork on the 23rd May, and that it was found the customs duty on these condensers had been increased from 25 to 75 per cent. on the day they arrived outside the Port of Dublin. My purpose in raising the matter now is that I consider the case an important one and that it has very important bearings on the activities of commercial firms who, in difficult circumstances, are scouring the world trying to get supplies for this country which are urgently needed.  In the particular case which I propose to refer to, an important class of people are being badly affected, namely, those who have wireless sets requiring repairs of one kind or another and who are depending upon the import of parts by the various importers to get their sets kept in order.  Perhaps even more important is the necessity for an understanding in this House and among the people generally of what exactly the Government are doing in relation to certain things and for avoiding actions and practices by the Government that really outrage common-sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case that I raised to-day and raised again last week is that of the firm of Messrs. L.R. Wood, Limited, Cork, who are official contractors to the Electricity Supply Board, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Defence, and who deal in electrical and radio products. Before November last a number of communications were addressed to the Department of Industry and Commerce asking for shipping space to import articles connected with wireless from the United States, and on the 13th November the firm were advised, in reply to a number of letters of various dates asking for space on shipping operated by Irish Shipping, Limited, that the Department had decided that, with a view to expediting the arrangement of shipping, the application <Col N="450" /> should be made direct to Irish Shipping, Limited.  That was done and, on 22nd November, the Department wrote the firm saying that, before any definite commitment was entered into for the purchase of these goods, the firm should ensure, by reference to their bankers, that the necessary currency facilities for the purchase of the goods or for any incidental charges would be available.</P>
    <P>The communication from the Department took cognisance of the fact that the firm wished to import 25,000 electrolytic condensers weighing approximately 18 cwts.; that the sellers were the Murbas Trading Company, 133-137 Front Street, New York. Through their bankers, the firm therefore applied for the necessary facilities to get dollars to make the payment and in a letter of the 10th December their bankers, the Provincial Bank of Ireland, wrote to the firm:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing application for 5,000 dollars approximately and instructions to open credit in favour of the Murbas Trading Company for the purchase of 25,000 electrolytic condensers, please note that this has been approved by the Department of Finance and we await your instructions to cable the opening of the credit in terms of duplicate Foreign Credit From herewith.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Department of Industry and Commerce, knowing the type of goods that were to be imported, facilitated the firm with regard to shipping space through Irish Shipping Limited, and the Department of Finance made the necessary arrangements that that firm would get the dollars necessary to finance the transaction.</P>
    <P>The order was given on the 9th January to the firm in New York and, on 2nd April, 11,000 electrolytic condensers were invoiced to the firm in Cork.  The shipping was handled by the agent of Irish Shipping, Limited, in New York and the actual shipment took place on 26th April on the <i>Irish Alder.</i>  The vessel arrived outside Dublin on the 18th May and then proceeded to Cork and arrived in Cork on 23rd May.  The position is that the firm, having intimated to the Department <Col N="451" /> that they proposed to import electrolytic condensers to the number of 25,000 at a cost of 5,000 dollars and having been facilitated in every way by the Department of Industry and Commerce and by the Department of Finance found, when they went through the long process under present circumstances of getting the goods in New York and having them shipped over here, that by the time the vessel arrived outside the port of Dublin a new tariff had been clapped on.</P>
    <P>That is a very extraordinary state of affairs.  The Minister has explained that he will allow a remission of duty to certain classes of firms and has indicated that the type of firms to whom he will allow a remission of duty will be firms undertaking the manufacture of electrolytic condensers here or who are assembling wireless sets.  There are some hundreds of thousands of wireless sets in this country, many of them requiring repairs of one kind or another. Assuming that a substantial wireless assembly industry is to be set up here and that electrolytic condensers are to be manufactured here&mdash;anybody with whom I have been in touch and who has any knowledge of the wireless business declares that will not take place because they say that even in Great Britain there are only about two firms manufacturing these condensers&mdash;why, under the present difficult circumstances, should those people who have old radio sets and do not want to go to the expense of purchasing new ones have the repairing or keeping their sets in order made more expensive? But why, particularly, should firms who are giving the service that these people want, and who, in difficult times, have tried to get the necessary parts, be served by the Department of Industry and Commerce as they have been served?  They were given certain facilities and then they found as soon as the goods arrived at the port, or a couple of hours before that, an increased tariff was clapped on them. The tariff was raised from 25 per cent. to 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>I think some explanation is required from the Minister.  Before the 18th May he had already received intimation <Col N="452" /> from firms throughout the country that they desired to import certain parts for wireless sets.  He gave them all the facilities for doing so.  Why, when these transactions are completed, does he not extend to them the facilities that he is apparently prepared to extend to people who, at some time or other, are going to manufacture wireless sets here?  I suggest that a very clear explanation should be given as to why, knowing that these people were trying to bring in these parts and were getting facilities from the Minister, they were not allowed in free of duty.</P>
    <P>Certain circumstances arose in the meantime, because I take it he did not give these people facilities to import these articles, knowing before they were going to come in that he would raise the tariff.  I ask him, in the first place, to waive the customs duty in respect of people who gave him full notice beforehand that they were trying to import these things and whom he did not stop before they did so.  In the second place, I ask him to take into consideration the people who require their wireless sets mended as against the people who require new sets. If it is outside the scope of the question to-night, I suggest that on some other day the Minister ought to tell us the policy he is pursuing in raising the customs duty on wireless parts to the extent to which he is raising them in order to encourage a wireless manufacturing industry here.  We should get some kind of information as to the prospects before that industry.</P>
    <P>While we would all like to see a wireless manufacturing industry developed in the country, we feel it is really outraging common-sense and leaves a bad impression on one's mind when we observe the way people, who have been putting their cards on the table for the Minister in the past, telling him they wanted to import certain things connected with wireless apparatus and having had extended to them facilities for so doing, were treated.  As soon as the ship was sighted outside the port of Dublin, the tariff was increased.  If the tariff were delayed for 24 hours the supplies would have come in under the smaller figure of 25 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of policy.  I have explained to the Deputy that the scale of duties upon wireless sets and wireless parts was revised immediately there were signs that the production of wireless sets here was about to be resumed, so that those proposing to engage in that business would understand clearly the degree of manufacture which they would have to undertake in order to get the components of sets and the other materials required for production free of duty.  It is true that certain of the components of wireless sets which we consider should be manufactured here are not yet being produced and the temporary arrangement is to give to those engaged in the production of wireless sets facilities to import these components free of duty until their manufacture here is practicable.</P>
      <P>The position regarding traders is different.  Wireless sets and wireless parts have been subject to duty for revenue purposes for a long time.  The duty was originally imposed 20 years ago and the effect of the new scale is to increase the duty on some components and take the duty off other components altogether.  Components which are much more frequently in demand than electrolytic condensers, such as wireless valves, which were previously dutiable, are now free of duty. It is quite obvious traders engaged in the importation of those parts will have suffered variously in fortune with the change.  For instance, as regards a trader importing wireless valves, the valves which arrived after the change were free of duty.  Traders importing electrolytic condensers who got them prior to the change were able to import them at a lower rate of duty, but traders whose deliveries arrived after the change had to pay a higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be some case for adjusting the rate of duty over a limited period in respect of goods clearly shipped before the change.  The practical difficulty in this case is that I have no power to reduce the rate of duty payable.  I can remit the duty altogether, but to do so would be to give this firm a very substantial advantage over other traders who imported these goods and paid the 25 per cent. <Col N="454" /> on them.  Having regard to the general situation, I do not think that would be desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister has power under the Emergency Powers Act to do that.  These are emergency circumstances; they arose out of the emergency.  Emergency circumstances were responsible for this delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the power of the Minister to make an Emergency Powers Order cannot be successfully questioned, but, in fact, the Minister has to declare that the Order is required for the preservation of the safety of the community or the safeguarding of supplies essential to the community.  I would have no reason to make that declaration in a case of this kind.  I have carefully considered this case and weighed in the balance the arguments in favour of granting a concession to this firm.  It would be regarded as giving them a considerable advantage over other firms, which would suffer a disadvantage through having received deliveries prior to the change.  It is probable there are other firms that are benefiting by the change in respect of other parts that are now free of duty.</P>
      <P>If I were to take any course other than to allow the duties to apply as from the date when they came into force, I would be faced with demands from firms which imported wireless valves prior to the change, firms which have to carry a loss of duty on them when selling in competition with the firms that got them in free of duty. I decided that the only practicable course to take was to allow the duties to come into operation on the date prescribed and to be chargeable, no exemption being granted to any traders other than those engaged in the manufacture of wireless sets.  The intention of granting duty-free licences to manufacturers was announced at the time the duty came into force.</P>

      <P>The argument Messrs.

In other words, there is clear evidence that there was a substantial number of firms which had imported these condensers and paid duty on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position.  The firms which are going to get the right of free import are being allowed to import condensers only for incorporation in sets which they manufacture here. They are not allowed to supply condensers for replacement purposes.  In so far as there is free import of these parts, that will apply only to sets manufactured here.  The net result of the change in the duty will be that far less duty will be paid because the number of wireless valves imported would far out-weigh the number of condensers. Under the new scheme, sets manufactured in accordance with our requirements within the country will pay no duty at all.  This will be the first time in this country that wireless sets will be free of duty.  I believe the effect should be in the course of <Col N="456" /> time to make wireless sets cheaper in relation to the general level of prices than previously.</P>
