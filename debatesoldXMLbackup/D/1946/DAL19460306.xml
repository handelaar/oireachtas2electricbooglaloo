      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the particular medical positions filled during the year 1945, through the Local Appointments Commission; and, further, if he will state, in the case of each such appointment, the names of the persons forming the selection board and the approximate date of the appointment of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here a statement setting out (a) the particular medical positions for which candidates were interviewed by the Local Appointments Commission during the year 1945; (b) the date on which the Local Appointments Commissioners selected the panel of members for each of the interview boards in question; (c) the approximate date on which the membership of each of these interview boards was completed; (d) the number <Col N="1910" /> of members of which each board was composed; (e) the date of the first sitting of the board; (f) the date on which the commissioners issued to the local authority the recommendation for the filling of the position.  I must point out that the number of these positions filed during the year 1945 would depend on the dates on which the local authorities acted on the commissioners' recommendations by making the actual appointments.</P>
      <P>As the statement is detailed and lengthy, I propose to circulate it with the Official Report.  These interview boards usually consist of from three to six members and comprise from two to four eminent members of the medical profession, the chairman being a lay man.  It frequently happens that for business and other reasons a number of those invited to act on a board find it impossible to do so.  Accordingly, when selecting an interview board the commissioners also approve of a number of substitutes for each place on the board, so that if any of the first choices are unable to act one or more of the others can then be invited.  The effective date of appointment of the board would, therefore, be the date on which the membership is completed in this way.  Membership of an interview board is honorary and it is not desirable to furnish the names of those who have given their services for this purpose on the explicit understanding that all dealings between them and the commissioners shall be strictly confidential.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not so sure that that would be true all the time.  They are probably asked if they are agreeable to act.  I do not know whether in all cases it would be strictly out of the existing panel.  There may be a case in which it might be desirable that, for some particular position, someone else might be added.  I am not saying that that is so, but I think it is likely. I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not finished.  I asked whether a practice has grown up of holding one examination for four dispensaries with the result that not only is the first in order of merit given a position, but men who are placed second, third and fourth in order of merit are also given dispensaries, and the whole purpose of holding an examination in order to select the best man amongst the candidates is defeated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that that is the work of a statutory commission and, therefore, in relation to any question addressed to me in that connection, I would have to ask for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would look into that aspect of the matter, inasmuch as this system, instead of ensuring that the best man amongst them is chosen, results in the whole panel of candidates being given appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of the continued need for increased food production at home and the desirability of helping to relieve famine conditions in Europe, he will arrange to convene a conference representative of all Parties to consider the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to the precise purpose the Deputy has in mind in suggesting that a conference representative of all Parties should be convened to consider the situation to which he refers.  The position at home and on the Continent is now fairly well known.  The continued need for the maximum food production and the national duty of doing all in our power to relieve distress abroad are also, I think, fully appreciated.  In a recent broadcast statement I dealt with these matters and referred to the fact that compulsory tillage and compulsory wheat growing were being maintained this year at last year's level.  I also said that we should not allow ourselves to be competitors with the starving people of Europe for the wheat which they so badly need and should make the utmost use of the supplies we have in hand and produce from our own soil all we require for our own use.  As a first step in this direction the rate of flour extraction was raised from 80 to 85 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the possibility of meeting our own needs and contributing to the relief of Europe depends on the farmers and I asked them to make this year the greatest effort they had yet made and to increase still further the acreage under wheat.  It is obvious that the more food we produce the safer will be our own position and the more we shall have for those who are in need.  I urged the farmers to seize every opportunity in February to sow as much winter wheat as they could and to sow as much spring wheat as possible in the months of March <Col N="1917" /> and April.  The time for sowing winter wheat is now over and it remains to sow as much spring wheat as possible this month and next.  Our aim should be to have at least 700,000 acres under wheat this year.  We ought, of course, to increase our production not only of wheat but also of potatoes, barley, oats and roots to make up for the deficiency which would be caused by the reduced output of bran and pollard in consequence of the higher rate of flour extraction and the absence of feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>Dealing specifically with the question of relief for Europe, I stated that from the Dáil vote of £3,000,000 last year it was possible to send to the Continent draught horses, cattle, bacon, butter, cheese, dried and condensed milk, sugar, baby foods, clothing and clothing materials and that in the coming year it was proposed to do at least as much.</P>
    <P>What I have said indicates broadly the situation as it is viewed by the Government.  We would, of course, welcome an expression of the views of the various Parties in the Dáil and I am prepared to meet the leaders of Parties to discuss the situation with them if this is desired.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the statement to which the Deputy <Col N="1924" /> refers.  The estimate of £24,000,000 for the provision and equipment of new voluntary hospitals and public health institutions is based on the assumption that the cost of building hospitals and providing the necessary equipment will be 50 per cent. higher than in the pre-war period.  In regard to the greater portion of the projected institutional accommodation, applications for grants out of Hospitals Trust Funds have been before my Department for a number of years.  The programme may be regarded as representing an ultimate objective, and will only be implemented as and when the position of the Hospitals Trust Fund permits of the allocation of the necessary grants towards the cost.  The sum of £10,000,000 for the improvement of public assistance institutions represents the estimated cost of providing suitable county homes for the aged and infirm in replacement of the present workhouse buildings.  As the requirements of the voluntary and public health institutions are regarded as being more urgent it does not appear likely that this latter development could be embarked upon for some considerable time.</P>

      <P>The information available to the Central Bank does not indicate any general shortage of small coin. The adequacy of the supply of copper coin cannot be judged by itself, but must be related in some measure to the availability of nickel coin.  The Central Bank continues to provide increasing amounts of small coin, an addition of over £36,000 in face value having been made to the outstanding amount of halfpence, pence and threepenny pieces in the 11 months ended 28th February, 1946.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention to the Minister that there is at the moment a considerable shortage of copper coinage.  It may have been greater in the past few months, but there is a considerable shortage at the present moment.  Anybody in business knows the difficulty of getting copper coins from the banks.  They simply have not got them and it has affected the general public.  I, therefore, urge on the Minister to put more into circulation, if at all possible.</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries and the information I have got from the Central Bank, which, of course, is in touch with the commercial banks throughout the country, is that there is no general shortage.  One complaint reached my office, and when I followed it up, I found that there was no basis for it.  There is, in fact, no general shortage of copper coinage.  It may happen that, in a particular case, for a few days there may be some shortage, but there is no general shortage. After all, if there was a shortage, it would be in the Central Bank's own interest to have more coppers coined, because there is a very big initial profit in the transaction.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state (1) the number of women teachers who were obliged to retire on pension at the age of 60 since the new regulation governing the retiral of women teachers came into force; and (2) the number of such teachers who did not receive full pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>(1) I assume the Deputy refers to the regulation which has been operative since 1st October, 1938, requiring women teachers of a specified minimum length of service to retire before reaching the age of 65 years.  From the date mentioned up to and including 31st December, 1944, this regulation applied to women teachers as from the date on which they reached 60 years of age or completed 35 years' service, whichever was the later.  As from 1st January, 1945, the regulation was modified so as to apply to those <Col N="1929" /> reaching 61 years of age or completing 36 years' service, whichever was the later.  The present regulation, operative since 1st January, 1946, permits women teachers to serve until they reach 62 years of age or complete 37 years' service, whichever is the later. Cases of hardship receive special consideration but, of course, whenever retention beyond the age of 60 is being considered efficiency of service has to be taken into account.  On this assumption the answer to Part I of the Deputy's question is that, for the period from 1st October, 1938, to 28th February, 1946, inclusive, 788 women teachers retired under the operation of the rule.  It is to be observed, however, that prior to October, 1938, when women teachers giving efficient service were permitted to serve up to 65 years of age, there were always numbers of teachers who retired voluntarily before reaching that age.  The figure of 788 must, therefore, be regarded as including a certain number of women teachers who would have retired voluntarily before the age of 65.</P>
      <P>(2)  Of the 788 teachers in question 645 had less than 40 years' service on the date of retirement and, accordingly, did not receive the maximum pension.</P>

In view of the burden that is being borne by teachers, through the high cost of living and the profits made by those in business and the failure to give teachers a reasonable salary, will the Minister not let the House know what offer he has made to them as well as an opportunity of deciding whether he has treated them with justice or not?</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary for Deputy Dillon to act as an auxiliary to Deputy Byrne in this matter.  I think the House knows what the position is.  For a considerable time the question of improved salary scales for teachers has been the subject of discussion and of correspondence between the representatives of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and myself.  That is a matter of general knowledge.  Deputy Byrne cannot be so innocent that he is not aware of the fact that the Government's offer to the teachers is at present the subject of consideration by their organisation.  In my view Deputy Byrne's intervention in this matter&mdash; this, of course, is not the first occasion on which he has intervened &mdash; is not helpful to the position.  Until this matter had been decided one way or the other I had not intended publishing the new scales for teachers.  I wished to give the teachers the fullest opportunity of considering the offer that has been put before them. <Col N="1932" /> Deputies need not be under the slightest misapprehension.  There is no question whatever of withholding any information from the Dáil.  The point is, when is the appropriate time?

      <P>In page 5, Section 2, sub-section (1), lines 50 and 51 deleted and in lieu thereof the following inserted:&mdash; the expression &ldquo;statutory tenant&rdquo; means a person being either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person who retains possession of any controlled premises after his contractual tenancy therein (not being a tenancy to which Section 45 of this Act applies) has terminated, or</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>(d)  a person who retains possession of any controlled premises under Section 58 of this Act;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to define more fully and more explicitly the classes of persons who are or may become &ldquo;statutory tenants&rdquo;.  I am advised, and I am satisfied, that this amendment, though it may not be absolutely necessary, is desirable and will improve the Bill.  During a rather long debate on this matter in the Seanad, it was made clear that, under the existing Acts, there is a considerable divergence of opinion as to what precisely a statutory tenant is and as to when exactly a contractual tenant's status is changed to that of a statutory tenant.  The amendment will, I think, resolve all doubts on this point.  Paragraph (a) of the amendment makes it clear that a person becomes a statutory tenant immediately he retains possession after his contractual tenancy has terminated.  Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) merely specify the persons who are specifically entitled under various provisions of the Bill to retain possession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if this amendment will meet the point I raised on Committee and on Report Stage, which he said he would consider?  That was the case of a tenant who dies, leaving a widow and family.  The widow then becomes the statutory tenant and, after a short time, she dies, leaving the family.  In that case, do the children succeed to the statutory tenancy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy turns to Section 39 (3), he will find that point is covered:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  In case the statutory tenant leaves him surviving his wife, who was residing with him at the time of his death, she shall be entitled to reclaim possession of the <Col N="1943" /> premises under the same terms and conditions as the deceased statutory tenant;</P>
    <P>(b)  in case the statutory tenant does not leave a wife so residing, such member of the statutory tenant's family so residing or, where there is more than one such member, such one of them as may be agreed upon between them or as may be selected by the court in default of agreement, shall be entitled to retain possession as aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that that is satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is satisfactory so far as it goes but the specific case I had in mind was that of a husband who died leaving a widow who, under sub-section (3) (a) of Section 39, becomes the statutory tenant.  If the widow dies immediately afterwards, then the children should, in the normal way, become entitled to be regarded as statutory tenants but, in a recent decision, a circuit judge held that they were not entitled to statutory tenancies, that the statutory tenancy determined on the death of the widow.  So far as I can see, that is not covered by (c) of sub-section (3) of Section 39. In that case, the statutory tenant is a woman.  If she dies, her husband gets the tenancy.  If he dies, the children get it but that does not cover the case where the statutory tenancy changes from the husband to the widow.  So far as I know, on her death, the children are not entitled to the tenancy.</P>

      <P>Tenancies from year to year were excluded from the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act and it was pointed out when we were in Committee, that bogus tenancies, subject to a week's or a month's notice, were expressed to be yearly tenancies. Accordingly, tenants were being treated as if they were not within the terms of the Act, whereas they should have been.  I brought in an amendment to make six months, expiring at the end of some year of the tenancy, the requisite notice but, when we went to the other House, we learned that genuine yearly tenancies also terminate on three months' notice.  If the Bill were left as it is, it would mean that certain yearly tenants would be excluded and others would be included.  To remove that anomaly, I accepted an amendment providing for not less than three months' notice.</P>

      <P>In page 8, Section 9, sub-sections (2) and (3) deleted and in lieu thereof the following sub-sections inserted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The basic rent of premises to which this section applies shall be determined by the court and shall be a rent of such amount as the court considers reasonable, under any given contract of tenancy not being for more than a term of five years, having regard to the basic rents of other controlled (1923 Act) premises and, in case evidence is forthcoming of both the following facts:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  that the premises the basic <Col N="1946" /> rent whereof is to be determined were on the 3rd day of August, 1914, held by an occupying tenant thereof under a contract of tenancy not being for more than a term of five years, or that they were not so held but were last so held on a date not being more than three years before the 3rd day of August, 1914, and</P>
    <P>(ii) the rent at which they were so held,</P>
    <P>then, having regard also to the amount of the said rent.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purpose of the determination by the court of the basic rent under this section the tenant shall be deemed to be responsible for the rates.</P>
    <P>During the debates in the Seanad, it was mentioned that there is probably a large number of cases under the existing Rent Acts where the parties have been able to agree among themselves as to the lawful rent on the basis of the 1914 rent, which was either definitely known to both parties or about which there was evidence available that satisfied both parties. There have been no proceedings in court for the determination of the standard rent and such cases do not, therefore, come within Section 8 of the Bill.  They are Section 9 cases and, under that section as it stands, the court when determining the basic rent is required to have regard only to the basic rent of other controlled (1923 Act) premises.  It was suggested that under these provisions there would be a temptation for either the landlord or tenant to bring proceedings under Section 9 in the hope that the court might vary the existing rent even though that rent was calculated on the basis of the known 1914 rent.  This amendment provides that the court may, in a Section 9 case, have regard to the 1914 rent where satisfactory evidence is forthcoming in regard to it.  This provision should suffice to deter persons, in the kind of cases to which I have referred, from taking a chance by bringing proceedings under Section 9.  It is a desirable amendment.</P>

      <P>(2)  Sub-section (1) of this section shall not apply to premises the increase in the rateable valuation whereof arises from improvements or structural alterations carried out by the landlord while in possession of the whole of the premises.</P>
      <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides that where a house is in one chapter, an increase in valuation will not bring it from Chapter I to Chapter II under which a superior rent would be chargeable. It was pointed out in the Seanad that a house might come into the vacant possession of the landlord and he might then execute substantial repairs with the result that the House would get a higher valuation.  In order to encourage him to let the house again and not to do what people mostly do with vacant houses nowadays, namely to sell the house, we are providing in this amendment that where vacant possession has been obtained by the landlord and where substantial alterations or repairs have been carried out, the house will come under the appropriate chapter, in other words, that Section 10 will not apply to such a house and that it will not remain in the chapter in which it originally stood.  The amendment may keep such houses in the letting market and encourage landlords to do substantial repairs.</P>

    <P>This is a purely drafting amendment. It was suggested in the Seanad that it would be desirable to set out specifically the matters in respect of which the lawful addition provided for in paragraph (e) of Section 11 (2) was allowed.  Paragraph (e) as it stands merely refers the reader back to a particular provision of Section 8 of the 1923 Act.  The amendment mentions the dates definitely rather than referring to sections.

    <P>(3)  If, on an application to the court under this sub-section by the landlord or tenant of premises to which Section 14 of this Act applies, the court is satisfied that the basic rent of the premises either exceeds, or falls short of, by an amount exceeding one-fifth of the basic rent, the rent (in this sub-section referred to as the notional rent) which, if the premises were premises to which Section 16 of this Act applies, would be determined by the court as the basic rent thereof, the basic rent of the premises shall be determined by the court and shall be the amount which, in the opinion of the court, <Col N="1950" /> represents the notional rent, and thenceforth the premises shall, without prejudice to the previous application thereto of paragraph (a) of Section 23 of this Act, become premises to which Section 16 of this Act applies as if such determination had been made under that section.</P>
    <P>This deals with another point which was raised in the Seanad.  Some Senators mentioned that they knew of cases in which people had let houses to relatives or to particular friends at nominal rents.  If they were to be held to that rent for the future, they would be getting a rent which would be altogether inadequate.  On the other hand a Senator mentioned a case in which the rent was unduly high.  I think the Senator in that case said that the house was occupied by some legation.  Obviously it would not be fair in cases like that to keep to the rent that was being paid on the particular date when that situation existed. There would not be many cases but its would be rather a hardship to a man who had set a house for quarter its value if he were kept to that rent.</P>

      <P>(2)  The basic rent of premises to which this section applies shall be determined by the court as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  in the case of premises consisting of a separate and self-contained flat or tenement forming part of any buildings which, after the 7th day of May, 1941, are or which at that date were being <i>bona fide</i> reconstructed by way of conversion into two or more such flats or tenements, the basic rent of the premises shall be the rent, which, in the opinion of the court, the <Col N="1951" /> immediate landlord of an occupying tenant of the premises might, if the premises, as reconstructed, had been in existence in the year ending on the 7th day of May, 1941, reasonably have expected in that year under any given contract of tenancy not being for more than a term of five years;</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case, the basic rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the court, the immediate landlord of an occupying tenant of the premises might, in the year ending on the 7th day of May, 1941, reasonably have expected under any given contract of tenancy not being for more than a term of five years.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 10 and 12 contain the provisions under which the lawful rents of newly-controlled flats will be determined and I suggest to the House that they may be conveniently discussed together.</P>
    <P>The first amendment provides in paragraph (a) for the manner in which the basic rent of the flat will be determined. In effect, all that is done is to extend the principle of the existing Section 16 by taking the year ending on the 7th May, 1941, as the period by reference to which the basic rent will be determined.  On the assumption that the flat, as now reconstructed, was then in existence, the court will fix the basic rent as the rent which the landlord might in the year in question reasonably have expected to obtain from an occupying tenant on a letting for a term of not more than five years. This, I think, is the fairest standard to apply for the determination of the basic rent and it fits in with the general scheme of Chapter 2 of Part II.</P>
    <P>The more difficult part of this problem is to determine what addition to the notional fair 1941 rent should be allowed, in view of the increased cost of reconstruction work as compared with the 1941 or pre-1941 cost of such work.  The second amendment deals with this by providing that the landlord should be entitled to a lawful addition reckoned as 8 per cent. per annum of the portion of the total cost of reconstruction which might be <Col N="1952" /> attributed to the particular flat.  The amendment provides that, for this purpose, the total cost should be apportioned between the different flats in the proportions that the rateable valuation of each flat bears to the total rateable valuation of the building or buildings as reconstructed.</P>

It brings the provisions of paragraph (e) into line with the other provisions of the section and is really nothing more than a drafting amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a minor amendment, which proposes to delete the words &ldquo;without prejudice to any other manner of service&rdquo; in sub-section (1) of Section 30.

      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), page 18, deleted and the following paragraphs inserted in lieu thereof:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if on the hearing of the application it appears to the court that the premises are not small premises, the court shall revoke the provisional order with effect retrospectively from the date of the making thereof;</P>
      <P>(b)  in any other case, the court may, as it thinks proper&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  by order confirm the terms of the provisional order with or without modification, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  revoke the provisional order and make such new order in relation to the premises as the circumstances may require;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  if an order is made under paragraph (b) of this sub-section, <Col N="1957" /> then, as on and from the making thereof and notwithstanding anything in any other provision of this Act,&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the said order shall have effect as the final determination of the District Court in respect of the matters to which the said order relates,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the provisional order shall cease to be in force, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  for the purpose of the application of Section 20 of this Act the tenant shall be deemed to have entered into an agreement with the landlord to pay in respect of the premises a rent equal to the lawful rent of the premises as determined by the said order made under paragraph (b) of this sub-section.</P>
    <P>This is, in the main, a drafting amendment. It recasts paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 31 in what are considered to be better and less rigid terms than the existing paragraphs.</P>
    <P>The only change of any substance which the amendment makes is that it gives the justice, when dealing with an application by the landlord under Section 31, the additional power of revoking the provisional order and substituting for it such new order as he considers the circumstances may require.  Under the existing provisions of paragraph (b), he can only confirm or vary the provisional order.</P>
    <P>The amendment also remedies a drafting defect in the existing paragraph (a) by deleting sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii).  Provisions identical with these two sub-paragraphs furnish the grounds for the making of a provisional order under paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 29 and it is clearly wrong that the same provisions should be the ground for subsequently revoking the order under paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 31.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment on which we had a long debate in the Seanad.  As the <Col N="1959" /> Bill stands, apparently a person could not sell his goodwill.  If a person were a statutory tenant, either wholly or in part, of a business premises, he was not entitled to sell his interest, as the section prevented him from taking any payment on giving up possession.  It was thought that such persons were covered by the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, in this matter, but that is defective also and will need to be amended.  In the meantime, we have provided that a person in such a position, holding a statutory tenancy either wholly or in part in a business premises, can take payment on giving up the tenancy.</P>
    <P>I hope this year to bring in a Bill to amend the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, so as to make that point permanently secure.  There was a long debate on that amendment.  One Senator convinced us all that it was right, though it would appear, as the 1923 Act stood, that landlords could have refused; at least, it was illegal to charge any money where there was a statutory tenancy.  But it was not exercised.  The fear was that once it was exposed there might be a flood of these things happening.  Therefore, we thought it well to make it quite clear that a business premises was not to be taken, that the statutory tenancy in the business premises was not to be put in the same position as in an ordinary dwelling.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, Section 40, at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows inserted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) Where, on or after the operative date, controlled premises are lawfully assigned by the statutory tenant (in this sub-section referred to as the assignor), then, in the absence of any express agreement between the landlord and the assignee, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if the premises are, at the date of the assignment, being lawfully used wholly or in part for the purposes of any business, trade or profession, the assignee shall, from the said date, be deemed to hold the premises in accordance with whichever of the following sub-paragraphs is applicable:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case evidence is forthcoming that the premises were, immediately before the creation of the statutory tenancy therein, held by the contractual tenant thereof under a tenancy from year to year or for a term of years or other certain period (not being less than one year), or depending on the fall of a life or any other uncertain event, the assignee shall be deemed to hold the premises from the landlord under a tenancy from year to year, terminable, on or after the expiration of the first year thereof, by either party by two months' notice expiring on a gale day and, subject thereto, on the same terms and conditions as the assignor;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  in case evidence is forthcoming that the premises were so held under a contract of tenancy to which sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph does not relate, the assignee shall be deemed to hold the premises from the landlord under a contract of tenancy of like duration as the contract of <Col N="1962" /> tenancy under which they were so held, and, subject thereto, on the same terms and conditions as the assignor;</P>
    <P>(iii)  in any other case, the assignee shall be entitled to retain possession of the premises on the same terms and conditions as the assignor;</P>
    <P>(b)  if the premises are premises to which paragraph (a) of this sub-section does not relate, the assignee shall be entitled to retain possession of the premises on the same terms and conditions as the assignor.</P>
    <P>This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 25 in order to define the conditions under which the assignee of a statutory tenant's interests should hold the premises from the landlord. Briefly, the main object of the somewhat elaborate provisions of this new amendment is to secure that the assignee will not hold the premises on any better terms than were enjoyed by the tenant holding under the contract of tenancy which subsisted immediately before the statutory tenancy was created in the premises.  Accordingly, in the case of business premises, sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (a) provides that where the contract of tenancy had been a yearly tenancy or better, the assignee shall be deemed to hold the premises from the landlord on a tenancy from year to year, terminable on or after the expiration of the first year by two months' notice.</P>
    <P>This latter provision will ensure, having regard to the provision of paragraph (f) of Section 3 (2), that the premises shall remain subject to control. If it was left to three months it would be outside control.  Where the premises were not originally held under a yearly or better tenancy, sub-paragraph (ii) provides that the assignee shall be deemed to hold under a contract of tenancy of like duration as the original contract.  Thus, if the original contract were a weekly tenancy, the assignee will hold as a weekly tenant. Sub-paragraph (iii) provides that, in any very exceptional case which might not be covered by the other two sub-paragraphs, the assignee shall hold the premises as a statutory tenant. <Col N="1963" /> Paragraph (b) deals with dwelling-houses and there, principally because of the fact that there can be no valuable consideration as a condition of the assignment of a statutory tenant's interest in such premises, it is simply provided that the assignee shall hold as a statutory tenant.</P>

It was suggested that instead of giving money something like a piece of furniture at an enhanced price might be given and in order to prevent that we put in &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;pecuniary&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we were debating this matter on the last day, we had the rather interesting experience of finding the Taoiseach accepting the findings of this committee on Ministerial powers, from which we have been quoting so much, and even going so far as to say that the conditions in this country were not inconsistent, and for that reason, on Deputy Byrne's and Deputy Anthony's motion in relation to legislation by Ministerial Order, the Taoiseach voiced the opinion that he saw no reason for setting up a special committee to consider Ministerial powers here and gave the impression that he more or less accepted the findings of the committee which had been set up in England in 1932.  He admitted that there was a problem and that there were certain necessary evils arising from that problem which would have to be faced.  He concluded by a full expression of the view that he would look into this matter to see what could be done to improve upon the present position and indicated to the House that conditions on the other side and here were not dissimilar, and that, even if a committee of the kind asked for in that motion were set up, its findings would probably be identical with those of the 1932 committee.  I mention that matter because the Minister for Local Government has throughout this debate resisted the principle that we should take the findings of this committee into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was referring on the last occasion to certain principles of natural justice <Col N="1966" /> which were considered essential to safeguard the proceedings of public inquiries and Ministerial judicial and quasi-judicial decisions, and had got as far as mentioning two of these. The third principle of natural justice is that a party is entitled to know the reason for the decision, whether it be a judicial or quasi-judicial decision, and, in the opinion of the committee, there were some cases when a refusal to give the grounds for a decision may be plainly unfair and that this may be so even when the decision is final and no further proceedings are open to the disappointed party by way of appeal or otherwise.  They then go on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But it cannot be disputed that when further proceedings are open to a disappointed party it is contrary to natural justice that the silence of the Minister or the Ministerial tribunal should deprive him of his opportunity.  And we think it beyond all doubt that there is from the angle of broad political expediency a real advantage in communicating the grounds of the decision to the parties concerned and, if of general interest, to the public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fourth principle which they maintained existed in these matters was that when Parliament has provided for what amounts to an oral hearing by the method of a &ldquo;public inquiry&rdquo;, local or otherwise, held before an inspector appointed for the purpose by the Minister, as a means of guidance to the Minister in his decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am concerned with only two points: the legal safeguards necessary in public inquiries&mdash;and in support of my argument in that respect, I have quoted the findings of the committee&mdash;and the publication of inspectors' reports.  The fourth principle is that when Parliament has provided for what amounts to an oral hearing, by the method of a &ldquo;public inquiry&rdquo;, local or otherwise, held before an inspector appointed for the purpose by the Minister, as a means of guidance to the Minister in his decision&mdash;whether judicial or quasi-judicial&mdash;it is contrary to natural justice that the inspector's report upon the inquiry should not be made available to the parties so heard.  They went on to make a recommendation that where a decision was given by the Minister, or a Ministerial tribunal, in their opinion, the law required some safeguard by which the jurisdiction of the High Court could be preserved to the parties who were affected by such a decision, and they went on to set up what they considered a simple procedure for providing that safeguard.</P>
      <P>As to the question whether or not inspectors' reports should be published, they went into the matter very fully and gave the arguments for and against publication.  I do not propose to prolong the debate by giving these arguments, but they can be found, by any person who wishes to consult them, at pages 103 and 104 of the report.  They say, in conclusion:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To these various arguments for and against publication we have given prolonged consideration, and on balance have come to the conclusion that publication is right.  By that we <Col N="1968" /> do not mean that the expense of printing a long report should in every case be incurred; but that in all cases the report of the inspector should be made available to the parties concerned and to the Press, and in important cases should be officially published by the Department responsible for the inquiry.  We fully appreciate the importance of not undermining the confidential relationship between the Minister and his officials and however strong the case for publication in order to allay a public suspicion, we should, in the public interest, resist the demand for publication if any such consequence were in our judgment likely to ensue.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am only making the point that the document itself was quoted from and its findings endorsed. The reasons for not setting up the committee, as given by the Taoiseach, were, briefly, that the events in law, the trend of legislation here and in Great Britain and the system of legislation by Ministerial Order and the administrative confusion which is growing up from it, were so similar <Col N="1969" /> that there was no necessity to set up a committee here, that he was satisfied that it could not come to any other conclusion than that reached by the British committee.</P>
      <P>I advanced this argument at whatever length I may have delayed the House solely in favour of my amendment that these proceedings should in some way or other be safeguarded.  All I asked for was that the rules of evidence should be applied to such proceedings, and, failing that, that some legal safeguards be given to the parties affected by Ministerial inquiries of that kind.  On the final point&mdash;that the report of the inspector holding the inquiry should be published&mdash;if I have delayed the House or irritated the Minister in any way by prolonging the debate by quotations from the Committee on Ministerial Powers, the Donoughmore Committee, my apology is that I wanted to advance these in support of my own views and not to stand up here merely to give expression to personal opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to give us a more judicial local inquiry than we have at present.  I think the Minister was right in saying that this amendment seeks to change the law in regard to a local inquiry, but his attitude is to stand for the present position.  Before we accept the Minister's attitude, we must realise that the law in relation to local government has changed fundamentally in recent years.  The Minister pointed out on frequent occasions in this House that it is desirable, in the interests of local administration, that there should be local inquiries, and that local authorities in order to maintain efficiency in their services, whenever they think it necessary, should call for local inquiries. If a local authority is to call for a local inquiry it must, first of all, have confidence in that inquiry.  It must be satisfied that the inquiry to be held is a judicial or semi-judicial one, which will act in accordance with the laws of justice.  It is because the Minister has refused to accept that principle, and has refused to give us a fair and impartial local inquiry, that local authorities have been reluctant to call for inquiries.  I am not arguing <Col N="1970" /> on theory in regard to this matter, because it was debated at Carlow County Council last week.  Statements were made there by the manager which appeared to reflect on local officials, and a proposal was put forward that a sworn inquiry should be held, but the county council, having considered the matter, decided not to call for a sworn inquiry, mainly for the reason that sworn inquiries, as we know them, are not impartial, and, as constituted, cannot be impartial.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the statement, in relation to a local inquiry, that he is in the same position as a jury trying a case.  That is a most extraordinary position to take up.  A jury, although it may consist of laymen&mdash;what the Minister claims to be in this connection &mdash;is a body of people selected because its members are known to have no direct or indirect interest in the case under consideration.  If it was found that any member of a jury had some connection with the case under consideration, that person would not be allowed to act on it.  Again, the members of a jury must be present at the entire trial.  They must see the witnesses giving evidence, note their demeanour, and the manner in which they reply to questions.  The Minister sitting in his office, engaged in transacting the business of his Department, has no opportunity of observing the demeanour of witnesses, or noting the general character of the evidence, so that there is no comparison whatever between the position of the Minister when dealing with local inquiries and that of a jury.  If we were to accept the Minister's contention that his agent could act for him at a trial, we would be in the position that we should accept the plea that a farmer summoned on a jury could send his son, or some other member of his family, to represent him at a trial and report back to him.  That would be a fantastic situation.  Yet, it is not more fantastic than what the Minister put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local inquiries must be held, either at the instance of the Minister or of a local authority.  If the Minister insists upon a local inquiry being held, that means that he is not satisfied with conditions <Col N="1971" /> in the area in which it is to be held.  It also means that he has some direct interest in the matter.  If a county council calls for an inquiry, it must, first of all, be satisfied that it is going to get an impartial inquiry.  The fundamental error into which the Minister fell is that he regards local officials as officials of his Department, directly under his control.  Local officials are officials of local authorities. The Minister does not seem to be able to realise that.  I think everybody will accept the view that the Minister has the right to exercise very effective control&mdash;I should say drastic control&mdash;over the officers of his Department, but when it is a matter of dealing with locally elected bodies, or the servants of these bodies, the Minister  dealing with an entirely different proposition.  He is dealing with something for which other machinery must be provided, rather than disciplinary action by the Minister, for that is what he seems to demand the right to exercise.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has expressed on various occasions, and even last week, an earnest desire for decentralisation, but the Minister is in direct opposition to the Taoiseach there, and is demanding more and more centralisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>If the Minister does not learn to keep his temper under control I am afraid he will eventually develop into a disagreeable old man.  I am dealing with a speech made by the Minister on Friday last, and I am replying to points he then made.  He stated that he is the Minister for Local Government, elected by this House to look after local government, and he claims that he has the right to interfere, down to the minutest detail, with every aspect of local administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make my own speech.  I advise the Minister to read his speech carefully.  All through that speech it was stated that by virtue of the position which he holds, he has inevitably the right to resist any attempt to curb his powers in any way. Not alone did the Minister claim this far-reaching control over local affairs, but he also claimed to be judicial, as judicial as the judges on the bench.  I believe that the Minister is endeavouring to convert the Custom House into a new Kremlin.  It appears to me that, standing in all his dignity on the dome of the Custom House, he is becoming intolerant of the Four Courts. He told us how hard is the road a Minister has to travel in order to reach his high office.  He told us that he did not reach his high office by accident.  I am not going to comment, Sir, upon the manner by which the Minister reached his high office but I do think that the Minister is quite incorrect in asserting that he can be as impartial as a judge on the bench. A judge has one thing, at any rate, namely, security of tenure.  I am dealing, not with the Minister personally but with any normal Minister for Local Government.  A Minister has not only to discharge the high functions of his office but he has to fight a political battle to assist in maintaining his Party in power.  For that reason, he cannot approach problems in the same judicial and disinterested manner as a judge approaches them.  For that reason also he is not the person best qualified to decide issues which may be raised in a local inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must remember that in dealing with the servants of a local authority he is dealing with an entirely different type of public servants from those of his own Department.  Many of the officials of local authorities are part-time officials.  Medical officers, for example, may not only be servants of the local authority but may be men with a big private practice in their profession.  The Minister must realise how serious a thing it is to have an adverse decision given against a <Col N="1973" /> medical officer in a local inquiry, what a reflection it must be upon his character and what an injury it must be to him not only in his position as a public official but also in his private practice.  For that reason it is absolutely necessary that we should have impartial local inquiries such as is envisaged in the amendment and that the report of such inquiries should be made public so that everyone may judge as to the justice of the decision taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by an extraordinary twist, after having denounced Deputy Byrne for attending a coronation ceremony and a royal funeral and having treated such ceremonies with ridicule, comes out openly and publicly in this House to tell us that he bases his authority for refusing to publish the findings of a tribunal on a decision of the House of Lords.  The Minister does not like crowns but he appears to have a great admiration for coronets and now we find that a member of the Government of the Irish Republic is relying for his authority on the British House of Lords, that great citadel of liberty and justice.  I wonder what would Maureen O'Hara say to that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech delivered by the Minister on Friday was an extraordinary one.  I think it was one of the most peculiar speeches we have heard in this House for a long time, even from the Minister.  Democracy was quoted by the Minister as his authority for his actions.  I am afraid the Minister does not know the meaning of democracy.  The Minister has come to the conclusion that the will of the people is the will of the Minister. He has, by an extraordinary philosophy, arrived at the decision that, because he is elected a Deputy and because he is elected by this House as Minister, everything he says expresses the will of the people.  When Rome was in her glory and Cæsar used to ride in triumph through the streets, he used to employ a slave to whisper into his ear from time to time: &ldquo;Remember thou art a mere man.&rdquo;  I think it would be a good idea if the <Col N="1974" /> Minister were to instruct one of his higher officials to whisper a similar message into his ear from time to time because I believe that since he took over local government he has assumed that he has a right to dictate every aspect of local government, from the most important matter down to the smallest detail and that that is the reason why he is seeking, most resolutely, to oppose this perfectly reasonable and perfectly desirable amendment.</P>
      <P>If we accept the view that the Minister, being responsible for local government, should dominate the whole local machinery, we should reject this amendment, but if we accept the view that decentralisation is good&mdash;as the Taoiseach suggested&mdash; and if we accept the view that local bodies should have considerable discretion, then we must accept the view that there ought to be an impartial tribunal to try issues that may arise as between local authorities and the Minister and as between local officials and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you put the question, Sir, I should like to make some reference to the Minister's attitude on Friday against the amendment. In order that people may get some idea of how far removed the Minister's whole speech on Friday was from the amendment, I think it is necessary again to emphasise that the amendment which is before the House seeks to do two things: (1) that inquiries shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence and (2) that the findings, the report or the observations&mdash;whichever word one chooses to accept&mdash;of the inspector shall be made public.  That is the amendment in a nutshell.  If one were to read the Minister's speech instead of reading the amendment, one would come to the conclusion that there was something far different before the House.  The Minister, on Friday, tried to get the House to believe that an acceptance of this amendment would undermine completely his authority as Minister.  He tried to get the House to accept that if they agreed to this amendment the relations between the <Col N="1975" /> Minister and his inspectors and, as a matter of fact, the relations between the Minister, and any official of the Department of Local Government. would be completely destroyed.  He went further and suggested that the acceptance of the amendment would place an official of his Department in a position superior to that of the Minister himself. The Minister is rather fond of describing other people's statements or arguments as fantastic.  Anything more fantastic than the case put up by the Minister on Friday it would be hard to conceive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, during the course of his speech, has been dealing largely with the position where a local authority has demanded an inquiry. But, remember, that in the majority of cases it is the Minister himself who orders the inquiry.  We must remember also that, when this Bill becomes law, the Minister will be empowered to order inquiries into matters which hitherto would not come within his power at all.  We must remember further that, if and when the Bill becomes law in its present form, inquiries will be conducted, not necessarily by a trained or permanent civil servant, but by any person who may be appointed by the Minister for a period&mdash;I am speaking from recollection and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;not exceeding 30 days. So that a person who is beholden absolutely to the Minister for his appointment to preside over a certain inquiry will make his report to the Minister on the inquiry and nobody but the Minister or that person will know what the report is.  That is an aspect of the matter with which the House ought to concern itself. Remember, the Minister has to be satisfied that there is need for an inquiry before he orders it.  The inspector goes down to hold the inquiry, human nature being what it is, with his mind more or less made up.  Certainly he is biased against the person or the public authority which is to be the subject of the inquiry.  He goes down knowing that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case sufficient <Col N="1976" /> for the Minister to order the inquiry. I want to put this as a bare matter of justice: an official, or a number of members of a local authority&mdash;when this Bill becomes law, it is not merely the local authority as a whole, but it may be one, two, three, five or ten members of a local authority&mdash;will be penalised, notwithstanding what the Minister said, very largely, if not entirely, upon the report of the inspector.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he reads the evidence&mdash;I do not question that statement for a moment&mdash;and that on the evidence he comes to his decision. Take some of these inquiries which have been held.  The evidence must extend to a very large volume.  We are not legislating now for the present Minister for Local Government.  Let us take it that we have at some time in the future a different Minister for Local Government who will not be quite as energetic or conscientious or who will not have quite the same judicial mind as the present Minister. Assuming that that Minister has the time, away from all the multifarious duties for which the Minister for Local Government is now responsible, but that he is too lazy or gets fed up after reading some of the evidence and does not finish the evidence, what is he going to do?  He will read the inspector's report, the analysis of the evidence, and give his decision on that.  Is not that a reasonable thing to say?  I have not yet heard from the Minister one good, sound, solid argument against the report of the inspector being published.  In my opinion, any official or any local authority charged before a local inquiry and penalised as a result of that inquiry will not be getting justice unless they are enabled to see the inspector's report.  The Minister was very uneasy whilst Deputy Coogan was quoting from the Donoughmore report. He did not like it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the delegation of legislation and there is a section delegating legislation in this Bill.  I think it is very pertinent, because it is unjust to give the Minister power to an extent which I think no individual, Minister or otherwise, should have in this country or in any country which claims to be a free democratic country.  Of course, the reason the Minister was uneasy was because it was a very effective reply to the fears which he expressed.  I do not believe that the Minister has those fears which he expressed here on Friday.  The Minister knows quite well, when he says that the intention behind this amendment is to destroy his power and authority as Minister, that there is no such intention or desire behind this amendment.  There is a desire to restrict his authority.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the Minister again of what I said on Friday.  The Minister, apparently, thinks that his authority is above and beyond any other consideration.  It is not.  The rights of the citizen are above any authority which any Minister of State ought to enjoy.  There is a question of a Minister exercising in a fair and just way the authority conferred upon him by this House and there is a question of that authority being abused to the detriment of the citizen.  All we are asking is that the citizen shall be safeguarded.  I do not think any Deputy will say that it is unreasonable (1) that the inquiry should be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence and (2) that the report upon which a person will be penalised and may be victimised should be made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> Now, I do not want in any way to be offensive; I do not want in any way to be accused of being personal, but if I were to judge the mind and the temperament and the outlook of the Minister as the mind and the temperament and the outlook with which he approaches the reports of inquiries, by the way in which the Minister carries on in this House, I would be very chary of giving the Minister any authority at all.  I feel, and I believe I am right&mdash;I certainly hope I am right&mdash;that the Minister, acting in the Custom House as a Minister, does not show the same blind prejudice that he shows in this House.  I believe that the Minister would not be deliberately unfair or unjust to any citizen or any person, but we are not legislating for the present Minister: we are legislating for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, yes, perhaps in a different Bill.  I do put it, however, that the Minister ought not to take the debate on this amendment, or the reasons put forward by Deputies in support of it, as if they were solely, purely, and completely personal to him.  They are not, and I am sure that the Minister knows that, but the Minister knows, perhaps better than anybody else, all the old tricks, and how many red herrings he can trail across a debate, when it suits him, just as he knows that sometimes he can succeed in knocking a Deputy off his point if he gets up and makes a sufficient number of irrelevant points of order. That is an old trick, as I say, but I do not want to go into that now.  I want to put this question in as fair and plain a way as I can, and I want again to ask Deputies not to take the Minister's speech on this as all that can be said, or to allow themselves to be influenced altogether by the Minister's spoken words on this, but to read the amendment&mdash;the suggested new sub-section&mdash; for themselves, and to say then, if they can say so conscientiously, that it is an unfair thing to ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  I think that if Deputies will read the amendment, they will come to the conclusion that it is a fair amendment.  The Minister found fault with one word in the <Col N="1979" /> amendment, the word &ldquo;findings&rdquo;, and we told him that we were quite prepared to accept any other word he suggested, if he accepted the principle. We are not wedded to that particular word, so long as we can get justice and fair play for the person who is charged with certain things, and so long as the report of the inquiry is made available to the public and, at least, to the person so charged, in order that he may know that he is getting justice and fair play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting this amendment, Sir, because I think it represents the last attempt that can be made on this stage of the Bill to provide certain safeguards.  I am of opinion that certain sections of this Bill contain very dangerous possibilities, and I want to approach this matter from the point of view of the future of local government in this matter.  It is a subject in which I am interested, and in which, I think, members of all Parties in this House are interested.  Again, it is a subject that is more intimately bound up with the lives of all sections of the people than perhaps any other one of the State services or Departments in this country.  That being so, I have tried to find in the report of the debates here some substantial argument by the Minister against the acceptance of this amendment, and I want to say, without offence, that having read his speech I can see none.  May I ask that this matter should be considered carefully before the proposals contained here are rejected, in view of the fact that the whole future of local government in this country will be affected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt about it&mdash; and there is no exaggeration in this statement; it is not made for mere Party purposes or anything like that&mdash; there is a great deal of uneasiness with regard to local government in this country, and more and more people are beginning to feel that powers are being sought by the central local authority in this country that are not in the best interests of local government or in the best interests of fair play in this country.  Now, that should be a concern of the present Minister <Col N="1980" /> or of any Minister for Local Government, and I think that the Minister would lose none of his dignity or none of his efficiency, nor would his Department suffer in any way, if he took the local authorities and the people, generally, more fully into his confidence and showed by his every official act that public confidence would be, shall I say, maintained in regard to the impartiality of local government or, perhaps I should say, that it would be restored to some extent.</P>
    <P>I have been present at local inquiries, and let me say that I want to express my emphatic support of the proposal here that a decision, following a report of a local inquiry, should be promptly furnished to the local authority.  There was a case some time ago where, as far as I remember, the delay in furnishing the decision to the local authority was as long as over 12 months.  Now, the local authority had to pay for that inquiry: local authorities will have to pay for every inquiry.  In that case, the reputation and the character of certain people were at stake, and I do not think it is reasonable that the decision in a case of that kind should take over a year, or a year, or even most of a year, before it should be furnished to the local authority or be published.</P>
    <P>I am interested in this question of the rules of evidence, which is suggested in this amendment.  As the Minister knows, and as any of us who have had experience of local inquiries know, there are no rules at the present time, and subjects may be introduced at a local inquiry out of the very distant past, and sometimes they tend to put the people against whom they are introduced into a very unenviable and disadvantageous position.  That is an argument, I think, for changing the procedure in that connection, and I want to emphasise it.  I am satisfied that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if the inspector's report were published.  I am satisfied that if it were published there is no reason for thinking that efficiency would be impaired or undermined, or that any of those things suggested by the Minister would take place, or that <Col N="1981" /> a fair and just conclusion could be reached that the inspector's report should not be made available.  I support this amendment and I ask the Minister, having regard to the whole future of local government in this country, and having regard to the fact that there is a feeling that the whole system is being removed more and more from the people and that local authorities have less to do with matters of this kind now than ever they had in the past, seriously to consider this whole matter.</P>
    <P>All control over, and association with, staffs of local authorities is being taken away from the local authorities, and a situation is being created that tends to throw a mantle of silence over the whole position locally.  Therefore, I believe that a good day's work would be done by, if necessary, initiating procedure of the kind suggested in this amendment.  Seeing that the Minister is desirous that the fullest possible confidence should be maintained in every branch of local government in this country, I think that that would be the best way to go about it.  It would be an earnest of the fact that the circulars the Minister has sent out to local authorities represent his will and his earnest desire to act in the best interests of local government here and that they are not just pious expressions issued for the purpose of getting members of local authorities interested in a system under which it is being made more and more abundantly clear to them their only function is to register and put into effect decisions that have been already come to.  Each day and every 12 months the local authorities have to provide the money, from whatever source they can extract it, for the various services which are performed in their name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on this amendment it was never suggested, I think, by any of those supporting it that local inquiries were not necessary in the past and would not be necessary in the future.  I wonder if any Deputy, with experience as a member of a local authority, who has ever attended a local inquiry believes that it would be possible to put this amendment, if passed, into operation.  The first thing <Col N="1982" /> set out in it is that the proceeding shall be governed by the rules of evidence.  That presupposes that nobody except a person with legal training will be qualified to hold a local inquiry.  A lay person would not be acquainted with the rules of evidence, so that in future a medical inspector, an engineering inspector or a civilian inspector would not, according to this, be qualified to hold a local inquiry. There will be agreement, I think, that nobody except a barrister, a judge, solicitor or other person acquainted with the rules of evidence would be competent to hold a local inquiry.  I challenge those who are supporting the amendment to deny that.</P>
      <P>The second point in the amendment is that the findings of the inspector on the evidence tendered before him shall be made public.  That means, following my argument on the first part of the amendment, that the findings of the barrister or judge who holds the inquiry must be published before the Minister has adjudicated upon them.  The position we reach, therefore, is this: that the Minister dare not express an opinion contrary to those findings, and if he does he is to be pilloried, to be put up as a cock-shot, in this House and before the public Press.  Is not that what the amendment means, that the Minister who has ordered the inquiry is to have no right to express an opinion on the findings?  Why did not the mover and supporters of the amendment go the whole way, and suggest that a judicial inquiry, presided over by a judge of the High Court or the Circuit Court, should be held, and that its decision should be final and not referable to the Minister at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only alternative that I see to the present system under which those conducting the inquiries, whether they be medical or engineering inspectors, or an official of the Minister's Department, or some outside person, do not, I believe, come to a final decision at all.  I have attended a number of those inquiries, and I have seen a stenographer take a verbatim report of the questions asked and of the answers given by witnesses. I assume that a transcript of the <Col N="1983" /> evidence is furnished to the Minister, and that, in addition, the inspector would send him a summary of his opinions of the different witnesses examined.  When the Minister has that information before him the responsibility is on him, and on nobody else, to come to a decision.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense for any Deputy to say that a Minister, in taking a decision, is not responsible to anybody.  He is responsible to this House which elected him a Minister.  Deputies on the Opposition Benches know very well that at any time they can put down a motion challenging a Minister's decision on any matter relating to his Department.  If, at any time, it is thought that a Minister has made an unfair decision in respect to any of these matters he can be challenged in this House.  Deputy Morrissey is well aware of that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite well aware of it all the same.  While I do not agree with the Minister and his Department as regards every iota in this Local Government Bill, I honestly believe that it would not be feasible or possible to put the proposal in this amendment into operation.  This system of holding local inquiries has been in operation ever since, I think, the Local Government Act of 1898 was passed.  The Minister is not proposing to change it, although one would think, listening to the speeches of some Deputies, that he was putting some revolutionary proposals into the Bill.  This amendment, if passed, would not be of any advantage to any local authority or to any person who had to answer before a local inquiry. It has not been suggested, either in this House or elsewhere, that any person has been victimised as the result of the holding of a local inquiry.</P>

      <P>All of us could say that, at some time or other in our lives, either by some individual or group of individuals, we have been victimised, but it has not been said in the debate on this amendment that one could name any individual who has been victimised under the present system of holding local inquiries.  It may be said that one did not agree with the findings of the Minister, or with the action taken by him following our inquiry. Suppose the Tipperary County Council or the Wexford County Council were suppressed as a result of an inquiry, I am sure that neither Deputy Morrissey nor myself would be pleased with the Minister's decision, but whether in so acting he was right or wrong, we must assume, until the contrary is proved, that he had done right in the exercise of his opinion as a responsible Minister of the Government, and as a Minister responsible to the House and to the country.  We must assume that Ministers may come to wrong decisions.  They are not infallible any more than we are, but, in my opinion, the present system is the only one that we have of reaching a decision on these matters.</P>
      <P>The only other alternative, as I have said, is to have a judicial inquiry, presided over by a judge whose decision shall be final and binding. That is the only alternative.  This amendment will not be feasible as an alternative.  I think that it is wasting the time of the House to flog this amendment, because it is not possible to operate it.</P>

      <P>I am not going to be side-tracked by the Minister, who knows where I am leading.  Under the 1924 Courts of Justice Act, the system of appeals was changed.  The old system of rehearing by the Judges of Assize was done away with and all appeals were decided on the notes of a shorthand writer.  There was such an outcry against that that a Courts of Justice Commission, of which I had the honour to be chairman, was set up by this House.  That commission included members of the Party opposite. It sat for 14 months and took evidence from every person in the country who was interested, from the Chief Justice down, including members of the legal profession and judicial personages.  That commission unanimously recommended that appeals should be decided by way of rehearing and that recommendation was accepted by the Government.  That is that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen's speech was merely a repetition of what the Minister has been saying.  The Deputy fell into the trap against which I warned him.  Instead of reading the amendment and analysing it, he read the Minister's speech, and repeated that the person who felt he was unjustly treated had a <Col N="1986" /> remedy, because the Minister could be pilloried in this House.  That is the appeal held out to a man whose future may be blasted by a decision by the Minister.  What is that appeal worth? Nothing.  Let me put this to Deputy Allen, as a member of the Minister's Party: if we bring in a motion here and prove to Deputy Allen's satisfaction that the Minister's decision was wrong in a particular case, will Deputy Allen vote against the Minister?  The appeal will be decided, not on the justice of the case, but on the size of the majority which the Government has.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen reminded us that he did not agree with certain things in this Bill.  Of course, not.  There are fundamental sections of the Bill with which he disagrees and he had the courage to get up and say so.  But, when it came to a decision, Deputy Allen and his colleagues did not vote against them and the same thing would happen if the Minister were pilloried in this House in the manner which is described by the Deputy as a safeguard. Deputy Allen knows that that safeguard is not worth twopence.  With all respect to Deputy Allen and the Minister, I do not think it is quite honest to try to convey to the House and to the people outside that a person who believes he has been unjustly treated has an appeal.  That is not playing the game.  There is no appeal whatsoever.</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Morrissey, not a day of the week passes in which decisions in respect of officers are not come to in the Department of Justice and in the Department of Defence&mdash;two large employing Departments.  In the case of the Gárda Síochána and the Army, the Minister decides the fate of some officer on the private report of another officer of the Department, probably, every week of the year.  Deputy Morrissey knows that.  That applies also in the case of civil servants.  A Minister may make a decision which will affect the future of a civil servant.  The civil servant may be dismissed as a result of that decision.  An officer in the Gárda or in the Army may be dismissed on a private report made to the Minister. <Col N="1987" /> Does Deputy Morrissey challenge that? Does he see any difference between the report in that case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does Deputy Morrissey suggest that, because an officer in the Civil Service, the Gárda or the Army is affected in his career by a Ministerial decision, the Minister should be pilloried before the country and in the public Press?  If a Minister for Local Government, whoever he may be, takes a decision affecting the future of an officer of a local authority, public opinion in the country will put the Minister where he should be if that decision be unjust?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen insists that nothing can be done in secret in the Department of Local Government.  The last issue of the report of the Royal Society of Antiquaries gives an account of the various heads of the river gods which adorn the present Custom House.  There are 14 of them&mdash;representing the Liffey, the Boyne, the Foyle, the Barrow, the Nore, the Suir, etc.  Reading the report while this Bill was under discussion I could not help feeling that the head of another river god should be <Col N="1988" /> added&mdash;the head of the god of the Poddle, because it goes so much underground. I do not think that what goes on in the Custom House will be sufficiently represented by the heads which adorn the Custom House until the head of the god of the Poddle is added.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen states that it has never been suggested that an injustice has been done to anybody as the result of a local government inquiry.  There have been persons affected by inquiries.  There have been persons driven out of employment as a result of inquiries whose case would have been raised here if it were not for the fact that Ministerial prestige is so identified in the Minister's eyes with public interest that the fact that the case was raised here would only result in that person suffering further injustice. Deputy Allen, particularly, ought to know what is possible and what has been happening.  I listened to the Minister last Friday when he spoke about his responsibility as Minister and his responsibility to the Oireachtas. He conveyed practically that, when he proceeds to exercise his functions as Minister, he acts as if he thought he was the Oireachtas.  All we are asking is that, if Ministers are servants of the Oireachtas, in order that we may have full confidence in them and in any action which they take, the Oireachtas should have all the information it requires in order to judge any particular matter.  The Minister takes up the line that if he is questioned or criticised in any way, if any reflection is cast upon the justice or the propriety of his actions by criticism here in the Oireachtas, the public interest is injured.</P>

      <P>I think that would be much more helpful than to sit silent, as the Minister has sat, during the whole of the afternoon in this debate. I want to repeat to Deputy Allen what Deputy Morrissey stated in regard to the rules of evidence.  The Minister's attitude makes it all the more necessary that we should insist that evidence be given in accordance with some kind of rules at these inquiries.  We are dealing with the provision in Section 83 of the Local Government Act of 1941 which details the arrangements enabling the Minister to hold public inquiries and we are dealing in this Bill with powers the Minister is now taking to wipe out completely any local body, with whose rating policy he disagrees, after a public inquiry.  If we are going to extend the Minister's power in relation to the holding of any local inquiry, to the extent to which it is now sought to extend it, I think it is nearly time that the law in regard to these local inquiries should be carried out and that the information which the Oireachtas should receive as the result of a local inquiry will be made available to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Coogan have stressed the necessity for this amendment.  The circumstances in which local government is being carried on at present are very different from those in which it was carried on in the past.  The fact is that the administration in the Department under the present Minister is such, one might say, as to terrorise the officials of particular local bodies and, to some extent, the officials of his Department into complete acquiescence with the dictatorial, Minister-over-all mind of the Minister disclosed here.  The legislation coming from the Department <Col N="1990" /> to-day not only shows that that mentality persists but that it is growing. The evidence we have of that makes it necessary that we, here in the Dáil, should take every possible step to ensure that we shall know everything that takes place at local inquiries carried out for the purpose of suppressing local government in the country.  Again I remind the Minister that his speech on Friday showed that he faces his duties as if he were the very embodiment of the Oireachtas. He told us that he will hold inquiries, that he will send down an inspector, that he will receive a report, and that he will not make public the terms of the inspector's report to him.  I think that is simply insisting on ignoring the Oireachtas and insisting on denying that the Minister is the servant of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, a Chinn Comhairle, I shall have to reply to some of the speeches made in the course of the debate this evening. What I said on Thursday and what I said on Friday has been subjected to such misrepresentation as I have seldom listened to in this House.  The Leader of the Fine Gael Opposition, who has just sat down, said that the terms of my speech on Friday implied that when I came to exercise my functions as Minister for Local Government, I felt that I should exercise them in the belief that I was the embodiment of the Oireachtas.  The Deputy must neither have listened to nor have read my speech.  That statement of his has no relation to anything I said.  It is a figment of his distorted imagination.  I have here the official report of Friday's speech&mdash;I was going to traverse some of the statements made by Deputy Coogan&mdash;so I have just read it.  In it I emphasised, not once but several times, that as Minister for Local Government I had, and felt imbued with, a sense of my responsibility to the country, to the Oireachtas and to the Government.  It is the primary duty of the Minister for Local Government, as the very title itself implies, to ensure on behalf of all the citizens that the standard of local administration in this country will be high.  That is the responsibility which <Col N="1991" /> the Minister holds to the people. Under the Constitution, the Minister is also responsible, not only to the House but to the Government as a whole, by virtue of the doctrine of collective responsibility, to discharge his duty to the citizens, that is to say, he has a responsibility to the Oireachtas and to the Government to ensure, let me repeat, that the standard of local government in this country is high. Not once but several times I enunciated this position in the course of my speech.  I will repeat the report, so that there should be no misunderstanding about it.  I challenge the Deputy who has just sat down to show me in that speech, it was a fairly long one, one single statement which is inconsistent with what I am about to say now and one statement which would support the charge which he has levelled against me.  I said, as reported in column 1854:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, whoever he may be for the time being, who is responsible to his colleagues in the Government in the first instance under the doctrine of collective responsibility which is enshrined in our Constitution, for...seeing that the local administration of this country is properly carried out and is above reproach.  It is the Minister who, subsequently, is also responsible to the Dáil on the same grounds and, of course, through the Dáil to the community as a whole, and, so far he is a citizen, to every individual within that community. That is his primary responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>By what feats of misrepresentation can the Deputy allege that that statement implies that, in exercising my functions, the functions in which the Oireachtas has confirmed me&mdash;by what stretch of the imagination can he allege&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that I, in discharging my functions as Minister for Local Government, regard myself as being not merely an executive of the Oireachtas but the Oireachtas itself? <Col N="1992" /> I do not want to weary the House but, as I have said, not once but several times was that statement repeated.  In the course of his speech to-day, Deputy Cogan alleged that my speech on Friday indicated that I regarded the officers of local authorities as my officers, as officers of the Minister and not as officers of those by whom they were directly employed and retained. My speech was a long one and I challenge Deputy Cogan to show me one reference to an officer of a local authority, one sentence which did in any way relate to an officer of a local authority&mdash;except, incidentally, when I said that a Minister, in considering the evidence and the reviews of the evidence given at local inquiries, had often to bear in mind that the decision which he was going to take might, if not jeopardise the whole future of a certain individual or individuals, certainly reflect very seriously upon them; and I said that, bearing that fact in mind, the Minister must be very slow and very reluctant to come to a decision which would gravely and seriously affect the future of an individual. That is a paraphrase of what I said, and that was the only reference I made to an officer of a local authority.  Yet Deputy Cogan got up here to-day and, relying on the shortness of human memory, deliberately misrepresented the whole tenor of Friday's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only did he misrepresent what I said here, but he made some reference to the proceedings of the Carlow County Council last week, which suggested to me that he misrepresented even the proceedings of that body.  He alleged that the procedure now under discussion, investigation by sworn inquiry, had fallen into such disrepute with local authorities that, at the meeting of the Carlow County Council on last Tuesday, when a question arose that seemed to warrant a local inquiry, statements were made by members of the local authority that they had no faith or confidence in an investigation of this sort.  Now, this matter has been raised by Deputy Cogan in the course of his speech this afternoon.  Here are the facts, as I have been able to ascertain them since.  A question or questions <Col N="1993" /> arose as to the conditions in the Carlow Fever Hospital.  Deputy Hughes, who is a member of the Carlow County Council proposed, and Deputy Cogan, who is a member also, seconded a resolution calling for a sworn inquiry into the conduct of the staff.  Well, I am glad to see that at least two members of that particular local authority, who are also Deputies of this House, have not lost confidence in this procedure of a sworn inquiry, as they both recommended to their colleagues that they should ask for one.  Then a discussion ensued, during which the manager made statements, not reflecting on the staff but exonerating the staff.  He stated that the conditions in the fever hospital were such that it was impossible for the members of the staff to be responsible for what had occurred there and that he was removing the patients temporarily to Naas while certain improvements in the fever hospital were being carried out.  As a result of the manager's statements, Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan withdrew their motion, being finally satisfied, I understand, that the members of the fever hospital staff were not responsible for what had occurred.</P>
    <P>Now, in the whole course of this discussion, as reported in the Press, the method of conducting these inquiries was not referred to at all&mdash; was not referred to by any member of the county council, in so far as the report in the <i>Carlow Nationalist</i> is a fair and accurate report of what took place at the meeting.  The inquiry, I understand, was not requested solely on the assurance of the manager, that (1) a new hospital must be built, (2) that temporary facilities were being provided for the fever patients, and (3) that the staff had behaved satisfactorily.  But would any person listening to Deputy Cogan's reference to these proceedings on last Tuesday at the Carlow County Council certainly have gathered that Deputy Cogan himself had seconded a demand for a local inquiry, and would he have understood that the staff had been exonerated?  On the contrary, if my recollection of Deputy Cogan's exact <Col N="1994" /> words is correct, they would rather have apprehended that the county manager, in his report, had reflected very gravely and seriously upon the staff of the fever hospital and that this had seriously disturbed the minds of the members of the county council, so disturbed them, in fact, that the question of asking for a sworn inquiry had arisen and that the sole reason why a sworn inquiry had not been asked for was, that the members of the county council had no faith in that method of investigation.  That is not what the report in the <i>Carlow Nationalist</i> tells us, even though that was what Deputy Cogan wanted the House to gather from his speech, that was the impression he wished to convey, just as, relying on the weakness of our recollection, he endeavoured to misrepresent the whole purport of the speech I made here on Friday on this motion.</P>
    <P>This amendment of Deputy Coogan's makes two proposals.  It proposes, first of all, that the proceedings at a local inquiry shall be governed by the rules of evidence, and it makes then a second proposal, that the findings of the inspector upon the evidence tendered before him shall be made public within three months from the date upon which the inquiry terminates.  I felt that, so far as informed opinion was concerned, that in so far as a great number of Deputies of this House are members of local authorities, the first proposition, that the proceedings at a local inquiry shall be governed by the rules of evidence, would be so plainly and clearly impracticable that it did not require any argument of mine to induce the House to reject it.  Accordingly, on Friday, I addressed myself solely to the issue as to whether what is quite erroneously and inaccurately described in the amendment as the findings of an inspector should be published.  I am certainly convinced, as are, I believe, those members of the House who are open to conviction, that it would be contrary to the public interest to publish any review of the evidence submitted to the Minister, whether by the officer who conducted the inquiry or by any other officers whose duty it would be to review that evidence on behalf of the Minister.</P>

      <Col N="1995" /> It would be, as I have said, quite contrary to the public interest to permit these confidential documents, which are provided for the assistance of the Minister, to become public property, to be bandied about in the sort of debate we have heard here, in which not only the views and judgments of the Minister, on the one hand, and his officer who presided over the inquiry, on the other, would become the objects of public debate, but, in addition, the views of other officers whose duty it would be to consider that evidence and to present their views upon it to the Minister&mdash;for they also would become the object of public debate.  We should not only have chaos in the administration but we should have distrust and we should have confusion created in the public mind if a proposal of this sort were to be adopted.  And the proof that what I am saying is of great force indeed is to be found in the fact that the recommendations of the Donoughmore Report, about which we have heard so much in the course of this debate, have not been accepted and applied in Great Britain.  I do not want to say any more than that.</P>

      <P>Becoming more British than the British themselves! To-day Deputy Allen, in a very forceful speech, pointed out what were the implications and consequences of the other proposal in this amendment, the proposal that the proceedings at a local inquiry should be conducted in accordance with the laws of evidence.  Only lawyers, skilled lawyers, are familiar with the rules of evidence and are competent to apply them, and they would <Col N="1996" /> have to be applied rigorously and strictly in accordance with the law if this proposal were accepted, under the penalty that if they were not so applied, then the proceedings of every investigation would be rendered null and void.</P>
      <P>It is not, I think, without significance that this amendment has been put down by a lawyer and has been supported by some lawyers, and that the Deputy who put it down was thinking purely in terms of legal proceedings, of the trial of an issue, rather than of what a local inquiry is.  A local inquiry is an investigation primarily not to determine points of law but to determine matters of suitability&mdash;the suitability of an officer, in some cases, to hold his post, the suitability, in other cases, say, of land as a building site or the suitability of a certain area to continue to be a residential area. There are many more local inquiries held into housing questions, construction of bridges, failure to keep records, shortages of stock, refusals to admit people to hospital than there are local inquiries into the conduct of a public authority.  How would one apply the rules of evidence to ascertain whether a slum area should be cleared or not?</P>

Who is best qualified to advise on questions of that sort?  Surely it is not a lawyer?  Surely it is an engineer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, the most difficult questions that arise at an inquiry of this sort&mdash;quite the most common in this country, I might say&mdash; are questions as to what is to be the amount of compensation for people deprived of the property rights which <Col N="1997" /> they have in, say, a slum area and as to what is the best way of providing alternative accommodation for them. These are not questions which a lawyer is better skilled to settle than a layman.  How could one possibly determine these matters according to the rules of evidence?  Yet we should be compelled to have these inquiries conducted, as Deputy Allen has pointed out, by a person versed in the rules of evidence and skilled in applying them, when the sole question is whether, in a street like Waterford Street or Marlborough Street, where so many people are living in single rooms, there is proper sanitation in these ghastly tenements, and where there are licensed premises in the area, the amount of compensation which will have to be provided and what alternative accommodation is to be given to these people.  These are the sort of questions that arise most frequently.</P>
      <P>Similarly, inquiries will be held when a local authority proposes to undertake a work of public importance such as a waterworks scheme, a sewerage scheme and even, in some cases, a hospital scheme.  These are the matters that will be discussed and investigated by a local inquiry.  It is not a case of presenting a charge that the local authority has not got a proper water supply and of putting the local authority in the dock because it has not got a proper water supply.  The inquiry arises in general from the fact that the local authority wants to have a water supply and that the Minister will ultimately have to sanction a loan in regard to it.  The question to be determined there is whether the proposals for providing a water supply are sound and adequate, and we are to have that question decided, if you please, according to the mover of the amendment, by a judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He has around him a number of advisers who are well <Col N="1998" /> qualified.  Very often&mdash;and this is the point&mdash;these advisers may differ, and then the Minister who is responsible to Parliament has to take the decision for himself.  Sometimes he will refuse to sanction the water supply and, if so, the matter is raised here and the Minister has to justify his action.  The proposal here, however, is that, for a Minister responsible to Parliament, we should substitute a lawyer who is responsible to no one.  That is the proposal here in relation to the question of a water supply.  I know how absurd such a proposal seems to Deputy Morrissey now.  Similarly&mdash;it may be a very simple question, but, in certain circumstances, a very grave one; I referred to it in connection with an amendment put down by Deputy Keyes and supported by the Labour Party&mdash;as to whether a patient was denied admission to a hospital when accommodation could have been provided. That is not a question which requires a lawyer to settle because it is a question which can be properly settled by the records, if the records are properly kept.</P>

      <P>If the records are properly kept, the question can be easily settled and responsibility can be put definitely on the person who refused admission in circumstances in which admission was necessary.  Who is going to advise the Minister in relation to that matter&mdash;whether, first of all, admission to the hospital was essential in order to preserve the life of the patient?  Is it to be a lawyer? Is that question to be settled according to the rules of evidence by a man in a wig and gown?  I think most of us would prefer to be guided in a matter of that sort by a medical opinion rather than by a legal opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Having, I assume, secured the assent of Deputy Morrissey to the proposition that a medical man would be a better adviser as to the condition of a patient and the treatment which that patient would require, than a lawyer, the next question <Col N="1999" /> which arises is why the patient was not admitted.  In general, perhaps, the explanation would be that a bed was not available.  If a bed was not available, then the records of the institution should show that beyond yea or nay, at any rate.  Do we have to have a lawyer in wig and gown to examine the written records of the institution?  Must these books be solemnly paraded according to the rules of evidence, in the sense to which they are applied to documents?  Is it not the commonsense thing to let your inspector go, as inspectors do, to investigate the books, and, if any question arises as to the accuracy of the books, examine those who were responsible for keeping them?  If the records are properly kept, then the responsibility for refusing admission to the institution can clearly be brought home to the person on duty at that time, which will also be recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the difference between an inquiry and a judicial proceeding.  A judicial proceeding proceeds on a definite pleading and on definite charges.  If the records have been properly kept the responsibility for refusing admission can be definitely brought home.  On the other hand, if the records were not properly kept, then the person responsible under the terms of his appointment for keeping the records has himself or herself been guilty of dereliction of duty, and can be dealt with.  The purpose of the investigation often starts in a narrow field, but is not confined to the point at which it starts.  If the exposure of one abuse indicates the need for inquiry, the inspector sent down is not confined to the narrow issue from which that inquiry starts.  Once his investigation starts, he is bound to pursue it, and to examine every other weakness which the initial proceedings might disclose in the administration of the institution.  Is it necessary, in order that we should be satisfied that the records of an institution have not been properly kept, that we must have a lawyer in wig and gown to examine the records?  The records to be kept by these institutions are prescribed by the Minister, and surely the Minister is capable of determining, without any <Col N="2000" /> legal assistance whatever, whether his requirements are being complied with.</P>
    <P>Yet, if this amendment were to be adopted by the House, the Minister could not decide that.  He would have to get a legally qualified person to hold the inquiry, and would be solemnly bound by his decision.  Are we not carrying that to the limits of absurdity? There are dozens and dozens of similar cases that I could quote to the House.  As Deputy Allen has shown, the House would stultify itself by agreeing to this and would certainly make supervision of local administration, which is already very cumbersome, very much slower.  I hear very many more complaints about the inactivity of the Department of Local Government in relation to matters of local administration than about our undue interference.  The reason for that is that we are hedged around, if you like, by regulations, and by statutes, which limit very definitely our powers of supervision and investigation. So that, as I have said, we are more often blamed for being slow and dilatory than for any excessive zeal.  If the House were to adopt a proposal of this sort, then I think you could wipe out the Department of Local Government, and the Minister for Local Government, as an effective instrument for ensuring that the standard of administration in the local services would be a high and an effective one.</P>

Does the Minister know what passed through my mind on Tuesday last at the meeting of the county council?  Does he claim to know what influenced me in deciding to withdraw that proposition, and to propose an alternative which was unanimously accepted by the county council? I withdrew the proposition calling for a sworn inquiry because I felt, having regard to the manner in which public inquiries are constituted, and having regard to the manner in which their findings are ultimately treated, that it would be unwise to submit the very important matter which arose at Carlow County Council to a sworn inquiry such as that.</P>

The matter before Carlow County Council was a grave and a serious one, as the Minister pointed out.  It was one which did not arise at the last meeting of the council.  It arose at a previous meeting, where statements were made, and action was taken by the manager, which seriously reflected upon the officials of the local authority.  The manager went to the greatest possible extremes, at the last county council meeting, to explain away his previous statements and his previous action and <Col N="2002" /> to exonerate the staff.  The county council, while believing that if there was a proper judicial inquiry it would clear the whole matter and clear the officials of the staff and restore confidence to the people of Carlow in their institutions, could not press for a sworn inquiry as long as we have the dice loaded as it is loaded.</P>

      <P>And I am not going to traverse the entire debate which took place at that meeting and of which the Minister has the Press report.  If the Minister wants to know what happens at the Carlow County Council, perhaps he will send down his verbatim reporter, as he does to sworn inquiries, and perhaps he will send down an inspector who will give a report which will be treated as absolutely confidential. The Minister has failed to justify his opposition to this amendment.  He has failed, even though he relies upon the authority of the House of Lords, to sustain it because here we are dealing, not with officials of the Minister's Department, but with the elected representatives of the people and officials of those elected representatives.  While the Minister may claim, and proclaim, as he did in the House, that he is responsible to the people and that he cannot be impeded in his exercise of that responsibility&mdash;he spent a long time on Thursday evening defining his responsibility and enlarging upon the dangers that would ensue if he were in any way hampered in carrying out his responsibilities&mdash;he must acknowledge that local authorities also have their responsibilities. It is neither fair nor just that any issue that arises between a local authority, elected by the people, and a Minister, elected by the people, <Col N="2003" /> should be decided by a jury which consists of the Minister, who is not present at the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister's mind is closed on this matter or not but his speech was clearly directed to an amendment stipulating that the law of evidence should apply in these inquiries.  That is not what the amendment says.  The amendment speaks of the rules of evidence. If the Minister were to consider the amendment, deleting the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; and saying that inquiries should be held &ldquo;subject to rules of evidence&rdquo; I think he would come a long way to meet the purpose for which the amendment was put down. May I make the case, founded on one of the examples the Minister himself has adduced: If a complaint is made that a dying patient has been refused admission to a surgical hospital, the real truth is that that is an allegation on the part of the relatives of the dying person that either the medical officer or the matron of the hospital is either grossly incompetent or shamefully inhuman and in fact either of those parties comes before the inquiry to defend themselves against that peculiarly injurious allegation.  Would it be unreasonable to stipulate that in inquiries held under the auspices of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, where matters of that character were drawn down, at least there should be a rule that the inspector would refuse to hear hearsay evidence?  A lot of laymen in this country, when they hear an expression like &ldquo;hearsay evidence&rdquo;, back away on the ground that it is a technical term but, when you come to examine the grounds upon which hearsay evidence is excluded under the law of evidence, the reason is perfectly simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you bring a man before a sworn inquiry, he is put upon his oath and he tells on oath what he knows of his own knowledge.  But if he then comes forward and says: &ldquo;and furthermore, the hall porter in the hospital told me that he saw this dying man brought to the hospital, and that he heard the matron tell his relatives to take him to Hell away out of that&rdquo;, you are immediately <Col N="2004" /> confronted with this problem, that it may be perfectly true; the hall porter may have told him that; the sworn witness is telling the truth; he did hear that story from the hall porter; but the difference is that when the hall porter told him that story, the hall porter was not on oath, and that had the hall porter been given the Bible and told to call upon God to witness that that which he was about to say was true, he might never have told that story.  But, when the sworn witness in the box recites, first, his own suspicion that something was wrong and that the rejected patient should have been admitted, and adds, &ldquo;and the hall porter told me that he heard the matron tell that dying man's relatives to take him away to Hell out of that&rdquo;, say what you like, from that moment the whole position is very seriously prejudiced because the impugned matron is now no longer presumed to be innocent, because at least there is some <i>prima facie</i> evidence before the inspector that she is guilty, and she is now on her defence.  She is now obliged, in that position, to disprove something, but she has not been put in that position by a man who staked his oath that she was in the wrong; she has been put in that position by a man whose observations are being reported by a person who is on oath, but the man who made the statement was not on oath when he made it, and need not have attached to his words any more gravity than the average gossip or backbiter who sins against charity.</P>
    <P>There is a very wide difference between sinning against charity and committing the sin of perjury, not only in the eyes of God but in the eyes of the civil law.  A person who tells lies about his neighbour may or may not be susceptible to an action for slander but a person who on oath categorically states what he knows is not true is amenable to the civil law and may get jail.  If an inspector may hear hearsay evidence, every public official whose conduct is called in question at a sworn inquiry is the victim of any liar or gossip who has made reckless allegations against him, if he can get those allegations repeated by somebody who is on oath before the <Col N="2005" /> inspector.  Without unduly circumscribing the inspector&mdash;and I agree with the Minister that an inspector ought to have the widest discretion to range over the widest field for the purpose of ascertaining truly the cause of whatever is wrong&mdash;surely the Minister would not think it unreasonable to make a rule of evidence for his own inspectors&mdash;&ldquo;You are not to receive hearsay evidence.  If somebody wants to adduce in evidence what the hall porter said, then insist that the hall porter be produced before you and put him on oath.  But, in the course of your inquiry, do not let anybody allege anything on oath which he has in fact had second-hand.  Get from each witness that which he knows of his own knowledge and, if some complainant alleges there is yet another witness who has further and better evidence to offer, insist that that person be produced.  But permit no one to state on oath what he heard another man say when the other man was not on oath.&rdquo;  Is it unreasonable to suggest that rules of evidence of that character should be laid down for the guidance of departmental inspectors when hearing the very kind of case that the Minister himself has envisaged?</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that the function of an inquiry is to find out the facts.  I quite agree that, whoever may suffer, if there has been a misfeasance or a nonfeasance where there was a duty to act, without regard to persons or any personal consideration the inspector should range far afield to bring responsibility home.  But there are lots of people in this country, notably, I think, matrons in hospitals and overworked county medical officers who may not keep records well and who may not keep them well because they opt, consciously and deliberately, between keeping records or looking after the patients.  They look after the patients and sometimes let the records look after themselves.  Who will blame them for that?  We are all familiar with the situation that arises at a county council or a board of health if a matron asks for clerical aid to complete forms and keep records. Many county councillors take up the position: &ldquo;Let her do it herself; we <Col N="2006" /> are not going to pay a clerk to do her work,&rdquo; and she finds herself in the position of looking after the patients or the records.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make without further detail is that the case the Minister adduces could be reduced to this, that while the inquiry may be primarily designed to ascertain facts, from the point of view of those of us who live in Roscommon or Monaghan the real vital thing that is at stake is the reputation of an honourable man who has been doing his job to the best of his ability and who stands charged with a grave dereliction of duty.  If the inspector's report is adverse, that man is humiliated before all his neighbours, and that is a very heavy penalty.  Is it unreasonable, in the knowledge that that is true, to ask that a person whose reputation is at stake should be given the protection of some rules of evidence?</P>
      <P>If the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; is taken out of this amendment, will the Minister go so far as to say that he is prepared to accept an amendment which will provide that inquiries conducted by his inspectors will be subject to rules of evidence?  Let him prescribe the rules of evidence, not on the assumption that the person conducting the inquiry will be a trained lawyer, not on the assumption that the rules of evidence will be of such an elaborate character that no one but a trained lawyer could, in fact, carry them out, but for the purpose of providing guidance to ordinary professional men, such as his inspectors are, and giving confidence to those whose reputations are at stake before these inquiries that at least they will be entitled to elementary justice and that only those who are prepared to stake their oaths will be heard in evidence and that casual gossip will not be read into the record for the purpose of influencing the mind of the inspector who is discharging the unaccustomed duty of seeking judicially to determine what truth is in accordance with the evidence brought before him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate, to my mind, seems to have taken an unreal turn.  We have before us an amendment proposing that the proceedings of a local government inquiry should be governed by the rules of evidence and, then, that the report of the inspector should be made public within three months.  Really, these two matters have nothing to do with each other.  They are both essentially different, although they appear in the one amendment.  I said that, in my opinion, this debate has taken an unreal turn and I will say why I think so.  We seem to have got into a discussion on the legal advisability of publishing or not publishing rules of evidence.  But I should like to remind the House that essentially this amendment has arisen because many Deputies, and all the Deputies of the Opposition, have a great degree of uneasiness concerning local government inquiries.  That uneasiness exists also to a considerable extent amongst the general public.  There have been many local government inquiries and, so far as I know, all of them have been carried out in a fair fashion.  But Deputies and the general public are uneasy because they feel that in certain inquiries the Minister has not followed the evidence which was submitted, while within the last week in this House he admitted that the evidence was the basis for his decision.  That is the reason why we cannot trust the final decisions of the Minister.</P>
      <P>In an effort to keep the Minister on the strait and narrow path, we press for the publication of the inspector's report.  Why?  Because the inspector is a public servant, a disinterested man, not a man likely to be swayed in the smallest degree by matters political. I do not like to say these things in this House.  I can honestly say that it does not give me any pleasure to say that, in my opinion, the Minister has acted wrongly.  I consider that, in the case of the Cork Street inquiry, the decision of the Minister was an injustice.</P>

      <P>In all deference to Deputy Dockrell, may I say that the Minister, when speaking in regard to this matter, kept, as far as I know, to the general principle?  He did not actually discuss the nature of the findings of the Cork Street Hospital inquiry.  If I remember rightly, he challenged the members of the Opposition to ask for an inquiry, and did so in order that this debate could be carried on without reference to that particular issue.  The Minister's challenge to the Opposition was accepted by Deputy Morrissey, but now Deputy Dockrell is going into details on the matter.  I simply want to make sure that the position is understood, and that the Minister never at any time referred specifically to the inquiry.</P>

      <P>May I say, in reply to the Parliamentary Secretary, that when the Minister made that <Col N="2009" /> statement or interjection he referred specifically to Cork Street?  The point that I want to make is that essentially this amendment arises out of the uneasiness that exists in the public mind on that particular matter.  That uneasiness is fully echoed by members of the House.  We want to get some measure of protection that, if people consider that an injustice has been done by a decision of the Minister, there should be some machinery by which people will be able to have the injustice righted.  The Minister has talked about the inadvisability, from the legal point of view, of publishing the inspectors' reports.  Some members on this side of the House have quoted other legal men whose opinion is that it is advisable, in certain circumstances, to publish inspectors' reports. I do not think any of us have tried to make the point that it is always advisable to publish the Minister's report, but what protection is there for people on whom an injustice has been done by the Minister?  The Minister has not answered that.  I <Col N="2010" /> would point out to the House that, in the case of Cork Street, the Minister went so far as to publish a White Paper, and that many of the matters categorically set out in it were denied by documents.</P>

      <P>Well, they are the foundation of this amendment.  I bow to the ruling of the Chair, and will not refer to Cork Street again except to say that I consider an injustice has been done there.  I think that in an effort to protect the public from the possibility, nay, I would say the probability of injustice, the Minister should accept the amendment.  If he is not prepared to accept it in its present wording, then I think he should accept the principle of it and bring in an amendment himself on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 127a, standing on the Order Paper in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 66 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>66.  Section 78 of the Act of 1941 shall apply and have effect as if after sub-section (2) thereof the following sub-section were inserted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a pensionable officer was immediately before the commencement of his service as a pensionable officer, in temporary Civil Service employment which would if it were permanent be pensionable employment, the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, direct that a specified part (not excluding one half) of the period of such temporary employment shall be reckoned as service in a pensionable office and such part shall be so reckoned accordingly.</P>
      <P>Section 78 of the Act of 1941 provides that in the case of a pensionable officer who had been in the temporary employment of a local body, half of the service of such local official shall be taken into consideration when his pension is being assessed.  This amendment asks for similar terms for a person who had been in employment in the Civil Service in a temporary capacity and who immediately went into the local government service.  I was prompted to submit this amendment because there are cases of young engineers who took temporary employment in the Board of Works, and some of these men have left the Board of Works to take up permanent employment under local authorities.  If they had stayed in the Board of Works in a temporary capacity, half the temporary period would have been taken into consideration when their pension was being assessed.  I think that the Minister should consider the position of those temporary civil servants who have gone into permanent employment with local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept this amendment for a number of reasons, the least of which is, perhaps, that, some time in the course of this year or early next year, I hope to introduce a Bill dealing with the superannuation of local officers.  A provision of the type suggested in the amendment would be more relevant to a Bill of that description than to the measure now before the House.  Even if it were proposed to insert such a provision in the Superannuation Bill, I should have very great difficulty in accepting the proposal.  This amendment proposes to confer upon an individual who had temporary employment in the Civil Service certain pensionable rights which not all temporary civil servants who become established enjoy. <Col N="2013" /> It makes no provision for the payment of the superannuation which would result.  Occasionally, in special circumstances, temporary civil servants who become established are allowed to count half their temporary service for pension purposes.  That is not the invariable rule, but, if this amendment were to be accepted, it would become the invariable rule in the case of those persons who, being temporarily employed in the Civil Service, leave the service and enter the employment of a local authority.</P>
      <P>Even if that could be accepted as reasonable, the question would arise as to who would be responsible for the payment of pension in respect of the period of employment in the Civil Service.  I am perfectly certain that the local authorities would jib at being made responsible for the payment of pension in respect of the period spent in the service of the State.  The ratepayers of Wexford or Carlow would quite properly say: &ldquo;If this man, who was a temporary civil servant, is to get a pension in respect of the period during which he served as temporary civil servant, then we ought not to be called upon to bear the cost of that pension.&rdquo;  I think that this amendment would be out of order if it were framed to provide for a pension at the expense of the State for any temporary civil servant, because that would impose a charge on the taxpayer. It is rather adroitly framed.  I am not raising the question of order, but I am pointing out that, as the local authority would object to paying a pension in respect of Civil Service employment, if effect were to be given to the amendment, the Exchequer would be called upon to pay that portion of the pension.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for superannuation in the Civil Service, would strongly object to the Minister for Local Government imposing by a side-wind such a burden on the State, so that, irrespective of any other objections I might have to the amendment as it stands, I should have to resist it on that ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to impose any charge on County Wexford <Col N="2014" /> which should not be imposed upon it. Would the Minister inform me as to what happens when a medical officer who has been in pensionable service, say, in County Carlow and County Cork, finally winds up his service in County Wexford?  Is his pension charged on County Wexford or is it apportioned between County Wexford and the other counties in which he served?  If the Minister would answer that point to my satisfaction, I should be willing to withdraw the amendment. However, I do not think that he need have any fears regarding the amendment.  It is worded according to Section 28 of the Act of 1941 and it states that the Minister may &ldquo;if he so thinks fit....&rdquo;.  It does not bind the Minister to do anything.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Whenever an allowance or gratuity is payable by a local body to any person...under this Act in respect of his ceasing to hold office under them and in ascertaining the service of such officer at the date of such cesser any service under another local body has been aggregated... the contributing body shall refund to the paying body a part of such allowance or gratuity reckoned according to the service and pay of such officer under the contributing body....&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1946, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is concerned entirely with the National Stud and is necessary because we did not succeed in transferring the Stud from the Department to the new board as soon as we expected.  There were a lot of legal delays, which are now coming to an end, but we have to ask the Dáil to vote this amount of money for carrying on the ordinary operations of the farm there, that is, the purchase of stock, payment of wages, and so on. The appropriations against that are coming from the sale of stock and income from the National Stud itself. Now that we have the legal position almost put right, it is hoped we may be able to make the transfer in or about the 1st April, so that the board would be put in control from that date.</P>
      <P>It was explained before that the new board will get a licence&mdash;which is the technical term, meaning something similar to a lease&mdash;to carry on.  During the time we had the Stud, there was a lot of necessary repairing done to buildings, including the setting up of paddocks and fields, and so on, as well as a lot of cleaning up on fences.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is all to the good that we had it for this couple of years so that we can hand it over to the new board in a fairly fit condition.  I cannot say definitely the date from which they will take over and carry on, but I hope it will be about the 1st April.</P>

This is another such company, but when we look for information regarding costings or anything else we cannot get it, either here in the House or otherwise.

At present, the prices of those things are being fixed for a number of years, but we are not getting an opportunity here to find out the basis on which they are being fixed.  The Minister has a number of these farms at his disposal, run by the State.

      <P>My trouble is this.  From time to time a number of those estimates are brought forward here, whether they are for university farms, the Athenry agricultural station or other places of one kind or another. When we afterwards look for information in this House in connection with the cost of production on any one of these farms, we are told that such questions cannot be allowed.  The whole future of agriculture in this country is hanging on the question of price, and naturally farmers are anxious to know whether these figures about which we ask questions will cover the cost of production.</P>

If I vote for £10 of the people's money for this thing, I want to know whether we will have laid on the Table of the House every year the cost of each of these horses and other similar information.</P>
      <P>Am I not entitled to have that done? I am giving instances where, in connection with previous sums voted by the House, we asked for certain information, and surely I can draw an analogy in the present instance?  Certain information was necessary in connection with Estimates that were passed here relating to farms.  We were refused information as to the cost of production of certain articles of farm produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, as agriculturists, are entitled to know how figures are arrived at which will govern the price of our produce in the future.  That was my main object in rising to speak on this Estimate, and I would like to hear something from the Minister on the subject.  I want to know whether production costs will be shown here or will be issued in the form of a White Paper.  As regards farms run by the State, I think Deputies and the public generally are entitled to be shown the costs of production. It is a matter of education for them.  We are entitled to the costs of production of different articles, the manner in which animals are fed, and so on.  When State money is being spent on agricultural education, the community are surely entitled to get <Col N="2026" /> certain figures and statements.  We are not getting them and that is my complaint.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into the matter raised by Deputy Corry, but in the White Paper before us, under the heading of salaries, wages and allowances, for the National Stud, there is a figure of £1,710.  I do not know what period is covered by that figure.  I should like a little information also as to how the figure of £10,000 for general expenses was arrived at and what period is covered there.  It is a fairly big figure.  What is meant by the term &ldquo;general expenses&rdquo;?</P>

I do not know if the Deputy is aware that every penny spent must go down in the Estimate, and every penny we get in goes into Appropriations-in-Aid. It is not a case of bringing the net result before the Dáil.  The £10,000 covers the purchase of stock, paying wages and doing everything that a farmer has to spend money on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil meets on certain days at a certain hour, and, as a rule, Deputies travel by train, or used to do so when travelling conditions were somewhat different from what they are to-day, and what they have been for the last 12 months or two years.  For some time, it was possible for Deputies to use their cars, and these cars were used for long distances, with the result that travelling expenses were somewhat greater than they should normally be.  The number of sittings were also greater than in the previous year.  These are the main contributing factors to the increase.  I thought that, on account of this being a matter which concerned ourselves, we would not be too critical of these matters.</P>

As a matter of fact, I think the Department of Finance at one stage had a regulation that a Deputy's claim for motor allowance could not exceed the price of his rail ticket.  I want to know if that regulation still operates, because, if it does, I cannot see how the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation covers the increase.</P>

When, if ever, will the Department of Finance do away with the present voucher system and see to it that Deputies will get an ordinary railway pass, the same as anybody else?  I do not want to press the Parliamentary Secretary on it now, but if this matter has not been taken up recently with C.I.E., will he have a note made and see whether it could <Col N="2030" /> be taken up now?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1946, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Gárda Síochána (No. 7 of 1925, No. 10 of 1926, No. 5 of 1937, No. 19 of 1941 and Nos. 1 and 17 of 1945); and for certain expenses of the Local Security Force, including Grants-in-Aid (No. 28 of 1939).</P>
      <P>The amount originally voted for the service of the Gárda Síochána this year has not proved sufficient.  No more money is actually required.  A Supplementary Estimate is, however, necessary for two more or less technical reasons.  Since the main Estimate was passed by the Dáil, an Act &mdash;the Gárda Síochána Act, 1945&mdash;was passed on 15th May, 1945, amending the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, by increasing the maximum number of inspectors and station sergeants with a view to the appointment of 18 additional inspectors and 14 additional station sergeants.  The appointments have been made, and consequently some of the money voted by the Dáil has been spent on the remuneration of posts not included in the original Estimate. Although the Dáil has already approved of the additional appointments, I am advised that in the circumstances it is the proper course to submit a Supplementary Estimate.  In the second place, it is necessary, in order to balance accounts, to take advantage of the fact that the receipts under the head of Appropriations-in-Aid have exceeded the original Estimate, and it is a rule that the Dáil should be asked to agree to that procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that of the new inspectors three were assigned to the new Dublin district which has its headquarters in Sundrive Road, Kimmage. <Col N="2031" /> This district was formed by the division of E district which formerly extended from Ringsend to Inchicore. The B and C districts have been strengthened by the appointment of an additional inspector to each.  Thirteen of the new inspectors have been allocated to country divisions, one to the Depot to look after recruits who are now coming in regularly and one to the Technical Bureau at Gárda - Headquarters.</P>
    <P>Although, as I have said, the original amount voted was adequate, some of the sub-heads show a deficit and others a saving.  The biggest savings are under sub-heads O and P which relate to the Local Security Force and they amount to £10,000 and £13,000 respectively. They result from the winding up of the force on the 30th September and the fact that its members were not actively employed in the year 1945, except in the local and presidential elections.  In the ordinary way, the saving on some sub-heads and the deficits on others would have been adjusted by transferring the necessary amounts from sub-head to sub-head without recourse to the Dáil; but as it has been necessary to come to the Dáil in any case, the opportunity has been taken, in accordance with the practice in such cases, to set out in the Supplementary Estimate the main variations as between sub-heads.</P>
    <P>I might perhaps amplify the note on sub-head G&mdash;Barrack Maintenance&mdash;by explaining that the public rooms in all Gárda barracks outside the Dublin Metropolitan area were, until this financial year, cleaned at the expense of the station party.  The representative bodies have frequently urged that this work should be done at the public expense and this view has now been accepted.  The expenses of this new service are estimated to amount to £9,600 in a full year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an item in respect of barrack maintenance, and I notice that the State will now bear some responsibility for it.  I should like to ask the Minister what is his policy in respect to Gárda stations throughout the country.  The Minister knows from his experience of his own constituency and elsewhere that many of these buildings qualify in every sense for the description of barracks. They are in many cases very old and very unsatisfactory buildings&mdash;bleak and badly furnished and very often badly painted and badly ventilated. Generally speaking, they are dreary dungeons in which unfortunate Guards have to spend a considerable portion of their lives.  I do not want to press the Minister for details of his future programme in that respect, but I think he ought to tell us at what date the Department intends to provide up-to-date Gárda stations.  Where new Gárda stations have been erected they are very fine buildings.  If we must have Gárdaí and Gárda stations, then we should have decent buildings. Many of these places are ramshackle structures and are no credit to a force like the Gárda.  They are particularly objectionable when the Gárda have to spend a considerable portion of their time in them.  Could the Minister tell the House what the intention generally is regarding the provision of proper accommodation for the Gárda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot go into details now.  That is general policy.  The intention is to have suitable barracks. We also hope to provide accommodation for members of the Gárda, but that is a very big proposition.  The rent allowances which they get would, probably, pay for the accommodation. Since I became Minister I have been getting details of a scheme for barracks and, at long last, we have got it through, but the matter hardly arises on this Estimate.  The intention is, wherever we can, to erect barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £142,785 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1946, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 &amp; 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928; No. 14 of 1940 (Secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (Sec. 23); etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs already approved by the Dáil for the financial year ending 31st March, 1946, amounted to £3,225,125.  Due to causes which could not have been anticipated, this provision will be insufficient, and an additional sum of £142,785 will be required to cover essential expenditure up to the end of the financial year.  The actual excess over the approved Estimate amounts to £165,815, but there is an offsetting saving of £23,030, representing increased Appropriations-in-Aid, leaving the net excess at £142,785.</P>
      <P>Increased emergency bonus, payable as from 1st January, 1946, accounts for £26,855 of the additional sum of £69,075 required under sub-heads A (2) and (3), I (1) and O (1).  The causes of other appreciable increases are, broadly, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-heads A (2) and (3).  Increase of £29,000, apart from that caused by grant of additional bonus.  This is due to increased staff and extra duty provision <Col N="2035" /> necessitated by general expansion of business, by unanticipated election expenses, by extra Christmas postal deliveries, and by the grant of sick pay privileges to temporary force.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D. Increase, £10,100.  Due mainly to purchase of new premises at Capel Street, Dublin, to serve as a stores warehouse.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (1).  Increase, £6,640. This represents additional payments to railway companies in respect of increased letter and parcel mails.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I (1).  Increase, £6,350. Due to increased provision for storm repair work.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K.  Increase £44,000.  Due to the purchase of urgently required engineering stores, previously in short supply, which became available at the end of hostilities, as well as to delivery earlier than expected of stores already on order.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (1).  Increase £36,000. Due to abnormal increase in the number of retirements, including female officers on marriage.</P>
    <P>Sub-head O (1).  Increase £6,870. The increased provision is due to growth of Savings Bank business, including work in connection with the payment of Army gratuities.</P>
    <P>The increase in the receipts under sub-head T &mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash; £23,030, is attributable mainly to additional receipts of £12,000 in respect of agency services performed on behalf of other administrations; £7,910 from Savings Bank Funds; and £2,500 in respect of work performed for railway companies and others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if the increased supplies will enable an extension to be made of telephone services to those who require them, or will it be used merely for the purpose of repairs?  While I appreciate the difficulties under which the Department have laboured for the duration of the emergency, it does seem rather unfortunate that at present, in a place like Booterstown, County Dublin, the telephone facilities cannot be extended to prospective users in the area.  If telephone equipment, such as receivers, <Col N="2036" /> and so on, is not available, of course that is the reason why the service cannot be extended.  While the public did not expect during the emergency that large - scale extensions could be undertaken, say, in rural areas, I think the public expect now that better facilities will be provided, at least, if the supplies which the Minister has outlined become available and that in extending the service preference will be given to those who require the telephone for business purposes or in the course of their professional duties.  I have had a few complaints, not very many, but some of the people concerned required the telephone for business or professional purposes.  I would ask the Minister to give the House an indication as to when an extension of the service will be possible.</P>

      <P>There is an item in this Estimate for the purchase of sites.  I think it is a matter for congratulation every time the Post Office moves at all to purchase sites because there is probably no Government Department that is more in need of proper and up-to-date accommodation than the Post Office.  Many of the buildings around the country, the Minister ought to know&mdash;I am keeping on the general question of Post Office administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the Post Office buildings are not satisfactory.  Some of them were built 60 and 80 years ago and were built in positions which have not facilitated their extension.  In the meantime, of course, the Post Office has taken on a vast amount of new work and tries to get all this new work done in offices which are very unsightly and utterly inadequate for the proper transaction of public business.  The Post Office ought to take a leaf out of the banks' book and make some effort to enhance this State service and its <Col N="2038" /> prestige by providing proper buildings. If one goes into many towns and cities in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say to the Minister that the sites of the present offices are in many cases&mdash;very, very unsatisfactory and that therefore he could very usefully acquire additional sites and ought to acquire them as soon as possible so as to erect on those sites decent post offices instead of the unsightly structures which, in many cases, are there at the moment.  I do not know whether the Minister really appreciates the magnitude of the problem of providing proper accommodation for the transaction of Post Office business, but I think it would be only necessary for him to make inquiries in his Department to realise that from all over the country there are complaints from the public and the staff as to the inadequacy of the accommodation provided for the transaction of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Post Office has taken on various new activities in the form of the payment of children's allowances, payment of widows' and orphans' pensions, payment of Army pensions, dealing with ration coupons.  There has been a considerable increase in telephone, telegraph and parcel traffic and the Post Office endeavours to perform all that work with accommodation which is grossly insufficient for the public requirements. I think, therefore, having had this matter raised now, the Minister ought to exercise his ingenuity and his administrative mind in endeavouring between now and the introduction of the main Estimate to make proper provision for the purchase of additional sites so as to remedy the defects from which the Post Office <Col N="2039" /> service suffers by reason of the present unsatisfactory accommodation.  I do not want to raise at this stage the question of the Pearse Street distillery which masquerades as a sorting office. I defer that until the main Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an item here relating to engineering materials. Apparently we are going to get more of these.  I wonder would the Minister tell us how much of the engineering equipment will be in the way of telephone switch-boards and whether or not he is going to make a serious effort to grapple with the problem of telephone delays due to inadequate accommodation and inadequate equipment. The Minister is getting in more equipment now and I think I am entitled to ask, (1) what kind of equipment it is, and (2) what he is going to do with it and where he is going to locate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I know the Minister is seriously concerned about the effect of the development of Rineanna on the postal services in this country and, presumably, on the telephone service as well.  I notice the Minister has been down at Rineanna on a couple of occasions recently.  I suppose the development of Rineanna and the large influx of traffic there inevitably make it necessary to accelerate the telephone service in the area. The next time the Minister is down at Rineanna, I wonder would he look at the Ennis telephone exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to the necessity for providing additional switchboards in these offices where he must know there is considerable delay to telephone traffic because of the absence of switchboards and because of the fact that it is not possible to employ a staff to deal with existing telephone traffic owing to the absence of switchboards. Ennis is one of the places to which the Minister should direct his immediate attention.</P>

      <P>Because, notwithstanding the fact that it is the second largest town to Rineanna, there was telephone delay amounting to about four hours last year and I suppose it will be more this year when the larger influx of passengers takes place at Rineanna.</P>
      <P>I hope that between now and the time when the main Estimate is introduced the Minister will be able to give some indication, if he cannot give it now, about what he intends to do to overtake the very serious lag in the provision of proper buildings for the transaction of Post Office business. There is need for very radical reforms so far as Post Office buildings are concerned. It is an aspect of Post Office administration which presses both on the staff and on the public who are compelled to discharge their business in circumstances which are no great reflection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All those individual cases which have been mentioned, Booterstown, the Markets, etc., are all necessarily part of a very big problem with which we are confronted with regard to the telephone service.  When you consider that the increase in 1945 on trunks alone was 500,000 calls, and that the increase on the local telephone service was 5,000,000 in one year, you can see the tremendous problems that we are confronted with even in dealing with our arrears.  In the plans which we are very actively considering at the moment, we have two aspects: one is to deal with the enormous amount of arrears, and the other is to go out planning for a much bigger spread of telephone services all over the country.  I need not say any more about the other matters.  Deputy Norton got away from sites to buildings. Of course, he could not avoid his King Charles's head, the sorting office in Pearse Street, which is not so bad at all.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2043" /> When the original annual Estimate for the Army Vote, 1945-46, was being compiled, hostilities in Europe had not ceased, and consequently the Estimate was presented in its emergency form whereby all expenditure and receipts were grouped under two broad sub-heads without any details whatsoever. That gross Estimate in that form was for £8,411,942.</P>
    <P>The annual Estimate was not taken until the end of June and by that time hostilities had ceased, and consequently the necessity for suppressing detailed information no longer existed.  Accordingly, it was then decided to present the Estimate in its old form by sub-heads and with details, subject to the overriding consideration that the total amount of the gross Estimate for £8,411,942 should not be exceeded.  Within that amount, the sum of £1,560,000 provided for gratuities was purely a post-emergency item and the balance, £6,851,942, was distributed among the other services indicated by the sub-heads of the Vote on the best information then available. As pointed out at the time to the Dáil, about 61 per cent. of the Vote's expenditure related directly to the pay and maintenance of the Army, and, therefore, the principal factor was the average strength to be maintained during the year.  Starting with the actual strength on 1st April, 1945, and assuming a progressive reduction month by month after June, 1945, until the figure of 12,500 all ranks was reached at the end of March, 1946, the Estimate proceeded on the basis of an average of 22,249 all ranks over the whole of the financial year.  That assumption pre-supposed that demobilisation would begin in July, but in fact it did not begin until November, so that now in February, 1946, we find as a fact that average maintained was not 22,249 but 23,616 all ranks. That is the main explanation for the additional sums now required under sub-heads A, B and C.</P>
    <P>In sub-head A there is also included a sum of about £175,000 for a special payment in March of all deferred pay accrued due up to and including 27th February, 1946.  Deputies will recollect <Col N="2044" /> that, nearly four years ago, privates received an increase of sixpence a day in pay, and that in addition both N.C.O.s and men received an additional increase of sixpence a day, the payment of which was deferred.  All men who have been discharged from the permanent forces have been, or are being, paid such pay, and soldiers serving on a regular engagement have received all credits due up to 28th September, 1945.  The only class, therefore, which has not received any of their deferred credits are men serving on a temporary engagement for the duration of the emergency.  It will now be possible owing to changed conditions to pay all men, of whatever category, serving in the Army, all deferred credits due up to and including 27th February, 1946, and after that date to treat the sixpence a day deferred pay as an integral portion of their ordinary pay.</P>
    <P>For gratuities under sub-head A (4), we require an extra sum of £260,798, because the number of claims which will, it is estimated, be dealt with during the financial year is greater than originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>The explanation I have already given regarding the additional amount required for the pay and maintenance of the Army applies also to the amount needed under sub-head C for the pay of civilians.  In June we budgeted for 1,511 civilians under this sub-head, but actually it has been found necessary to employ on an average about 1,800, and that is why we require £47,939 more.</P>
    <P>As regards the sub-heads for stores, P, Q and R, our commitments in the annual Estimate are greater than anticipated, and claims materialising in respect of deliveries have also been heavier.  Under sub-head R (£59,537), for instance, we relied on the fact that in previous years much of our fuel supplies consisted of Army-won turf, but this year, owing to the reduction in the strength of the Army, we were unable to rely on that source of supply and had to go out to tender for our requirements. Again, as regards sub-head Q (£23,811), we had for some time past under order badly needed engineering equipment, and in the absence of an <Col N="2045" /> export licence we could not get delivery.  With the cessation of hostilities, however, the licence was granted, and we received delivery of the equipment. In the case of sub-head P (£169,729) we have received delivery of guns and fittings, generator sets and Bren-gun and universal carriers which we were seeking for some time past, and which are required for the equipment and training of the Army even in peace time.</P>
    <P>The excess on sub-head T (£29,605) is entirely due to the purchase of sites for military purposes.  At Limerick we have purchased a site for a new barracks, and work is proceeding thereon; and at Baldonnel and Fermoy, in view of the development of aircraft, we have found it essential to purchase more land for the extension of runways.  Under sub-head U, the excess of £18,307 is mainly due to compensation to owners of private property occupied for military use during the emergency.  In sub-head Y (2), Army Reserve, the excess (£10,656) is due to the fact that the revised Estimate presented in June allowed for an average of 1,770 all ranks, but the actual average strength throughout the year was 5,843.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Y (4) provides Grants-in-Aid for the newly reorganised Local Defence Force described in the Estimate under its Gaelic title of <i>An Fórsa Cosanta Aitiúil.</i>  For financial purposes the old force has now practically ceased, and recruiting to the new force has begun.  Here I should point out that, in the annual Estimate, a sum of £83,000 was provided for Grants-in-Aid for the old force, and that the most of that money was payable in January, 1946.  Owing, however, to the reorganisation of the force payment was suspended and only about £3,000 was actually paid out. There is a saving, therefore, of £80,000 on the original year's Vote against the £15,000 now asked for.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head E E we require £1,000 to defray the cost of pre-Truce medals and ribbons.  No provision for any such expenditure was made in the annual Estimate.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head V (2) we are asking <Col N="2046" /> the Dáil to make a Grant-in-Aid of £10,000 towards acquiring and adapting a new soldiers' club in Dublin.  Such a club existed in Dublin up to 1931, but from that year until 1941 there was not any.  In 1941, owing to the large number of troops garrisoned in Dublin, and also to the large number visiting the Capital either on duty or on leave, the need of a club which would provide meals, lodging and recreation for the soldiers became apparent, and for a time the position was acute.  After vainly seeking accommodation in various quarters, the Hospitals' Trust came to our rescue by letting us at a nominal rent certain premises over the Sweepstake Offices in O'Connell Street, and through the generosity of benefactors, to whom I, on behalf of the Army, offer sincere thanks, we were enabled to equip the club.  The need of the club and its success may be gauged from the fact that during 1945 the turn-over of the restaurant was £6,112, and that of the dormitory £1,040.  These figures represent about 4,779 meals a month, and accommodation for 50 soldiers nightly.</P>
    <P>The premises were required for their original purpose and notice of termination was served for 31st August, 1945. Alternative accommodation was then sought, and the management committee eventually secured premises in Parnell Square at a cost of £8,989.  The building is now being adapted and renovated and the cost, including the provision of a new hall, will be about £8,250.  The total cost, therefore, will be between £17,000 and £18,000, and we are asking in this Estimate for a Grant-in-Aid of £10,000 or two-thirds of the total cost whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>I have now dealt with the various sub-heads shown in the Estimate.  The total gross additional sum required is, as shown, £1,408,037.  From that has to be deducted a sum of £374,765 in respect of excess Appropriations-in-Aid, due mainly to the sale of surplus Army stores.  From the special sales we expect to realise about £367,000 and we also anticipate a surplus of about £7,765 from the normal activities of the Department.  This reduces the gross total to £1,033,272.</P>
    <P>However, from that total there must <Col N="2047" /> be deducted a sum of £326,131 representing savings on other sub-heads of the Vote not specified in the printed form.  The savings are scattered over some 22 other sub-heads of the Vote, but it may be said in brief that the savings were effected mainly either through the cessation of certain services or the non-purchase of certain stores.  For instance, the closing down of the old Local Defence Force has effected a technical saving of about £136,641; the repatriation of internees about £11,037, and the termination of the A.R.P. services £30,974.  The cancellation of certain store purchases has brought savings of £105,273 and the adjustment of estimation on other sub-heads £42,206, bringing the total technical savings up to £326,131.  Hence, deducting the excess appropriations and the technical savings on the annual Estimate the net sum required is £707,141 which the Dáil is now asked to Vote.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter on a general discussion of this Supplementary Estimate although it deals with many aspects of Army control and administration.  In connection with the L.D.F. Grants-in-Aid, can the Minister say if the sum mentioned is intended to provide a gratuity for each man, or is it merely a Grant-in-Aid made to the unit to cover certain expenses?  I see that the amount in the sub-head is £1 per man per unit.  Would the Minister say if that includes a gratuity, or bonus, to each member of the L.D.F. either on a <i>per capita</i> basis or on a basis of service at so much per year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gathered from what the Minister said that the rate of demobilisation has <Col N="2048" /> been slower than was anticipated. Speaking from recollection, the rate of demobilisation was estimated to be 2,000 per month.  Can the Minister say whether the rate of demobilisation has been less than 2,000 per month, and, if so, by how much?  Can he also tell us the number of acres of land acquired at Baldonnel and Fermoy, and the cost per acre?  Perhaps he could also tell us the cost of the club that has been acquired, and also if the club, in making provision for the lodging of soldiers, endeavours to make the largest profit possible or is merely catering for the accommodation of those soldiers, who find themselves in town for a night or a few nights, at the cheapest possible rate; because it was suggested that such accommodation should be provided at the cheapest rate which would enable the club to pay its way, and that the club should not charge anything over and above the ordinary outgoings which these services would entail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period of the emergency, Sir, I think the Minister will admit that this House was very generous in voting huge sums of money for Army expenditure, including a very big sum for the provision of warlike stores.  We are now asked, in this Supplementary Estimate, to vote a further sum of about £170,000 for the same purpose.  I presume that that arises from contracts that were entered into before the war ended, but I would very definitely discourage the Minister and the Government from entering into contracts for the purchase of any further large quantities of warlike stores, because the average person assumes that we are going to have peace for a reasonably lengthy period, and if we are going to have another war, we will not be able to defend ourselves with the same kind of warlike stores or equipment that we might have been called upon to use during the period of the late war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an Estimate on which we can say very much on questions of policy, but if I were tempted to encourage the Minister to purchase warlike stores and equipment, I should say that he ought to concentrate on the air and the development of our air force. <Col N="2049" /> I do not suppose we can expect anybody to acquaint us with some of the secrets connected with the atomic bomb, or to tell us how to counteract any of the effects of the atomic bomb when the next war takes place&mdash;and I hope, at any rate, that I will have passed out of this world before that takes place.  However, it is a serious thing to authorise the expenditure of huge sums of money on warlike stores if, as we all hope, we are not going to have another war for a long time to come.  In that connection, I should like to know from the Minister what percentage of the warlike stores purchased during the late war are still in stock, and what is their stock-taking value at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, that it will come as a shock to a great many people to find that nine months after the war has ended we are presented here with a Supplementary Estimate, asking for a sum of money to be voted, by way of a supplement, which is almost equal to the total normal, pre-war sum required for the Army.  The Minister&mdash;and I tried to follow him very closely&mdash;did not say, in respect of the sum mentioned by Deputy Davin: about £169,000 for guns and so on, that that sum was in respect of contracts entered into before the end of the war. If I followed the Minister aright, it was in respect of a new commitment by the Department, and I think that <Col N="2050" /> before a sum of £169,000 is voted we ought to get some more justification for it, even on a Supplementary Estimate, than we have got.</P>
      <P>Another substantial sum that is mentioned in this Supplementary Estimate is for the provision of new military barracks in various parts of the country.  Now, I think&mdash;and I speak out of the absolute depths of my ignorance about military matters and military strategy, and particularly about what are the effective military weapons of the day and, still more so, what they will be to-morrow or the day after &mdash;we already have enough military barracks in the country.  Even if we had not made what, I suppose, will now be called progress in war weapons over the last four or five years, one would have thought that we already had more than sufficient military barracks in this country, and I want to object strongly to voting money for the provision of new military barracks in various parts of this country at a time when we are told that, because of the shortage of necessary building materials, we are unable to provide houses for people who are living to-day in conditions that are resulting in disease&mdash;I will not put it any stronger than that.  I do not want to over-stress or to over-emphasise this matter, nor do I want to pick holes in the proposal, but I do say that if the Minister for Defence comes into this House and asks for a sum of money&mdash;because that, in effect, is what it means&mdash;of between £1,000,000 and £1,500,000, as a Supplementary Estimate, in a year in which the House has already voted a very large sum it requires a lot more justification from the Minister than we have got from him.  I think that this cannot be treated, if I might say so, as just an ordinary Supplementary Estimate for a token sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confining myself as closely as I can to the Supplementary Estimate, and I am dealing only with the larger items. There is another substantial figure in the Estimate.  It is a sum of £59,000, the amount required, in addition to the sum already voted, as I understand from the Minister, for the provision of fuel for the Army.  We are told that that sum is required because of demobilisation or because Army personnel was not turned over to the bogs, so to speak, this year as in other years, while at the same time we are told that the rate of demobilisation has been far slower than was originally anticipated. The Minister cannot have it both ways.  If the personnel of the Army is considerably smaller than it was, then there ought to be some reduction in the amount of fuel required, though I can see that you could have a substantial reduction in personnel without reducing the commitment for keeping the fires going.  Those who remain in the Army ought not to be scattered and under as many roofs as it was necessary for them to be during the war period.  On the other hand, if the rate of demobilisation has not been as rapid as was anticipated, and the necessity for military manoeuvres has not been as great as it was in previous years, there should have been sufficient personnel available to cut and save whatever fuel was required for the Army.  Three items of the Estimate stick out: (1) £169,000 for more guns; (2) a substantial sum for new military barracks; and (3) an additional sum of £59,000 for fuel for the Army.  The Minister covered his subheads in the way customary with other Ministers when dealing with Supplementary Estimates.  I suggest that this is rather an extraordinary Supplementary Estimate which would require a little more elaboration and justification.  The House ought not lightly to vote so substantial a sum without further information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise one or two matters in connection with this Estimate.  There is provision in the Estimate for what are described as re-enlistment bounties.</P>
      <P>I have no official ground for saying what I propose to say, but it is generally rumoured that recruitment for the Army, of late, has been very slow and unsatisfactory.  I have no official grounds for making that statement, but the general view I hear expressed amongst Army personnel is that recruitment is not as good as was anticipated. I should like if the Minister would give us some indication of what the rate of re-enlistment is, and what the rate of recruitment of persons not previously in the Army is.  As everybody knows, there is quite substantial recruitment for the British Army at the present time.  Quite a considerable number of men contrived to get across the Border, officially and unofficially, to join the British Army.  If they are young healthy persons, we ought to endeavour to attract them to our own Army.  If they have not been attracted so far, because the conditions are not to their liking, the Minister must give some consideration to making those conditions such as will attract that potential Army personnel which is at present not being attracted.  I am talking, more or less, in the dark so far as the rate of recruitment to our own Army is concerned.  I am not in a position to express an opinion whether it is up to expectations or not.  I should be glad if the Minister would tell us what the Army view is of the present rate of recruitment and whether it is up to the standard anticipated by the Army authorities when they contemplated a peace-time Army of, approximately, 12,000 men.</P>
      <P>An item in this Estimate relates to marriage allowances.  If it is not inconvenient at this stage&mdash;if it is, I shall postpone the question until the main Estimate is before us&mdash;I should like the Minister to tell us whether he hopes to be able in the immediate future to take on to the marriage establishment all the married soldiers in the Army.  At present, only a proportion of them can get on to the marriage establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> The others have to await their turn, which is very unsatisfactory to the married soldier.  I think that everybody would desire that married soldiers should be borne, generally, on the marriage establishment of the Army.  For some reason or other, that was not found practicable in the past. That is a situation to which the Minister ought to face up and some steps should be taken to overcome the difficulties which prevented the absorption of married soldiers into the marriage establishment.  That may be an administrative matter which it is not fair to raise at this stage.  If it is not convenient for the Minister to answer now, I am satisfied to leave the matter over for the main Estimate or the Minister might communicate his views to me otherwise than by debate here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer, in the first place, to Item P&mdash; Warlike Stores&mdash;in respect of which the Minister said the increased cost was £169,000.  The Minister explained that that was for stores for which they had entered into commitments and of which delivery had been made unexpectedly or in advance.  I should like the Minister to tell us to what amount of warlike stores we are committed, and must take delivery of, because I take it that, in 1939, when the emergency threatened, we would have passed an Estimate for millions.  The next question that arises is: Are the stores which have been delivered obsolescent or of the latest type?  I differ slightly from some of the previous speakers in that I feel that the Army ought to be equipped with the latest types of arms, including guns, armoured vehicles, tanks, etc.  They ought to have samples of all those of the latest types.  If those are what we have got, I have not a word to say, but I should like the Minister's assurance that we had not had to take delivery of obsolescent types of equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item about which I want to ask the Minister has reference to the Grant-in-Aid of the L.D.F.&mdash;£1 per annum in respect of each effective member.  I asked him to-day about the overcoats&mdash;whether they would involve an expense or a saving.  I ask the <Col N="2054" /> Minister now&mdash;he can answer at his pleasure if he does not find it convenient to answer at the moment&mdash; what is he going to do about the L.D.F. overcoats?  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dáil Eireann requests the Government to introduce proposals for the purpose of providing for persons over 65 years of age, who have ceased being gainfully employed, old age pensions at the rate of 22/6 per week; and providing further that, in computing the means of applicants under the old age pensions code, any net income not exceeding £52 per annum will not be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, I suggest, a certain significance in the fact that this motion will be seconded by Deputy Keyes of Limerick because it is now some 19 years ago since Deputy Keyes signalised his entry into this House by a speech on this very same subject.  The fact that he will, of necessity, have to traverse a good deal of the ground that he covered 19 years ago, is a pretty fair indication of the lack of progress in the intervening years on this outstanding social question. When old age pensions were increased to the figure of 10/- some 30 years ago, it was hailed in this country as the economic emancipation of a very large section of our community, calculated as it then was to give a reasonable measure of comfort to our people, with the added recommendation that it would ensure to them that spirit of independence which is cherished at no time in life more than in old age.  Two wars have been sandwiched in between that period and the effect has been to dissipate to a very great extent the value of that splendid social experiment, to the extent that the position of the pensioner in this country at present is depressed almost to zero.  An illustration of that is to be found in <Col N="2055" /> the fact that it now takes 24/7 to purchase what was available in 1916 for 10/-.</P>
    <P>The House I think will readily admit that there has been, I am glad to say, an improvement in the intervening years in the position of the great majority of the people in this country. The one glaring exception to that general improvement is afforded by the position of the old age pensioner.  Not alone has there been no improvement in his position but there has been an actual serious deterioration.  I suggest that if we reflect for a moment on the rising tide of prices which has been a feature in this country during the last five years, it does not require a very vivid imagination to get a picture of the hardships which these people had to endure.  I can say from experience that in the City of Dublin the position of a considerable number of them in any case has been pitiable in the extreme because pensioners in the City of Dublin, and in other large cities and towns throughout the country, have to meet the full impact of an economic situation which taxes even the resources of those who might be regarded as being properly equipped to meet it.  I would ask, how could it be otherwise when one examines what could have been purchased during these five years or what could be purchased to-day for the sum of 10/-?</P>
    <P>We suffer from the disability that we have no official standard by which we might express in terms of £ s. d. the requirements of an individual, but at least we have the figures for the cost of maintenance in our institutions.  I can give the figures for two of these institutions in the City of Dublin.  In one case the figure is 30/- a week and in the second £2 2s.  If, therefore, we refer to the individual with 10/- a week&mdash;at most his total income cannot be more than 16/- a week&mdash;and place that figure against the known cost of maintenance in institutions, a minimum figure of 30/- and take also into consideration the impact of prices here during the last five years, I think the House will not suggest that I am making an over-statement when I say that a considerable number of <Col N="2056" /> people affected are very definitely on the border line of destitution.  To get an idea of the number of people so affected it is necessary for us to refer to the official figures.</P>
    <P>For that purpose I will quote the official figures as at the 30th June, 1943.  The number of persons then in receipt of the old age pension was 146,068.  Of these 22,500 were in receipt of less than 10/- a week:&mdash;159 had 1/-, 316 had 2/-, 514 had 3/-, 1,095 4/-, 2,172 5/-, 3,935 6/-, 3,105 7/-, 6,184 8/-, 4,012 9/- and 124,576 10/-.  There are, therefore, 124,576 in receipt of 10/- per week, whose income because of the assessment under the means test can not be more than 16/-.  When we consider what these people have to face, having regard to the purchasing power of that 10/-, we get a very clear picture of what the old age pensioner is suffering at the present time.  His position I suggest calls for a little more than sympathy.  On occasions of debates of this kind the value of comparisons has been disputed.  I am going to make some comparisons, with the reservation that while they may not entirely help to solve the problem here, they at least will help to show the general trend towards this great question of old age pensions throughout the world.</P>
    <P>First of all, I take the position at the present time in Great Britain. Deputies are aware that a new national insurance scheme was introduced there in December last.  Under the Bill &mdash;which, incidentally, will apply automatically, in the general course of events, to Northern Ireland&mdash;every man becomes pensionable at the age of 65, and every woman at 60, according to Section 77.  Instead of an old age pension, the old person on reaching pensionable age, becomes entitled to what is described as a retirement pension of not less than 27/- per week. An additional 16/- a week is paid if there is an adult dependent, and 7/6 for each child dependent.  In Great Britain, therefore, a couple&mdash;a man of 65 with a wife of 60&mdash;are guaranteed 52/- a week for the remainder of their lives.  They may get even a larger allowance later in life: if the husband continues at work until aged 70, and <Col N="2057" /> pays 50 contributions in each of the five years between 65 and 70, his pension is increased by 10/- per week.  It is true that the retirement pension envisaged under the Bill is entirely on an insurance basis, and as the contributions are not segregated, I am not in a position to give the amount that would be attributable to the retirement pension.  That scheme being on an insurance basis, there will be contributions from the beneficiary.</P>
    <P>In the case of New Zealand, which has been quoted here on many occasions and where the scheme is noncontributory, every person gets 32/6 at the age of 60, so man and wife are guaranteed a joint income of £3 5s. In addition, such a couple&mdash;and this is interesting because of the means test here&mdash;can have £1 a week of their own, can have up to £500 each in the Post Office Savings Bank and may own their own home, without the pension being affected.  The cost of living in New Zealand, particularly regarding food, is now assessed at 20 per cent. under that which operates in this country, so the benefits have been more substantial even than may appear on the face of the figures.</P>
    <P>In Sweden, one of the most progressive countries in the world, perhaps, so far as social legislation is concerned, the pension scheme at the age of 65 is £120 a year and the husband and wife may draw separate pensions. It is interesting to see what has happened in the United States at the present time.  The scheme there covers pretty well every item of employment, save agriculture, domestic service and State service.  The pensionable age is 65, but retirement from work at 65 is not compulsory.  The pension is based on the rate of earning. Taking a man earning 100 dollars a month, which appears to be a fair average income for the mass of the people covered by the scheme (that is £300 per annum) his pension would be 27½ dollars a month.</P>
    <P>In France, now struggling to emerge from chaos, a scheme has been introduced for old age pensions. Their rate is half the average national wage as a minimum, plus 10 per cent. where the insured person has brought <Col N="2058" /> up at least three children.  If they have brought up more than three, it is plus 20 per cent.  The pension proposed there is payable at the age of 65.</P>
    <P>I mention these comparisons not as a solution, or any indication of a solution, of the problem that applies here, because of varying conditions, but because they are covered by a general trend with two outstanding features. One is that the pension will be payable at the age of 65, and the other that the pension rates are more reasonably adequate.</P>
    <P>Now I come to an aspect of the old age pensions code which gives more trouble to the potential beneficiary and to members of public bodies, including this House, than any other section of the code itself.  It is the question of the means test, regarded as the most objectionable section of the whole code.  No later than to-day, a Question appeared on the Order Paper regarding it and I certainly would be one who would like to regard the incident reported in that Question as being purely isolated and not governing the general position.  However, there is a feeling abroad regarding the means test that it carries with it, immediately from the first, point of examination, a general form of inquisition which is, to put it as low as I may assess it, irritating. A man or woman at the age of 70 is naturally in a sensitive state.  They do not like to feel that their whole lives shall be laid bare, and more especially that their position of dependency, as it will appear to them then, is one to be exploited.  In that respect, I suggest that the time has arrived for a complete reversal of the policy pursued in connection with the means test.</P>
    <P>My own view&mdash;and it is a personal view&mdash;is that the means test should be entirely abolished.  I see no grounds for retaining it and I am strengthened in that view by the fact that a Bill passed through this House quite recently on much the same lines, the Children's Allowances Bill, from which that objectionable feature was removed.  Something might be said for that proposal, when we look at the figure for administration of the old age pension code as a whole.  That figure <Col N="2059" /> in 1942-43 was £118,000.  On the 21st June, last year, the Minister stated that of that sum £30,000 was allocated as administrative charges in respect of the means test&mdash;in other words&mdash;25 per cent. of the total cost of administration.</P>
    <P>In this resolution, we are asking that the means test might be modified to the extent that income in excess of £52 a year would be disregarded, so far as the investigators are concerned.  I think that proposal is reasonable and will not make an undue charge on the Exchequer.  It is one that will be very deeply appreciated by those about to come into benefit as beneficiaries and is one that will be welcomed by all sections of this House, since I am bound to say that concern for the aged is not the preserve of any particular Party here.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions since I came into this House, I have drawn attention here&mdash;and so have members from all quarters&mdash;to the position obtaining so far as voluntary pensions are concerned in both industrial and commercial firms.  I am glad to say that, for the last five years or so, there seems to be a growing tendency on the part of employers to give a voluntary pension on discharge at the age of 65&mdash; which seems to be the general figure in industry throughout the world.  The individual between 65 and 70, therefore, has to fend for himself as best he can.  Employers are recognising the difficulties with which their late employee would be faced and, consequently, more and more of them are coming in on what may be described as a voluntary superannuation scheme. Again, the vicious circle enters at the age of 70.  The pension, usually a small one, is immediately docked at the age of 70, because of the fact that this particular means test will apply and the head of the industrial firm is prepared, naturally, to saddle the Exchequer with the 10/- rather than bear it himself, when he knows that it can just as easily be had from the State.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I make to the Minister&mdash;it has been made by several members before&mdash;is that we might encourage this type of voluntary pension to the extent of £1 or 30/- a week, as it <Col N="2060" /> may be, and that, in addition, the State pension of 10/- will automatically apply.  I do not think that is an excessive demand.  I think, again, that not alone the employees, but the employers generally throughout the country, would be prepared to co-operate in a scheme of that character.  I may mention, too, that in the trade union movement a number of trade unions provide a superannuation scheme on a small basis for their members retiring at the age of 65, or in the years between 65 and 70.  They, naturally, suffer the same disabilities.  I will not say more on the means test than that, because I know that Deputy Keyes will have something to say about it, as will other members of the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to indicate to the Minister that a motion in almost similar terms was debated in this House in 1944, and the only distinction between the motion then before the House and the one that is now before it is that a figure of 22/6 is substituted for 20/- The reason for that was that on our side we felt the necessity for bringing it into line with the money payment which operated in Northern Ireland which was, from a pension and a supplementary pension, 22/6, although there is this point, that, since the cost of living in Northern Ireland is generally regarded on a 20 per cent. lower basis, the figure of 22/6 represents a higher purchasing value there than here.  That is the reason for the alteration from 20/- to 22/6.</P>
    <P>When that debate took place in 1944, and, indeed, on other occasions, the answer of the Minister in charge at the time usually was that the cost of the motion would be prohibitive, since the charges would have to be made up out of taxation.  Reference in that respect is usually made to the cost of expanding social services.  It is true, as was pointed out on the last occasion, that an increase of 1/- a week would cost the Exchequer £385,000, and a figure of 5/- would cost just slightly under £2,000,000&mdash;that is, with the basis of age at 70.  Actually, the figure of cost for the motion in 1944 was given as £12,500,000, less, of course, approximately £4,000,000, the cost of the then existing services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2061" /> One of the reasons why the Minister for Finance, as a rule, says that he cannot accede to this request is the cost of expanding social services.  On this occasion I want very clearly to say to the Minister that on these benches we have an entirely different conception of the term social services from that which he and his colleagues are prepared to place upon it.  I would say that when a nation is compelled, as apparently ours has been compelled for some time, under the guise of social services to resort to such expedients as free boots, fuel and food, then quite frankly such a nation is very definitely, both socially and economically, sick.  Services of that kind are not social services.  Throughout the world, in every progressive democratic State, social services are classed under three or four headings.  They are common to these countries and should be standard here.  These are the care of the aged, the sick, the infirm, the widow and orphan, and the blind person.  I say, therefore, that any of the other services for which taxation is being imposed on our people, outside of those in that category, is very definitely not a social service as we view it.</P>
    <P>I suggest a continuation of that scale of services is just merely a device to stave off what should be, in effect, a radical solution, and that solution is to be found working with success in countries as far apart as New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and the Scandinavian countries; it is now in operation in Great Britain and is praised from practically every platform in the United States.  That solution is the exploitation of our national resources on the basis of a policy of full employment calculated to increase the pool of national wealth from which real social services can be fed.  That is not happening here; it is not, apparently, likely to happen for some time and I suggest to the Minister that, in the light of the position which operates for so many of these people suffering from keen hardships outside, we cannot afford any longer to go down the slippery slope and something in excess of sympathy is needed, something practical and something that should be done quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2062" /> I am hopeful that the Minister, who is appearing here in his capacity as Minister for Finance for the first time on this particular subject, will not only approach this subject with sympathy, as I feel he will, but that he will give some evidence that he is prepared to ease the burdens which now lie so heavily on shoulders that can ill afford to bear them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion, which has been proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan, I regret that I, too, find it necessary, after more than 18 years, to advert to a subject on which I spoke for the first time in this House.  Practically no change has taken place since then in the alleviation of the lot of the old age pensioner.  I remember distinctly on that occasion the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Blythe, indicated his very considerable agreement with some of the points I made, particularly on the anomaly of the old age pension code as operating in the country, and he promised then at some time in the near future attention would have to be given to it.  I was speaking then particularly on the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan as to the anomaly of the means test, because it appeared to me then, as it appears to me now, that the only citizen who is entitled to qualify for the magnificent sum of 10/- a week, which, at its best, is an insult to our people, is the person who has never made any attempt to be thrifty or careful in his life.  The citizen who gives of his best to rear his children decently, to educate them to become good citizens and who puts a few shillings into a provident fund associated with his trade union, or some benevolent fund like that of the Foresters or the Oddfellows, is penalised when he reaches the age of 70 by a State which encourages thrift and which wastes public money in advising us to be thrifty and to buy Savings Certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested in 1928, and it is equally true to-night, that that advertisement should be surcharged by the auditor and there should be a footnote to it stating: &ldquo;And we will duly punish you at the age of 70.&rdquo;  That would be a truthful exposition of the mind of the Government, and, without that qualifying clause, I suggest that we <Col N="2063" /> are inviting people to be thrifty under false pretences.</P>
    <P>An old age pension of 10/- is ungenerous, unjust, unwise and would be absolutely farcical were it not for the tragic aspect of it.  Deputy O'Sullivan has indicated the purchasing value of 10/- to-day and it is not necessary for me to dwell on the point, but I do not think 10/- was a reasonable return to a citizen who carried out his duties as a citizen in industry or in agriculture up to the age at which he could no longer work.  That man was entitled to more generous consideration to enable him to retire in reasonable comfort so that he would not be a burden on others in his last days but would be welcome in the home he had built up.</P>
    <P>We have seen many instances of old people being pushed aside when they were no longer able to bring in any revenue.  We have seen many instances of these people being pushed into county homes and similar institutions where the State cannot maintain them on 10/- per week.  The House has been given the figures for the institutions in the City of Dublin, and I challenge the Minister to say that there is any institution in the country, buying stuff in bulk and at contract prices, in which an old age pensioner can be kept on anything less than 100 per cent. more than he is expected to live on when he is fending for himself in his own home.</P>
    <P>It was ungenerous and unjust to give them that amount for the services they had given and it is nationally unwise because it is the desire of every right-minded citizen to bring about the restoration of unity between Northern Ireland and ourselves.  How in reason or common sense can we expect to get that barrier wiped out if the old age pensioners, their relatives and friends in Northern Ireland, are to be told: &ldquo;You will come into this State but your allowance will be reduced to a sum of 10/- a week&rdquo;?  The people there also have hopes of vast increases under the social legislation promoted in Britain.  What is wrong with Eire? Have we become so pauperised because of changing the Union Jack for the Tricolour <Col N="2064" /> that we have to depress the standard of life of our own citizens?</P>
    <P>The acid test of our success or failure as a Government is our ability to do our own business in our own way, and if we can do no better than to keep these people on the lowest standard of any country in the world, we should write ourselves down as failures when we cannot even compete with the Six Counties, a small provincial Parliament, which has set such a magnificent headline.  We are maintaining the barrier between us and them so long as we refuse to step into line and step up old age pensions and other social services to a standard not lower than that which operates there.  The system operates very harshly on the tradesmen in cities and towns who put away a few shillings each week from their already meagre wages in order to make provision for their old age.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has indicated that generous employers in increasing numbers in recent times are showing a tendency to grant voluntary pensions, but why should they grant these voluntary pensions if they know that the State will take advantage of their generosity and cut down the recipient by the statutory amount?  We all know cases throughout the country&mdash;I know several cases&mdash;of employers who are trying by stealth and subterranean methods to help old employees while securing for them the benefit which the State gives in the shape of a pension. That is not easy to accomplish when, as we are told, 25 per cent. of the total administrative costs of old age pension services is spent on investigation officers operating the means test.</P>
    <P>We have seen how rigorously that test is carried out.  I quoted the instance already in this House of an old woman who was visited by the investigation officer.  Since his previous visit, the two goats which she had had been replaced by a cow which had been guilty of the heinous crime of giving birth to a calf, with the result that her old age pension was cut.  This treatment of our people is beneath contempt. Investigation officers probably have to follow the scales which are laid down for them, but the standard set is certainly a by-word and a disgrace <Col N="2065" /> to our boasted civilisation and to the Constitution which is so frequently flaunted.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan said he mentioned certain countries with reservations.  I make no reservation whatever in asking that our country should give at least as much as countries comparable with us in population and possibilities of development.  Is there any reason why we should not do as well as New Zealand?  The sums provided in New Zealand do not seem to have made New Zealand a bankrupt nation. It has gone step by step to greater prosperity, and, since that social legislation was passed in 1935, they have increased the old age pension three times in each succeeding Budget.</P>
    <P>Whatever the economists and statisticians say, the plain fact is that the money given to the old age pensioner circulates in the country in which it originates.  It does not leave the country to buy petrol in Palestine or to buy rubber elsewhere.  It circulates through the shopkeepers' tills, and helps the farmer, the producer, and the tradesman, by enabling old persons to buy their requirements in their own way.  Their requirements are humble&mdash; they want no great luxuries&mdash;but they want reasonably good food, and reasonably good furniture and surroundings in their old age, so that the money passes round and helps to enrich the old age pensioner and the shopkeeper, and to give more employment.  The money is not wasted, so that I have no reservation in the matter.  I do not share the reservation of Deputy O'Sullivan, and I think we ought to be able to do as good as New Zealand is doing.</P>
    <P>However, having been rebuffed so frequently, the motion we propose does not set out any grandiose scale of payment. It simply asks that 22/6 per week be given at the age of 65, the age which has become accepted as the age for retirement, to enable our people to retire from industry, to get out of the way and make room for younger men.  We have an unemployment problem and this is a step in the direction of easing it.  If, at the age of 65, a man could retire, knowing that he would get 22/6 per week, and that his <Col N="2066" /> wife would get the same, it would be a reasonable encouragement to them to get out and provide an avenue for the employment of many young men who at present are going to Britain and elsewhere to seek employment.</P>
    <P>I suggest that very scant consideration has been given to the problem. The emergency, which pressed so heavily upon all sections, saw the making of the standstill Wages Order for the organised working classes.  Notwithstanding that standstill Order, it was found necessary by the Government to provide certain easements, and bonuses up to a maximum of 15/- or 16/- per week were allowed to workers in order to help to tide them over the period of sky-high prices ruling here at the time and at present.  What did the old age pensioner get?  The old man with the 10/- he got 30 years ago was left with that 10/- until the Bonus Order came along providing for an increase of 2/6 per week.</P>
    <P>That increase of 2/6, however, was not of general application.  It was administered through the Board of Health and another means test was imposed by the home assistance officer He went through the country on the instructions of the county manager, who, in turn, was acting on the instructions of the Department, and unless sheer destitution in the home could be shown the half-crown increase did not apply.  No two old pensioners in the one house can get the 2/6.  In some instances the 2/6 was cut to 1/6.  In some families it was cut off completely in summer to enable the pensioners to be paid throughout the winter.  As the 2/6 was granted in an honest effort to help old age pensioners, that might be taken as a precedent for making it a permanent feature of the old age pensions code.  I think that approach was a contemptible one.  It has caused friction and bitterness amongst old age pensioners, where one is getting the extra amount and another is not getting it.  I think every Deputy can bear testimony to the number of letters received complaining that one person is getting the 2/6 and that another is not getting it.</P>
    <P>In asking to have the pension <Col N="2067" /> granted at 65, I think we have indicated clearly that that is a sound and a practical proposition.  That is proven by figures showing what is done in other countries, where it is the accepted principle that 65 should be the retiring age.  If the old people retire they ought to be able to have a reasonable hope of maintaining themselves in some sort of decent and frugal comfort, and, incidentally, making way for younger men to get employment in their places.  On the question of 22/6, is it considered unreasonable?  Is it too much?  I do not think anybody can say that a pension of 22/6 a week is too much, having regard to the present value of money, for anybody to maintain himself on.  Added to that, I advanced the other reason, that we ought at least be able to do as good as they are doing in Northern Ireland.  If we do not do that, by bringing our standard of social legislation, at least, into step with them, we can abandon our expressions of hope of removing the Border and reuniting our country. That is what we all hope will take place some time.  It will not take place by force or coercion.  It will take place in one way only, by winning the people of the Six Counties with good will to come under one Government, where there is a realisation of what is due to the working-class people, particularly to the old people and to the blind; where they will be no worse off under the Tricolour in a Dublin Parliament than under the Union Jack in Belfast. It is a reflection on our capacity to govern this country if, after almost a quarter of a century, we cannot show that we have advanced one iota in improving the lot of old age pensioners, and blind pensioners, while those who opted out have been able to increase their standard of social security.  I commend this motion to the sympathy of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate both the proposer and the seconder of the motion on the manner in which they presented it to the House, and for the amount of information and knowledge they displayed in the course of their presentation.  The motion before us asks that old age pensioners should be <Col N="2068" /> granted pensions at the rate of 22/6 a week, that pensions should be given at the age of 65 years, and that any net income not exceeding £52 yearly should not be taken into account.  I do not believe that from any quarter of this House, or anywhere outside it, there would be any objection to the motion, except one objection, namely, that the money is not available, or that the taxation that would have to be imposed in order to get the money would be entirely too severe for the backs of the people to bear.  There was a time when I was impressed with that type of argument from a Government Front Bench, but that time has gone.  It is only a few months since we had without any notice to the House, without any consultation, without any reasons given, in a kind of casual happy-go-lucky way, a statement that our postwar Army, in the peace period following the war, was going to be two and a half times as large as our pre-war Army, and, taking into account the difference in rates, that happy-go-lucky statement was to the effect, that the post-war expenditure was going to be from three to four times as great as pre-war.  Five or six millions went like that in a casual statement, and no Minister for Finance got up to ask where the money was to come from.  No Minister of State worried about the backs that would be broken by the burden of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that in peace times an army is a parasite, a form of tapeworm inside the body of the State; an animal that devours, that is nonproductive, that gives nothing back, but sucks the substance of the State. Yet, the future peace time expenditure is to be £4,000,000 or £5,000,000, and it can be easily got, and there is not even an obligation on the Government or the Minister making that proposal to give any reason why.  No, just that the money is wanted.  That money can be got, but when it comes to the blind, the sick, and the aged, then every pound note is a plaster on the backs of the taxpayers.  For that reason, I am no longer impressed by that kind of statement to which I referred.  It appears to many of us that the money could easily be got, but we perpetuate this situation, asking where the <Col N="2069" /> money is to come from.  We are living and have lived through a very abnormal period, when a flow of wealth undreamt of poured into this country.  No matter what caused that wealth to pour into this country, the income-tax returns give some standard measure as to the rate at which it poured in.  The worker's remuneration was fixed.  He could not participate in that wealth. People living or trying to live on pensions had to contribute to that flow of wealth.  In the case of everybody living on a wage or on a salary, the Government stepped in to ensure that not only could they not participate in the great new flow of wealth, but each one of them, down to the old age pensioner, was to make a contribution to it.  But in the case of producers, manufacturers, merchants and traders, as the income-tax figures show, and as the published reports of companies show, their profits reached a point undreamt of in their rosiest moments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Vis-a-vis</i> that state of affairs, the old age pensioner is sentenced to continue to endeavour to exist on 10/- a week and the highly paid State official, with a bonus that will go up if butter goes up by one penny a pound, will earn a good living investigating into and nosing into every penny and every shilling that goes into that old age pensioner's house so as to ensure that whatever that old age pensioner may knock out, that old age pensioner, by hook or by crook, as far as the State can ensure it, will not have one farthing more than 16/- a week.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the fabulous fortunes that have been made in recent years, taking into account the extra millions that have rolled into the Department of Finance from those easy-made fortunes, in that set of circumstances, are we to be impressed by a parrot-like statement that the money is not available, that crushing taxation would have to be imposed, but that millions more are available for the Defence Forces, in peace times, than were available pre-war?</P>
    <P>As far as the amount asked for is concerned, the amount asked for is logically and mathematically calculated according to the increased cost of living.  The intention is to give those <Col N="2070" /> aged people at least the same standard of living as they had nine or ten years ago, to appeal to Parliament and to the Minister that the poor, semi-destitute standard of living that existed ten years ago should not be considerably worsened, that that bare standard of living should be maintained.  I do not think there is any denying that the cost of living, particularly in the case of people living alone or living with a small number, has more than doubled. If the cost of living has more than doubled, it would be necessary more than to double the pension in order to keep the recipients on the same poor scale of subsistence.</P>
    <P>The next claim made in this motion is that old age pensions should be given at the age of 65.  The State policy as to when a man or woman is unfit any longer to be of service and unfit any longer to be in receipt of salary is that it is at the age of 65.  Even with regard to people sitting at desks, people earning their living in sheltered occupations, not exposed to hardship, not exposed to the elements, professional men, civil servants and others, the State view is that at the age of 65 years, they are unfit for work.  That is the State view.  There is no sidestepping it.  When we come to the poor, when we come to the labouring man, the man working in the factory, on the roads, in the fields, the man who has to earn his livelihood exposed to all the hardships of the weather for 12 months in the year, is it not reasonable to assert that the same age limit should apply, that that man should be regarded as past his work and deserving of a rest and leisuré when he reaches the age of 65?  The intention behind the old age pension scheme all the time was to provide for the time when work ceases.  If there is any consistency about our outlook on matters of this kind, then I think there is a case, an unanswerable case, for giving the pension at the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>On the question of the means test, the motion asks that means less than £52 a year would not be reckoned.  Any of us could quote hundreds of speeches made by Deputies opposite, when they occupied this part of the House, each one of them more vehement than the <Col N="2071" /> other, urging that there should be no such thing as a means test in connection with old age pensions, that these pensions should be given at a certain age, that those who are well-to-do and provided freely with the world's gifts, would not draw the pension and that, in any case, if any of them did, it would go back again in income-tax. The objection was to any form of means test, knowing what it entailed, the prying into the private lives and homes of these poor aged people.  The motion before us asks that means less than £52 a year should not be taken into account.  If there is any honesty, if there is any consistency in the outlook of people opposite when dealing with perhaps the very poorest, certainly the most deserving, class of the community, namely, the very old, then they should honour, when they are in a position to honour, what they advocated when they were over here.  I certainly have no hesitation, on behalf of the people in this Party, in urging the Minister to consider sympathetically and very fully the advisability of allowing these pensions at the age of 65, the advisability of adopting the suggestion made here with regard to the means test.</P>
    <P>The best argument for that is the very drastically increased cost of living. What was a reasonable means test ten or 15 years ago is anything but reasonable to-day.  What was a reasonable pension ten or 15 years ago is anything but reasonable to-day.  In normal times, the headline set by the Government in this country in respect of the most highly-paid officials, drawing salaries up to £1,250 a year, is that they draw that salary irrespective of the cost of living; that if the cost of living goes up, the cost-of-living bonus goes up; if the cost of living goes down, the salary is not reduced, but the cost-of-living bonus is.  That is a very fair principle, but it is not reasonable to guarantee a person with £1,000 a year or more an increased allowance if the cost of living goes up one point or 50 points, and to deny any consideration along the same lines to these people of 70 years of age and upwards.</P>

      <P>I must first congratulate Deputy Alderman O'Sullivan, the mover of this motion, and Deputy Keyes, for the exhaustive manner in which they dealt with the motion.  They have in their speeches covered every aspect of the Old Age Pensions Act as it operates in the Twenty-Six Counties. They have proved conclusively, if proof were needed, that to-day the old age pensioner in this country is treated in the most shabby manner, worse than he is treated in Great Britain or the Colonies.  While I should like to elaborate on much that they have said, repetition does not carry much weight either with the House or with the Minister.  Reference has been made to the value of the £.  Comparisons have been made with conditions that obtained when 10/- would purchase 10/- worth.  To-day the £ has decreased in purchasing power and it is calculated that it is only worth 8/-.  The speakers, so far, have dealt with that aspect of the question and I do not want to elaborate on it.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Ceann Comhairle's permission to raise on the Adjournment the substance of a question which I had addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 14th February.  The grounds on which I based that application were that the answer that the Minister had given to me on the 14th February was not true.  It behoves me now to substantiate that statement.  Deputies are aware that considerable quantities of Jaffa oranges have recently arrived in this country.  Jaffa oranges are the produce of Palestine, exported from the port of Jaffa.  It is common knowledge that these oranges were imported by a firm well-established in the trade known as Messrs.  Connolly, Shaw and Company.  At column 956, Volume 99, No. 8, of the Official Reports, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is reported as saying to me:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Only one firm approached my Department for shipping facilities in respect of Jaffa oranges.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2073" /> I ask the House to note these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Equal facilities would, however, be granted to any other firm qualified to receive facilities and in a position to arrange supplies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a reasonable assumption that Messrs.  Connolly, Shaw approached the Department and got the facilities, which they availed of, to import the oranges.  I now direct the attention of the Minister and the House to the following letter from the Department of Industry and Commerce addressed to Messrs.  James Reilly, Sons and Company, Corporation Market, Dublin:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;S.214/1136.</P>
    <P>A Cháirde,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your letter of the 17th October regarding the importation of oranges.</P>
    <P>In reply I am to inform you that shipping space is allocated for the importation of oranges only to firms who in pre-war years imported supplies direct from abroad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that, having demonstrated that Messrs.  Reilly applied for facilities and were denied them, I have established the truth of my statement that the Minister's statement&mdash;that only one firm approached his Department for shipping facilities in respect of Jaffa oranges&mdash;was not true.  At least two firms: Messrs. Connolly, Shaw, who got them, and Messrs. James Reilly, Sons and Company, who did not get them, approached his Department.</P>
    <P>Now the facts of this transaction are as follows: In October, Messrs. James Reilly, Sons and Company, who have been in the fruit importing business for many years in this city, provisionally purchased 10,000 cases of Jaffa oranges for 18/- per case, f.o.b. Jaffa, contingent on getting the facilities from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which the importation of any merchandise to this country must have if the import is to be effected.  On 17th October, 1945, they wrote to the Minister for Supplies:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are in the position to obtain a supply of oranges to arrive here in December for Christmas trade. <Col N="2074" /> Kindly state can we go ahead with the importation arrangements?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 31st October, they addressed a reminder to the Department because they had received no reply to the first letter.  On the 1st November, they received the letter which I have already read to the House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In reply I am to inform you that shipping space is allocated for the importation of oranges only to firms who in pre-war years imported supplies direct from abroad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On December 11th they commissioned a firm of chartered accountants, the integrity of which is not challenged, to submit a certificate to the Department that in November, 1934, December, 1934, January, 1935, on four separate occasions; February, 1935, on two separate occasions, and March, 1935, on three separate occasions, they imported large quantities of Jaffa oranges from Palestine direct.  They were willing and anxious thereafter at all times to import oranges from the same source direct, but were prohibited from doing so by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because the Government had made the eggs-oranges agreement with Spain, under which it was agreed that while Spain was sending oranges here to pay for our export of eggs, it was inexpedient to permit Jaffa oranges to come in lest they should compete too strongly with the best Spain could produce.  Therefore, these people who, in the pre-war years, had been importing oranges direct from Jaffa, were at all times willing to continue to do so but for the fact that they were prevented by our own Government, in pursuance of the Spanish trade agreement, from carrying on normal trade, and as a result of the prohibition this firm suffered substantial loss about which they did not complain.</P>
    <P>That certificate being filed with the Department, the Department addressed to this firm on the 22nd December, under the same file number, the following letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to the recent interview which a member of your firm had with an official <Col N="2075" /> of this Department regarding the granting of facilities for the importation of oranges.  I am to inform you that the evidence submitted does not establish that you imported oranges direct from abroad in the years up to introduction of official control over shipping space in 1941.  The Minister regrets, therefore, that the facilities required by you cannot be granted.</P>
    <P>I am to return herewith the auditor's certificate submitted by you in support of your claims.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the House observe that the vital date for importing oranges has now changed?  It is no longer the importation of oranges in the years before the war.  It is now the importation of oranges in the years up to the introduction of official control over shipping space in 1941.</P>
    <P>Messrs.  Reilly replied on 7th January:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In reply to yours of the 22nd December, 1945, we would inform you that the submitting of auditor's certificate was in answer to your letter dated 1st November, 1945, and if same is not sufficient evidence that we imported oranges direct pre-war, kindly let us know what would be.</P>
    <P>Further to our interview with an official of your Department on 3rd inst., the suggestion that no record exists in your office relative to oranges and ourselves is an absurdity. We must ask you to institute a further inquiry and let us know what happened to all our expired and exhausted, licences which were duly returned to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 22nd January this firm received the following letter:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your letter of the 7th January and previous representations regarding the provision of shipping space for oranges.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the absence of evidence that you imported oranges direct from country of origin in the years immediately preceding the institution of control over shipping space in 1941, the Minister regrets that he <Col N="2076" /> cannot provide the shipping facilities you desire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 29th January, Messrs.  Reilly wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Replying to yours of the 22nd January, we would remind you that we first wrote to you concerning Jaffa oranges on the 17th October, 1945, and that during the past week a shipment of these oranges has been on sale here.  This is the first direct shipment of oranges from Palestine to this country on which we have not had a consignment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Up to that date, of every such shipment of Jaffa oranges which reached Éire from Palestine, part belonged to this firm.  I continue to quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The introduction of the Spanish trade pact caused a cessation of direct shipments from Palestine which, in itself, was a serious loss to us, and we consider that it is most unjust, now that trade in oranges with Palestine is resumed, that we are being denied the right to trade. It does not seem feasible now that such is the Minister's wish, and it is our intention to make our position made known to him.  Meanwhile, should a ship outside of the Maritime Control, out of which you are granting shipping space, become available to us for the transportation of oranges, can we use it for our purpose?</P>
    <P>On 6th February, they received the following reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to inform you that carriage of goods on foreign ships for Irish account from a port not situate in either this country or the United Kingdom to a port situate in or outside this country is prohibited save under licence issued by the Minister in accordance with the terms of Emergency Powers (No. 224) Order, 1942.  As facilities for the importation of oranges are provided only for firms who imported direct from country of origin in the years immediately preceding the institution of control over shipping space in 1941, the Minister regrets that he could not issue on your behalf a licence under the above-mentioned Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> That meant that that firm could neither bring oranges here on our ships nor resort to the expedient of the other firm&mdash;that of employing any foreign shipping available to bring oranges in here.  What I want to direct the special attention of the House to is that, in November, the vital qualification was the importation of fruit direct in pre-war years.  In December and January, the period of qualification was that immediately preceding 1941.  What had happened between these two dates?</P>
    <P>There is in Palestine a body known as the Palestine Citrus Board&mdash;a perfectly legitimate cartel, which seeks to control all supplies of citrus fruit in Palestine.  It has never yet succeeded in doing so.  Independent producers have continued to sell their produce not through the cartel but through their own agents.  That cartel is a mixed body of Arab interests and Jewish interests.  Their representatives in London communicated with a national of our country who, in the ordinary course of trade, had business discussions with them.  He was appointed, in the ordinary course of trade, as their patrone for transactions within the jurisdiction of Eire.  If I understand the term &ldquo;patrone&rdquo; correctly, it means that the person concerned becomes the agent of the Citrus Board and acts on their behalf.  The patrone in this case&mdash;I think it is only just and fair to say this without concealment or suggestion&mdash;was Deputy Briscoe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the facts, and the House is entitled to know them. The patrone of the Citrus Board, in pursuance of his arrangements, met the fruit trade.  So far as I know, Messrs. Connolly, Shaw were prepared to import the fruit on terms acceptable to the Citrus Board of Palestine.  I understand that a couple of other firms were approached with a view to ascertaining if their requirements could be met.  For one reason or another, they were not prepared to put up the credits that, in these uncertain times, many foreign merchants require before they are prepared to make a binding contract for any consignment.  The net result was that Messrs.  Connolly, Shaw, who were able to meet the requirements of the Citrus Board, contracted for a supply of oranges which, in due course, were shipped and delivered in Dublin.  On arrival here, I understand that the Minister for Industry and Commerce invited&mdash; whether he ordered or not, I cannot say &mdash;Messrs.  Connolly, Shaw to approach two firms who had not been in a position to make financial provision for direct shipments themselves, and offer them a part of the parcel which had come to hand.  I believe that that offer was made.  There were, however, other firms whose relations with Messrs. Connolly, Shaw, for various reasons, may not have been as cordial as the relations of those other firms.</P>
      <P>In business, misunderstandings occur between firms, as we all know, and some firms did not desire to be be holden to Messrs.  Connolly, Shaw. They would prefer to be utterly independent and to be allowed to make their own shipments.  Those firms were not vouchsafed the advantage of sharing in the parcel on shippers' terms and they found themselves relegated to the position of mere wholesalers, although they themselves had no retail customers.  They were constrained by custom of the trade to dispose of their fruit only to shopkeepers, which meant that firms like Messrs.  Reilly were deprived of their legitimate profit on their ordinary trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every citizen of this State ought to <Col N="2079" /> be entitled to equal treatment and there should be preference for none. If Messrs.  Reilly and Messrs.  Connolly, Shaw were both importing oranges from Palestine in the pre-war years, as per the Minister's letter, then Messrs. Connolly, Shaw and Messrs.  Reilly should have been offered identical facilities.  I certify, and I am prepared to demonstrate, that Messrs.  Reilly were in a position to make, with an independent producer with whom they were in touch, through a London broker, financial arrangements which would have enabled a shipment to be made direct to them from Palestine.  I assert that they were, <i>vis-a-vis</i> their intended supplier, in exactly the same position as Messrs.  Connolly, Shaw were <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Palestine Citrus Board.  It appears to me to be unjust, inequitable and wrong that one citizen of this State should have been given facilities which enabled Messrs.  Connolly, Shaw to bring their cargo to hand and to dispose of it at a legitimate profit in the Irish market, whereas another citizen of the State was denied those facilities and told expressly that they would not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to tell the House why it was that, in his letter of 1st November, the vital qualification was that firms should in pre-war years have imported supplies direct from abroad, and that, when evidence was brought to his attention that this firm did qualify under that condition, in his next letter of 22nd December, the nature of the qualification had suddenly altered and now applied to firms who had imported oranges direct immediately preceding the imposition of the control in 1941.  Some Deputies may wonder why it was that Messrs. Connolly, Shaw, who had been importing Palestine oranges during the period to which I have referred, were importing Spanish oranges thereafter, whereas Messrs.  Reilly, who had been importing Palestine oranges, ceased to import Spanish oranges.  Deputies might ask if this was not evidence that Messrs.  Reilly had given up the business of direct importation.  That presumption would be quite contrary to the facts.  The only inference to be <Col N="2080" /> drawn from the facts is that Messrs. Reilly did not want to import Spanish oranges but wanted to import Jaffa oranges.  Anybody acquainted with the trade knows that the quality of Jaffa oranges is superior to that of Spanish oranges.  As the Minister is entitled to 10 minutes in which to reply, I shall now conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that I shall be able to dispose very easily of any misunderstanding there may be in connection with this matter.  In the first place, I want to draw the attention of Deputy Dillon to the fact that he did not quote the whole of the reply I gave to his question on the 14th February last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I began that reply by pointing out that there are no restrictions on the importation of oranges into this country, and I added that at the present time, however, shipping and currency facilities are granted only to firms which imported oranges direct from the country of origin before the emergency. My statement, later, that only one firm approached my Department for shipping facilities in respect of Jaffa oranges, clearly related to the previous statement that facilities were granted only to firms which had imported oranges direct from the country of origin before the emergency. There is no restriction on the importation of oranges into this country. Those who import oranges, however, require, sometimes, currency facilities; sometimes, shipping facilities.  In the case of Jaffa oranges they require no currency facilities as these oranges can be purchased for sterling.  It is, therefore, only shipping facilities that they require, but because of the limited amount of shipping accommodation that we control, we have to confine that shipping accommodation to those firms which were previously engaged in the importation of any class of goods, and that applies to oranges.  Accordingly, facilities that we can grant in respect of the import of oranges are confined to firms which can show that they were engaged in the importation of oranges direct from the countries of origin prior to the war.  In that connection, I may say, that a large number of <Col N="2081" /> firms, which had imported oranges from Liverpool, have had to be excluded because of the fact that they did not import direct from the country of origin before the emergency, and these somewhat small firms were so numerous that proper control of shipping facilities could not be arranged on the basis of providing for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that one firm asked for facilities but did not get them.  I must say that I think Deputy Dillon might have had the courtesy to give me in advance the name of the firm, instead of forcing an examination of all the files of the Department in order to identify it.  However, I have the file before me now, and I can give the facts.  Now, I am not saying that Deputy Dillon was deliberately misleading the House when he made his statement.  I think that he was misled by the firm in question, but he certainly left me and, I think, the House, under the impression that correspondence with the firm began on the 1st September, 1945.  In case the Deputy is under any misapprehension, let me make it clear that, to the best of my recollection, I never heard of this firm until this evening, but, according to the file, the correspondence began on the 11th November, 1944, when the firm applied for facilities to import citrus foods from Spain and certain other goods from the Argentine.  They were informed on the 11th January that in order to have their applications considered they would have to supply a statement from their auditors showing their direct imports of citrus fruits, from countries of origin, during the years 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1940.  There was, therefore, no question of any change of policy as was suggested by Deputy Dillon.  The firm concerned were informed that they had to show, in respect of those years, that they imported oranges direct from countries of origin, and the fact is that they have not been able to show that they imported oranges direct from these countries, during those years.  Arising out of the trade agreement made with Spain in 1934, a quota for the importation of citrus fruits was arranged, but the Deputy did not mention that that arrangement ceased in 1937, and that, consequently, the years for which the <Col N="2082" /> information was asked were subsequent to the quota arrangement.  The only evidence that this firm supplied to my Department as to its direct importation of oranges was what they described as a copy of an auditor's statement furnished in 1935 showing the quantity of oranges imported by them in 1934.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the certificate which is dated the 11th December, 1945.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That certificate was only submitted in respect of oranges imported in 1934, the bulk of which came from Liverpool, but the firm supplied no evidence, no documentary evidence, that they imported directly from the country of origin since that time.  They could not even produce books showing their trade transactions in oranges, or any evidence that they had engaged in the importation of oranges directly from the country of origin since 1937.  The only thing I can say in regard to that firm is that if they can produce any documentary evidence now that in the years preceding the emergency, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940, they imported oranges direct from the country of origin, then they qualify for whatever facilities can be given, just the same as any other firm.  Let me say also that there is no discrimination against that particular firm.  A number of other firms applied for facilities, and were refused on the same ground.  If we were to decide on a different method of disqualification, such as importation in earlier years by firms, even though they went out of the business or did not import oranges in the subsequent years, it would be necessary to treat all alike and admit many firms which would qualify on that basis.</P>
      <P>On that question of Jaffa oranges, let me make the position clear.  A delegation went to Britain from the Palestine Citrus Fruit Exporters' Association to arrange for the disposal of their entire supply of Jaffa oranges. The Deputy, who was named here by Deputy Dillon, crossed over to London and interviewed that delegation with a view to arranging for the supply of a proportion of these oranges for this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a few minutes left, and I think the Deputy should not interrupt me.  In consequence of that interview the Palestine Citrus Fruit Exporters' Association agreed to supply oranges to this country and nominated Messrs.  Connolly, Shaw as their brokers.  They intimated that they wanted to deal with only one firm, and Messrs.  Connolly, Shaw is the largest in the business in this country.  I may say that I was not quite satisfied that only one firm should import the oranges in this case.  It is true that other firms are importing oranges from other countries.  However, I directed my officers to go to the firm concerned and say that I wanted the consignment divided in accordance with the agreed basis for allocation amongst those in the trade&mdash;25 per cent. for other firms and 75 per cent. for Connolly, Shaw, Ltd.  Some importers were not prepared to accept the risks which were involved as well as the profits, but they were offered an allocation of the oranges to be imported. I should like Deputies to understand that at the time the supply of these oranges was being arranged for, there was a belief that the market would be glutted and that the oranges would become unsaleable.  That did not happen, however.  As a matter of fact, there was sold in one week a quantity of oranges which would normally meet the demand for about three months.  The danger anticipated by brokers in December, 1945, therefore, did not emerge; but they had that fear and so they were not willing to take all the risks as well as the profits, but, as I have said, they did get an allocation of oranges on arrival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation with regard to shipping facilities is now easing, and I hope that that situation will end soon.  The United Maritime Association, which <Col N="2084" /> controls shipping at the present time, is due to end in the very near future. If it does end, presumably it will be possible for firms to negotiate for shipping outside that control.  They can then arrange for the importation of fruits, at least so far as Jaffa oranges are concerned, without reference to my Department.  There will be no longer any reason why firms should approach my Department for shipping facilities when they can go out and get these facilities on a commercial basis.  That is true in the case of Jaffa oranges, because the currency difficulty does not exist there.  In the case of Spanish or Brazilian or Argentine oranges there will still be the question of currency facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Palestine is concerned, there are no currency difficulties, and I hope that in the near future there will be no question of shipping difficulties, and that shipping facilities will be available to newcomers. However, so long as we have to restrict imports so far as the matter of shipping facilities is concerned, we shall have to confine it to firms which were importing before the emergency. It is, of course, desirable to get away from that basis as soon as possible, but I think it is desirable in the interest of existing firms not to let newcomers in until the situation reaches a normal position again.  However, I should like to say further, that so far as this particular firm, referred to by Deputy Dillon, is concerned, there is no indication on the file that they were engaged in the importation of oranges in the years between 1937 and 1941, and I can say to them that if they can produce any satisfactory documentary evidence that they engaged in importing oranges direct from the country of origin between 1937 and 1941, they will get the facilities.</P>
