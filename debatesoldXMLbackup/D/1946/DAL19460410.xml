      <P>No country publishes the texts of letters of credence presented by foreign envoys, and it would not be proper to do so without the express permission of the Government responsible for issuing the document.</P>
      <P>The form of letters of credence varies considerably according to the accrediting States and changes from time to time.  The substance of these documents is, however, fairly uniform. They all declare that the accrediting State, desiring to maintain friendly relations with the receiving State, has appointed a certain person as diplomatic representative.  The credentials go on to express the hope that the person appointed will be found agreeable, that he will perform his mission in a worthy manner, and that credence will be given to all his communications.</P>

It is safe to assume, however, that such services will not be less than in 1945.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the uneasiness in that area of County Donegal which is at present served by the Letterkenny-Burtonport Railway, arising from reports that this line is to be closed down in the near future; and whether, in consideration of the facts that road freight charges are higher than rail freight charges, and that the roads will have to be remade from their foundations to take the extra traffic, he will take steps to prevent the abandonment of the railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>On the application of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company I made an Order in 1940 authorising the company to terminate the service of trains on the Burtonport-Letterkenny railway line. The Order was made on the grounds that the permanent way was becoming unsafe, that the railway had been operating at a heavy loss, and that the company were in a position to provide adequate alternative services.  Subsequently, in view of the petrol shortage, a temporary arrangement was made to keep the line from Gweedore to Letterkenny open for goods traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> The company have recently represented to me that it is dangerous to continue to work the line having regard to its condition and to the difficulties involved in carrying out any effective repairs.  They propose to substitute road services at the scale of road rates. which is applicable to their services throughout County Donegal.  I have had the line inspected and the company's statement as to the risk of operation has been fully confirmed by the railway inspecting officer who reported the line to be in such condition as to make it unwise and unsafe to continue using it.</P>
    <P>Certain reports that the condition of the road was such that it was unfitted for the carriage of extra traffic have also been examined.  These reports were not well founded, and I am satisfied that the road, generally, is in reasonably good order.  In these circumstances, I do not propose to interfere with the railway company in the action which they propose to take.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is prepared to sanction the payment of housing subsidies to the Dublin Corporation, on the same lines as subsidies granted for slum clearance, should the corporation decide to house demobilised and other Army personnel and their families, who are forced to vacate official married quarters because of overcrowding or on retirement from the Army.</P>

      <P>Section 6 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, limits the payment of contributions to annual loan charges at the higher rate of 66? per cent. to loans borrowed by a local authority for the provision of houses for the accommodation of persons displaced by any operations of such local authority under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  I have no power to pay contributions at this rate in respect of houses provided for the accommodation of the classes of persons referred to by the Deputy.  The <Col N="1591" /> maximum contribution that could be made in such cases is 33? per cent.  In respect of each dwelling the contribution is of course subject to an overriding limit of cost which is prescribed by regulations.  These will be reviewed in connection with any revision of the assistance to be given to housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>As none of the public notices published by my Department since the strike of teachers in national schools in the Dublin City area began made any reference whatsoever to the strike, I assume the Deputy intends to refer to those notices, five in number, which gave particulars of the new scales of salary and other grants which had been offered to the teachers and which were published in the Dublin daily and evening papers and in one other paper. The accounts for these advertisements have not yet been presented but I understand that the total cost will be about £650.</P>
      <P>I should like to add that, while not in any way subscribing to the implication that a Department of State has not the fullest right to publish, by way of advertisement in the Press, information which the Minister in charge considers should be made known in the public interest, recourse to this method was only had in the present instance when it became clear that, because of other demands on their available space, there could be no guarantee that the newspapers would publish these notices in their entirety as news items.</P>

What guarantee have we that that sum will not be increased if the strike continues?  Does the Minister not consider that his statement in the Dáil on the question of teachers' salaries was sufficient without using <Col N="1594" /> the funds of his Department to that extent in connection with this matter?</P>

      <P>When speaking on this matter last night I pointed out that it was impossible to have sufficient land to satisfy the needs of all the uneconomic holders.  The land is not there.  Some Deputies seemed to take umbrage at that.  There are 152,000 so-called farmers under 15 acres in the country, and to give them farms of 30 acres each would involve over 4,000,000 acres of land.  Where are we to get that acreage?  I quite admit that the Mayo Deputies have a very definite case in respect of 12,395 hen-roosts&mdash;I can call them nothing else&mdash;in Mayo.</P>

      <P>We have seen some of these gentlemen from Mayo being shifted down to Meath, and recently one of them sold out in Gibbstown for £1,100 and two others have applications in to sell out at £1,000 each.  If I could go to 12,300 of my constituents in Cork and tell them I was going to make the Land Commission or the State hand over to them £12,000,000 worth of property, they would vote for me, too. The question is whether the four-acre farmers who were mentioned last night can be regarded as farmers at all.  One of the leaders of the Labour Party here, Deputy Larkin (Junior), described any man with less than 15 acres as a joke and Deputy Everett told me here in the House, when I alluded to farmers with under 30 acres, that they were not farmers at all but road workers. There are 242,000 of these fellows. Let us examine this in a sane way and see whether it is possible to call these people in the hen-roosts of four-acres in Mayo farmers at all.  I suggest it is not.  The point is whether these people deserve to be shifted.</P>

I do not believe there is any farm labourer in Cork County who would swop his job as a farm labourer to-day for any 30-acre or 20-acre farm put up by the Land Commission.  The Deputy said that if they got the land, they would work it.  I am giving a specific instance in the colony to which a lot of them were shifted from Mayo to County Meath a few years ago, and, as I say, one of them has now sold out for £1,100&mdash;he did not intend to work the old farm for too long&mdash;and two more have put in applications to the Land Commission to shift out at £1,000 each.</P>

There are something like 20,000 men in Cork County who have been in possession of a house and an acre of ground for 40 years and who have been working on the land for 40 years.  I hold that these men have a better claim to any land which is put up in Cork County than any migrant from any four-acre hen-roost anywhere.  There are these 12,000 people in County Mayo alone for whom the Minister has to make provision, <Col N="1600" /> and there are 34,000 in Connaught.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the position of these Mayo people, but I want to point out that there are 786 farmers with over 200 acres in Connaught. There are 2,700 with over 100 acres.  I do not know if we are to proceed on the basis of the suggestion made by Deputy Cafferky and Deputy Commons with regard to putting out every fellow with over 30 acres.</P>

Is Deputy Cafferky prepared to stand over the eviction from and taking over of the land of 30,000 farmers in Connaught? <Col N="1601" /> Is he prepared to say to these 30,000 farmers: &ldquo;Get out.

      <P>I take it no one suggests that Mayo should get all the land; that it is the only county which should be considered?  For instance, there are a few thousand farmers in <Col N="1602" /> Cork County of under 15 acres and they have a claim, too.  They are men who have been working on the land for the past 40 years, living in labourers' cottages on one acre and the valuation is about the same as in the Mayo hen-roosts of four acres. These men in Cork County should have a better claim than any other county.  Let us get down to business and see what the policy of the Land Commission is in regard to those things.  Are they going to find four million acres for division amongst farmers of under 15 acres?  If so, let them be frank and tell us where they are going to get it.  Secondly, who qualifies for land?  Does the man who is working on the land, as I pointed out, living in a cottage with an acre of ground, qualify more than the three-quarters fisherman, one quarter road-man, one quarter work-on-the-land man?</P>

Or the man who has been all his time working on the land as an agricultural labourer living on one acre of ground and a labourer's cottage?  Has he as good a title as the man with four acres who does not work on the land at all in reality? Does anyone here suggest he earns his livelihood on the four acres?  He generally works as a road worker or in some industry in the district, or as a fisherman or something else.  Which of the two has the better claim?  We want to know that.  This is a very serious problem which we want to have thrashed out.  Are we going to see migrants coming in from other counties as they came to Gibbstown in County Meath for so many years and realising now £1,000 a man and walking off with that £1,000 present per man <Col N="1603" /> from the State in their pockets?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made this question as plain as I can and do not intend to go further into it.  I want to take up a statement by Deputy Hughes in connection with the taking over of land by the Land Commission and the manner in which they used it during the emergency.  It was difficult to know what they could do.  The primary function of land here is to provide food for the people.  That is a dictum accepted by all Parties.  If there is an owner of land who has not done his duty during a period when no food could come into this country, it was the duty of the Land Commission or the Department of Agriculture to take over that land and see that it was tilled.  The Land Commission also had some thousands of acres on their hands during that period.  They were at least supposed to show an example as far as producing food on that land was concerned.  They had not the advantages possessed by ordinary farmers. First of all, regarding the fellow who did not till his land and let it be taken over, I have no sympathy for him.  He did not do his part in producing food and deserved what happened to him, which was not half enough.  As far as the land in possession of the Land Commission is concerned, we have another story.  There was roughly six years of an emergency period.  We all know that, if you take crops out of land year after year and do not put in fertilisers or farmyard manure, it is bound to deteriorate.  We also know that the Land Commission had got neither farmyard manure nor fertilisers for that land.  Where were they going to get it?  Was Deputy Hughes or Deputy Corry or any other farmer Deputy prepared to give up any portion of his quota of fertilisers to the Land Commission?  I am sure we were not.  That land undoubtedly deteriorated badly, but I am afraid we cannot lay responsibility for that on the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What prevented them from dividing it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The prevention of sub-dividing was largely caused&mdash;Deputy Hughes will pardon me&mdash;by the Deputy's action and that of other Deputies during the first two years of the emergency, in making excuses for men who were not doing their part in the tilling of the land.  Men had to be taken from the Land Commission and handed over as inspectors to other Departments, to see that farmers did their duty in tilling their proportion of land, so the inspectors were not there for the purpose of sub-dividing. Deputy Hughes knows that just as well as I do.  We have to face this frankly, as I have to face it.  I know what happened on a couple of estates in my constituency.  I know very well that that land is worth very little now. Any land where three or four crops are taken off in succession without anything being put into it is bound to deteriorate.  The Land Commission would have a problem in handling over that land.  I suggest that the ordinary method of fixing an annuity on the rates, as it were, and handling it over then, will not do, because that land will not pay for the rated annuity on it for at least three or four years after it has been handed over to the tenant owner. It will not pay him, because the body has gone out of it.  I suggest the Land Commission should tackle that problem early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend taking up the time of the House on this Vote at all, but when I heard the arguments put up by Deputies in connection with the claims of this person and that person for land, I had to intervene, on account of the knowledge I had of what was done with the land they got.  I admit that in many cases the Minister for Lands has a problem that I should not like to tackle.  I should not like in the morning to face the position of having 152,000 people, supposed to be farmers, living on holdings of under 15 acres per family, and to have to find additional land for these people.  The Minister has stated that he has 40,000 acres ready for division.  That amount of land would go only a very small way; it would satisfy very few of the 12,300 hen-roosters in County Mayo.  It would mean three acres a man, divided among the 12,300.  That would not take <Col N="1605" /> into account the claimants from the remaining 25 counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not 500 acres, and let me say that any man working for the Deputy would not swap his job for any 25 or 30 acres that the Land Commission would hand over; he would be a damn fool if he would, unless he could do, as some of the Mayo boys have done, sell out a week after getting the holding and clear away with £1,000 in his pocket.  However, this matter is too serious for joking.  We shall have to get down to business and I would like to hear from the Minister what the proposals of the Land Commission are with reference to the 152,000 so-called farmers with holdings under 15 acres.  The official Labour Party might call them that; they might say that the 15-acre farmers are only a -joke.  That was Deputy Larkin's statement here.</P>
      <P>The National Labour Party, speaking through Deputy Everett, said that any farmer with under 30 acres is not a farmer at all, he is only a road worker.  That is the statement he made when he was discussing holidays for farm labourers.  If any man with under 30 acres is not a farmer, what are the Land Commission doing, making 22-acre and 20-acre holdings?  If the Labour Party are right in saying that those men cannot claim to be farmers, why is that policy pursued? Even the Department of Agriculture, when they brought in the compulsory tillage scheme, did not recognise any farmer with under ten acres.</P>

      <P>The Deputy stated here yesterday that those people for whom he was speaking had only four acres of arable land.  He said there were <Col N="1606" /> two holders of four acres, one of five acres and one of three acres, all claimants for 37 acres from some unfortunate man whose farm will be split up among them.  One had a valuation of £2 5s. Od., another of £2 15s. Od. and a third with a valuation of £3&mdash; just the type of valuation that would be on a labourer's cottage and an acre in any other county.  Putting forward claims for such people for 1,000-acre farms in the County Meath, is surely a bit of a joke.  If there are Deputies here who are prepared to bolster up that type of claim, let them go ahead.  I should like a statement from the Minister on those matters.</P>

      <P>I look upon this Estimate as a very important one. Very little can be added to what was said here recently during the debate on the Land Bill.  I was very pleased to hear from Deputy Corry that the Minister mentioned he had 40,000 acres available for distribution among suitable applicants.  I think that will be very welcome news for people who, for some years past, have been waiting for the Land Commission to awaken from their slumbers.  As Deputy Corry pointed out, there are several small-holders, uneconomic holders, who are anxious for the Land Commission to resume their duties.  I am glad to see that a step is being taken in the right direction and that the Land Commission are resuming the division of some of the lands which they have listed and for which schemes have been prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe Deputy Everett was quite right when he stated that any citizen with a holding of less than 30 acres could not, in the real sense of the word, be described as a farmer.  It is impossible for any citizen, in any part of the country, to live on 30 acres, to rear his family, school them and educate them. He would have a miserable existence on 30 acres, simply because a portion had to be retained for grazing of live stock, and a portion for tillage, so that by the time the rent, rates and other demands were cleared off, he would find himself, at the end of the harvest, in debt.  Assuming that that man had five sons, he could only leave the land to one of them, and he would have a <Col N="1607" /> miserable existence on such a holding, while the other four would have to emigrate, or seek land elsewhere.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission is allotting land I believe they should not give less than 40 or 45 acres.  There is no use in giving small holdings to allottees, because it means that their position will be very little improved so far as getting a decent livelihood out of it is concerned.  I am strongly opposed to a practice that has grown up recently of allowing Englishmen to come over here and purchase large tracts of land.  I hope the Minister will take serious notice of it.  A great Leix man, Fintan Lalor, stated that the soil of Ireland belonged to the people of Ireland.  It is the duty of the Government to object to titled gentlemen coming here and putting money into large tracts of land in the Midlands.  They are not purchasing land in the interests of this nation, and they are not interested in the production of food for man or beast; they are simply gambling in land to see what they can get out of it.  The Government should take serious notice of Englishmen and aliens coming here and purchasing large tracts of land.</P>
    <P>If the Government were doing their duty, these large holdings would not be available to foreigners, who are depriving Irish citizens and small farmers of their rights in the division of such land.  Deputy Corry referred to the number of holdings in this country containing less than 15 acres. Would it not be to the advantage of the people on these 150,000 holdings if those Englishmen who have purchased large holdings were requested to go elsewhere so that they could be divided amongst uneconomic holders?  I am sure the Government realises that the Irish people are better entitled to that land than aliens who come here, not with the intention of producing more food but to gamble in land.</P>
    <P>Migrants have been the subject of debate in this House.  I represent a constituency in which there are several large ranches, and I will oppose in the strongest possible terms any people from the West coming to the Midlands <Col N="1608" /> to occupy farms there.  I hope the Department, when formulating schemes for the division of land in my constituency, will make every effort to make it available for local smallholders, landless men, cottage tenants and Old I.R.A. men.  It is most unfair to bring people from Mayo and Galway into districts where they will not have the goodwill of their neighbours who have a claim to any land available for division and who are fully equipped to work it.  I believe that that state of affairs has existed in certain parts of the country.</P>
    <P>When dividing land in the Edenderry district, where I understand the Land Commission have vested a number of farms for occupation at an early date, I hope the claims of the people of Rahin and Croghan will be considered. In order to avoid any trouble which might arise later, I strongly recommend that the fullest possible consideration be given to the claims of people in that area when they are suitable applicants and in a position to finance and work land.  In Killeshin, on the borders of Carlow, there are estates which have been the subject of agitation for many years.  These holdings have been allowed to change hands on numerous occasions, and the Land Commission has not taken any steps to acquire them.</P>
    <P>I would be obliged if the Minister would arrange to have these estates inspected and something done in the way of dividing them amongst local people.  There is suitable land also in the parishes of Arles, and Ballickmoyler, convenient to Carlow.  Deputy Norton was on a deputation with myself and others to the Minister last week in connection with the Kilmorney estate, convenient to Athy.  A certain amount of uneasiness has been created amongst people in that district because the Land Commission had had the estate on its books for a long period. The owners decided to sell recently, and as the local people had the land taken on conacre for years it was the sole means of livelihood of many of them.  Recently, an auctioneer from Athy called on them at midnight, and asked them to put down from £400 to £600 with which to purchase portion of <Col N="1609" /> the land, as otherwise it would be sold. It was impossible for them to comply with the request in the space of ten minutes, and, as a result, a local farmer who already has three farms and lives alone, Mr. James Owens of Ballyroe, purchased the estate.  I called on him with other local people and I asked him what business he had in butting in, seeing that his action was likely to prevent the land being divided amongst the local people.  He gave an undertaking that if the people wanted the land, he would not stand in their way.  When such an offer is made to the Land Commission by owners who are willing to sell, I cannot understand why undue delay should arise.  In another part of my constituency, in Durrow, a number of farms has been listed for acquisition, and the owners have written to the Land Commission to have them taken over.  The Land Commission appear to be slow in moving in that respect.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on this Estimate a year ago I criticised the Land Commission very severely for being subject to political influence in dividing land.  I do not know whether the strong words I used have borne fruit, but I am happy to say that two farms have been recently divided, and I am quite satisfied that no political influence was used.  I have conveyed to the officials the intimation that I am quite satisfied that in the dividing of these farms in my constituency the Land Commission have given land to the most deserving applicants, and on the merits, and that no political influence whatever was used.  A secretary of a local Fianna Fáil cumann was greatly disappointed that his son did not secure a farm on one estate.  I am fully satisfied that, although every effort was made to secure it for him by the local Fianna Fáil T.D.s, the commissioner, whoever he was&mdash;I never saw him&mdash;did his duty and did it well in the division of the Luttrell estate, quite convenient to the town of Stradbally.  It is about time that when estates are being divided they should be divided without political interference whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, has denied certain charges that I made in the <Col N="1610" /> House.  I think it was this time 12 months when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Surely, when we did not take Deputy Flanagan seriously seven years ago, when he was a Fianna Fáil secretary, we are not going to take him seriously to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I care not what the Minister thinks or does not think.  The Minister may claim to have a great record, but I have a record of good service to my constituents and in any recommendation that I make to the Land Commission I have to satisfy myself that the applicant will give the Land Commission every satisfaction before I recommend him, and I may tell the Minister and the Land Commission that I refuse to recommend as many applicants for land as I could recommend, simply because I believe they would not be successful if they did secure land.  As a Deputy, I refuse quite frankly to recommend them.</P>
    <P>Great charges were made in my absence by the Minister when he was referring to statements that I had made here about political influence being used in connection with land. He denied it.  My word is as good as the Minister's and I speak from experience. The Minister got the full and wholehearted support in his charges against me, in my absence, from one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies for my constituency not so long ago.  That Deputy knows as well as I do that political influence was used to secure land and the Minister knows that political influence was used to secure land. I was asked in this House to give proof that political influence was used. Would the Minister be surprised or astonished to learn that the Deputy who said that no political influence was used in land division, that is, Deputy Gorry, who stated that the Land Commission did their duty in a straightforward, in an upright and in a honest and sincere manner&mdash;they were the words used in this House when he was speaking on the Land Bill&mdash;did not tell the House that he secured the best part of the O'Shea estate in his area, that he handed over a swamp to the smallholders in the district and got the best of the land himself?  Surely it ought to be sufficient evidence of political <Col N="1611" /> influence, when we saw that it was the Minister's and the Land Commission's intention to cater first for the needs of the local Fianna Fáil T.D's. I am sorry that I had to make such a statement in the House but I only want to give the House ample proof that the statements I made were correct.  Any citizen who sees a Fianna Fáil T.D. getting the best portion of land in his area would come to the conclusion that political influence was used.  In connection with the same case, people from the area tell me that the Deputy had interviews with the Land Commission inspector concerned and that he handed over to the Land Commission a swamp and secured the best tract of the O'Shea estate, thus depriving citizens who were duly entitled to the land, as uneconomic holders, of securing a portion thereof. If there were any farmers' sons in the district who could be regarded as landless men, who would be in a position to work the land, I believe they should be the persons to get the best of the land, not a man who already was in occupation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be in a position to make the statement that in connection with any land that has been divided in my constituency within the past 12 months, no political influence was used and I hope that in future, when land is being divided it will be divided in the same manner and that political influence will be completely ignored.  I should like to see every man getting a fair crack of the whip, provided he came within the term, uneconomic holder, and would be suitable in the opinion of the Land Commission, irrespective of his <Col N="1612" /> political outlook.  On several occasions I have recommended my bitterest political opponents for tracts of land simply because I believed that if they got it they would be in a good way of living and were deserving and would work the land to the entire satisfaction of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission are now resuming land division and I wish them every success and good luck.  They have my wholehearted support and co-operation, at whatever value the Minister may estimate it.  I support him in every way and I am glad his report may be considered as fairly favourable.  I would ask him to introduce legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; which would empower him to deal with cases where farms are changing hands.  For instance, the Minister is well aware of the fact that when a farm is listed for land division, if the farm is sold, within the meaning of the Land Acts, there is nothing to prevent the Land Commission from negotiating with the purchaser as with the original owner.  In my constituency there have been cases where those who purchased the land divided it amongst themselves and proceeded to sell it to the highest bidder by public auction, thus excluding those who were not sufficiently financed.  I believe the Land Commission should prevent such sale of land, that is to say, it would not be sold in the best interests of the community but for the purpose of making a profit. In other words it would be gambling in land.  The Land Commission should not authorise subdivision in such cases because that is making it very difficult for the Land Commission to carry out their programme of land division.  I have had considerable experience of such cases in my constituency and the Minister's attention has been drawn to it.  Every effort should be made to prevent the new owners of large estates that have changed hands from selling the land out in small lots to the local people, making it more difficult for the Land Commission to discharge their duties when it comes to putting into operation a scheme for the division of the lands in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> I would ask the Minister to consider the position of the estates in all the Midland counties because I believe that in many areas there is very great congestion.  The Minister has before him the case of a number of very large estates convenient to the town of Birr. While there are large tracts of land in the area, there are cottage tenants and county council workers who have to graze their cow, if they are lucky enough to have one, on the high road. There is the case with which the Minister is very familiar, of an estate at Croghan, near Edenderry, where the owner has denied the cottage tenants their right to have any portion of it by conacre.  In cases where they had conacre for a year or two, he put them off it and they had to sell their cow or donkey because they could not graze it on the roads.  I think it is a disgraceful state of affairs.  Where you have smallholders doing the best they can to rear families and to eke out an existence on the land, every encouragement should be given to these people to remain on the land. I hope that sympathetic consideration will be given to such cases and I am sure that already the Minister has those cases under consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that there is very little use in giving an allottee, who has not the finances, 45 or 50 acres of land without some capital to work it.  I think that the Land Commission should have some scheme under which, if an applicant for land is considered suitable and is not in a financial position to work the land, they would advance him some money to start him, or assist him by providing implements for the working of the land.  Deputy Corry pointed out that people from the West who secured land had sold the land.  I believe that the reason they sold the land and the reason a lot of other people are selling the land is because of the rent, rates and taxes which they have to meet. I think they are doing a wise thing in selling it, because otherwise they would be in the workhouse and would lose the land anyway.  When allottees are given land, some scheme should be put into operation to put these people in a financial position to <Col N="1614" /> work the land.  If they are in a financial position to work the land, I am sure they will not give any trouble to the Land Commission or any other Department.  If funds were placed at the disposal of the Minister for Lands to allocate on loan to such people at low rates of interest and to be repayable with the annuity, I believe it would help them to work the land to the satisfaction of the Land Commission. There are lands which are not being tilled to the fullest productive capacity.  That is due to lack of capital.  I trust the Land Commission will see fit to formulate such a scheme whereby people who are suffering from lack of capital may be put into such a financial position that they will be able to work the land to the satisfaction of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he has 40,000 acres ready for division. That shows anyway that there is an improvement and that the Land Commission, which is a very big body and moves slowly, is beginning again to perform the duties for which it was established.  I hope that the Minister in presenting his Estimate next year will be able to report that he has even a greater acreage of land available for division.  I hope also that he will give consideration to the question of providing capital for those allottees who want it, because, as I pointed out, it is impossible for any allottee to work the land properly if he is not in a financial position to do so.  I know a few of them, such as those who are going to be victimised by the Land Bill recently passed here and are going to be deprived of their holdings.  There would be no need for the drastic action proposed under the Land Bill and the removal of these people from their holdings if the Government had put them in a financial position to work their holdings.  They were not in a position to purchase live stock. They could not purchase horses to do their farm work owing to the enormous prices prevailing.  It was impossible for them to get agricultural machinery in a great many areas.  Even if it were available, it was impossible for them to purchase the machinery.  All that was due to lack of capital.</P>
    <P>I know small farmers and people <Col N="1615" /> who secured land from the Land Commission who are put to the pin of their collar to meet the demands on them. They find it impossible to employ labour because they are not in a position to pay the wages set out by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The agricultural workers are entitled to these wages which, according to the law, farmers have to pay them.  If the farmers were in a position to pay, if their farms were turning over a profit, there would be no need for any compulsion to make them pay the standard rate of wages.  Farmers in the Midlands are only too anxious and willing to pay the highest wages possible to those engaged in the important work of food production.  But, as the old saying goes, you cannot get blood out of a turnip.  We cannot get money out of the agricultural industry unless there is some way of putting it into it first.  As I say, there should be some scheme to assist people who secure land to stock that land, to furnish their houses, and to procure agricultural machinery.  If a genuine case is put up to the Government, sympathetic consideration should be given to it. Such persons should be given every help and every financial consideration by the Government to assist them in carrying out the important work on the land.</P>
    <P>If encouragement were given in that way, I believe that many of our young men who are neglecting land, or who are fleeing from rural Ireland to get positions in malthouses and factories in the cities and towns, or trying to get to England to earn a living, would have no reason for leaving the land and that the question of emigration would not arise.  Leaving out the cities and towns, I believe that over 170,000 young men from the rural districts have emigrated. I think that a great deal of that could have been avoided if the Land Commission had in operation the schemes of land division which they had to curtail during the emergency period.  If encouragement were given to the young people by providing them with a holding of 40 acres, or not less than 30 acres, as Deputy Everett pointed out, these people would be only too anxious to <Col N="1616" /> remain at home and work on the land. Every man who leaves the land is a loss to the community.  I know that the Government have been considering this matter very seriously but, unfortunately, without successful results so far.</P>
    <P>I hope that the future policy of the Land Commission will be to give portions of land to uneconomic holders in order to make their holdings economic, and in order that these people will be in a position to live decently on the land and to discharge their obligations. There is very little encouragement being given to farmers' sons to remain on the land and I trust the Minister will do the best he can to make life in rural Ireland more attractive by embarking on large schemes of land division and by establishing as many families as possible on these large estates.  I trust he will also give some consideration to the matter of financing those who are unable to carry on and who will eventually have to dispose of their holdings, either by surrendering them to the Land Commission or selling them.  Otherwise, the Land Commission will have the job of taking them over and putting them up for sale. If these people are not in a sound financial position, in a condition in which they are able to work the land properly, they cannot be described as farmers.  Their life is one of misery and they live from hand to mouth.  I trust the Minister will do something about it and that a scheme for financing those people whom the Land Commission regard as suitable and deserving citizens to place on holdings will be devised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate but for a speech made by a colleague of mine on these benches, Deputy Corry.  I wish emphatically to dissociate myself from the references he made to the congests in the West of Ireland.  There are congests in Galway and in Mayo, and the foundation of the Land Act of 1903 and of every subsequent Land Act was the relief of these people.  I am not so foolish as to pretend that if all the land available in the country were taken over, it would bring a full <Col N="1617" /> measure of relief, but what it certainly would do is to ease the problem considerably.  All I am sorry for&mdash;and I am sure it is a matter of regret to every colleague of mine from the West of Ireland&mdash;is that progress in that respect has not been much more rapid.</P>
      <P>The first Land Act for the acquisition and division of land was passed by a foreign parliament, under pressure, of course, from our representatives in that parliament and from the people of this country in 1903.  A period of 43 years is a long time in which to deal with the problem, and I would be much more happy in standing up here on the Land Commission Vote if the acquisition and division problem had been settled and if we had only to debate the question of rearrangement and revesting.  I quite agree with the Minister that the problem of rearrangement is a very pressing problem and that it is also a very slow procedure, but I do not think that revesting can be placed in the same category as the acquisition and division of land.  It is not nearly so important.  People who have holdings and who are still unvested are in the happy position that they have at least good, or fairly good, holdings, and if they are not, in the strict sense, the legal owners or legal purchasers of their holdings, it does not make very much difference.  Some people may argue that the fact that they are not vested deprives them of certain privileges in that they are not able to get credit on the security of their holdings, but I hold that the industrious, hard-working farmer is credit-worthy, no matter what the tenure by which he holds his land, and, while it may be a pressing problem, I want to submit to the Minister that it is nothing like as important as the acquisition and division of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite understand the difficulties in the way of the Land Commission arising out of the emergency, and while the lack of materials for building purposes is a very big consideration, there is an equally big consideration which makes it difficult for them, save in cases in which land is offered voluntarily, to negotiate for the acquisition of land, that is, the <Col N="1618" /> inflated price of land at the moment. We all know that if land is purchased by the Land Commission, the owner has the right of appeal to the price-fixing tribunal and that they will relate the price to be paid by the Land Commission very closely to the existing market value.  Consequently, when the Land Commission are allotting that land, they have to proceed on that basis.  They have to take improvements and so on into consideration and to fix what would be the normal rent or annuity.  When the land is purchased at an inflated price, undoubtedly an inflated annuity must be placed upon it, and even though that annuity is halved as a result of the 1933 Land Act, in normal times it is still fairly high, while, at the same time, a very large burden, much larger than should be passed on, is passed on to the taxpaying community.  I am sure these are the two main reasons, or should be the two main reasons, for the slowing down in the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>There is one matter on which I should like to have information.  The peak period of land division since the passing of the 1933 Land Act was in the years ending 31st March, 1935, and 31st March, 1936.  In each of these years, over 100,000 acres of land were divided. There was no war situation in 1937, 1938 or 1939, and I should like to know the reason for the slowing down.  Was it that the number of inspectorate staff were changed over to rearrangement, and, if so, was there a great speeding-up in rearrangement in the years 1937, 1938 and 1939 as compared with the years 1934 and 1935?  I think that is a fair question to ask, when I know that the number of staff were not decreased in any way and that the Government were prepared to make provision, and had made provision, to make available sufficient money to keep up the pace set in the years 1935 and 1936.  When the emergency came, I know that a considerable number of the staff were taken over by other Departments, but, at the same time, there was a fairly large staff there all the time, and there was a good deal of useful work other than land acquisition and division which could have been proceeded with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> One of the faults I find with the Land Commission&mdash;it is a fault which has existed for a very long number of years&mdash;is that when an estate is taken over and allotted, improvement works are carried out, but in many instances a sufficient estimate was never given or made available to complete the improvement works, with the result that many very necessary improvements still remain to be carried out on many estates divided several years ago by the Land Commission.  This is particularly true of turbary.  Where people were given holdings, turbary was promised in some cases, but although the bog was available, it has never been given to the people since.  In other cases, the bog was allotted and roads and drains were marked out, but neither roads nor drains have ever been made and the bog is deserted because the people to whom the bog was allotted could not avail of it, with the result that they have to pay a very high price for domestic fuel That is one of the things which should have proceeded apace and the staff was not big enough to deal with them.  The maps were there and they need not look for men with very high academic qualifications.  So long as they had the maps, they could get good practical men, such as supervisor gangers, to carry out the work.  It has not been carried out as rapidly as it should have been.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, when it comes to the question of turbary, turbary is given far too cheaply to the allottees, in my opinion.  A man gets four, five or six perches of a face bank of turbary and, even with a normal rent fixed on it, it is not £1 a year.  That could be trebled if the proper improvements were carried out and the increase would help to pay for proper drainage and roads into the holdings.  During the emergency period, plans should have been prepared for resuming the normal activities of the Land Commission at an accelerated speed in the post-war period.  The congestion problem is still very acute in the West of Ireland and, while I do not hold it ever can be completely relieved, it can be considerably eased.  I know of instances where land was taken over during the emergency, <Col N="1620" /> but because of certain restrictions no division was carried out, even to extend the holdings of the adjoining congests.  That also could have been attended to.  I do not intend to mention any specific cases, but I know that in County Galway there were congests adjoining an estate taken over by the Land Commission and it was still left to the owner.  He had to carry out the tillage on it by putting it up for auction and get the highest possible price for it.  The adjoining congests, who were not able to give that high price, had to travel several miles in order to get tillage.  That could have been solved easily had they been given the portion of that land to which they were entitled and which would have brought their holdings to an economic standard.  I hold there should have been staff enough to deal with that part of the work, in any case.</P>
    <P>So far as the West is concerned, I am sure the Minister will admit that 43 years is a very long time to be dealing with the acquisition and division of land.  There should be a time limit set for the work of acquisition and division west of the Shannon and it should be settled once and for all. There are some very large areas of land west of the Shannon, particularly in my constituency, and in dealing with them the Land Commission should take into consideration those who have large areas and who, in order to comply with the compulsory tillage scheme, had to set that land by auction during the emergency.  That is a clear indication that those people have more land than they are capable of working.  I do not want to fix any figure as to the maximum holding, but in the West of Ireland and Connacht generally, any person who has 150 acres of fairly good land can be regarded as in a fairly independent position as a reasonably big farmer.  Anyone with land in excess of that, save in very few instances, has much more than he is capable of managing and working properly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred to the hen-roost farmers of £4 valuation in Mayo, but he should not forget that those people clung on to their hen-roosts and it is a good job for the Irish nation that they did cling on to them.  There <Col N="1621" /> were attempts made, both by intimidation and inducement to get them out of it, but they still clung on to them. Despite the fact that legislation was passed to enable them to improve their lot, are they still going to be left in the wilderness?  I am sure that is not Fianna Fáil policy and I am sorry that Deputy Corry should have taken that line.  I hope he has no such ideas in his mind.  After all, they clung on to that land under immense difficulties. Even though the Land Commission would not be capable of giving them all 30-acre or 25-acre holdings, their lot would be considerably improved. Although I believe a fair-sized holding is necessary in present circumstances, if we develop our industries the time may arrive when a very much smaller holding would give an equally high standard of living.  That is what should be aimed at.  If it is not capable of giving that standard here, how is it that it was capable of giving such a high standard to the people of Denmark, many of whom have holdings under 15 acres?</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan, of course, resents any congest from the West of Ireland coming into the Midlands.  He is one of those people who puts very awkward questions here sometimes to the Minister for External Affairs and one of the people, I am sure, who talks a lot outside about our failure to undo Partition; but he wants to create 32 more partitions, in addition to the one we have, by trying to create a barrier of ill-will against the congests from the West being brought back, in many instances to the land from which they were driven.  I stand for settling the local congests first; but when there is land available outside the needs of local congests&mdash;and in this I am supported by the Deputies of all Parties who are interested in the best possible solution of the land problem&mdash;then other congests living in slums in the West, the South and the North of Ireland are quite acceptable and will be regarded as Irishmen and not merely as strangers because they cross a county boundary line.</P>
    <P>There are some large tracts of land which the Land Commission inspects on some occasions, and I fear that they <Col N="1622" /> come to a decision not to acquire them on the ground that the land is inferior. I hold if it is inferior for acquisition for the purpose of land division, it might be quite suitable for afforestation. As far as the West of Ireland is concerned, with the schemes that have been initiated and put into operation as a result of Government policy for the reclamation and improvement of land, I suggest that land should be of a very inferior type before the Land Commission refuse to take it over. The people I have in mind, the congests and those others, would be very glad to get a fair holding of it and, by their sweat and labour, I guarantee they will reclaim it just as they have reclaimed some of the patches they have already. I think land should not be turned down in that way.</P>
    <P>Another thing that I think undesirable is, when the Land Commission take over a tract of land on which there is a mansion, that mansion should not be handed over for somebody to tear it down and sell the slates and timber.  If there is profit in it for the individual, the profit should be equally there for the Land Commission, and they should have people competent enough to demolish such mansions and hold on to the land and divide it.  As to cases where a scheme is prepared, I have one particular case in mind in County Galway, where a scheme was prepared about seven or eight years ago.  The scheme was on the lines that the people in a certain area, on barren land, were to be migrated into new holdings and any bit of good land in their old holding was to be left to them, the remainder to go to the Forestry Branch.  For some reason that I cannot understand, the Forestry Branch has refused to take over that land, even though that is the only solution of the congested problem there.  In my opinion, no more suitable scheme could be prepared than the one that was prepared to relieve those people.  I think there should be a better understanding between the two sections of the one Department in matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is not the intention of the Minister for Lands, or the Government, to pay much attention to the <Col N="1623" /> ideas propounded by Deputy Corry, or Deputy Flanagan either.  If they do, as far as I am concerned, the day that happens they can have both these gentlemen, but I am one they will not have.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I have to protest against the statement made by Deputy Corry.  I suppose Deputy Corry is to be excused when he talks about the people of the West of Ireland and refers to them as hen-roosters and that class of thing.  I excuse him for his ignorance because he does not realise who these people are or where they came from.  Perhaps some of them came from the county the Deputy represents.  When Cromwell came with his crowbar brigade, in days gone by, and drove the ancestors of those people into the West, when he said: &ldquo;To hell or to Connaught&rdquo;, those people had to go to the bogs or to Connaught.  I suppose they thought it a little better than hell.  It is not much better, I regret to say.  The position of those people is very bad. The Land Commission have completely ignored them and it is no wonder when you have a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, such as Deputy Corry, referring here to them as hen-roosters.</P>

      <P>He has asked the Minister to say are the hen-roosters to remain on as they always did.  Are the very people who upheld the nationality of this country, the people who held the language for this country, the people who went out to the mountains, whose ancestors gave their blood, blood which was spilt in the grass of this country for the sake of the nation, still to be the hen-roosters? Are we still to know them as labourers or farmers, or as spalpeens or beggarmen?  That is the idea that Deputy Corry has put forward.  That is his view.  I do not believe it is the view of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is not the view of Deputy Beegan.  It is not the view <Col N="1625" /> of the men I knew when I believed Fianna Fáil was right.  I do not believe it is the view of five per cent of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party. These men are often spoken of as failures.  It has been stated that at least one of them in Gibbstown had to sell out, at £1,000, the land he got.  Surely in every walk of life we find a failure? Deputy Giles who is no great lover of the people from the West of Ireland, any more than Deputy Flanagan, admitted that in the main these people were a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Giles admitted that the remainder of the migrants are a success.  It is well known that they have been a success. I resent what Deputy Corry said, that because one man had to sell out the whole thing was a failure.  Of course Deputy Corry wanted to get a lash at the South Mayo people, but the answer that the people of South Mayo gave was given on account of the way the Land Commission had carried on there.  Time will prove that that feeling will expand in the West of Ireland. I hate to have to make these statements. Let me point out that if Deputy Corry thinks this country is depending on the shoulders of lords and ladies, graziers or grabbers, he is making a grave mistake, because that crowd was imported, and if our people, or as he calls them, the hen-roosters of Galway, Mayo and Kerry do not count, he is making the greatest mistake he ever made.  The people will cling on and live here as they did in the past.  They will do it for love of Ireland and will keep on with their efforts to improve their conditions.  I regret to have to speak in this strain, but I was compelled to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to hear it stated that 40,000 acres are to be divided, and that it is hoped the division will be made soon.  In my constituency certain land has been in the hands of the Land Commission for many years.  I do not know why it is not being divided, seeing that there is no need to build new houses there.  Within a mile of the place to <Col N="1626" /> which I refer there are uneconomic holders who have been waiting for land.  I ask the Minister to give it to them as soon as possible.  I wish to point out that these lands have been cessed for tillage for the past three or four years by the Land Commission.  I do not object to that.  When land is given to people it is often in bad heart. Generally those who get land which is divided are not wealthy, and for that reason some consideration should be given to them in the way of a grant for artificial manures or something like that so that they might bring it into heart again.  I am sure the Minister and everybody who knows anything about land realise that when three or four corn crops are taken off land, it is practically pauperised.  When those who have it are not wealthy, and are not in a position to put heart back into it their position for many years will not be improved.</P>
    <P>Many statements have been made as to what is a reasonable holding of land. As one who has to depend on land, my belief is that to put a man into a holding of less than 30 Irish acres is putting him in to face starvation.  To give a man a smaller holding means that he will be living, to use Deputy Corry's words, as if he were a hen-rooster.</P>
    <P>It has sometimes happened in my area that additional land is given, but at a distance of two or three miles from where the tenant is living.  I think that is a great mistake.  An addition of seven or eight acres of land to an uneconomic holder, three miles away from where he lives is, I am afraid, of no use to him.  Naturally he will not refuse to take the land, seeing that he has been looking for it all his life, but his time is wasted going and coming to look after it and eventually he has to sell it.  I believe that a mile radius should be the limit.  What should be done in such a case is that a man should be taken from a congested district and the holding divided amongst those in the immediate vicinity.</P>
    <P>Coming from the county of Galway and not being ashamed of it.  I have had to go to the Land Commission on several occasions during the year in <Col N="1627" /> connection with many knotty subjects. I should like to take this opportunity to say that the officials were most courteous and helped in every way to do the best they could for me.  I must say that in all fairness to the officials of the Land Commission, both in the office, as well as the inspectors in Galway and in the West of Ireland. They helped in every way they could. There was one special matter in my area, which I brought before the Land Commission and before Mr. Kelly, the inspector in Galway, which I find it necessary to refer to it on this Vote. A huge bog on the Redington estate was taken over at Kilbannon by the old Congested Districts Board.  It was known as the Red Bog.  Tenants in the area got a division but tenants on the adjoining Dick estate and the Lune estate, the landlords of which would not give turbary, made application to the Congested Districts Board and were allowed in when the other bog was divided.  Later on, under a native Government, the Dick and the Lune estates were bought and, as a result, the tenants who were brought from the Redington estate got the share they were entitled to on their own estates.  Now the tenants on the Redington estate have objected and have more or less said to the outside tenants, &ldquo;You have got bog on your own estates and why should not this bog be the property of the tenants on the Redington estate?&rdquo;  The Land Commission say it is now part of the holdings of those people but it is very unfair to the tenants on the Redington estate that they should be put in that position.  The position is that the tenants have said that outside tenants have bog portions on their own estates and, since the days of the Congested Districts Board, they have been given plots in this estate, with the result that the tenants on the Redington estate have been put out.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not it is in order on this Estimate to refer to that matter, but I would ask the Minister to give it his serious consideration. I certainly protest against the statements made by Deputy Corry, and I was delighted to hear Deputy Beegan, <Col N="1628" /> a member of his own Party, objecting to and protesting against such statements. It would be well, once and for all, that we should put our foot down on such things.  If sections of our people, the people who have that real blood in them, have been downtrodden and if we have failed in our duty for 20 years to help them as we should have done, the least we may do is not to speak disrespectfully of them.  I am more than grateful to the officials of the Land Commission for the manner in which they helped in any case I put before them during the year.</P>

    <P>I am very glad that Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Giles are agreed that the migrants are a success.  It is a great day for Ireland that the two Deputies are of the one mind that these men have made a success of their holdings in Rathcarne and in Gibbstown. The Minister has stated that he has 40,000 acres of land for distribution and that he is going to devote it to migrants.  I do suggest that he should examine the position in these two colonies.  He will find that a number of young men, farmers' sons, have got married and that a new congestion has been created there.  I suggest that he should take them into consideration when he is allocating farms in County Meath, a county I have the honour to represent.  In the debate on the Land Bill I spoke about the success that these people have been in Gibbstown and in Rathcarne.  I pointed out that, since the war, a fleet of lorries leaves every day with potatoes and other farm produce for the Dublin market.  I indicated that the hard work and industry of these people in the Gaeltacht have brought wealth and abundance <Col N="1629" /> to Gibbstown and Rathcarne. The married sons of these farmers have proved themselves worthy claimants in any future scheme of land division in County Meath and I suggest to the Minister that when he has his migration policy on foot he should take into account the claims of those who are on the spot.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Minister should consider the extension of the cow-park scheme.  The cow-park scheme in Westmeath has been a complete success. I cannot tell off-hand the number of cow-parks in the county operated by the county council but I suppose I would err on the conservative side if I said there were 12.  The nearer they are to the towns the greater success they are.  The poor man can have his cow, his calf, his ass and his pony in these cow-parks at a very small fee. The Westmeath County Council, by resolution, and other councils have asked that wherever there is an estate divided near a town portion of the land should be set aside for a cow-park and, further, where there is no estate in the vicinity of the town, a farm should be acquired for the purpose.  No better thing could be done.  They have proved a success, except where the cow-park has been established in a remote area, such as the cow-park which was established about 12 miles from Moate, of which no one was availing because all their requirements were met in land division.  Nothing but dry cattle were being put on this cow-park, with the result that the county council had to appeal to the Land Commission to remove that cow-park.  That should not damn the scheme.  Where the cow-parks are established near towns or villages, at Killucan, Delvin and other places, they are a complete success. The Westmeath County Council and the General Council of County Councils have advocated the continuance of the policy of establishing cow-parks and I advocate it here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan referred to the neglect of work on the part of the Land Commission in years past.  Under the 1903 Act they divided an estate; they started to make a road into it but they did not complete it.  Deputy Beegan urged the completion of the work and <Col N="1630" /> I second him in that.  The same applies to turbary.  In relation to the question of turbary, for years I have asked for a list of the allottees on certain estates who got turbary.  I have been refused. I have been told that it is not the policy of the Land Commission to give such lists.  There should be a reversal of that policy.  What has happened in my locality has proved that I am right and that the Land Commission are wrong.  On the Wilson estate, a huge tract of bog was divided.  I think some people got an acre of bog.  During the emergency, for the last six or seven years, the allottees have gone into competition with people in the towns. They have built up turf banks and knocked the poor people out.  They have cut, not only for their own use, but for commercial purposes.  They were put out from one bog on the Clonturk estate and the result was that last year some of them went to this bog on the Wilson estate and began cutting the virgin bog that they had left intact for the last five or six years.  I think it is in the national interest that the Land Commission should reveal who are the allottees on that virgin bog which has remained practically intact since the emergency, while other bogs are being cut away.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan also referred to the acquisition of estates and set a headline for estates on which no tillage was done and on which the Department of Agriculture had to enter for the last seven years.  I second him in that suggestion also.  There are a number of estates south and west of Mullingar on which the inspectors of the Department of Agriculture had to enter year after year and on which they are entering this spring to do the tillage which should be done.  Some of the owners are non-residential.  A few of them have had influence for the last 20 years and have resisted all attempts to acquire and divide the land.  I advocate in the post-emergency period the immediate acquisition and division of these estates.</P>
    <P>I asked a question in the Dáil to-day about a certain allocation of land and got a reply from the Minister. I am not going to throw any bouquets at the inspectors and staff of the Land <Col N="1631" /> Commission, because I never got a fair crack of the whip from them.  So far as I am concerned, and I have a right to speak here as a Deputy without being personal, their attitude seems to be that whenever I advocate a thing which appears to be just, they do the opposite.  There should be one rule in connection with the division of lands in the Midlands.  If they give a holding to a person in the Midlands, no matter who he may be, they should not translate him in a few years to another holding.  If they peg out an Old I.R.A. man out of his holding, they should not take somebody else and give him an exchange of holding within a period of a few years.  No matter what his politics are, there should be a fair crack of the whip for the ordinary man in the street.  There should not be one rule for a few favoured individuals in the Midlands and another rule for &ldquo;Paddy from Ireland&rdquo;.  The sooner the Land Commission establish fairness and equity in their dealings with people in the Midlands, the better.</P>

      <P>The Minister finished up his introductory statement by introducing a bone of contention when he referred to the reduction of outstanding arrears as a proof of prosperity. Deputy McMenamin was inclined to contest that matter with the Minister and to assert that the £350,000 outstanding is a proof of considerable destitution amongst the agricultural community.  I do not think either view is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is a more contentious bone than I thought it was. I shall leave it at that.  I hold that these figures, which show a considerable reduction in the amount of arrears outstanding, do not disclose any condition of prosperity amongst the agricultural community.  They certainly disclose that the farming community are honest and upright and, when they get a reasonable chance, that they endeavour to meet their liabilities to the best of their ability. That is what they are doing.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which the Minister referred was the 40,000 acres of land which he has on hands at present. I hope Deputy McMenamin will not be offended&mdash;I think we would want to be very careful about what Deputy McMenamin says&mdash;when I say that he was rather suggesting that the Minister for Lands was guilty of bad husbandry in regard to a large amount of that land.  I am inclined to agree with that viewpoint.  Bad husbandry is perhaps a term which it is difficult to define.  Sometime ago I happened to slip into a public-house in the city to buy a box of matches and I heard two aged ladies discussing the news.  One said: &ldquo;I see where a farmer has been sentenced to three months for bad husbandry.&rdquo; The other said: &ldquo;It serves him right.  Wait until I write to the Government and tell them about my husband.&rdquo;  Now that the legal gentlemen have got after the Minister for Lands, I hope that they will not be able to convict him of bad husbandry. I hope the wise and prudent advice given to him from all sides of the House will be taken, namely, to get this land off his hands at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reasonable excuse for the long delays which take place in regard to the allocation of land in the hands of the Land Commission.  It takes years and years to find suitable allottees for the various estates which they are called upon to divide.  It seems to me that the inspectors keep running round and round in circles until they eventually come to the right applicant. I think it is only a matter of luck, because, after all, there are in <Col N="1633" /> every district a large number of people who are more or less suitable and it is very difficult to find the best possible person.  I think that no useful purpose is served by chasing round from one to the other and hearing the stories that one applicant tells about another.  That only makes for delay and confusion and also creates a certain amount of bitterness.</P>
    <P>There is another small matter which I raised last year.  It is a matter which causes a considerable amount of contention amongst a small number of tenants under the Land Commission, and that is the liability for tithe rents. It is about time that tithe rents were abolished.  They are not collected for the purpose for which they were originally intended and we know that the main function of the Land Commission, in regard to the collection of money, is to collect from the tenant-purchasers the necessary money to repay the purchase money on the holdings. I do not know whether these tithe rents come within that category. They are not utilised for the repayment of bond holders, but for various other purposes.  I fail to see why a limited number of tenant-purchasers should be subject to this imposition which is a source of very considerable grievance in certain areas.  It is not very widespread and because it is not very widespread, it is a problem which should be tackled and solved.</P>
    <P>There is another small section who, I think, have not derived the full benefit of the Land Purchase Acts to which they are entitled.  I refer to yearly tenants, tenants who hold their land under lease.  There are a good number of such tenants throughout the country, and in most cases they have made application to the Land Commission for an extension to them of the benefits of the Land Acts, and I think it is a matter which should be speeded up.  There is another aspect of that matter which recently came to my notice, that is, the position of such tenants when they are economic holders in relation to land which may be divided in their areas.  Are such persons entitled to allotments from the Land Commission or to parcels of land to increase their holdings as if <Col N="1634" /> they were actually tenants of the Land Commission?  That is a question which ought to be cleared up.  It is a matter which does require attention.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Book of Estimates that there are 60 temporary inspectors, and, as a matter of curiosity, I should like to know what is the purpose of such a large number of temporary inspectors.  One would imagine, even from listening to this debate, that there is so much work lying ahead of the Land Commission that no official should be in a temporary position. There seems to be a lifetime of work lying ahead of practically the entire staff.  Some claim that the Land Commission is understaffed and some suggest that it is overstaffed, and as a result they are getting in each other's way, but in an efficiently run Department practically all the officials of importance should be permanent.</P>
    <P>One question which was dealt with, and rightly so, at very considerable length during this debate is the general policy of the Land Commission with regard to the acquisition and distribution of land.  Deputy Corry, I think, was somewhat unwise in referring practically to the entire population of the western seaboard as &ldquo;hen-roosters&rdquo; and I think he will have a rather unpleasant time on the hen-roost of the Fianna Fáil Party for some time to come.  There are some old roosters in the Party who are very dissatisfied with him and who are inclined to repudiate him and all his works and pomps.  No useful purpose is ever served by insulting and abusing any section of the population and particularly a section of our people who live in humble but decent circumstances. It is not the fault of the people who occupy the Western counties that their holdings are small and that they are congested, and the fact that there is such an enormous amount of congestion in the western counties presents this Government and any Government which will take office with a problem of very great magnitude and very great difficulty.  It is a problem which should be tackled impartially, objectively and without any bitterness or any display of extravagance of language or temper.</P>
    <P>I have noticed a tendency in various <Col N="1635" /> parts of the House to regard any migrant or any citizen from any other county who comes into another county as an enemy who ought to be kept out at any cost.  Even Deputy Flanagan who claims to be very progressive in his outlook and his ideas is inclined completely to exclude all migrants from his constituency, while freely advocating that the land should be broken up on a very wide scale amongst his own constituents.  That is not a helpful attitude, and neither is it a helpful attitude to seek to set one type of farmer against another, to represent the small farmer as being immeasurably better than the big farmer and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>I travelled two days ago through portion of Deputy Flanagan's constituency of Leix, and I was struck and deeply impressed by the quality of the land and the high standard of efficiency displayed in its working.  The crops were sown, the land was tilled to the very fences, the fences were well trimmed, and so far as I could see, there was not an inch of waste land.  On that particular stretch, I estimated, from viewing the houses and the number of fields attached, that each holding was in or about 100 acres in area. They were exceptionally well cared for and well managed, and I do not think that anyone in any part of the House would suggest that such farmers should be dispossessed, or their land taken from them and given to anyone else either inside or outside that constituency.</P>
    <P>That raises the bigger issue, of how far the Land Commission should go in regard to the distribution of land.  I am satisfied that there is a vast amount of work to be done in relation to the acquisition and distribution of land, but I think there should be certain guiding principles which should be universally accepted.  One principle which the Land Commission and the Minister should accept is that no farmer who works his land well according to the laws of good husbandry should be dispossessed of his holding in any circumstances whatever.  That, I think, is the principle which should guide the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> The Minister, on the recent Land Bill, agreed that he would not dispossess any allottee who was working his land according to the laws of good husbandry and who, of course, was residing in the homestead.  He agreed further to accept an amendment from the Opposition Party by which he left it to the courts to decide whether an allottee was working his land according to the laws of good husbandry or not. When the Minister agreed to that amendment, I must say he grew six inches higher in my estimation, if that is of any advantage to him.  Having accepted that general principle, the Land Commission can get by agreement all the land they are able to deal with, if they act in a business-like way. I know many farmers who have offered their land and who are still waiting for some action in regard to it.  Land is urgently needed in those districts.  I know also that there are many farmers who would offer their land if they were sure that, in the event of a disagreement in regard to price, the Land Commission would not step in and use compulsory powers to acquire it.  If they would deal with the farmers in the same way as good businessmen deal with one another, they would get all the land they require provided they establish confidence between themselves and the people with whom they have to deal.</P>
    <P>In the case of a farmer who has an out-farm, which may or may not be very big, and who is prepared to hand it to the Land Commission at a fair price, what is the position at the moment?  He may have to wait for years before the Land Commission acquires it.  Also, there must be a considerable amount of agitation in the district for the land.  No farmer who has land like that to dispose of wants to go to the trouble of getting people to agitate for the possession of his land.  That is a difficulty which can be got over easily by business-like methods.  With the establishment of confidence between the Land Commission and the farmers, there would be in the future a greater tendency amongst the larger farmers to sell portion of the land, where they find they have more than they are able to <Col N="1637" /> work.  That would relieve some congestion in their own particular area and it is a tendency which should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I believe that agricultural conditions will be rather difficult in the future. It is certain that, in the conditions which will prevail in the post-war period, the farmer who has more land than he is able to work efficiently will be forced to sell to somebody, since working costs in agriculture, and labour costs, too, will certainly be higher than they were pre-war.  The tendency of farmers will be to meet the Land Commission fairly and give them their land, provided a reasonable price is offered.  Therefore, the Land Commission should drop all this idea of compulsion and act in a business-like way.  Otherwise, the farmer will go to the auctioneer&mdash;and very rightly&mdash;as he can put up his land and get rid of it in a month or two, whereas in dealing with the Land Commission the case might drag on for years.  That is a consideration which the Minister should take into account.</P>
    <P>I would like to see growing up between the officials and the farmers and people generally with whom they have to deal a spirit of co-operation and understanding.  We do not want the farmer in the position where he simply fills in a form and then gets a reply, an inspector comes down after some time and takes a note of his grievance and another inspector comes some months or some years after that, and so on.  There should be somebody appointed to deal with each particular case and take a personal interest in it. It is by establishing a human relationship between the Land Commission and the farmers that more progress will be made and more confidence will be established.  I have in mind the case of a farmer who got into financial difficulties after the first world war and, as a result, agreed to the Land Commission taking over his place.  He understood at the time that he would get a parcel of land on it.  In making the allocations of the holding, the inspector found that he could not satisfy this particular farmer on his own holding, but he gave him a definite promise to see <Col N="1638" /> that he got a parcel of land on the first estate that would be divided in the area.  That happened in 1934, but this particular farmer&mdash;or ex-farmer&mdash;is still waiting for his allotment.</P>
    <P>There was a definite promise made by an official, which may not have been put into writing&mdash;I think it was not&mdash; the kind of promise that one farmer or businessman would make to another and the kind of promise that should have been honoured.  There was no obstacle in the way of giving this man a small parcel of land.  He was capable of working it.  The fact that he got into difficulties on the larger farm was due to his having purchased it at a time of inflation during the first world war.  He has hung on for more than ten years to a little stock that would enable him to set up on a new farm, if it is allotted to him.  He is now getting old and, perhaps, the Land Commission might object to him on that point, but he could hardly be expected to prevent that occurring.  However, he has grown-up sons who are prepared to help him.  That is a kind of case where we should have a more human relationship between the Land Commission and the farmers.  There should be a sense of fair play, of justice and of human understanding of the needs of each particular individual.  We often hear it said that a corporation has no soul to be damned or body to be kicked.  I do not want the Land Commission to get into the position that they can do a dishonourable thing on a particular individual and get away with it because they are a huge Government Department.</P>

Thank God, I am able to look after my own character and I am able to look after my own deeds and I do not want the help of Deputy Flanagan.  I do not want him to tell me what is right or advise me what is wrong.  He put forward the case a while ago that I used undue political influence and corruption with the Land Commission and their inspector in order to get the best part of an estate which was being divided in my countryside.  As a matter of fact, the estate, the O'Shea estate, lay alongside the farm where I was born, where my father before me was born, and where my grandfather lived.  My family have been there during the last 100 years and, therefore, I ought to know something about that particular land and its history.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This estate came up for division and there were about a dozen applicants.  It was part of a holding which had been sold.  It was an out <Col N="1640" /> part of a neighbouring farm and the residential part was sold a couple of years before.  As I said, there were about 12 applicants.  The townland of Garrymore, from where the applicants came, was a very congested area. The holdings were grouped together in such a way that in one field you would find patches of half an acre or three roods.  They were so interlocked that at the outset, on the question of making a good resettlement scheme in the district among my neighbours, and remembering that there were at least four or five cabins which had to be demolished and a new adjustment made, I suggested that all those people should voluntarily surrender all the land they held, lock, stock and barrel, to the Land Commission and allow the inspector to draw up a scheme, taking into consideration the migration of two or three of the tenants on to the O'Shea land into new houses and readjusting the various acreages among the remainder.</P>
      <P>I also suggested, in order to make extra room, that a couple of the tenants who would be willing to give up, in one case, ten acres and, in another case, a smaller holding, should go to another estate that the Land Commission was dividing, that it would be all to the good and that the finished scheme would be a better one for the countryside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think at least the truth should be put on record.  In this instance one of my neighbours, a man named Dunne &mdash; if any Deputies are <Col N="1641" /> interested in this matter and want further details I can supply them&mdash; had a holding about two or two and a half acres a mile from my place.  His holding was approached down a laneway a half a mile in length.  One corner of the O'Shea estate came within a 100 yards of the farm where I live.  We held 17 or 18 acres right around where Dunne lived, about a mile from our place, and it surrounded him on three sides.  Dunne had the privilege of grazing two cows with ours on that part of the land. His fowl were continuously on that part of the land, too, and also his donkey. In our time he had the said use of the land.</P>

      <P>I will stop if Deputy Flanagan persists in taking up this attitude.  Those are his tactics and he does not want to hear the truth.  He wants to get away with one side of the story, to his own advantage.  The inspector came to the district and visited the people, my neighbours, who applied for a portion of the land. When he came to Dunne's place he asked Dunne who owned the land which surrounded his house and he was told it was ours.  Dunne was one of the future allottees.  He was bound to get land because his garden joins on to the O'Shea estate.  It was suggested by the inspector to Dunne that it would be a better settlement if he would approach me to know if I would agree to exchange the land that surrounded him for the portion that the inspector intended giving to Dunne and which came within a hundred yards of our home.  As regards Deputy Flanagan saying it is a swamp, I know what land is and there are many farmer Deputies and others here who know what good land is and what bad land is.</P>

The day of the division came. The inspector met the allottees on the public road about half-a-mile from my place.  I said there publicly that I would not agree to give consent and that the inspector could give the land that they had agreed to exchange with me to Dunne, that I would stay as I was if anyone objected.

      <P>Anybody who is interested in this matter can verify what I have said.  Anybody who goes to that district can see that Dunne is a good neighbour.  He is a man with five sons who has been farming all his life and who knows how to work land. Since he got land he has produced 17 or 18 barrels of wheat to the acre and from ten to 12 tons of beet.  That is the best recommendation I can give him.  I only wish that the Deputy could give as good an account of himself as Dunne.  I wish Deputy Flanagan would have a bit of commonsense at this hour of his life and not be listening to the stories which some people tell him.  The Deputy lives in Mount-mellick and near enough to Garrymore to make inquiries, but he prefers to draw red herrings into this matter for his own advantage.</P>
      <P>There is one matter to which I wish to call the Minister's attention although it may not be possible to do anything about it during the coming year.  I refer to the question of housing as it affects tenants who have purchased holdings from the Land Commission. No provision has been made for farmers with holdings the valuation of which is from £25 to £50 in the way of providing housing facilities or for the reconstruction of houses.  In many cases the old houses are beyond repair. I mention the matter now because in some cases the tenants would not be able to face up to the expense themselves and if they went to the Agricultural Credit Corporation the terms for a suitable loan, even if available, would make it impossible for them to provide houses.</P>

The Minister should make is clear to farmers, whether large or small, that as long as they work their land they will not be disturbed.  Knowing the Minister as I do, I am perfectly satisfied that that will be his policy. Despite all the Land Acts that have been passed by foreign governments and by our own Government there are still some tenants who have not purchased. Deputy Cogan referred to yearly tenants but there are others which might be called line-ball cases and fee farm grants.  They are not numerous.  I brought certain of these cases to the notice of the Minister.  I should like him to look into the matter to see if tenants who have not purchased could be helped to do so.</P>

      <P>I listened to the debate on the Land Commission Vote and I must say that I heard some amazing speeches being made.  Some of these speeches by Deputy Giles, Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Corry were the best speeches that could be made in favour of Partition.  It appeared from them that Ireland would want to be divided into 26 separate parts.  Any man who comes beyond the borders of Meath in the opinion of Deputy Flanagan or beyond the borders of Leix-Offaly in the opinion of Deputy Flanagan or beyond the borders of Cork in the opinion of Deputy Corry should be treated as a foreigner, as an enemy and as an invader.  We had an amazing statement from Deputy Corry about the hen roosts in the West.  It was a good job for the Deputy and for his colleagues that there were men in the hen roosts in the west.  It was the men in these hen roosts who smashed feudalism in the past.  The kernel of the land question in this country is to be found in the fact that our people would not accept feudalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last migration to Connaught did not take place in the days of Cromwell. A very small acquaintance with Irish history would inform Deputy Giles that as late as 1750 migration took place from the Midlands to Connaught and that there was a clearance from <Col N="1645" /> the Midlands in 1850.  There was also a pogrom in Ulster at the same period as a result of which many unfortunate Catholics had to go to Connaught. Deputy Corry made the amazing statement that men who were working as agricultural labourers in Cork for the glorious wage of £2 a week were so enamoured of their position and so pleased with their conditions that they would not take 30 acres of land if they were offered it.  I am surprised that there should be such backboneless jellyfish amongst the the labourers of Cork.  I met labourers from Cork, decent manly men who were not the cowardly jellyfish or the backboneless individuals who would prefer to be cleaning out the dog kennels of the local hunt rather than availing of the opportunity to become owners of small farms and achieve that much independence.  I ask the Minister as far as it is in his power to proceed on the line that the problem of congestion does exist.  It has its roots in a very bad background and in a very sad period of Irish history.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I have already mentioned this but I want to make my point more explicitly than I did yesterday: Under sub-section (2) regulations may be made and the <Col N="1646" /> regulations may have reference, under (2) (d), to the methods used or the time taken in the manufacture, the preparation or the distribution of the food.  I can understand one point with regard to the time and that is, as can easily be observed from cases that occur in the courts, that preparations are sometimes sent out with a stamp on them or some indication given that they cannot be kept on the shelves longer than a certain period, that whatever the food preparation is goes bad if it is retained on a shelf and not disposed of before a particular time or that some mites, or something of that type may get into the food after a certain period.  Therefore the time taken in the distribution of the food might be a matter with regard to which provision might have to be made.  But I cannot understand what provisions will be required to be made in regard to the manufacture or the preparation of the food and I certainly can see a considerable danger in provisions in connection with the methods used in manufacture because there are, as I mentioned yesterday in connection with the earlier amendments, many very well known patented formulæ relevant to the preparation of food and it would seem to me that this would open the door to a Minister making regulations which would destroy processes that are well known and have been used and have been sanctioned by the public taste over many years.  So that I would like to know what the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind when he demands the power to make regulations as regards time.  I am excluding in all my argument time for distribution.  But, I cannot understand why there should be any necessity for a regulation controlling time in the preparation or time taken in the manufacture and I would be particularly anxious over the power that is here sought to make regulations regarding the methods used in the manufacture of food.  One might think of general regulations with regard to hygiene and cleanliness in connection with distribution but these two words, &ldquo;method&rdquo; and &ldquo;time&rdquo;, apply both to manufacture and to preparation as well as to distribution.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (d) provides, as Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, for the making of regulations that may contain provisions in relation to the methods used, the time taken in the manufacture, preparation or distribution of such food.  Deputy McGilligan is anxious to know what have we in mind in regard particularly to the time factor and to the methods that may be employed.  It might be necessary to control the methods under two headings.  One of them Deputy McGilligan has already mentioned in relation to the handling of food.  It would be necessary to provide that the method of handling food intended for human consumption should be a hygienic method.  In the manufacture, for example, of sausages, black puddings, or such edible products, the most hygienic methods are not invariably employed.  There is some difficulty in securing the operation of rigid hygienic methods in relation to this particular type of product but, in some up to date concerns the employees have to wear gloves, for example, in the handling of the raw materials for such foods. Method would appear to include something more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>It would include the wearing of gloves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to furnish a particular circumstance in which hygienic methods of dealing with the manufacture of a particular product could perhaps only be fully achieved by the use of gloves.  I do not want to suggest to the House that I have in mind, as soon as this Bill becomes law, insisting that everybody who manufactures any of these edible products will wear gloves but I do mention it as a possible consideration anyhow if unhygienic methods were being adopted in any particular concern. Method would appear to me to include something more than that.  For example, in the pasteurisation of milk the method of pasteurisation would be an important factor.  Whether &ldquo;method&rdquo; is just the word that expresses what I have in mind I am not so sure, but there are pasteurisation processes in operation in this <Col N="1648" /> country that are very little protection to the community.  I do not think that I need further develop that.</P>
      <P>As to the time factor&mdash;provisions relating to the time taken in the manufacture, preparation or distribution of food&mdash;the idea inspiring such a provision as that arises out of the fact that in the manufacture of many of these products perishable commodities are used.  If there is not any control with regard to the length of time that meat, for example, may be stored before it is distributed or before it is manufactured into some bye-product, or, having been manufactured, say, into sausages or brawn or such products, if the raw material that is perishable is allowed to remain on the premises for a very long time before being used, or, on the other hand, the product remains on the premises for an unreasonable time before it is disposed of, we would not get very far in the matter of the control of the manufacture of these products.  The same would apply to the delay that might take place in distribution.  Anyhow, these are the considerations that gave rise to the provision that is made here. If the House considers that no such provision is necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This section, if it were the only section, might have to be strengthened in the way in which the Parliamentary Secretary desires. But the section must be taken in relation, first of all, to Part IX of the Bill and, secondly, in relation to the other provisions in connection with food and drugs in other Acts.  The section we are dealing with has as its side note, &ldquo;Standards for food and drink&rdquo; and the whole aim of the section is to have a standard prescribed for the composition of the food.  The regulations which are allowed under the sub-section we are discussing all aim at getting food of a particular standard, that is food which is of special importance to public health.  Power is now sought to make regulations in relation to the nature, quality or amount of any substance to be contained in the food, specifying any substance which is not to be contained in such food, and limiting the amount of any substance to be contained in such food.  These are all quite clearly provisions which would aim at getting a standard. Outside that we get into wider territory. Sub-paragraph (d) brings in the methods used or the time taken in the manufacture, preparation or distribution of such food.  I can see a deterioration possibly occurring if there be longer than a certain time between the date of manufacture and the date of sale.  The people who are most often fined in court or who are the subjects of a civil action are those who eventually dispose of the article, if it is disposed of after a certain time, particularly if that time is marked on the back of the container. I do not understand why we should ask to have power to make regulations regarding the time taken in the manufacture or in the preparation.  I do not see how it comes in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we turn to the methods, I have got from the Parliamentary Secretary that this is to cover a hygienic system in the manufacture and in the preparation and distribution.  The <Col N="1650" /> Parliamentary Secretary should remember that he has other sections dealing with this matter.  He has Section 76 which prohibits dealers in rags, bones, waste paper, etc., from being engaged in the selling of foodstuffs. He has also Section 77 and, of course, he has all the other regulations in the various Food and Drugs Acts under which prosecutions take place and actions are brought if any person suffers as a result of having taken food which is unwholesome.  The prosecution generally is for selling food which is unfit for human consumption. A person has a civil action if he suffers any injury or damage as a result of taking contaminated food.  I suggest that these matters are all strong enough to meet the case of food which becomes contaminated because unhygienic methods are used in its preparation. Under Section 72, the Parliamentary Secretary does not do any more than make regulations and make it an offence if anybody contravenes the regulations.  I suggest that he gets all the powers and control he requires under the later sections.  In any event, if the matter is to be even under control and regulation, I ask when it comes to the time factor that that should be limited to the point at which up to date it has been found capable of operation; that is to say, in regard to the time of sale in relation to the date of manufacture.  I suggest that when the word &ldquo;method&rdquo; is used, there is a danger that that might be used to deal with those who make what is called proprietary foodstuffs.  By making a regulation dealing with the method, one might put these people out of their manufacturing process altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this from a slightly different angle.  The section gives very wide powers.  If the powers contained in it are granted they could be open to very grave abuse. I do not say that the powers will be abused, but they could be abused.  We are dealing with standards for food and drink which may be set up by the Minister and we are dealing with the methods of distribution and, I think, also the methods used or the time taken in the manufacture.  Am I to <Col N="1651" /> take it, for instance, that under this section dealing with drink it will be within the Minister's powers to specify the gravity at which beer should be manufactured and sold?  That power is certainly given here.  It would be within the competence of the Minister if the sub-section becomes law to specify the strength at which whiskey should be manufactured and sold.  The Parliamentary Secretary is inclined to smile at that.  He probably has not the slightest intention of doing that. I am pointing out, however, that it would be possible for him to do it if this sub-section becomes law.  That is not so far-fetched as one might think. We must remember that the Taoiseach on one occasion was very hot on what he termed light beer.</P>

      <P>I should not like to see the Department of Local Government and Public Health instructing Messrs.  Guinness as to how they were to manufacture stout, the methods they were to employ in its manufacture, and the ingredients they were to use in its manufacture; but all that is possible under this section.  The Parliamentary Secretary may smile, but, whether he knows it or not, under this section, if it becomes law in its present form, it will be possible for the Minister for Local Government, after consultation with two other Ministers, as I see it, to give instructions to our brewers and distillers as to the strength and gravity of their products and the ingredients they are to use in their manufacture.  We may find that this is the thin end of the wedge in relation to this more or less abandoned campaign of light beer for the people. I would not put it beyond them if that was the real intention of it.  &ldquo;Provision in relation to the methods used or the time taken in the manufacture, preparation or distribution of such foods&rdquo;&mdash;it is all there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may regard this as something about which we can afford to smile, as something to be treated rather as a joke, but again I have to remind him, as I have had to remind him so many times during <Col N="1652" /> the debate on this Bill, that we are legislating not for the present head of the Department but for any person who may be there&mdash;not that I have any more confidence in the present political head than I would have in anybody who would follow him.  There is that wide power there.  I recognise that, when dealing with food, and particularly when you seek to get food in its purest form for the consumer, fairly wide powers and perhaps very stringent powers are required, and that only by possession of such powers can the Parliamentary Secretary attain his object, but I do say that we ought in some way to limit them, because, in the light of the evidences in many directions of the mentality of the present Government, it would not stagger me terribly if they did direct Messrs Guinness, Jameson, Mountjoy and all the others how they were to prepare their products.</P>

      <P>I agree that the powers asked for are very wide and could be abused in certain conditions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to stress the point that the powers are too wide, especially in relation to the manufacture of a proprietary article which might from certain angles be considered excellent but which might not satisfy the inspectors.  I am inclined to agree that, so far as the methods used and the time taken are concerned, some power of the sort is necessary. Take the case of by-products in a bacon factory.  Anybody who has visited a bacon factory and has seen how these by-products are handled will know that occasionally the time for which they are allowed to lie before being processed is a very serious matter.  Many people who are fond of sausages might not be nearly so keen on them if they got a glimpse into some of the factories producing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that much improvement could be brought about in the manufacture of articles of that sort and I think that certain power must be given to the Minister and to the local authority.  I am just wondering what machinery is to be provided for the enforcement of the necessary provisions.  There is an amendment to Section 74 which seeks to empower the official of a local authority in the matter and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give us some information as to what sort of inspections will be carried out and how often they will be carried out. As I say, certain powers are necessary with regard to the manufacture of particular classes of food to ensure that perishable articles are used up in a reasonable time and that the method used in their production is an approved method and that the conditions are such as will make for hygienic production. I agree with Deputy Morrissey that giving the power to specify the substances and the amount of substances required to manufacture a proprietary article may be giving the Minister too much power and may lead to some abuses and injustices, because there might be a definite difference of opinion as between experts on the <Col N="1654" /> question of the percentage of ingredients and the type of ingredients which should be used in the production of a certain commodity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to say in reply to the criticism of this paragraph offered by the various speakers. Deputy McGilligan very properly reminded us that a person who is damaged as the result of consuming contaminated food can seek redress by civil action.  There is no denying that, but it seems to be a rather illogical approach to the problem.  It would be sounder policy to try to prevent the damage caused by the manufacture, sale or disposal of contaminated foods. There is no denying that the powers sought in this section, as in any other section, can be abused.  I do not think there are many laws passed in this House which are not open to abuse, but the House has some redress in this particular matter and it seems to me that interests concerned are particularly well safeguarded.</P>
      <P>I have already informed Deputy Mulcahy that I propose circulating an amendment for the Report Stage, providing for a public notice of intention to make regulations in regard to any particular matter arising under this section, so that anybody interested may have a full opportunity of presenting his views.  I presume it would be possible to regulate the alcoholic strength of various beverages, as Deputy Morrissey suggests, but I rather think that, if we issue a public notice informing interested parties that we propose making such regulations and invite them to make representations and we subsequently make regulations and they are considered unsatisfactory and perhaps even improper, they would make their voices heard.  I would be very much surprised if they did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies might bear in mind two matters in relation to this.  I will ask them not to forget that the powers may be abused.  They might bear in mind that notice will be given before the regulations are drafted, that full consultation between the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for <Col N="1655" /> Local Government and Public Health will take place and must take place under the section before any standards are fixed.  Finally, the regulations prescribing the standards will be placed on the Table of the House.  The House will have an opportunity of discussing these regulations and, if there is anything in them that should not be there, there will be an opportunity of drawing public attention to it.  Then, if the Deputies concerned can command the support of a majority in the House, they can reject those regulations. The powers are necessary; they can be abused; but I do not see how we can do the things it is desirable we should do, if we are not given the power to do them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is probably some value in this notification the Minister talks about.  He says that, when certain things are to be done, the public will be notified beforehand by publication and notification, and can make their voice heard.  They may make their voice heard, but that may not have the slightest effect&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;on the regulations.  This is another step along the road to State interference and this sub-section, if passed, will enable the Government to interfere with the manufacture of any article of food or drink in this country. It will enable the Government to say how it should be manufactured, what ingredients should go to its manufacture, what time should enter into the question of its ripening or maturity, or whatever the case may be.  The manufacturer will be coerced into carrying on his business, not in the way that his training and experience has indicated to him as the best way and likely to produce the best results, but in the way he will be directed, or the way dictated to him by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the Minister's intentions may be, as members of this Dáil charged with passing a piece of legislation and making it part of the law of the land, we have to concern ourselves with what use can be made of it.  That is really what we are doing. While it is necessary to give the Minister fairly wide powers, there ought to be, and I think there should be, some <Col N="1656" /> limitation on this section, and particularly on this sub-section, and very particularly on paragraph (d) of sub-section (2).  There is no limit to what the Minister may do.  He has to confer with his two colleagues, but having done that and having got their consent to a particular course with regard to the method of manufacture, the ingredients to be contained, the time factor and so on, the manufacture of that article of food or drink must be carried out in accordance with his directions.  I submit, with all respect, that that is carrying State interference beyond the limit.</P>

Mind you, there is something in that, and I mention it particularly because there is more than mere home consumption concerned.  Those industries I am referring to have&mdash;fortunately for us &mdash;a vast export market.  The same thing might be done with regard to Jacob's biscuit factory.  I am not saying that it is the intention to do so, but I am saying that, if the subsection&mdash;and particularly paragraph (d)&mdash;is passed in its present form, that can be done.

      <P>In that connection, I had to attend an inquiry, about which I made mention yesterday, into the preparation of milk around the City of Dublin.  For something like three days, the best known officer of the veterinary service here in town gave evidence about the regulations made with regard, not alone to milk but the handling of cows.  I remember one very vivid example he gave of the way in which the conditions are carried out.  He said that he had come to the conclusion that where he saw the outward signs of the regulations being observed he marked that place down as a place from which, under no consideration, would he take milk for himself or his family.  He talked about measures that were demanded by the Department&mdash;a clean smock, a clean pail, clean water and a clean cloth&mdash; and then he gave you a picture of seven cows about to be milked, all lined up, with their flanks stained with what he called &ldquo;gross dirt&rdquo;.  The milker took the clean cloth and dipped it into the water and the gross dirt was wiped off the first cow.  The cloth was then put back in the water and that contaminated water was applied to the gross dirt on the second animal, and so on.  As a result, when you came to the seventh animal, you had the accumulation of gross dirt from the previous six.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was certainly <Col N="1658" /> a mass of warring microbes carried from one animal to another.  That was the way in which the regulation was carried out.  When I draw attention to the matter, the Parliamentary Secretary says it depends on the gloves, on the way in which the gloves are used. So far as relates to hygiene, we have to give him the powers he wants and hope for the best; but in relation to matters which are not matters of hygiene, there has been an approach to me by certain manufacturers who are not in accord with this section. They have told me they would feel safer and entirely in agreement with the section if the whole thing were more strictly confined to the consideration of public health, but they point out that that is not so.  I have tried to allay their anxieties, but the more I look at the section the more I feel there is something in what they say. It is quite clear that, in the first sub-section of Section 72, the consideration is public health, because it deals with food that is of special importance to the public health and we have the consideration by the three Ministers mentioned in regard to the prescription of a standard.  It then veers away altogether, as far as the sub-section is concerned, from the consideration of public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the standard is not tied on to a standard which, in their opinion, is considered necessary or desirable in the interests of public health.  When you come to the regulations, you are still further away from the public health.  For instance, the provisions in relation to the methods used have directly no tie whatever with the public health.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that this matter should be looked into.  I take it that the only methods that are under consideration in this connection are methods which are going to be decided by the simple test&mdash;are they for the public health or are they antagonistic to it?  That is not in the sub-section, and I think Deputy Morrissey is quite right in saying that, under the sub-section as drafted, it is wide enough to enable a sort of semi-protection to be given, and so, in the interests of some branded stuff, some method of manufacturing <Col N="1659" /> might be prescribed which would entirely do away with a substance already manufactured here and enjoyed by the public.</P>
    <P>I do not imagine that is intended.  It should not be carried under a public health measure.  I suggest that, however, ever wide the powers of the Parliamentary Secretary may be, he should only use whatever powers are required for the purposes of the public health. That is nowhere in this sub-section and I do not think it is carried into the standard under the first sub-section. The matter might require tightening up.  The Parliamentary Secretary's analogy with regard to the time taken was possibly badly chosen.  I understood him to be referring to the age of a particular material which is used in some article of food.  He does not get that under this sub-section, though he may under an earlier sub-section with regard to the quality of the substance. I suppose there will be some provision about ruling out something that has passed a certain time.  This relates entirely to the time taken in the manufacture. If you started with an aged material or allowed a certain extra time to pass in the manufacture of it, that is one thing, but this would not prevent an aged and decrepit substance being used as an ingredient in the composition of some food.</P>

    <P>This matter has been agitated in previous <Col N="1660" /> sections of more or less the same type.  It is proposed to make a certain matter an offence.  Deputy Costello's amendment is wrongly phrased.  He suggests putting in the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;sells&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; should be in front of the word &ldquo;sells&rdquo;&mdash;where a person knowingly sells for human consumption; that is the ordinary grammatical way in which it should run.</P>

      <P>I shall come to that in a later section.  I think that is one of the hardships retailers are under. Why should a retailer be brought into the courts?  I am not speaking now of a civil action.  Why should he be subject to a prosecution because he sells something which he gets in an enclosed container?  He has no means of knowing what is inside and he can give abundant proof that the deterioration has not taken place in his premises. Yet if a person sells and someone suffers there can follow a prosecution and a civil action.  I want to minimise the harm and I suggest that a prosecution should follow only if a person with knowledge sells, for human consumption, food which has an ingredient not up to standard.</P>
      <P>There is no reason for having an offence declared here unless the State can come to the point of proving whatever is imposed on them in the way of proof by the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;. So far as criminal offences go, generally if that word is left out all that has to be proved is (a) that something was sold and (b) that it does not conform to the standard.  If the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is put in some extra burden of proof will be put on the prosecution. There must be something more than the proof merely of sale and that the standard has not been conformed with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are making an offence of a rather heavy type.  It will be met with a fine of £20 and, in a second offence, £100, with the possibility of six months in jail.  I suggest we should give the <Col N="1661" /> person who sells whatever protection &mdash;and it is a slight one&mdash;is given by the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If ever there was a case in which the word &ldquo;summary&rdquo; ought to be criticised it is here, particularly if the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is not put into the earlier sub-section.  Here we will have a person brought up for a particular offence.  As the section stands, he need have no knowledge whatever and if someone goes into court and proves (a) the sale, and (b) that the substance does not conform to the standard, there is an offence proved.  I suggest that is not a summary offence, a minor offence, and only minor offences come in.  This is clearly the type of case where a verdict of 12 or nine jurymen, or whatever the lesser number may be, should be taken as to whether a person is guilty, and not a professional type of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made this point already in connection <Col N="1662" /> with the Constitution.  It does not matter what we say here as to whether or not a case shall be summarily tried. On a case being raised by an alleged offender, the High Court will have to determine whether it is a minor offence. If trial by jury is the right of every citizen, here is the proper case in which a certain number of a man's fellow-citizens will decide whether or not he is deserving of this fine and imprisonment. We should remove this to the upper sphere and keep it away from the District Court and what I call the professional justice there.</P>

      <P>This section makes regulations and lays down certain standards whereby certain brands say of cornflour will be certified as conforming to those standards. Difficulty might be created for small shopkeepers who sell a multiplicity of articles of food in not knowing what they were up against.  In what way can small shopkeepers be assured that they will not be committing an offence or be liable to a penalty under the section? In regard to chemists certain standards are set up but there you are dealing with trained people.  In the case of food sold by small shops, particular brands might conform to the required standards, but we should be careful that these shopkeepers are made aware of these brands, either by way of having them stamped or by some other indication, so that brands not carrying the official stamp should not be disposed of.  That point should be considered if we are going to have these standards enforced, and so that confusion will not be caused amongst shopkeepers.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned last evening that milk was one of the prime articles of <Col N="1666" /> food dealt with in this section.  I wish to refer to a matter to which I have referred in the House before in connection with milk.  In winter the milk supplied to the city has a certain minimum quantity of cream.  The citizen is told that that is due to winter conditions.  When summer comes and when there is richer feeding for cattle, it does not seem to result in any appreciable increase in the cream content of the milk supplied.  I would urge that when these regulations are being framed in connection with milk the city customer should get the benefit of the richer milk in summer. At the present moment I think the summer milk is kept down to a minimum standard and the children are thus deprived of the larger amount of fats which they ought to get.  I trust that under these regulations that situation will be kept in mind and that different standards will be fixed for the winter and the summer.  I do not know whether that is done at present or not but certainly the ordinary citizen does not seem to get the benefit he should get of richer milk during the summer months.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point made by Deputy Larkin, I hope he will not be too easily put off by the answer given by the Parliamentary Secretary, that it is a matter for regulation. Section 72 sets out to establish standards for food and drink, at least, to give power to a Minister, in consultation with two or three others, to establish standards for food and drink, and sub-section (3) has as a consequence that, where a person sells for human consumption, or prepares, manufactures, offers or keeps for sale for human consumption, any food for the composition of which a standard is prescribed, and if in fact the food does not conform to the standard, then there is an offence and we have a later paragraph dealing with the case where it is an ingredient that has been standardised and where the ingredient is used. In connection with offences, there is a later section, 77, which deals generally with prosecutions and, before we pass Section 72, it is proper that Section 77 <Col N="1667" /> should at least be glanced at.  Section 77 starts off by a couple of sub-sections which are very hard and are meant to be hard on the seller of the foodstuff, because it ordains that food is to be deemed to be intended for sale or to have been sold for human consumption until the contrary is proved.  So that, if a sale takes place, there is a <i>prima facie</i> case that it has been sold or offered for sale for human consumption. Consequently&mdash;and much more difficult&mdash;any article of food that is found in the premises, if it is capable of being used in the preparation or manufacture of food, then it is deemed to have been intended for use in the manufacture.  So that, the difficulty is that if a retailer gets into a shop certain articles of food which he may only get in for the purpose of storing, or for the purpose actually of picking and discarding, if an inspector should happen to visit him before that particular situation has come about, then he is deemed to have the stuff on the premises for sale for human consumption. Quite a number of small retailers here have not separate establishments in which they store and select before they bring into their premises for sale.  Section 77 goes further as to analysis, that where there is an analysis taken certain things may be found.  Paragraph (d) is the only point that comes near to the relief which I imagine Deputy Larkin is seeking for certain retailers.  Paragraph (d) says that a defendant, a person who is made an accused person in a prosecution for an offence under this section, has certain defences but the very, very limited nature of the defence must be attended to&mdash;that he can prove that he purchased the food as of a nature, substance or quality or in a condition which would not have contravened certain regulations and with a written warranty.  There must be a written warranty and if a person has not a written warranty his defence is no good.</P>

      <P>Now we are going to have a full discussion on Section 77.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate. I can discuss it here.  I have an amendment <Col N="1668" /> on which I want to bring in another matter.  I will collapse the discussion on the later amendment into this.  To get a defence under Section 77 a person must prove that he did purchase as of the particular nature, quality and all the rest of it as would have been in accordance with the regulations and that he had a written warranty to the effect.  Then he goes on further to prove that he had no reason to believe at the time when he sold such food that it was of a different nature or quality or in a different condition and that he sold it in the same state as when he got it.  It is only when he goes through all these three lines of defence that he gets a defence and that is where I think the small retailer is very badly hit under this. It quite often happens in courts that judges actually express their sympathy with people.  A case was reported in the newspapers as being before the courts in the last four or five days where a justice expressed himself as having great sympathy with the person whom he nevertheless had to convict under the law as it stood.  He will have to convict under this section because there was no written warranty. No retailer ever gets a written warranty.  It would not be worth his while.  He could not do business if he had to go to that particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bring in an amendment which I may speak of here.  I want to add a new paragraph to this Section 77 to enable a person to have a defence if goods have been invoiced to him under a name or description which, say, if it is a standardised commodity, would indicate that the standard had been complied with.  Then that invoice in itself should take the place of the written warranty and the person should then have the right to parade that as a defence so long as he was, of course, able to show the other things, namely, that he sold the food in the same state as he purchased it and had no reason to believe that it was otherwise than as described to him.  I think there is some little relief given to the retailer which does not, incidentally, prevent somebody else from being made amenable before the law because, if the retailer gets out <Col N="1669" /> and if an offence has been committed, there will be a harking back to the person immediately before him in the line.  I suggest that all this is relevant to the point that Deputy Larkin raised and I would suggest to the House that before they pass this section making these new offences, they should at least advert to the possible lines of defence that are open to the retailer under Section 77.  I repeat again that they are very, very restrictive. The retailer must show he has got the food as of a particular substance, quality and so on, that he has got a written warranty, that he has no reason to believe that the stuff is otherwise than as described to him and that it has not deteriorated, that he sold it in the same state as he purchased it.  Except you put in all these four things he has no defence.  I suggest that that is extremely hard.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 50 in my name is taken entirely from the British legislation. There is a change made in it, but the purport of it is the same as in the British legislation.  They have become definitely aware there of the difficulties under which the retailers are put. They are not of any mind to let out the person who has committed an offence in connection with the sale of unwholesome food or drink, but they want to put the blame on the right person.  I suggest that we should do the same.</P>

But he proposes to charge the manufacturers for the cost of his interference in the business for the purpose of protecting the public health.  I submit that a proposal like that requires some justification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that the very fact that the Minister does interfere, that he takes samples and insists on certain standards in relation to hygienic conditions of production and certain standards in relation to the actual constituents of the manufactured product and so on, gives a guarantee to the public that ought to be worth something to the manufacturer.  If a manufacturer has a certificate from the Minister indicating that his product has reached a certain standard and, in fact, has to comply with a certain standard, and that he is liable to certain penalties if it does not reach that standard, I think that is of considerable commercial value to him.</P>

      <P>I want again to object to the putting in of these words in the place where it is proposed to put them, because that means that the Minister for Finance may object to these regulations being made and may, in fact, prevent them from being made.  Why should that be so?  The Parliamentary Secretary refers me to Section 75.  Why not put in the Minister for Finance there?  Why not say: that regulations under this part of this Act may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, authorise the <Col N="1671" /> imposition of such charges as the Minister approves for the purpose of various things?  The point I am making is that if you put in the Minister for Finance in Section 73 he may stop the regulations altogether. Put him into Section 75 and he is in his proper framework.  He is given power to prevent charges being made, except such charges as he likes.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health can make the regulations without charges without going near the Minister for Finance. Why should not that be the case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have answered that yesterday.  We have. One of these days all these penalty sections will have to be cleared up. The difficulty arises out of the difference between the 1922 Constitution and the 1937 Constitution, because the 1922 Constitution certainly allowed matters to be brought before a summary court if they were offences made triable under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, or any amendment of it. Your test was that it was either a minor offence or such an offence as was called a minor offence by pieces of legislation like this.  That is not the situation under the 1937 Constitution. Under that, the simple term is that minor offences will be tried summarily. Everything else is to be tried under <Col N="1672" /> the conditions of a jury, except by a special court.  That means that hereafter some court has to pronounce whether a matter raised before it is a minor offence or not.  The difficulty we are in is that under the new Constitution that point cannot be decided in the District Court or the Circuit Court.  There must be a motion made to take the whole action up to the High Court and get the constitutional point determined.  It may appear to be a good analogy to say that there are quite a number of statutes which impose higher penalties than these and that these cases are taken before the District Court.  They may be.  Some of these days somebody will raise that point and it will be discovered that they are not minor offences and that they should not be tried before the District Court.  Then we will have retrospective legislation brought in to cover up the whole thing.</P>

But the mere fact of saying that we want it to be tried summarily does not mean it will be tried summarily.  If an alleged offender says that it is not a minor offence and that he wants his constitutional right to be tried by a jury, he can get the matter determined in the High Court <Col N="1673" /> and the High Court may say that it is not a minor offence.  The mere fact that we say that it is a matter for summary jurisdiction does not count. At least, I submit that as a statement.</P>

      <P>(1)  The Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture, may make regulations for the prohibition of the sale, or offering or keeping for sale, of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  articles of food intended for human consumption,</P>

    <P>(2)  A person who contravenes a regulation under this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £100 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding £10 for each day on which the offence is continued or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or to both such fine or fines and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Under Section 71, sub-section (1), the Minister is empowered, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture, to make regulations providing for the prevention of danger to the public health from the manufacture, preparation, importation, storage, distribution or exposure for sale of food intended for human consumption. These regulations will provide for any danger to the public health arising from any of these processes in connection with food intended for sale for human consumption.  The provisions do not cover the danger from food arising from the natural process of decay, such as putrid meat or stale eggs, and it has become necessary to cover that type of contingency by the new sections providing for the making of regulations to prohibit the sale, the offering or keeping for sale of such articles of food, living animals intended for such food, or materials or articles used or intended for use in the preparation or manufacture of such food, which are diseased, contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption. The section will replace Sections 132 and 133 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  These are being repealed.  It is not necessary to quote these two sections of the 1878 Act, but if the House desires to have them put on record, I can quote them at a later stage.</P>

      <P>(a)  the enforcement and execution of the regulations by health authorities and their officers and, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by officers of Customs and Excise,</P>

      <P>One or two things strike me in relation to the changes made by the removal of sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 71.  Under the old proposal in sub-section (3), people were empowered to enter and to inspect premises where there were reasonable grounds &ldquo;for believing any of the following things are kept therein,&rdquo; and then we get more or less the same thing in this amendment. They are here empowered, if they find anything diseased, contaminated or injurious, to seize and dispose of it. We have cut out the power to enter. I do not know if that was intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, if we propose to allow people to enter, surely we will insert the phrase which accompanies all these rights by which the right will be exercised &ldquo;at all reasonable times&rdquo;.  That is a precaution which is ordinarily inserted. Premises are allowed to be entered during business times only.  Otherwise, the proprietor may be away and difficulty might arise with regard to gaining entry and it might mean forcible <Col N="1678" /> entry in the end.  Also, with regard to the provision which speaks of empowering specified persons to enter, one does not mind the officers of the Gárda Síochána, because they will identify themselves by their uniforms, but where other people are to be empowered to seize articles, surely they should be required, as is ordinarily the custom, to produce whatever is their warrant of authority, whatever authenticated document they have which gives them that authority.  Further, there generally is a provision in these cases in which entry on premises is allowed that a dwellinghouse may not be entered without something more in the way of a formality than applies to a place where beasts are kept or meat stored.  The Parliamentary Secretary might keep in mind the amendments which I had down &mdash; amendments Nos. 18, 19 and 20&mdash;which cover the points I am raising on this amendment.</P>
      <P>There is one further point I want to raise.  This amendment allows the seizure, destruction or otherwise suitable disposal of any article of food, generally speaking, which is contaminated or diseased.  I was trying to bring this whole matter back to the ordinary procedure.  I understood the general procedure to be that any article seized as unfit for human consumption or as unwholesome as food is taken before the justice of the District Court and an order condemning it is there secured and that then certain conditions might follow and after that there may be prosecutions or there may not. I always understood that officials and inspectors were not given the right to seize and dispose of property, but always had to go before somebody of a judicial nature to get an order.  I had such an amendment down&mdash;amendment No. 21&mdash;to certain paragraphs of Section 71.  I am not sure that what I have spoken of is always the practice or always the law, but I think that, where an ordinary article of food is seized as unfit for human consumption or as unwholesome, it has to be brought, before the order is made for destruction, before the district justice and I would like this kept in harmony with the existing law.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to this section.  I think the manufacturers have difficulty enough in their business and in keeping things going, and if an impediment is to be put in the way of people who are developing the manufacturing of food, by their having to pay the costs of Government inspection in this way, it is adding a charge which will be passed on to somebody else. It will interfere with the development of small specialised industries and I think the charges should be borne by the State.</P>

      <P>The charges on small industries would naturally and probably be reasonably small charges.  The charges arising under this Part of the Bill will, in the main, be imposed on the rather bigger concerns which are manufacturing on a fairly big scale. The Deputy does not expect me to be able at this stage to give any indication in regard to those charges, inasmuch as this is very much a new departure.

There may be losses in the taking of samples. For instance, in the taking of portion of goods for sale, once a portion of a complete article is destroyed, the retailer is at the loss of the price of the article, plus the cost of having the sample analysed.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary admits that this is the introduction of a completely new service, and he proposes to make charges for carrying out certain examinations and <Col N="1681" /> giving certain certificates.  We would expect him to give us an outline of the foundation on which those charges would be made, that is, what would be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of a particular charge.</P>

      <P>In relation to the taking of samples for the purpose of fixing a standard, one of the major considerations in determining the cost would be related to the output.  I cannot envisage retailers coming within the scope of charges at all, as it is the manufacturer of the article who, in the main, will be responsible for maintaining the standard.  The retailer would only come in in the case of goods which have deteriorated or have become a danger to the public health.  I think the manufacturer will feel the impact of this Part of the Bill to a much greater extent than the smaller or larger retailers.  I do not know that I can be of any greater assistance to the Deputy on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been of great assistance.  He has indicated now that the charges that are going to be imposed under these regulations are not charges in respect of services rendered, but they are a tax on output.  I could have understood his saying that the charges made under these regulations were going to be based upon the average amount of time that would have been spent by an official in investigating the situation locally, the cost of carrying out any analysis that might be required, the cost of writing out or preparing any certificate that might be necessary, or even that the general charges would be made in such a way that, spread over all the work done, it would pay for the whole cost of the particular section of the Department that would deal with this matter. But no, the Parliamentary Secretary tells us nothing of the kind; he says that it would be related to the output.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point, at any rate, is that in taking into consideration <Col N="1682" /> the charge that is going to be made for these services, the total output, the annual output by the manufacturer concerned, is to be considered. What we are now having disclosed to us under this section is a new type of tax; that is, a tax on the output of certain foods.  I think it is a very interesting disclosure, in view of the great desirability of keeping food prices down to the lowest possible level. I must ask the Parliamentary Secretary to justify imposing a charge, assuming a charge is to be imposed, on the manufacturers under this section that is not related to the actual cost of the department supplying the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be related to the actual cost, but my disposition would be to run the service at a loss, so far as the poorer people who might find themselves involved under this portion of the Act are concerned, and perhaps to make a little compensating profit on the people who could afford to pay.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary cannot say that this does not concern retailers, that it will be mainly, if not altogether, the manufacturers. May I point out what has been happening in the courts during the past two or three years?  It has all arisen because samples have been taken from patent and other foods got up and ready for sale in containers.  All this has originated in actions against the retailers and not the manufacturers. The samples were taken from the retailers, and when the prosecution was brought, it was against the retailers. The practice has been that it was the retailer who was paying through the nose and not the manufacturer.  So far as I see, this section, far from giving relief there, is going to magnify the trouble.</P>

It applies to all the regulations in these sections we have been discussing and it would cover the case Deputy Hughes mentioned of a living animal being seized.  Take the case of a beast belonging to a farmer.  It will be seized, probably, by the Gárdaí.  What the Gárdaí do with the beast the section does not say.  They may eat it for all I know.  But whatever expenses would be consequent on the seizure, they would be chargeable to the owner of the beast.  He would be doubly burdened.  He may lose the beast. Someone will have to prove that the beast was ill or emaciated or dangerous in some way.  There is a new principle involved here and that is that a man may be subject to a type of charge that he never had to meet before.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to Section 75.  We have been pointing out that the Government, unable to see how they can impose additional taxes on the people, have been throwing the whole weight of a considerable part of this measure on the local authorities. Now they have found other pockets into which to put their fingers.  Under this section they will put their fingers into the pockets of people who are producing food of one kind or another and they will take money out of these pockets in relation to the output of these people.  That is a definite tax on production.  It is a new tax of a very interesting kind.  It shows the extremes to which the Government are going in arranging their taxation policy for the future.</P>

We should be concerned not to increase the cost of food on the poorer sections and, whatever charges are incurred in the matter of ensuring that the best quality food will be produced, they ought to be <Col N="1684" /> borne by the State and should not be passed on as a further imposition on the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete paragraphs (a) and (b), and in paragraph (c), line 57, to delete the word &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the same claim which has run through the whole of this Bill, to ease the burden of proof on the part of the prosecution.  The procedure in criminal cases is that the burden of proof <Col N="1686" /> is on those who allege that an offence has been committed.  I do not know why it should be necessary to cast the burden of proof on a defendant in the way that it is sought to cast it in proceedings in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b).  As regards the latter part of the amendment, proposing to delete the word &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;, I think that that is a new phrase in our statutes.  The section would then read that the analyst's certificate is evidence of what the analyst said.  I think the object of that paragraph is to make the analyst's certificate evidence of the facts stated, unless the defendant wishes to have the analyst come forward and give evidence in person.  I do not know if it was intended that the word &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; should be camouflaged as conclusive.  It might be argued by the prosecution that the word &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;, in effect meant &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; and the defendant could not by other expert evidence contradict the findings of the analyst as set out in the certificate.  It is essential that a defendant charged with an offence of this kind should be permitted to give his own expert testimony in opposition to the analyst's certificate. My amendment by deleting &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; would leave the analyst's certificate as evidence of the facts therein stated, and as such would be receivable in court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The section makes certain provision in relation to prosecutions for an offence, and, amongst other things, sets out in paragraphs (a) and (b), which the amendment proposes to delete, that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  any food shall be deemed, unless the contrary is proved, to have been sold or to be intended for sale (as may be appropriate) for human consumption,</P>
      <P>(b)  any material or article which is found on premises used for or in the preparation or manufacture of food to be sold for human consumption ...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes on to deal with any material found on the premises.  The provisions set out in the section are in replacement of certain provisions that operate in law as it applies to-day.  Under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) <Col N="1687" /> Act, 1907, which it is proposed to repeal, we find it set out in sub-section (2).  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of regulations made under this Act, articles commonly used for the food or drink of man shall be deemed to be intended for sale for human consumption unless the contrary is proved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Coming to the amendment, and dealing with the value of the analyst's certificate, it is provided, in the case of prosecutions under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, Section 21, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the hearing of the information in such proceeding the production of the certificate of the analyst shall be sufficient evidence of the facts therein stated, unless the defendant shall require that the analyst shall be called as a witness, and the parts of the articles retained by the person who purchased the article shall be produced, ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The sufficiency of the certificate of the analyst in evidence seems to have been clearly set out in that section.  That is the principle embodied here.  Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan would have more information on that matter than I have.  It has never come to my notice that there was any complaint arising out of the phrasing of the Act of 1875.  It is still in operation.  I do not know that it has given rise to any dissatisfaction.</P>

Surely it would be possible to know whether &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; means <i>prima facie</i> or conclusive evidence.  We ought to know what the Parliamentary Secretary wants.

Proceedings might be taken against the manufacturer but, at any rate, there would be a good defence if the defendant were going to adopt it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new paragraph at the end as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e)  For the purposes of this section a name or description entered in an invoice shall be deemed to be a written warranty given pursuant to a stipulation made at the time of sale that the food to which the entry refers is of such a nature, substance and quality that a person can sell or otherwise deal with it under that name or description without contravening any of the provisions of this Act or of regulations made thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already spoken on this but I should like to add briefly to what I have already said.  This, with a slight change, is taken from the latest English legislation on the matter.  It has been a matter of comment here for years, as it has been in England, that the retailer, the man who in good faith, takes stuff, which is afterwards found to be, say, contaminated, the retailer who takes stuff from a reputable manufacturer and sells it, may nevertheless be penalised unless he has taken the precaution to get a written warranty, and very few retailers ever take that precaution.  Quite a number of manufacturers will not give a warranty, even if asked for it, and it is no good to make the defence that you have sought one.  In England a slight change is made.  It does not relieve everybody from the possibility of prosecution, it enables the State still to make somebody responsible for an offence, but it shifts the burden from the retailer in certain limited circumstances. It only applies in the circumstances in which there is a name or a description which may <Col N="1691" /> be regarded as something amounting to a warranty, something that is so clear that no second substance could be sold under the particular description. In particular, under this Bill and it is into the frame-work of this Bill I want to fit it, it would have relation to articles that are standardised.  Supposing under the earlier sections the group of Ministers concerned have established a standard for certain stuff and have said, for instance, that milk is not to be sold unless it conforms to certain standards, why should not the retailer be entitled to claim that a statement has been made to him in an invoice that something has been passed on to him described as milk?</P>
    <P>Where the milk is standardised, why should not the retailer be able to stand on that as if it were a written warrantly instead of having to go through the performance, which, of course, he will never achieve, of looking for a written warranty?  If he gets a written warranty, he then gets a certain degree forward in his defence.  He does not get the whole length.  He has to prove what is contained in the other two subsections&mdash;that the stuff is of a certain quality and all the rest of it, and that he had no reason to believe that it was otherwise than it was purported to him to be.  I ask here that we should say that a name or description entered in an invoice shall be deemed to be a written warranty that the food to which the entry refers is of such nature, substance and quality that the person can sell under that name or description without contravening any part of the Act or regulations made thereunder. As I say, it is the new legislation in England and it has been produced there because of the feeling that there the retailer was badly treated in connection with this particular type of circumstance. I suggest that we should realise in the same way the difficulties of the retailer and we should make this limited approach to him.  It does not go very far.  It simply says something shall be considered a warranty and that fits into the framework of paragraph (d).</P>

      <P>I am prepared to examine it in the light of what Deputy <Col N="1692" /> McGilligan has said but I am not favourably disposed towards accepting the amendment.  According to Deputy McGilligan's statement regarding this amendment, taking the example he gave, milk, a mere mention on the invoice of &ldquo;milk&rdquo; would appear to imply that when the commodity was delivered and sold it conformed with the regulations under Section 71 and whatever standards may have been prescribed under Section 72 and possibly, also, the requirements of Section 73.  I wonder is it wise?  If we hope for any material improvement in standards of foods from the operation of this Part of the Bill when it becomes an Act, if we concede too much in relation to these sections, will we not bring about a position under which the results that all sections of the House would aim at will be beyond achievement?  Perhaps Deputy McGilligan would make it clear to me that there is an insuperable difficulty on the part of the retailer in getting a written warranty. If he can merely produce an invoice and pass that off as a warranty for the purposes of this Act, it seems to me that we are weakening the section to the point where it will be practically useless.  Is there any insurmountable difficulty on the part of a retailer in getting a warranty?</P>

      <P>There is plenty. Whether a retailer gets a warranty in writing or whether, under my amendment, he gets an invoice with a name or description, either of these things does not get him out of the prosecution.  Under paragraph (d) he has to prove that he had no reason to believe at the time when he sold the thing described as milk that it was of a different nature or quality or in a different condition and that he sold it in the same state as when he purchased it.  Those things are parts of the successful defence.  Even though he proves that the article was not changed and was sold in the same state as when he got it and that he had no reason to believe it was anything different from what it was purported to be sold under, that does not get him out unless he has a written warranty.  Even if he gets a written <Col N="1693" /> warranty, or has this name or description, he has still to prove that he purchased it as being of the nature, substance and quality and in a condition which would not contravene the regulations.  The only slight change I ask is that instead of a warranty he can say that he has an invoice with a description on it and let that pass for a warranty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man invoices milk to me, he may be a producer or a producer wholesaler, he knows that he is purporting to sell me something inside the regulations.  Why should I not be enabled to pass the offence back to him if I have proved that I sold it in the state in which I got it; that I had no reason to believe it was anything except milk in accordance with the regulations; and that I purchased it as being of that type?  Why should I not be able to rely on the invoice just the same as on the warranty?  Let us take other things.  Suppose people buy imported foodstuffs in containers. Injustice is often done to a completely innocent retailer, a man to whom the court will say when fining him: &ldquo;We believe you did not change the product; but there you are, the law says I must fine you and here is the fine.&rdquo; The only way a man can get out of it is by having a written warranty. Retailers never get that.  Manufacturers will not give a warranty.  They know that retailers must buy somewhere. Once they take the line that they will not give a warranty, the retailer is at their mercy.  He must get stuff to sell and, if anything goes wrong, he has to meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not break down this system of making responsible the man who sells. I am not talking about a civil action that may arise later under which the person who sells may be brought up under the ordinary law.  I am talking merely of the prosecution.  Why should not a person be enabled to get out of a prosecution if he says: &ldquo;There is the invoice and on it is a description that is a well-known description and that is as good as any warranty&rdquo;?  The amendment that I suggest is taken out <Col N="1694" /> of the latest English legislation, with one change.  The change I have made is that I have put in the phrase: &ldquo;a written warranty given pursuant to a stipulation made at the time of sale.&rdquo; That is not included in the English Act.  It is a thing which retailers are asked to demand of wholesalers when they are getting invoices from them&mdash; that they should write a letter putting on record that the invoice is required as a stipulation made at the time of sale.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Deputy McGilligan's statement with regard to milk, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that milk is a different problem from many of the other problems which may arise under the section.  For instance, you may have a retailer pleading under sub-section (3) (d) that he sold milk as he received it, whereas he could have easily adulterated it. Such things have happened.  No producer or wholesaler will ever give a warranty to a retailer that the milk is pure, although the retailers often demand it.  They are advised legally that they should never do it.  The retailer may adulterate the milk.  It lends itself to adulteration in the hands of a retailer.  Mill stuffs or meals, for instance, do not lend themselves to adulteration.  Butter, however, can be adulterated by mixing margarine with it.  Retailers have done that, as has been proved in court. Milk may also be adulterated in the hands of a retailer.  I want to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that this section may be unfair to producers or wholesalers of milk.  A retailer may plead that he sold the milk as he received it, although the milk had been adulterated by adding water.  If a retailer can plead under this section that the milk was sold as he got it from the producer or wholesaler&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The section may be all right in respect of products which cannot be adulterated or altered in the hands of the retailer.  It is all right in regard to cornflour or other meals which cannot be adulterated in the hands of the retailer.  But in regard to milk and milk products, it is very dangerous and unfair to the producer or wholesaler.  There was one case recently where a retailer pleaded in court that he sold the milk as he got it from the wholesaler.  In a very short time the contrary was proved, because he was actually found watering the milk.  The provision is dangerous in that respect.  It is all right where the retailer cannot alter the substance or nature of the food, but it is a different matter when he can alter the substance and nature of products, such as milk and milk products.</P>

That is the worst case of hardship of the lot&mdash;the article which comes in in a sealed container <Col N="1696" /> and with which the retailer can do nothing.  He admits in court that he has not done anything with it and the court accepts his attitude that he believed he had got what he had ordered and, notwithstanding all that, unless he produces a written warranty, he is to be convicted and fined.

      <P>(a)  food kept for human consumption in an establishment to which this section applies shall be deemed to be kept therein for sale for human consumption,</P>
      <P>(b)  where any such food is consumed in the establishment by any person, it shall be deemed to have been sold for human consumption,</P>
      <P>(c)  in any prosecution for an offence under this Part of this Act in relation to any such food, the food shall be deemed, until the contrary is proved, to have been kept for human consumption in the establishment.</P>
      <P>(2)  Each of the following shall be an establishment to which this section applies:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any school or college,</P>

Food may be raised on a farm and used by the management of <Col N="1697" /> such an institution, such as milk, butter, cheese, beef, mutton and so on, and the idea is to ensure that such food offered for consumption to a particular section of the community in these institutions should be of the required standard.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert the following sub-section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  If the county medical officer of a county is aggrieved by a decision of the urban sanitary authority of any urban district therein in relation to duties assigned by the said authority to him under paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) of this section, he may appeal against such decision to the Minister in the prescribed manner and on notice to the said authority, and thereupon the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Minister, after consideration of such appeal and of the representations (if any) of the said authority in relation thereto, shall either (as he thinks proper) refuse such appeal or give to the said authority such directions as he considers will remedy the grievance of such officer,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  if any direction is given by the Minister under paragraph (a) of this sub-section to the said <Col N="1707" /> authority, the said authority shall comply with it.</P>
    <P>Section 78 (2) of the Bill set out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The office of the county medical officer of a county shall be an office under the council of the county and the salary and expenses of the office shall be raised by the council of the county as a county-at-large charge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That has been amended so that the salary and expenses of the office shall be paid by the county council.  In amendment No. 54 the county medical officer of a county is required to perform such duties as may be assigned to him by the urban sanitary authority of any urban district within the county. The amendment is for the purpose of providing machinery for an appeal to the Minister by a county medical officer who feels aggrieved by the decision of any urban sanitary authority in relation to the duties assigned to him.  The county medical officer is really, to some extent, under the control of both the county council and the urban authority. This is only a machinery amendment so as to provide an appeal to the Minister in case the officer feels aggrieved.</P>

      <P>My purpose is this.  We have not heard very much from the Parliamentary Secretary as to the extent to which the duties and responsibilities of a county medical officer will be changed as a result of this measure.  But they will be very considerably changed, to an extent that there will be a radical alteration in the terms of his appointment and the general work he will be required to do.  That being so, there is to some extent a change in the contract between himself and the local authority.  I suggest in my amendment that on his signifying his willingness in writing to the health authority he shall become the new medical officer. I want also to put in the new sub-section outlined in amendment No. 58 which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (7), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(7)  A person who immediately before the commencement of this section held the office of county medical officer of health of a county under Section 21 (repealed by this Act) of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925) and who does not desire to continue in office on the passing of this Act, shall be retired and shall have his period of office for the purpose of calculating his pension increased by one-third of the number of years served, or not more than ten years, whichever is the least.</P>

    <P>Where you have a public servant who is in an office with a particular contract with the local authority, and the <Col N="1709" /> terms of the contract are substantially changed, I submit it is in accordance with practice to give that person the opportunity of resigning and compensate him for his loss of office.  I suggest there are considerable changes taking place in the duties that will devolve on county medical officers under this measure.</P>

I do not subscribe to the view put forward by Deputy Mulcahy that we are, under this Bill, extending the duties of county medical officers of health.</P>
      <P>We are doing nothing of the kind. We are undoubtedly providing them with a better machinery for the purpose of discharging their duties.  We are not imposing any new duties upon them.  There is no earthly reason why we should afford them an opportunity to resign, and add ten years to the period of their professional services.</P>

      <P>There is no foundation for such a proposal.  As far as I am aware, the county medical officers of health have not the slightest intention of resigning.  They welcome the provisions of the Bill, because they know, when it becomes law, they will be in a better position to discharge the duties which they are trying to discharge at the present time under considerable difficulties and handicaps. Suppose a medical officer of health has reached the age of 60 or 65, are we to say to him: &ldquo;Now is a good time to resign and to add ten years to your service?  You will get a good pension&rdquo;.  Apart from that, the whole idea behind such a proposal has no foundation.  I stated already, and I say again, that we are not imposing new duties on our county medical officers of health.  Their duties in relation to health are of the widest possible nature at present.  There is no extension of <Col N="1710" /> them, but we are providing better machinery to enable them to discharge these duties with the fullest satisfaction.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that county medical officers are getting a better machine. They are being given greater responsibility for the machinery that existed already.  The amendment states that the county medical officer shall be the chief medical officer for the purposes of the Act.  It seems to me that county medical officers are now being made chief supervising officers of the whole medical health services in their area, in respect to dispensary doctors, nursing services and the various institutions. They get new responsibility in relation to all these persons and establishments.  How the Parliamentary Secretary can assert that by being given new machinery and new responsibility they are not being saddled with greater responsibility I do not know. It seems to me that under the Bill the whole relationship of a county medical officer of health to the medical organisation in his area is being radically changed.</P>

Every Deputy knows well that medical officers have no fault to find with the Bill, nor have they complained that it is going to impose any additional duties upon them.  They are very glad that they are going to be furnished with a more efficient machine for the proper discharge of their duties.  Why should this House set out to induce them, by adding ten years, to leave the service, as well as adding the expense to the rates when, if they go out, they will have to be pensioned?</P>

      <P>The House is being asked to pass a section that will <Col N="1712" /> radically change the responsibility of these officers and, therefore, there is a radical change in the contract entered into between the State, as represented by the local authorities, and those who are county medical officers of health.  It is not right that we should pass a law radically changing the terms of the contract without giving them the traditional facility to opt out and leave the service, with compensation for loss of office.  For county medical officers of health this is loss of office of a particular kind with an offer of a change. If there is even one who is not satisfied with the change and who considers the responsibilities that are being placed on him under this Bill are not the kind of responsibilities that he wishes to undertake or that he thinks himself capable of undertaking, he should be allowed to go out.  I do not know if I detected in a phrase of the Parliamentary Secretary that there may be some of them that may not be up to the standard that is required here and that he may be shifting them in a couple of years.  I do not think that is fair.  If men are performing satisfactorily the particular kind of work that they contracted for, it is not good enough to impose increased responsibilities on them by Act of Parliament and then in two years' time, if the Parliamentary Secretary or anybody else thinks that they are not equal to their new duties, just to push them out.  This Bill is definitely changing the responsibilities and the contract of county medical officers of health and I think the House should recognise that.  It is a mean practice and it is an unworthy practice that by an Act here we should change contracts of this particular kind and not make the usual provision that has been regarded as the normal type of thing to do in legislation up to the present, that is, to agree that there is a breach of contract and, in addition to whatever pensionable rights derive under the contract, to give additional service for pension purposes because of such breach of contract.</P>

      <P>The arguments of Deputy Mulcahy will leave everyone stone cold. It would seem to the House that he <Col N="1713" /> had in mind some medical officers of health who probably feel that they are unable for their duties, and this is an easy way out for them.  That is the only thing that would strike any Deputy listening to him.  But we do know that the medical officers of health will have new machinery and new powers under this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>New powers for enforcing the law that they have been trying to enforce without those powers in the past.  That is the only difference in their status.  We know quite well that they will have new machinery and better machinery for doing the work that they have been trying, very often under difficult circumstances, to do in the past.  Is not that true?  Medical officers of health, as we know them, were officers who devoted all their time and gave all their energy.  They worked an ordinary day like any other citizens.  Their hours are not fixed; their hours are not extended in this Bill; their remuneration is not reduced. Under this Bill, maybe their remuneration will be increased, for all we know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Who started the red herring? It was the Deputy who brought the red herring across.  This is a red herring brought in as an amendment. It is quite true it does not appear in the Bill except as a red herring introduced on this amendment by Deputy Mulcahy.  We do not even know whether it is a salt one or not, but certainly none of the arguments advanced by Deputy Mulcahy would influence the House or any member of the House to make provision to encourage <Col N="1714" /> comparatively young men to retire and to give them ten years or one-third of their service in respect of the few years that they have been in the service.  That is what it amounts to.  You are encouraging a set of comparatively young men, none of whom has been in the service for longer than about 20 years, to leave at this stage. I think the House will be very slow to impose such an additional burden. Deputy Mulcahy, and probably rightly so, on many occasions complained about the burden this Bill may impose on local authorities.  He comes in here now with an amendment that would put a substantial burden on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In very many avenues in life men can carry on only by making contracts with one another and understanding that these contracts will be honourably upheld.  If the State enters into contracts, the State ought to be scrupulous in the way in which it should keep those contracts To-day, the State is not so scrupulous about the way in which it does things and, apparently, Deputy Allen has as little scruples as the Parliamentary Secretary in certain of these matters. I feel substantial backing for my argument that under this section the duties and the responsibilities of county medical officers of health will be substantially increased when they find themselves county medical officers and in recognition of that fact, which, I think, is fairly clear in the back of Deputy Allen's mind, he suggests that county medical officers will get increased pay. Of course they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But those who are not satisfied to accept increased responsibility, even for increased pay, should not have their contract broken in the way in which this proposal definitely breaks it.  That is my purpose in introducing this amendment and I introduce it as a matter of principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out again that there is not any question, or cannot be any question, of a breach of <Col N="1715" /> contract with the medical officers of health in this matter.  I do not know whether repetition will get the facts to sink in but, once again, let me say that we are not adding to the duties of our county medical officers of health.  We are merely providing them with a more efficient machine for the proper discharge of their duties.  We were told that the State should be scrupulous in the observance of its contracts, and while I do not disagree with that principle, I do want to say quite definitely that there is not any question of even a breach of faith with the county medical officers in this regard.  Deputy Allen has apparently registered in the back of his mind the possibility that, arising out of this Bill and because of the contents of this Bill, there may be some increase in salary.  Deputy Mulcahy seemed to take comparatively kindly to that also.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say on that issue is, that there is no undertaking given to the county medical officer of health or to anybody else in association with this Bill that there will be any increase in salaries.  If there is any question of the adequacy or other wise of their remuneration, that will be adjudicated upon quite apart from anything that may arise in this Bill. There are no increased duties being imposed upon them and, on the basis of this Bill, no case could be made for increased remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing peculiar about it.  I do not admit for a moment, and I never have, either in this House or outside it, that this Bill is imposing increased duties upon county medical officers of health, because there was no limit to their duties as county medical officers of health under the existing law.  There is a lot of to-do about all this question.  Even if we were imposing <Col N="1716" /> new duties on them, we have a statutory right to do that.  Deputies must be acquainted with the terms of the Local Government Act, 1941. Section 10 (1) (b) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every officer appointed or servant employed by a local authority shall perform such duties and be paid such remuneration as such local authority may from time to time assign to him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then we come to Section 20 (1) of the 1941 Act which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The appropriate Minister may by declaration do all or any of the following things in respect of a specified office in relation to which he is the appropriate Minister or in respect to such of the officers in relation to which he is the appropriate Minister as belong to a specified class, description or grade, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  define the duties of holders thereof,</P>
      <P>(b)  assign a particular duty to holders thereof,</P>
      <P>(c)  define the places or limits within which all or any of the duties of holders thereof are to be performed.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every declaration made under this section shall have the force of law in relation to the office or offices in respect of which it was made and to holders thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, there is no question whatever of the statutory powers that exist at the present time to impose extra duties on medical officers of health, if it were necessary to avail of these statutory powers.  But it is not necessary to avail of these or any other statutory powers in relation to duties arising under this Bill, because this Bill does not impose any extra duties on them.</P>

May I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there are more amendments to this Part of the Bill in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary than to any other part of the Bill?  That is due to the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary, as he admitted in an earlier discussion, had his consultation with the county medical officers of health subsequent to the Second Reading of the Bill and not before it was introduced.

      <P>I will leave that answer to the House.  Whether they have or have not said it, I have no hesitation in saying, as a result of a few weeks' discussion of this Bill in Committee, that it certainly does impose new and far more onerous responsibilities on them.  I do not think there is any question about that.  If we go back to Section 29 particularly, there is no use in the Parliamentary Secretary telling me that there is nothing in that that he had not under previous Acts. That was exploded here long ago.  I have not any particular reason to plead for any extra benefits or concessions for the county medical officers of health. No matter how much the Parliamentary Secretary or Deputy Allen may scoff, I do say that there is a definite principle involved in this amendment.  They ought to admit that.  The Parliamentary Secretary quotes from the 1941 Act.  He is merely quoting there the conditions laid down when a man accepts a position. There are no new duties, he says; there is better machinery to enable him to perform his duties in a more easy fashion.  But the Parliamentary Secretary would not say that the salaries are not to be increased.  He says they are not to be increased as a result of anything in this measure.  That is pure eye-wash.  If they are increased, how are we to know whether they are increased because of this measure or because of any other measure?  Nobody but the Parliamentary Secretary will know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that the Parliamentary Secretary in one of his statements intimated that he wanted more money for dispensary medical officers.  I should like to know if I heard aright and if he did make that statement.  Secondly, I should like to know if he meant to include county medical officers of health in that statement. As Deputy Morrissey has said, it is very hard to believe that, if this Bill becomes an Act, the county medical officers of health will not have more duties to perform.  He admits himself that dispensary medical officers will, and I think it only reasonable to expect that the county medical officers of health will also.</P>
      <P>I think the amendment is reasonable, because I believe that, when by recent local government legislation, boards of health were amalgamated with county councils and the officers transferred to county councils, in all cases major officers were given the option of signifying their willingness to retain their status&mdash;in other words, to retain their jobs&mdash;and it is only reasonable to give county medical officers of health the same option.  I believe also that, under that recent legislation amalgamating boards of health and county councils, these officers also had the right to appeal to the Minister if they thought their duties were increased or made more onerous, and for that reason I am prepared to support the amendment.  It does not mean a whole lot.  It will not disturb the position with regard to public health or the affairs of a county council to any great extent.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 5, to delete the words &ldquo;one or more than one&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;an&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment, apart altogether from the interesting discussion we have had about the duties of the <Col N="1724" /> county medical officers of health, in the course of which the Parliamentary Secretary said that no additional duties are being put on these officers. The section says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by Order provide that there shall be one or more than one assistant county medical officer for a particular county.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It implies that there is to be considerable volume of work for these officers other than the work at present carried on by county medical officers of health. It also implies that the number of things which may be done under this Bill is greater than any of us could conceive, and perhaps greater than the Parliamentary Secretary himself has any conception of.  My particular interest, as I have reiterated on section after section, is that I stand here as the champion of the ratepayers of my county.  They have no protector against the actions of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government in imposing additional and unreasonable burdens, in imposing fresh taxation, on them, except the Deputies here, and their own Deputies in particular.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made no case whatever for the appointment of one or more than one assistant county medical officer of health.  When I originally put down the amendment restricting it to one, I was convinced that there might be additional duties which might make it necessary to have an assistant; but, having listened to the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to Deputy Mulcahy's amendment to the other section, I think there is no room whatever for doubt that there is no necessity for an assistant in any county, that the duties of the county medical officer of health are not extended in any way in this Bill, which is not imposing any new duty on them. I must oppose any attempt to give power to appoint these assistants <i>ad lib</i>, whenever the Minister chooses. The possibility of spending money on this particular section would be considerable all over the country, and I, for one, will not agree to it, and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>When a Deputy in opposition moves an amendment, one would expect that some members of the Party, if they were supporting it, would speak in favour of it and would endeavour to make a case for it.  Sub-section (1) of Section 79 sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by Order provide that there shall be one or more than one assistant county medical officer for a particular county.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett seeks to restrict the appointment of assistant medical officers to one appointment, regardless of any set of circumstances that may arise in any particular county.  Circumstances may arise in certain counties where the assistance of more than one assistant may be necessary.  The most likely development along those lines would arise out of the provision of sanatoria and the intensified development of the campaign against tuberculosis. It may be necessary to have more than one assistant in certain counties.</P>
      <P>If it is not necessary, more than one will not be appointed.  This proposal&mdash; which would be represented, I presume, as another of those encroachments by the Minister&mdash;is the counterpart of Section 11 of the Local Government Act, 1941.  That section sets out that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The appropriate Minister may, by Order, direct the kind and number of the officers to be appointed by a local authority for any purpose and thereupon it shall be the duty of such local authority to appoint for that purpose such and so many (and no other) officers as may be necessary to conform with the requirements of such Order.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this measure&mdash;not so much from the point of view of the improvement in the measure, but from the point of view of its educational effect on the public. The public are thinking in terms of public health now in a manner they were not thinking of it before this Bill came under discussion.  I believe there will be a much better understanding of the magnitude and importance of the matters connected with public health as a result of the display we have had from the Opposition Parties. I give them credit for having made a few useful suggestions; I would not like to say that they have been of no help at all.  They have, but I think a little less than 500 or 600 amendments would probably have done.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand why, in a matter of health, an attempt has to be made to tie the Minister up.  In section after section an effort is made to deprive him of powers that may be necessary, and almost certainly will be necessary, for the proper discharge of his duties. Day after day, in section after section, an effort is made to deprive him of those powers, utterly regardless of whether or not they were enshrined in the law when the Opposition Party were a Government.  It looks as if the debate is going to continue in that way.</P>

Why should this section not read: &ldquo;that the local authority may, with the consent of the Minister, provide that there shall be one or more assistant medical officers of health&rdquo;?  Is the local authority to be completely set aside and this whole business to be a brass-hat affair, the high brass-hat being the Minister, and all action in relation to public health carried on by order, dictated from the Minister?  That is the objection I take to this section, if objection is to be taken at all.</P>
      <P>If the local authority is to be called a public health authority, it ought to have some kind of responsibility thrown on it to look after the machinery and see whether the machinery is adequate.  The authority should at least be in a position to make recommendations to the Minister for increases or changes in that machinery. We are dealing here with a new public health scheme and, apparently, we are not to have any kind of consultative council here on top, to bring general thought on social medicine together for the information of Parliament or of the Minister.  Down the country the so-called public health authorities will not be allowed to suggest whether there ought to be one, or two, or three assistant county medical officers.  They have to leave all these decisions and recommendations to the Minister. That is what I see wrong with the section.</P>

      <P>Now we are making provision for one, or more than one, assistant, where the existing county medical officer is not capable of performing all the duties imposed on him as a result of this legislation.  This obviously has proved that the Parliamentary Secretary feels that the duties will be so onerous that one man will not be capable of performing them.  At the same time, the Parliamentary Secretary does not trust the local authority to make the provision.  We must still have control and order from the Custom House and, regardless of what the local authority feels so far as ample provision for public health administration in an administrative area is concerned, the Custom House will decide, over its head, what provision should be made with reference to county medical officers.  I would expect that in dealing with this matter the arguments and reasons advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary would at least be consistent.  He has shown no consistency.</P>

There will be plenty more work but, so that there will not be any heavier load on the shoulders of the county medical officer, we will supply him with enough assistants to shoulder the extra burden.

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asks, at this stage of the Bill, why the Minister is insisting on providing&mdash; why he will not allow the local authority to provide.  He asks that question at this stage of this Bill and after the Committee Stage of the Local Government Bill&mdash;why are we not going to allow the local authority?  Is it not clear to everybody in the House that there will be no local authority, as such, in this country?  That is the reason this is being done.  The local authority will be there for one purpose. We are told here that the Minister may, by order, provide an assistant or assistants, and then the Bill goes on to say that the local authority shall strike a rate and raise the money to pay them.  The local authority is there only in name.  It is there as a sort of &ldquo;Aunt Sally&rdquo; for the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>All over the country, when we have a few more of these assistants appointed and salaries fixed by the local authority&mdash;to wit, the county manager &mdash;we will have a lot of people attacking the county councils, as foolish people in Dublin have been attacking the corporation about raising the rates and, of course, ratepayers in the country, if the Minister can help it, will not see him hiding behind the facade of the so-called local authority.</P>
      <P>The local authority will be there to receive the rotten eggs and the Minister will not.  That is the only function they will provide.  Deputies are waking up to it as this Bill goes on. There may be one or more than one assistant.  There can be ten if the Parliamentary Secretary considers they are necessary or desirable, and the local authority will have no function except to provide ten additional salaries.  They will not have the fixing of the salaries either.  All they will be allowed to do is to pay.</P>

I think if the Parliamentary Secretary wanted to meet the House in a reasonable way he would consider altering the sub-section by putting in some limit.  He did try, more or less, to provoke additional opposition, if that was his idea, by suggesting that this debate has awakened considerable interest and has had an educating effect on the public.  I happened to notice that it has awakened some prominent medical men and they have started writing to the <i>Irish Press</i> in a very critical vein towards this Bill and all it sets out to achieve; so there seems to be a little truth getting into the news as a result.</P>

      <P>When I put down this amendment, I did not anticipate it would give rise to as interesting a discussion as we have had.  The gods have been good to me.  The Minister's argument on the previous section gave me ammunition to make a case I would not otherwise have made for the amendment.  But the Minister has <Col N="1731" /> failed to make any good argument against it.  I am not relying on the case that the Minister made for the amendment when he more than suggested there were no extra duties whatsoever being placed on existing medical officers or that their duties were being extended in any way.  The Parliamentary Secretary has denied that and made no case for any extra county medical officers.</P>
      <P>My chief objection to this Bill, and it is that of other Deputies, is that whatever good is in it&mdash;and there is a lot that is good in it&mdash;is obliterated by this blot, that the Government is providing no financial assistance to work it, but is placing the burden on the unfortunate ratepayers, who are already incapable of bearing the other burdens placed on them.  Deputies could not put down an amendment proposing that the Government should bear the expenditure incurred under this measure.  That would be ruled out of order.  Accordingly, the only way we can lessen the burden on local ratepayers is by offering all the opposition we can to placing any extra taxation on them.  This is the one section on which we see a possibility of preventing even an extra halfpenny being placed on the rates.  Ratepayers are now unable to help themselves, as those who have been elected to represent them on local bodies have no longer any power.  These local representatives have not had any power for the last ten years.  The only possible help the ratepayers will get is whatever help they get in this House, to resist the imposition of extra taxation.</P>

      <P>I should like to take advantage of this section to get some information on another matter. The Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of the discussion last week&mdash;I <Col N="1736" /> think on Section 34&mdash;talked about a campaign of case-finding in relation to tuberculosis.  I gathered that it was the intention of his Department, when this Bill became law, to initiate an intensive campaign with particular reference to tuberculosis.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would be good enough to tell us by what machinery that is going to be done.  Does he consider that the county medical officer will be able to superintend that campaign in relation to tuberculosis, apart from all the other activities, or is it in relation to that campaign and others that this section was inserted; or are we to take it that the campaign in connection with tuberculosis will be conducted by the ordinary dispensary doctors who become district medical officers under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I presume, is aware that in most counties at the present time we have an assistant county medical officer of health who is specially earmarked for tuberculosis work.  Presumably, where we have a tuberculosis medical officer&mdash;and that is in most areas&mdash;the tuberculosis medical officer will supervise any case-finding campaign that may be launched.  But, in the main, the personnel that would man the case-finding campaign would be more of the technician type, such as radiographers.  As soon as we are able to supply mass radiography plant we hope to provide the facility as rapidly as we can to make it available throughout the provinces.  Of course, that will undoubtedly be a slow development.  We have been held up for quite a long time in the provision of the plant in Dublin.  It will be technical personnel that will be required for that purpose rather than professional.  The reading of photographs will be a fairly technical process but provision will be made for experts where there is any doubt.  If there is any doubt or difficulty we will have to have the assistance of radiologists for the reading of pictures that are not particularly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this particular section I do not think the matter arises but at any rate I have no hesitation in giving the Deputy any information that I have at my disposal but I do not think I can <Col N="1737" /> give him very much more guidance than that.  Whether that is sufficient to satisfy him or not or whether he will be able to pick any hole in it for a debating point, I do not know.  He appears to be in very good debating mood this evening.

I did not raise the point merely as a debating point.  I am thankful to him for the information he gave regarding the technical approach to this question of tuberculosis in so far as mass radiography is concerned. The Parliamentary Secretary's reply dealt with what happens when the cases have been found and brought to the appropriate institution where the technical experts could be brought to bear on them.  There are, as he said, assistant county medical officers of health whose time is given almost completely to tuberculosis work.  Even then, with what they have been able to do and what they are still doing, am I to take it that this is the full extent of the effort to be made in case-finding?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 75:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The office of a district medical officer shall be an office under the county authority for his district, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where the district of a district medical officer consists of a part in a county and a part in a county borough, such district medical officer shall, as respects the part in the county, be an officer of the county and, as respects the part in the county borough, be an officer of the corporation of the county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  where the whole or any part <Col N="1742" /> of the district of a district medical officer is situated in an urban district, the office of such officer shall, as respects assignment of duties (other than duties relating to infectious diseases) to be performed in the whole or the part of the district situated in the urban district (as the case may be), be deemed for the purposes of Section 10 of the Act of 1941 to be an office under the urban sanitary authority for the urban district.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the district of a district medical officer consists of a portion of a dispensary district, sub-section (2) of this section shall have effect in relation to him as if any reference therein to a dispensary district were a reference to such portion of a dispensary district.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to declare the office of a district medical officer to be an office under the county authority for his district, subject to certain modifications as follows: (1) where the district of a district medical officer is partly in a county and partly in a county borough, he shall be an officer of the county council as regards the part of his district in that county and an officer of the corporation of the county borough as respects the part of his district in the county borough; (2) where the district of a district medical officer is wholly or partly in an urban district, his office shall as respects assignment of duties (other than infectious disease duties) to be performed in respect of the whole or part of his district situated in the urban area, be deemed, for the purposes of Section 10 of the Local Government Act, 1941, to be an office under the urban sanitary authority for the urban district.  Section 10 is the section which provides for an appeal to the Minister by an aggrieved person.  The third modification is: where the district of a district medical officer consists of portion of a dispensary district, the above-mentioned reference shall have effect in relation to him as if any such reference to a dispensary district were a reference to such portion of a dispensary district. It is really a machinery amendment. There is no principle in it that could be regarded as contentious.</P>

      <P>I cannot put my finger on the section, but I think that was the term used in an earlier section. I want to know whether the district medical officer and the authorised medical officer are one and the same person.  If so, it would mean that these medical officers would be exercising functions in relation to earlier <Col N="1744" /> sections as well as the mother and child scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the infectious diseases provision the dispensary medical officer is the medical officer of health for the dispensary district.  He would be an authorised officer for certain purposes. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the county medical officer is the medical officer for making the detention order; but the district medical officer has very definite functions as medical officer of health, apart from his duties as a dispensary medical officer.  He will, of course, be very much of a health officer under the new system, if he is brought into medical charge of the mother and child scheme, and the inspection of school children which will arise under the development of that scheme, if the plan is adopted by the House.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 83 proposes that a health authority may disseminate information and advice on matters relating to health by advertisements, notices, pamphlets, lectures, radio, cinema exhibitions and any other means, and the sub-section which I move to delete says that the Minister may by Order direct every health authority, every health authority of a particular class or a particular health authority, as to the subjects in relation to which, the manner in which and the extent to which they are to exercise their powers under sub-section (1) of this section and a health authority to which any such direction relates shall comply therewith.  Again, the health authority for a district is not to be allowed to use its initiative in relation to its district and the problems of its district to decide what means it will adopt to spread information and intelligence with regard to health matters.  It is again the brass-hat operating, when it should be left to local circumstances and the local representative intelligence saddled by the local elector with responsibility for looking after the situation.  I think it very wrong that a health authority should not be given a free hand to decide in what way it <Col N="1746" /> will carry out its duty of educating its public on health problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of this section is the one which appeals to me perhaps more than any other in the Bill, in that I believe, given proper effect to, it would probably do more for public health than many of the very drastic sections in the earlier parts of the Bill.  It is rather a pity that sub-section (2) goes on to destroy the spirit and the helpfulness of the provision.  In relation to this matter of education on health matters by publicity and propaganda, what we want is not the Minister at the top directing the local authority but the closest possible co-operation between the Department and the local authority, and if the Parliamentary Secretary would only insert the word &ldquo;advise&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;by Order direct&rdquo;, we would get far better results.  I am perfectly satisfied, from my knowledge of local authorities, that, in relation to public health, local authorities will be only too pleased to carry out any publicity or advertising of a propaganda campaign which the Department, out of their experience and as a result of the advice of their experts, advise should be carried out, but I object again, as we have had to object in regard to various sections, to giving the Minister power to direct a local authority to do anything he thinks fit and to make the local authority pay for it.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in my opinion, would get better results if he acted merely in an advisory capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I believe that we have not been doing anything at all like what we should do in the matter of publicity.  Our newspapers, our hoardings and our schools, in particular, have not been used at all for educating our people in the matter of attaining a better standard of health, and perhaps&mdash;what we heard so much about last week&mdash;better standards of cleanliness and so on.  If we had set out earlier, in the last 20 or 25 years, on an intensive campaign of education, there would be no necessity for a Bill of the type we have before us.  So far as I am concerned, either as a member <Col N="1747" /> of this House or of a local authority, I would be prepared to vote for any expenditure within reason under this heading, because I have far more faith in its lasting results than I have in the results to be secured from the operation of some of the drastic sections in the Bill.  You may bring a person by force into an institution and you may, by force, clean, disinfect and disinfest him for the time being, but the mere fact of doing that will not change his habits.  If he is a person who is naturally dirty, a person whose dirty state does not arise because of the conditions in which he lives, I am afraid it is only a very temporary relief.</P>
    <P>I have far more belief in the lasting effect of an educational campaign carried on through the newspapers and through publicity of every description in the cinemas and, above all, in the schools.  I believe we can do more by a proper educational campaign in the schools, and particularly in the girls' schools, towards having not only a healthier race but cleaner and more economically run homes, on which health depends to a great extent.  I am very sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary has put in this word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; again, and is taking powers to direct a local authority to do what he thinks should be done instead of giving them advice.  I would like to give my fullest possible support to this section, and if <Col N="1748" /> the Parliamentary Secretary does not agree with me now, I think he will later.  I do not know whether I can take his smile as suggesting that he could never hope to find himself in agreement with me or whether it means simply that he has no faith in anybody&mdash;local authority or anybody else&mdash;outside himself and his own Department.</P>
