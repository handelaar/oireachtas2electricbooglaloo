If, however, particulars are furnished to my Department of any cases in which there is reason to believe that prices charged for blacksmith's coal are unreasonably high they will be investigated.

      <P>The types of iron referred to come under the provisions of Emergency Powers (Mild Steel) (Maximum Prices) Order, 1946, which sets out the basic prices for rounds or rods, squares, flats and angles as £33 10s. 0d. per ton, free on rail, when sold wholesale, and £38 10s. 0d. per ton when sold retail.

      <P>The question may be hypothetical, but the proposal to bring portion of this railway system under the control of the Six Counties is not hypothetical, and the prospect of the main workshops of that company being transferred is a definite possibility which should be investigated by the Minister.  I suggest to him that, in the light of the livelihood of many hundreds of workers in the Dundalk workshops, regard should be given to that possibility, to which reference was made in the course of the debates in this House when the Transport Act was going through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The three trustees of the National Health Insurance Society are, under statute, appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health from year to year, and they act as members of the Committee of Management of the National Health Insurance Society. Last year I invited each of the outgoing trustees to continue to act during the current year.  Bearing in mind, however, certain events which had transpired during the most recent term of office of that Committee of Management I considered it necessary to make explicit what might reasonably be regarded as the minimum obligations of courtesy, good faith and cooperation which any Minister of State is entitled to expect from those whom he appoints to fiduciary offices.  I accordingly asked those whom I proposed to appoint to the committee to give me the following assurances (1) that they would strive to ensure that a close and cordial liaison was maintained between the Committee of Management and the Ministry; (2) that should anything arise which might disturb harmonious relations they would inform the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary who appointed them, and (3) that before publicly raising any such matter with the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary they would resign.  It is clear that these assurances would not fetter in any way the independence of judgement of members of the Committee of Management. Unfortunately, two of the outgoing trustees felt unable to give these assurances and, in such circumstances, I was regretfully unable to reappoint them when their statutory term of office expired.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the Deputy's question, I am satisfied that the persons whom I appointed in place of the two former trustees possess all the qualifications of character and experience of affairs necessary to enable them to carry out their duties in the best interests of the society and of its members.</P>

      <P>A person who ceases to be in insurable employment within the meaning of the National Health Insurance and Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts may normally become a voluntary contributor only if he makes application within 12 months of the date of his ceasing to be in such employment.  Whenever the fact that the person has ceased to be compulsorily insurable comes to the notice either of my Department or of the National Health Insurance Society during that period, he is supplied with literature informing him of his right to become a voluntary contributor and the procedure to be adopted.  The local agents of the society mentioned are available to advise the persons concerned in other cases.  In addition, certain of the cards issued to insured persons contain notes drawing attention to the voluntary side of the scheme and in the past the society has sought, by press advertising, to ensure that no eligible person will forego his rights through ignorance of the position.</P>

      <P>Contributions under the National Health Insurance and Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts are not payable after age 70.  A person who is insured at that age remains insured thereafter until death without further payment of contributions.  A person who ceases to be insurably employed and to pay contributions before that age does not go out of insurance immediately.  He remains an insured person for at least 12 months and this period is extended by periods of incapacity.  If, therefore, a person retires from employment before age 70 through ill-health his insurance is maintained without contributions as long as his incapacity lasts.  If his retirement takes place before age 69 and he is not incapacitated from work, then in order to maintain his title to benefit he must continue to pay contributions as a voluntary contributor.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the proposition that in general the means of such persons are such that they cannot afford to continue payment as voluntary contributors for the limited period involved.  The extra contribution required is only 8d. per week, and contributions are excused for weeks of sickness.  In these circumstances there are no adequate grounds for any amending legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the current restriction on the export of hunter mares is a cause of hardship to farmers, and I am satisfied that it would not be in the interests of the horse-breeding industry at present to permit the unlimited export of mares of the hunter type. The position will be reviewed in due course.  The Deputy may not be aware that since July, 1945, licences have been freely made available for the export of mares of all types not exceeding 15.1 hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently the mares for future breeding purposes have been selected.  There is an extraordinarily big number of mares of that type turned out, and are used for agricultural work.  They are really undervalued. Until the ports were opened the farmers did not know what to do with them.  There is no incentive to have breeding continued when they cannot sell the mares at four or five years of age.</P>

      <P>In view of the comparatively small number of children concerned I am not satisfied that there is need for a school at Sheeane but if arrangements can be made locally to have the children conveyed to school the question of allowing a grant towards the cost of a transport service will be considered. My Department is at present in communication with the parish priest about the matter and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution will be reached at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The final offer made by me to the teachers has been rejected by the majority of the members of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and, as far as I am aware, that body represents both male and female teachers who are members.  I have been informed by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation that 4,749 of its members voted against the acceptance of the terms offered, that 3,773 voted in favour of acceptance and that 599 of those entitled to vote did not do so. I should like to add that the total number of teachers in receipt of salary direct from the Department (i.e., excluding Brothers and Nuns in capitation schools) is about 10,750, so that there were apparently more than 1,600 teachers who were not eligible to take part in the organisation's referendum. Since only 4,749 teachers out of a total of 10,750 are definitely recorded as against the acceptance of the terms, I am unable to say that my offer has been rejected by the teachers as a whole, nor have I any information as to the numbers of married men teachers, unmarried men teachers, or women teachers represented in the figures of those who did vote.</P>
      <P>With regard to the terms of the offer made to the various classes of teachers, particulars of the new scales have appeared in the Press on the 11th instant and I presume the Deputy has seen them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2308" /> As regards the differentiation of rates of pay between male and female teachers, the claim for equal pay raises an issue which could not be decided in the case of one particular body without careful consideration of its reactions upon all other wage and salary earning classes.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the object of the offer made to the teachers was to afford improved scales of pay generally.  Since existing scales differ for men and women, it would not have been possible, from the financial point of view alone, to provide improved remuneration for the various classes of teachers and to make special provision for married men teachers to the extent that has been done, within the amount of money available, if men and women teachers were to receive the same scales of pay.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the House on more than one occasion, pensioned teachers cannot be dealt with as distinct from other classes of pensioned public servants.  The Government has come to a decision in that matter.  It was announced by the <Col N="2310" /> former Minister for Finance, now President Ó Ceallaigh, that one particular class could not be dealt with and, therefore, the question of teachers on pension cannot be dealt with unless the whole body of superannuated public servants are also dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question relates to the Army Benevolent Fund. The fund is an independent voluntary organisation, having for its principal objects and purposes the provision of relief in cases of necessity or distress for members of the reserve and ex-members of the Defence Forces and the assistance of members of the reserve and ex-members of the Defence Forces in obtaining employment.  Its affairs are centrally managed by a council consisting of a number of Army officers and chaplains and a number of ladies and gentlemen who have accepted membership.  Its rules also provide for county or area committees throughout the country for the conduct of the business of the fund within such counties or areas.  The fund is officially recognised, having been established in 1930 by the then Minister for Defence and reorganised by me last year.  It does not, however, derive any revenue from public funds.</P>
      <P>Subject to the control which the rules enable the Minister for Defence to exercise, if necessary, the fund, through its council, executive committee and local committees, manages its own affairs.  Since public funds are not involved, the Department of Defence is not responsible, either directly or indirectly, for the policy or activities of the fund.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not available in the form requested and its extraction would not justify the time and labour which would be necessary to secure it.  While lands remain on the hands of the Land Commission pending final allotment, they are let for grazing or tillage, usually to local small holders and often to the parties for whom they are intended on division. The food production requirements of the Compulsory Tillage Orders have been more than complied with so far as the arable lands on hands each year are concerned and no advantage would result from their transfer to co-operative societies.</P>

The actual number of men whom we can firmly describe as deserters to whom this section applies is 4,000.  There may be a few more than that number&mdash;I am not sure of the exact figure.  It may be 4,100.  I should say then that the number of persons passing through the Army from 1939 up to a recent date was roughly 60,000.</P>

      <P>Who joined the emergency forces and continued to serve until they either were retired on <Col N="2321" /> grounds of ill-health or for some other reason or were given indefinite leave. That number joined the forces during the emergency.  For a considerable period of time, there were 40,000, and possibly 42,000 men serving, but the figure I gave the other day of 35,000 was in fact an underestimate.  It was nearer 40,000 during the peak years of the danger period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

I do not know whether the Deputy made it firmly or whether he made it in the belief that the figures which he secured were correct figures or not.  It would be entirely wrong to say that a quarter of the Army deserted, as that figure would not be correct in any circumstances.</P>

      <P>There is no question of wishing.  It is a fact that 7,000 did desert?  It is another matter as to how many were serving on a particular date or, as the Minister puts it, how many passed through the Army.  The maximum strength attested over the whole period of the emergency was approximately 60,000, but I think the maximum ever serving was 42,000 at any particular time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>This section proposes to incorporate in a piece of permanent legislation Emergency Powers Order No. 362, 1945.  I think it is very objectionable to embody in a common piece of legislation an Order of that sort.  I would like to hear the Minister justifying this section.  I do not want to condone or defend deserters, but I believe the punishment <Col N="2323" /> provided here is altogether too drastic, when you bear in mind the reason why some men deserted.  Some deserted, possibly, to join other armies, for the purpose of having an opportunity to take part in war and the excitement associated with all that, while other members of the Defence Forces deserted for financial reasons, the allowances not being sufficient to provide a decent livelihood for them and their families.</P>
      <P>While I do not want to defend a deserter and think a deserter should be punished, it seems to me that paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) is altogether too drastic.  I think that (b), (c), (d) would be sufficient punishment for a deserter, that is, that he would not be entitled to any pension or gratuity. Surely it is a thoroughly drastic provision to deny to those men, when they come back to this country, the right of employment paid for by any moneys from the Central Fund, or employment by any local authority, or the right to hold an office as a paid member of any such board or body?  There would need to be very exceptional and very extreme circumstances before punishment of that sort should be inflicted on an individual who, perhaps, has family responsibilities.  So far as punishment is concerned, it ought to be within the powers of the normal authorities within the Army, without going outside the Army itself, to other Departments of State, to exercise punishment.  I merely rise to ask the Minister again to justify such drastic and severe punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said a moment ago, roughly 60,000 men offered their services to the State and were accepted.  A very much larger number of people offered their services, but for one reason or another they were not accepted.  Now, that shows that there was a patriotic fervour there, that our people were prepared to defend this nation in whatever circumstances were likely to arise.  There was no period during the emergency when I could say&mdash;or, I am sure, when Deputy Hughes could say&mdash;that the danger element was not there.  It was always there.  If 4,000 individuals decided to <Col N="2324" /> better their conditions as he suggests, by deserting, that is no reason why we should make the conditions in this section easier for them.  There were very large numbers of men who continued to serve the State loyally.  They had the same circumstances surrounding themselves as the individuals to whom the Deputy refers, and they had the same responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should not misunderstand me.  I agree that the punishment should be there, but it is the measure of punishment that we disagree on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to misrepresent the Deputy.  He is asking for the reasons why we do it, and the reasons are clear.  We want to ensure that whatever number of vacancies is likely to arise in any of the services mentioned in the section will go to the people who continued to serve this State loyally and patriotically and not to some other persons who would crash in over the heads of these individuals. We are going to ensure that the men who continued to serve the State will be the first to be considered for these vacancies, whatever number there may be.  There may not be a whole lot, there may not be as many as we would like, but whatever number there is will be held for those men who served the State as they should have served it. I do not want, no more than any other Deputy, to act in any vindictive spirit, but I want to ensure for the future that this sort of thing will not be undertaken lightly.  We want to ensure that, in any future emergency, men will know where they stand and will not lightly undertake a contract with the State and just as lightly break it. We want to ensure that discipline will be maintained at all times in the Army and it is only by taking action of the type contained in this section that we will be able to maintain that discipline.</P>

Does it follow they will be court-martialled <Col N="2325" /> and will also suffer the penalty set out in Section 13?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what is the necessity for this section. In the ordinary way any soldier or any individual, because it applies, to a soldier the same as to an individual, who is guilty of larceny may be charged summarily or on indictment.  It seems to me that if a soldier appropriates Army property, he can be tried under the Larceny Act, 1916, and punishment can be inflicted if he is convicted.  This is merely an additional power which the Minister has to apprehend these people and I do not think that it is necessary.</P>

Unfortunately, heretofore we had cases of individuals joining the L.D.F. and other organisations, serving for a very short time and just disappearing. It was impossible to recover their equipment and this section merely provides that, for one reason or another, the district justice will be in a position to order the individual to make payment for the goods which he will have, either through negligence or some other cause, done away with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better to put it this way, that the court, without proceeding to a conviction, may order him to make payment?  It looks bad to say, whether he is convicted or not, you may compel him to pay compensation.  I think it would be better if you use the formula of the Probation of Offenders Act and insert words suggesting that the Court, having satisfied itself that an offence was committed, may, without proceeding to a conviction, order the individual to pay compensation.  I do not like the phraseology used in paragraph (b).  It leaves it open to the suggestion that whether or not the court is satisfied an offence has been committed, it may compel the individual to pay compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be circumstances where we would have to have it in the wider form.  We do not want a conviction and we are leaving it in a form in which the district justice can fine the person or compel him to pay compensation.  There may, and I am sure there will, be circumstances in which it will be necessary for the district justice to enforce some other penalty&mdash;to convict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>But if the individual did not make away with the article? If he made away with it, if he sold or pawned it and if it is not recovered by the Minister in the normal way then, if he is convicted, he should pay the penalty of the conviction.  It seems a new form of offence that, if the person is not convicted of making away, pawning, damaging or destroying the article, he should still be ordered to pay compensation to the Minister in respect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The district justice might not like to put the slur of conviction on an individual.  There may be circumstances in which he would rather do the other thing.  We want to have wider powers and be safeguarded to the extent that, if a rifle or ammunition, for instance, has disappeared and the individual will either not give us reasonable help or will say that he does not know where it is&mdash;if it has disappeared and he does not give the <Col N="2327" /> State help to recover it&mdash;then it may be necessary to convict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <P>Assuming he did not take it <i>mala fide</i> or with intent to hold it permanently; but if such a person is found in possession of an article of clothing, military uniform, or in possession of a rifle, under the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act the district justice could still dismiss the case and order restitution of the property.  I think the Minister is given very wide power here.  As long as the Minister gets the article back, he would be satisfied, provided it is in proper condition.  Under the law, the district justice can order that the article be returned or else he can convict. Assuming he finds the article has been taken by the person and orders restitution, and in the normal way he proposes to dismiss the case, it seems drastic that he should impose a fine on the soldier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quarrelling with the point of view of the Minister, but with the principle.  Here you are creating a new offence.  It is immaterial whether he steals, makes away with or deals negligently with public property.  You are creating a new offence and he will be charged with that offence under Section 15 (a). In (a) you say that such person shall be guilty and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5.  In paragraph (b) you say that if he is tried, whether the court convicts him or not of this offence it may order him to pay the Minister the value of the article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel it would be much better to couple that provision in some form with (a) and say that he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5 and, in addition, the <Col N="2328" /> value of the article, or, alternatively, that the court having satisfied itself an offence has been committed, does not proceed to a conviction but assesses the amount of the compensation which the individual should pay.  In other words, you are extending the principle of probation to a man, compelling him to pay compensation at the same time. If the court makes no conviction, you are compelling the individual to pay compensation where he has not been found guilty of a specific offence.  I think the principle is very wrong.</P>

      <P>The Minister is confusing two things.  The old procedure dealt with larceny, but here you are introducing a specific offence.  If a person does any of the things mentioned in the section he is liable to prosecution for a specific offence.  If you proceed to assess compensation for public property negligently lost, without proceeding to a conviction, you are establishing an extraordinary principle. The court without proceeding to conviction, and without having made an order convicting, proceeds forthwith to assess compensation.  I think the principle is bad and I should like the Minister to look into the matter.</P>

As the law stands, so far as the guilt of an individual is concerned, before being punished either by a fine or otherwise, his guilt must be established.  Here you are going to allow a court to inflict punishment without establishing guilt.  That is something the House should not stand for.  The Minister does not intend that, but from my interpretation of the section I submit that is what will happen.</P>

That would give only four days.  I was hoping that I might be able to go to the Seanad to-morrow and then deal with the Committee and other stages on the 20th.

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Forestry Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>This new piece of legislation, which is a codification of legislation dealing with forestry, is intended to tidy up existing legislation and to provide certain improvements in existing machinery.  Having read the Bill I feel the Minister certainly ought to have under this Bill machinery adequate for the purpose.  I was not here when the Minister spoke on the Second Reading but I have read his statement and I have been struck by the casual way in which he is dealing with this matter.  In the circumstances in which we live and in the circumstances of the future, when there will be a huge demand on the world's supplies of timber for the tremendous amount of repair and reconstruction work that will have to be carried out in Europe, we might have got some review from the Minister as to the real position.  I think we will experience great difficulty in getting supplies of timber for some time.  As the Minister knows, foreign exchange will present a difficulty for a long time. The tremendous increase in the world <Col N="2335" /> demand for timber will undoubtedly make for a situation in which timber will be very expensive for a long time to come.  I feel that the Minister might have availed of this opportunity to give us a survey of our position here: what has been achieved under existing legislation; what improvement has been effected in the quantity of afforestation; what success has attended the efforts of the forestry organisation under the Minister's control?</P>
      <P>I feel that something has been achieved&mdash;that cannot be denied&mdash;but, at the same time, even before the first Great War this country suffered very severely so far as its timber supplies, woods and forests were concerned.  I think the Minister was right when he pointed out that our landscape here is probably the most bleak in Europe, that we have very little timber resources. At the same time, I am convinced that very much more could be done in that respect.  I do not think we will advance very much by dealing with this matter on a purely economic basis.  Apart altogether from the commercial value of timber, it has many other advantages.  There is the question of drainage which is affected by the timber in a country; the climate and, in fact, the health of the people of the country are also affected by the presence of the timber.  These are aspects of the problem that can hardly be measured by hard cash.  I agree with Deputy Dillon when he says that he does not stand for replacing men with trees; in other words, that the trees should not get preference over men.  I do not think it is necessary to do that. I do not think we have gone that far at any time yet, and I do not think the Minister proposes to supersede men by trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that in this country we should have some sort of central authority to deal with land utilisation which will decide in a strictly scientific way what land should be used for agricultural purposes, what land should be used for forestry purposes, and what land should be used for building purposes and that sort of thing around towns and cities.  In view of the resolutions passed by many nations at conferences <Col N="2336" /> held in recent years and realising the marginal line so far as productive land in the world is concerned, although we have quite a lot of productive land in this country in proportion to the population that we carry, yet I think we should eliminate waste as far as possible and ensure that we have some authority here to decide scientifically how land should to be used to the best advantage nationally.  In that respect, it often struck me that we should have that sort of body which would deal with the matter.  We have not sufficient co-operation between the Minister, as Minister for Lands and the man responsible to this House for forestry, and the Minister for Agriculture on the other hand.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister that the Minister for Agriculture is consulted on matters relating to land and land utilisation, especially where there is a question of whether the land is more suitable for the production of food or for the growing of trees.  There is a good deal of mountain land suitable for the production of mutton, which would carry a considerable number of sheep.  At the same time, it is ideal and for forestry purposes.  The question arises there right away whether that land should be planted, or whether we should continue to produce food from that land, or, in fact, make an effort to improve the quality of the land with a view to further production.</P>
    <P>I am glad that under this Bill the Minister takes power to set up a consultative committee.  I welcome a committee that will deal with matters of that sort because there is a difference of opinion as to whether, from the point of view of food production, marginal land situated on high altitudes should be planted or not.  There is the problem, so far as afforestation is concerned, of the smaller areas.  So far as the Minister is concerned and the work done directly under his Department, there must be an area that is economic from the point of view of appointing a forester to look after it as a forest area.  I think it comprises something like 200 acres.  We can understand that in order to make it economical there must be a considerable amount of land available within <Col N="2337" /> a reasonable area for a forester to look after and keep in order.  There are, however, many small pieces of land all over the country that could be planted and that ought to be planted.  Under the system at present in operation, I think there is very little hope of ever getting that land planted.  I suggest that that land ought to be planted and that we should not be approach the matter from an economic point of view at all.  The preservation of timber in the country is a matter of wider consideration than the mere economic aspect of it.  I think there is not sufficient inducement held out to local authorities to do anything in that respect.</P>
    <P>So far as the private individual is concerned, there is no encouragement. The whole picture has changed in recent years since the farmer became the owner of his land and the big landlord disappeared.  The old landlord, who controlled a very substantial estate and who thought that it was going to pass down in his family for generations was quite satisfied to plant and to improve the estate.  To-day, the picture has changed completely.  The smallholder has no interest at all in the matter when he knows that, if he wants to cut timber at any time, he has to have the sanction of the Minister. I feel, therefore, that there is very little hope of inducing the individual farmer to plant timber to any extent.  I feel that the only way you can have these small plantations put in and cared for is by utilising the local authorities to the maximum.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking power and has power under the existing law to provide facilities in the way of loans and advances.  One aspect of that again arises.  If we are to do that, we ought to have cheap money.  If money is advanced at 4 per cent. or over 4 per cent., and if the local authority has to wait 30 or 40 years to realise on the money invested, it means that there is a very substantial increase in the original outlay.  If we are to make any real advance, I submit that the Minister should make every effort to convince the Minister for Finance that money should be advanced at the <Col N="2338" /> lowest possible rate and that we should provide a substantial subsidy for the local authorities and induce every local authority to be interested in planting small patches which are waste land at present.  It will increase the beauty of the country and will have very definite advantages, apart altogether from the economic aspect.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how many local authorities are really interested in afforestation, and how many have a forester in their service.  I think they are very few, and I suggest that the Minister should examine the whole matter of inducing local authorities to take an interest in small woodlands in their respective administrative districts. If we are really interested in this problem of planting trees, we will make reasonable financial provision and will thereby get many local authorities interested, and get very useful work done.  The Minister should also give the information, for which many Deputies have asked, as to the present position and the rate of expansion over a number of years past.  We appreciate the difficulty with which the Minister was faced during the emergency years, particularly with regard to securing wire netting to keep out vermin.  There is very little use in planting small young trees if you are unable to protect them from attack by vermin.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this problem is the aspect of research, in respect of which sufficient work has not been done.  We are often told that a lot of land is not suitable for forestry purposes and we have been told time and time again that a reasonable degree of fertility is necessary to produce commercial timber and that there are certain lands whose condition makes them unsuited to forestry.  Soils may be highly acid or deficient in certain things necessary for tree production.  I admit that I have not read very much about it, but I remember reading of successes achieved in other countries through research.  In a certain type of bog land, trees have been established by not digging any hole but merely planting the young tree on top of the turf and building turf around the roots. So far as acidity is concerned, we <Col N="2339" /> ought to try to correct that condition, just as we must correct it in agricultural land, and I should like to hear that a substantial sum of money is set aside for research purposes.</P>
    <P>If we feel that we should not utilise agricultural land&mdash;even marginal land &mdash;which is suitable for the production of different classes of food&mdash;and if the Minister is of opinion that such land should not be utilised for forestry purposes, then we appreciate immediately that we are up against a problem. Land outside that class is land of a low degree of fertility, in which there are deficiencies which research and experimentation may get over to a very great extent, and I should like to hear from the Minister that his Department is paying attention to the matter of finding a solution of the difficulties which operate against the possibility of growing timber on land of that sort.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from him also what his programme is with regard to deciduous timber, because I think we have not done enough in the matter of hardwoods.  There appears to be a general shortage&mdash;a shortage not merely in this country but in others&mdash; of hardwoods.  The supplies of softwoods in the past have presented no great difficulty at all and a real world shortage will show up in hardwoods long before it is possible for it to show up in softwoods.  I think we can produce, as a class, better hardwoods than softwoods in this country.  That is only a personal opinion, but I think very little hardwood is planted by the Department and surely that does not show foresight or any attempt to anticipate what conditions are likely to be in the next 40 or 60 years.  We realise&mdash;and I suppose this has had some effect on policy&mdash;that softwoods will come to maturity much earlier than hardwoods, and it is possible to cash in years earlier on the capital invested if forests are planted with softwoods than with hardwoods. Nevertheless, I think we should devote an increased proportion of the acreage planted annually to deciduous timber.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with some of the enemies of afforestation.  One enemy has always been the fellow who wants <Col N="2340" /> to exploit a wood and not replace it, and I think the Minister is right in putting responsibility for replanting on the owner.  Hereto fore, the policy has been to grant a licence for the felling of timber to a man who does not own the land, and, once he had cleared it, nothing could be done about it and it was not possible to compel the owner to replant.  For this reason, the Minister is right in granting a felling licence only to the owner and compelling him to replant.  We have examples all over the country of the tremendous slaughter of timber which took place, especially during the first great war, which has not been replaced even to this day.  It has resulted in unsightly areas, and if we can avoid it in future by providing that wherever such slaughter takes place, the trees will be replaced at the earliest possible moment, it will be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I would expect the Minister to inform the House of the amount of slaughter which took place during the recent emergency and of what is the position so far as replacement, the nursery position, is concerned.  Has the Department expanded the nurseries in anticipation of an expanded scheme of planting immediately wire and other materials become available, the shortage of which hampered activities during the emergency?  The Minister should be more vigorous in his attitude and his policy on afforestation.  I am not, however, one of the enthusiasts who are boiling over with enthusiasm and who put forestry before anything else. I put the production of food and other matters before forestry, but I still think that much more could be done.</P>
    <P>Section 9 empowers the Minister to make advances by way of grant or loan and to give advice.  There again, I think there is very little propaganda. I have never seen a leaflet from the Department as propaganda for the planting of trees.  Money spent on that sort of propaganda might induce private individuals to take part.  I have not much hope of the private owner doing very much, as the whole situation has changed completely from that of 50, 60 or 100 years ago.  However, <Col N="2341" /> a certain amount of propaganda should be done by the Department to encourage individuals to plant trees. There is no use in stressing the economic aspect, since the planting of timber is very valuable in itself, apart altogether from the economic aspect.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking power to extinguish existing rights over forest lands, even in the case of land that he acquires at present or in the future for forestry purposes.  This problem of rights-of-way is a very difficult one, and I can appreciate the anxiety of the Department to eliminate trespassing and the damage that might be done by people passing through forests.  I appreciate that the Bill provides for appeals from the Land Commission to an appeals tribunal, but hardships might definitely occur where the Minister extinguishes a right.  Where there is a number of interests involved, the Minister can acquire land by agreement and, where there may be one individual with a right-of-way, holding up the agreement, the Minister is taking power to extinguish that right. I believe that the Minister should not press for the extinguishing of that right, if there is any hardship involved.</P>
    <P>In the same way, in the question of providing facilities for a temporary right-of-way over a farm, for the purpose of removing timber from a forest, it may be that, from the Department's point of view, those facilities may be of advantage or may be absolutely essential, as there may be no other access to the public road.  However, as a farmer, I can appreciate that very considerable damage could be done to a farm adjoining a forest, especially if the timber were removed over soft ground in the winter time.  The men would simply cart all over the place and there would be very considerable damage to property.  I would not like to be the owner of a farm adjoining a forest where a considerable quantity of timber had to be removed across my place.  I would anticipate a tremendous amount of damage being done. I suppose there is no alternative, but great caution should be exercised in the granting of facilities of this sort. There may be a long and difficult approach to a wood by a lane, in very <Col N="2342" /> bad condition, while at the other side of the wood there may be a field belonging to a local farmer, intervening between the road and the forest.  There will be a tendency, in a case like that, to look for facilities to cross the field, instead of attempting to use the difficult approach by the lane on the other side.</P>
    <P>I do not like all the facilities the Minister is looking for here.  I admit that fairly elaborate provision is made to assess compensation and that, where the owner is not satisfied, he has a right to appeal.  I am very doubtful whether the Land Commission are the right people to assess and fix compensation. The Minister paid great tribute to the capacity of the Land Commission and said, in column 1601:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission is the most competent and most independent body in this country to assess the value of land of the type with which we are concerned in this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Land Commission confiscated a lot of land in the 30's, in the last decade, they took any amount of very valuable land from individuals in this country, and paid them little or no compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nearly time for them to do so.  So far as fixing compensation for land is concerned, there are many people&mdash;I know at least two or three cases where widows were concerned and these have been mentioned from time to time in the past&mdash;who were treated in a scandalous way by the Land Commission in regard to the fixing of compensation.  Now we are going to entrust them with the responsibility of fixing compensation here. The Land Commission is involved in this, in acquiring land for forestry <Col N="2343" /> purposes, and where a dispute arises between them and an individual it is proposed to appeal to the Land Commission to fix the compensation, though they are a party to the dispute themselves and have an interest in it. There is no justice in that at all.  The Minister should provide some impartial tribunal to fix compensation.  It is like going to law with the devil, and holding the court in hell.  The very same thing applies here.  The Land Commission is a party to the dispute, but is to sit in a judicial capacity to fix compensation.  Their past record does not convince me that they are competent to be fair and impartial in fixing compensation as between themselves and another person.</P>
      <P>On Section 31, the Minister rightly talks about the provision for compulsory acquisition being used only in very rare cases.  He wisely anticipates that, if land is acquired compulsorily for a forest, a lot of damage might be done to the timber there, that you must have the approval and support of the local community, and that there is no possibility of success if they do not approve of the planting scheme.</P>
      <P>In Section 36, there is a new provision for excluding certain species of trees and I wonder if the Minister would say what particular species is envisaged.  In another section, certain types of land are excluded.  I suggest to the Minister that, if we had some sort of central authority to deal with land utilisation, it would deal with that point, as to whether land should be exempt as agricultural land, or as land adjoining a town which might be used later for building or certain other purposes. I feel that we require a body of that sort to deal with the problem of how we shall best utilise the land in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Bill ought to give adequate powers to the Minister to deal with afforestation here.  The only thing that I have objected to is that in all the problems with which we have to deal&mdash;rights-of-way, extinguishing a right-of-way, and the compulsory acquisition of land&mdash;we are appealing to the Land Commission, as a party, and entrusting to it the problem of <Col N="2344" /> assessing compensation, to be the judge and jury as it were, in matters where it has an interest.  I do not think it is right to provide that sort of machinery. I do not know what sort of tribunal should be provided, but, at all events, it should be a tribunal outside the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister felt that it would be better to deal with the policy of the Land Commission on the Estimate and, for the moment, he is dealing merely with the machinery that is being introduced in this legislation.  We have had from the Minister information only on the machinery arising out of this piece of legislation, explaining the purpose of the different sections.  We have had no information good, bad or indifferent, about the policy of his Department, what the position is and what he proposes to do with the machinery he now has at hand.  I hope he will give us some more information in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to any section of the Bill.  My complaint against the Minister is that he has failed to bring in some provision to protect the workers engaged in forestry.  It is the custom of the State, through most of its Departments, to provide that the rate of wages or the salaries paid should be the same as that paid by good employers in the district.  I think the Forestry Department is the greatest slave-driver of any of the Government Departments. We can picture to-day men engaged in my constituency out on the side of a hill, working from 8 o'clock in the morning until 5.30 in the evening, bringing what food they may have with them, after a journey of four or five miles.  If they are lucky to put in five and a half days on that type of work, they receive 38/- or 39/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our whole fight with the Forestry Department is on the basis that it will not pay men the same as good employers in the district pay their workers.  We have been negotiating on the Wages Tribunal with employers engaged in a similar way to the Forestry Department.  The Forestry Department is engaged in commercial work now.  It has sawmills in the county and is disposing of its timber for sale in Dublin, in competition with employers who pay 50 per cent. and 60 per cent. higher wages.  The position is that when we are before the Wages Tribunal in Kildare Street the owners of sawmills always put up the argument: &ldquo;How can we compete against <Col N="2346" /> the Forestry Department which has men employed for 39/- a week and sawyers and other skilled men engaged for less than £2 5s. a week?&rdquo; It is difficult to argue against that, because the Forestry Department is a Government concern.  As it is a Government concern, we are unable to move, other than through propaganda, to try to make it change its views, or to try to bring about some change of heart.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister has failed, to bring relief or consolation to the men who have been engaged in skilled, work in forestry for the past ten or 20 years.  I have had experience, and I am sure other Deputies have had it, too, of men who have given their services in the forestry section prior to the establishement of this State and, when they arrived, at 70 years of age, they were deprived even of the old age pension; because they earned over £52 a year, they could not get the full pension.</P>
    <P>When you contrast that treatment of skilled men, who gave loyal service, to the treatment accorded in other industries, where they are guaranteed pensions, I say that the Government and the forestry section are adopting a policy of class distinction towards workers in rural areas.  I am surprised that the Government Party tolerates such a state of affairs. Members of the Government Party must be aware of the volume of public opinion in the country that protests against conditions that the Government forces these employees to accept.  When members of this House appeal for greater progress in the way of afforestation do they realise that they are asking for a continuation of the conditions I outlined?  Do they imagine that they are going to get men to work under such conditions in future?  In view of the post war schemes that are announced, men will not be available for work on them, as they will have gone away to England or elsewhere where conditions are better.  In asking the Minister to simplify the Bill, I ask him to make provision for the staff, by having in it a section guaranteeing to workers employed on forestry a living wage, <Col N="2347" /> as well as conditions similar to those provided by private employers, many of whom grant pensions to their staffs.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Brennan that forestry is skilled work for which men taken from labour exchanges would not be suitable.  Between October and April all men engaged in forestry plant a number of trees each day.  I am sure the numbers, if known, would surprise Deputies. The present position is that young men will not take up forestry work if they can get across to England. I appeal to the Minister to bring it to the notice of the Government that the conditions I have referred to cannot continue in rural areas.  I agree with Deputy Hughes that county councils could and should do more for the encouragement of forestry.  At one time the Government Party&mdash;in fact, all Parties&mdash;were in favour of arbor days.  A rate was struck under which farmers could plant shelter belts.  I should like public bodies to be permitted to raise a rate of, say, 3d. in the £ for that purpose.  That rate should not be charged against their borrowing powers, as it would be 25 or 30 years before there would be any return from the money.  In County Wicklow the farmers availed of such grants to provide shelter belts.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked why forestry work was concentrated in County Wicklow.  They wanted to know why such work was not undertaken in the West or in other portions of the State. Everybody knows that there is congestion in the West and that there is a great demand for arable land.  If it was proposed to take a couple of hundred acres of land in the West that was suitable for cultivation, on which to plant trees, I am sure that that matter would be often raised on the Adjournment.  I have never known land suitable for cultivation being used for forestry in County Wicklow.  The Land Commission and the forestry section work in co-operation, and unless the sanction of the Land Commission is obtained land cannot be taken for forestry.  In County Wicklow much of the land is hilly, and farmers are anxious to dispose of it, seeing <Col N="2348" /> that it relieves them from the payment of high rates, as well as allowing them more time for the cultivation of arable land.  If county committees of agriculture could undertake propaganda for the establishment of arbor days the people generally might be got to take a greater interest in afforestation.</P>
    <P>If we are to do that on a national scale we will have to change our outlook as regards wages and conditions. I am sure the Minister will be surprised to learn that if a man arrives at his work a quarter of an hour late, because his bicycle was punctured, and if he works a three-quarters day, he will be paid only for a half-day.  In previous years strikes occurred and certain concessions were granted.  The bad conditions I mentioned do not apply to workers alone, but also to overseers and charge hands responsible for administration.  Although these are civil servants they do not enjoy the same conditions as other civil servants. I am aware that some of these men work seven days in the week, as on Sundays they make up their time sheets and reports.  I appeal to the Minister to take a special interest in forestry workers, as if forestry is going to be the success that we all hope it will be, we must get away from the idea of employing men simply because numbers of them offer themselves for such work in rural areas at any wages and under any conditions.  If they were organised there would be very little forestry work done in County Wicklow, except by men who have long service.  Having drawn attention to the matter I am sure the Minister in his Estimate will give an account of what work was done during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the Bill as a whole.  I only regret that the Minister did not bring in other sections to improve the conditions to which I have referred.  I hope that as a result of my remarks, wherever there are the slave conditions to which I referred, there will be a change.  If there is not a change, I am certain, from what I know of the people in the country, that the treatment they are receiving cannot continue.  There will not always be wars raging.  In the rural areas the <Col N="2349" /> people realise that for years the position of those in the cities and towns has been considered, while they have been neglected for motives that I do not understand.  I can assure the House that rural workers are beginning to awaken and that they will give the Government, when it again appeals to the country, a shock that they require.  There will not always be a war to give you a majority.  The people realise that for some years the Government have considered the towns and cities in relation to unemployment assistance and everything else and have neglected men in employment in rural areas.  Whatever has been the motive, I cannot understand it.  However, we are now giving the assurance that the rural workers are beginning to awake and will give the Government in all parts of the country the rude awakening they require, if they get an opportunity.  It will be no use to throw out a sop to them before a general election.  I am stating the opinion of men in the Government Party.  These men may be members of the Party but they know, as I know, the feelings of the people in the rural areas.  I know that they are not in agreement with the conditions the Government have imposed on the forestry workers and road workers.  They are not parties to that policy.  They are trying to defend them but there is no defending them in the rural areas.  I would ask the Minister, knowing his views in connection with workers generally, to take courage in his hands and to fight the finance experts in the Department of Finance in order to secure something for the workers of the Department he represents so faithfully.  I appeal to him to do something on behalf of the forestry workers generally under his control so that the national scheme he is initiating will meet with success and have the support of all sections of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a close observer of timber, particularly in the area in which I live, midway between the Galtee and the Knockmealdown Mountains.  These mountains are very well planted along the lower slopes. The Cahir sawmill there gives employment to a large number of men.  Were <Col N="2350" /> it not for the existence of this sawmill we would be in a very bad state.  The Galtee Mountains are planted along the lower slopes on the southern and northern sides but only up to a depth of perhaps half a mile.  I understand that trees cannot be grown successfully in the higher altitudes.  There are certain types of trees that should be grown there.  I believe the Minister knows a good deal about his job.  There is scarcely any Minister who has studied his work as well as he has.  I believe that certain parts of that mountain could supply larch capable of being made into ordinary farm carts. Two generations ago the Earl of Glengal planted a certain area.  After 25 or 30 years the timber was cut and sold.  The sawmill was started about 40 years ago.  I think the timber grown on these mountains is not much use after 30 to 40 years.  As the timber was cut and sold, the land was replanted. These lands supply timber for 14 miles around but there is a demand for 20 times the amount of timber they are able to supply.  We in the valley, 14 or 15 miles away, would be definitely in a bad way were it not for that timber.</P>
      <P>In the lowlands, in the middle of the valley, there is a turf bank that has been dug out for about 100 years.  That was planted with deal trees which, I understand, were cut 50 years ago and all it was fit for was for pit-props for Welsh mines.  I do not think that trees of that type can be very successfully grown in the lowlands.  My idea is that larch should be grown on the mountains.  In certain sheltered areas hardwoods were grown, such as elm, oak and ash, and it is on record that the oak used to roof the Parliament House 400 years ago is quite good yet. That goes to show the great quality of hardwood that was reared in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the development of plastices, I do not know whether or not all this timber will be needed.  I understand sawdust will be used in future but I do not know that wholesale plantings, except on the mountains, would be of much use.  On Saturday evening I visited a seven-acre field of mine, where there was an old ditch of elm mixed with thorns that had not been cut for <Col N="2351" /> 50 years.  Twenty yards out from that ditch the roots of the elms were growing and those roots would be four or five inches thick.  These roots would break a plough and would have to be broken with a hatchet.  I have come to the conclusion that I would not allow a tree to be grown along any farm ditch.  They are only a vantage point from which crows can make depredations on the nearest field. They do not serve any useful purpose. I am not so enamoured of these ditches from the aesthetic point of view.  I prefer the utilitarian point of view.  I was greatly impressed by Deputy Dillon when he said he would prefer men on the land to trees.  I do not always agree with Deputy Dillon.  There should be not trees on arable land except as shelter belts. One Deputy suggested a shelter belt along the west side of the farms to protect against the prevailing winds. I would not agree.  Shelter belts in the south-west corners would be very good.  I think it is wrong indiscriminately to plant trees in ditches of the elm, ash or sycamore type, because the roots extend 40 or 50 feet; they impoverish the ground and the leaves falling in October and November poison the grass.  Timber should be confined, practically, to the mountains.</P>
    <P>I wonder will agricultural science advance to the point when it will be possible to reclaim boglands.  I wonder, with the aid of chemicals, will they become food-producing.  If so, the planting of the lowlands may not be the success that we anticipate it will be.  Wood grown on bogland is no good for anything except to burn, and if, after 25 years, it is cut down and burned or used merely as props for mines, what value is it?  I have grave doubts as to the utility of planting land that is any way fair except for the purpose of shelter belts.  I do not approve of wholesale planting. There are certain trees that could be planted in the higher altitudes that would be of value.  On the western slopes of the mountains you will see trees planted&mdash;they are to be seen in Clare and Connemara&mdash;which grow to a certain height and are then stunted, <Col N="2352" /> and inclined towards the east.  In the southern slopes of all the Irish mountains trees will grow.  I know they are growing successfully on both sides of the Galtees.  Plenty of good commercial timber can be grown on the higher regions that would be of commercial value.</P>
    <P>Trees are certainly wonderful things. Somebody has written: &ldquo;Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.&rdquo; If the plastic business develops, trees can be grown in bog areas and on other land with great advantage.  The development of plastics may make it very useful.  But there is very little use in growing trees on reclaimed bog in the lowlands. There is no difficulty in planting on the higher altitudes in the mountains or in giving farmers every opportunity for having shelter belts.  Ash is very little used except for handles or hurleys.  There is a great planting of ash, but it poisons the ground around. Then there are beech and elm and oak, which is not very much used in this country because it takes so long to grow.  I think shelter belts of elm might come in with larch planting, sufficient for the needs of each farm. The time may come when the bogs are reclaimed and, with the scientific development of farming, they may be fit for producing food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a recent Press report of a meeting held in Dublin an official of the Forestry Department is quoted as saying that the development of forestry and national afforestation here depended on the Department of Finance and that there was no use in talking about it until the Government and the Department of Finance dropped the Scotsman's reputation in regard to it.  That is probably the background for the Minister's statement in introducing this Bill.  He was very careful to say nothing with regard to the future policy of afforestation, but to assure us that the views of the experts responsible for the technical control of forestry work were that the present scheme of expansion was adequate and best suited to the country's needs.  But the Minister gave us no picture of that scheme of expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that, as a new member of <Col N="2353" /> the House, I am unfamiliar with what happened in the past.  It may be that this is old history for some of the older Deputies.  But I, for one, felt rather disappointed that we had not been given some picture of our position in the matter of afforestation.  Have we or have we not a forestry policy?  When the Minister, in introducing this Bill, said that since 1928 the forestry service has expanded its activities in extent and, were it not for the recent war, the service would be now probably have come close to attaining the rate of annual growth which is believed by the experts to be the desirable aim of this country's needs, I felt that he should have gone on and told us what was the desirable aim and what eventually we have decided upon as our policy in this matter.  A predecessor of his in a former administration, when introducing the 1928 Act, I think it was, quite frankly admitted that in the matter of afforestation policy we were unambitious. That was the word he used.  In other words, we were tinkering with the problem.  Since then, undoubtedly, a considerable development has taken place, and we have made some progress. But, if we are to go on as we are going, to my mind we are simply carrying on by what is commonly described in this House as stop-gap methods.  We are not doing anything on a broad scale to reach our peak point in afforestation within a minimum of years.  So far as I can make out from the figures, we seem to have reached our peak point in 1938-39. Since then, due to emergency conditions, of course there has been a complete slow-down.  But now that we are at the end of the emergency period and that materials which were in short supply during the emergency will be coming on the market again, we should have been given an indication of our probable annual rate of expansion and the minimum period in which we hope to reach our ultimate development of forestry.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be a practical expert in this matter or to have any practical knowledge of it, but I do happen to have, over a great number of years, read a good deal about this matter.  In the old days when we were fighting for our freedom, one of the <Col N="2354" /> things held before the youth of the country was that when we got our freedom we were going to restore the ancient forests of Ireland.  Neither this Administration nor its predecessor, to my mind, has done anything serious in the matter of forestry.  I know that there are many practical difficulties in the way and that the Minister can give us a very satisfactory explanation of the slow rate of progress.  At the same time, I feel that forestry has been the Cinderella of the services.  When a civil servant makes a statement of that kind and lets the cat out of the bag, I think we are getting the real kernel of the trouble.  The Minister is being starved for money.  I put it to the Minister that he should take his courage in his hands and fight the Minister for Finance every inch of the road in this matter of finding money for afforestation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the case made, I think it is a common case, that we are all satisfied that a sound forestry plan will have beneficent effects on the health and the climate of the country.  At the same time, I do not want to be taken as endeavouring to encroach on what you might call the agricultural problem and the rights of a farmer to cultivate his soil, etc.  But, allowing for all the agricultural problems we may have connected with this problem of forestry, I still believe we have a big margin of land which is uneconomic from the agricultural point of view and which can still be acquired by the Minister in large economic units for forestry purposes.  There are large belts of lands on the east coast and on the south coast, sand-belts if you like on the fringe there, which to my mind are useless.  There are miles and miles of that type of land in Wicklow and Wexford and along the south coast to Cork which, I am sure, could be acquired if there was what you might call a courageous policy in this matter of forestry.  If we are ever to take the matter seriously, the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>At the present rate of progress.  I visualise a period of from 50 to 60 years before we can even achieve the limited plan which the Minister apparently has in mind in this matter. It has been accepted in the House <Col N="2355" /> here, I think, that our ultimate development will be something in the nature of 700,000 acres.  That is considerably less than half of what experts, enthusiastic experts, if you like, in this matter, in the past have set out as our requirements in this country.  I think the informations we have now on forestry is so old and out of date that the time is ripe for the Minister to establish some new survey so that we could have our requirements in this matter settled once and for all.</P>
    <P>Do we wish to develop timber, hard or softwood, and to what extent?  Are we satisfied that developments outside this country are such that we shall have to look after our own resources here?  Are we satisfied that we will not face a further period of emergency in 20 or 30 years, time when we may need all the timber we have and all the wood pulp we have?  Are we satisfied that other nations are conserving their forests in such a way that the world supply of timber and pulp and of the by-products of forestry will be available in normal supply?  If we are not satisfied with world developments, we should have our own policy here in relation to such developments abroad, and try to link up with the world supply position so that at least we can provide that future generations will not be left in the lurch should the occasion arise.</P>
    <P>It may be that technical developments in other fields of industry have rendered the forestry problem&mdash;at least, from the point of view I am advocating&mdash;out of date, but on the other hand, I have had no technical information on the subject which would suggest to me that that is so. I realise that with the freedom now being given to yellow races and the probable developments in education and so on that may arise from the extension of such freedom in the Middle East and the Far East, a new problem may arise in the very near future, and it may be that there will be such a demand for the world supply of wood pulp and timber as will render our position here singularly acute.</P>
    <P>In this matter, we have really to make up our minds whether or not we <Col N="2356" /> are going to reverse the happenings of history.  Our forests disappeared about 300 years ago, practically overnight. In one or two rebellions, our forests were wiped out and apart from such developments as were brought about by private enterprise&mdash;really the private enterprise of the landed class in the past&mdash;we have been left in the lurch since.  We have to make up our minds whether we intend to rectify that historical problem of the deprivation of this country of its forests and its timber.</P>
    <P>I personally think that, despite all the demand for land on the part of the agricultural community, there is still a margin that we could work on and that we should be able to achieve at least the 1,000,000 acres mark, without unduly hampering the agriculturists in any way.  I agree with Deputy Hughes when he says that this problem will largely have to be met by the State and the local authorities. I feel that we shall have to depend more on State development than on local authority development, because the amount of land available in economic units to any local authority is negligible.  The State, however, if it took the problem up, could get land in the quantities required.  The question is, have we a policy and is the Minister for Finance prepared to facilitate the Minister for Lands in implementing that policy?  I want to hear from the Minister what is our long-term policy, in all these matters, and, given our long-term policy, what he hopes to do this year, next year and in the years to come to work towards that ultimate end.</P>
    <P>As to the Bill itself, I think it is a good Bill, deserving of the support of all Parties.  There may be certain aspects which will require attention on Committee Stage, but I do not propose to go into them now.  Deputy Hughes mentioned that, in the matter of compensation, there was a need for something more than the appeal given to the Appeal Tribunal of the Land Commission. That is so.  In regard to forestry, the position is that when the Land Commission seeks to acquire land compulsorily, it is definitely and interested party.  The appeal given <Col N="2357" /> here is a considerable improvement on the form of appeals provided in other Bills which come before the House, that the aggrieved person in the matter of compensation has a right of appeal from the lay commissioners to an appeals tribunal presided over by a judge.  It is a considerable improvement on what we have in other Bills, where the appeal is to the Minister <i>per se,</i> without any judicial intervention. I do not want to press the point, but it is a matter which will have to be fought out sooner or later.</P>
    <P>Where a Government Department is interested in a matter, it cannot be regarded as an impartial party to that matter and therefore cannot be accepted in the sense of a judicial tribunal or judge in its own cause, and the sooner we face up to this development the better.  The old theory on which we are working here of the king not being capable of doing any wrong should, to my mind, be scrapped, and we should get to the position in which the State is a corporate entity, with no greater rights in relation to its citizens than any other corporate entity.  It will have its rights and the citizen will have his, and the citizen will have the right to face the State in the courts of law at least on an equal footing.  That is the position in other countries.  It is the position in Australia where the State is a corporate entity and where the citizen has his recognised rights and can fight his rights against the State in the courts of law.</P>
    <P>There is, as I have said, in the appeal system in the Land Commission the advantages that at least one has the protection of a judicial tribunal presided over by a judge, but I am not satisfied even with that.  I should like to go the whole hog and have the appeal to the courts proper.  Some Minister said that if we were to have appeals in every case, the courts would be glutted.  It is an extraordinary fact that where the State is simply a corporate entity, with no more and no less rights than what it has by statute <i>vis-á-vis</i> the citizen, there is not that glut of litigation which we are supposed to get here, if we give the citizen his rights.</P>
    <P>I have already said that I think the <Col N="2358" /> Minister should take a courageous viewpoint on this matter.  A courageous viewpoint is being taken across the water at the moment&mdash;I am constantly quoting what is being done across the water and it is inevitable because they are near neighbours&mdash;and the same development is taking place in the United States.  In Britain, at the moment, they are embarking on a scheme of 3,000,000 acres.  They were able during the emergency to take over 100,000 acres in the border countries and to proceed with their development, although they were fighting the greatest war in history.  We here are hampered apparently by certain reasons of agriculture more than anything else, and if there is nothing standing in the way as between the Minister and agriculture, there should be more importance attached to reconciling the two view points and getting a move on.</P>
    <P>This is our first generation of freedom and the results since 1921 are negligible compared with what we told the world we would do when fighting for that freedom.  I should therefore like to see the Minister developing a courageous policy in this matter of forestry, and, above all, I should like to see him, if he is satisfied that he can face the House with such a courageous policy, going one step further and facing the Minister for Finance with the same courage.  Let us embark upon a scheme which, within 25 years, say, will bring us to the end of the road.  At the present rate of progress, it will more likely be 100 years before we see the end of the road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">

      <P>Deputy Coogan says this is the first generation since we won our freedom and that, when we were engaged in the winning of it, we were telling the world what we were going to accomplish.  People who are engaged in telling the world what they are going to accomplish never accomplish anything.  We were too busy on the job at that time to tell anyone what we were going to do.  The reason we are regarded, possibly, as not being so successful since is that we have been engaged in going on with the job, without telling the world what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2359" /> There are two points I would like to deal with before taking the Bill generally and they are matters in regard to civil servants.  Deputy Giles mentioned one particular civil servant, the head of the Forestry Department.  He is not an Irishman, but he is above all things a forester.  I am fully confident about his knowledge, his capacity and his honesty in regard to his work.  I also remember that another Scotsman, Thomas Drummond, was one of the greatest friends of Ireland we ever had, and in the Scotsman we have now I have the fullest confidence.  In regard to a statement made by an official of my Department at a recent lecture on State forests, the man who gave that lecture has done and is doing very valuable work for this country and anything he says must be taken seriously. He wrote an article in a well-known magazine here, in regard to national forests.  I and the officials in my Department, being interested in the work we have to do, read that article and formed our own opinion on the views stated; and when we were invited to attend the lecture given by that gentleman, we discussed before going there what our attitude was to be.  I think those of us who were able to attend surprised the lecturer by the previous knowledge we had of his proposals. I know exactly what the official said at the lecture on national parks.  He said exactly what I would have said.  Journalists and sub-editors &mdash;while I have no personal quarrel with them&mdash;are very often in a hurry and are as liable to make mistakes as are politicians.  The official who spoke at the lecture here in Dublin is too wise, too experienced, and has too great a knowledge of his duty to make the statement attributed to him.  The fact of the matter is that at no time has there been any quarrel between the Department of Lands and Forestry and the Department of Finance in regard to the provision of money for forestry.  Any money needed for the development of forestry is available to us always from the Department of Finance, at the order of the Government. There has never been any quarrel about it.</P>
    <P>I did not think, when I heard all <Col N="2360" /> the Deputies here defending individual liberty and democracy, that we would have so many appeals on this Bill for compulsion.  Deputy Hughes talks fluently on individual liberty in regard to other matters, but wants a tribunal set up to go into the question of the utilisation of soil and a tribunal for certain other purposes.  Everybody complains of the tremendous number of inspectors we have in the country, but if we agree with the idea of setting up further tribunals, there will not be room on the farms for the farmers to work.  Again, in regard to Deputy Coogan's suggestion for a special court to deal with matters as between the landowner and the Department of Forestry, this is what Deputy Coogan said last week:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would entirely agree with the present system if there were a right of appeal to the courts of the land, that is in a matter of dispute between John Citizen and officialdom if the final word did not rest with officialdom but the aggrieved citizen had the right of appeal not to the Minister but to a court.  That may give rise to a host of cases and may inevitably lead to the setting up of some special court to deal with matters of that kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Land Commission is a court.  It was set up to deal with the vexed question of land, because the ordinary courts of justice could not possibly have dealt with the amount of litigation taking place about land.  It is a court, with a judge at its head, and is the most suitable court for our purpose in assessing compensation under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy opened up for the Opposition and, listening to the various members of the Opposition who spoke on the Bill, it seems to me that their speeches cancelled one another out.  Each presented a totally different view from that of his predecessor. Deputy Mulcahy, like another famous statesman we had in this country, has apparently grafted a slip of poetry on his economic tree.  He suggested that, in this Bill and in the policy of the Department, there was no imagination.  Half a dozen other <Col N="2361" /> Deputies followed him, telling me that I had no imagination, that there was no imagination in the Bill or in the policy.  Many years ago, I divorced myself from the leprechaun.  I have not sufficient imagination to populate the woodlands of Ireland with dryads and I must harness my imagination to the chariot of common-sense.  What we want in regard to forestry is something that will give results, a policy so resilient as to be capable of absorbing the shock of obstruction and difficulty, sufficiently elastic as to be capable of expansion when opportunities offer for swifter expansion and wider development. What are the facts in regard to the development of forestry?  In 1923-1924 we planted 1,176 acres and we had reached an annual planting, in 1931-1932, of 3,645 acres.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan said that my predecessor here, speaking on forestry, declared that he was not ambitious, about forestry, and I know that to be true.  Nevertheless, from 1923-24 to 1931-32, every year, the acreage of forestry planted increased.  After 1932 and until 1939 there was an increase. In 1939 we had reached 7,603 acres per year and in the war years, from 1939 until now, we have never planted less than, 4,000 acres, much more than was planted in any year before this Government came into office.  I am not blaming the previous Government, because I know that no big undertaking reaches its peak point of production immediately, and the bigger the undertaking the less easily can you get your policy under way.  I say the last Government and this Government have done their duty in the development of forestry over the years.</P>
    <P>During the war years the greatest achievement of all took place because, notwithstanding the difficulties with which we were confronted, never in any year was there less than 4,000 acres planted.  I am not satisfied that we could not have a greater acreage planted per year.  Our target was 10,000 acres per year and eventually. an area of forestry of 700,000 acres.  I believe we can go faster than 10,000 acres a year.  I believe that when we reach anywhere near the amount we now think adequate, there will be a <Col N="2362" /> new viewpoint in this country in regard to forestry and then it will be time enough to change our views as to whether we want 700,000 acres or 7,000,000 acres&mdash;whatever amount you have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy, having done with his imaginings, came along to the restrictions imposed by the Bill.  You cannot cut a single tree without the permission of the Forestry Department. There must be restrictions, and the restrictions imposed here are very reasonable.  The attitude of the Department of Forestry to the people concerned was at all times reasonable. They were swiftly answered; they got permission whenever it was possible to give them permission.  In other countries these restrictions are also in force&mdash;in countries where forestry is much more highly developed.  In France no one is allowed to turn woodland to any other use, no matter for what reason.  In Switzerland no tree can be marked for felling unless with the permission of and in the presence of an official of the Forest Office.  I told you here in my opening statement of the number of permits that were applied for and the number given, and of the number given to which conditions of replanting were attached, to show you how reasonable the Forestry Department was with the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick raised the question of interference with small holders. Deputy Blowick need not have any fear of interference with small holders. Trees scattered over a farm are a menace and a nuisance.  No edible vegetation grows under them.  They interfere with seeding and harvesting and the sooner these trees are cut off the small farms, the better.  Hedgerow timber is useless.  It does not produce timber.  It affects the vegetation beside the fences and I am no believer in the growth of such timber, although I would suggest to Deputy O'Donnell that they might plant a little ash along the fences of Tipperary, because hurleys are getting scarce.  I suggest that, having got the scattered timber off the farm, there is hardly any farmer in the country who has not a waste acre of land which he could put under trees.  I suggest to you people <Col N="2363" /> here that it is a most essential thing that we should have those waste acres on every farm planted.</P>
    <P>We are told we have no imagination, and the British Forestry Report has been quoted here.  Britain is also anxious that her farmers should grow timber on their lands along the lines I suggest.  Their idea of the best contribution they can give to the farmer in the planting of land is to give him advice.  They will give £2 per acre for softwoods and £4 per acre for hardwoods. In this country the Forestry Department will give all the advice and assistance necessary to anybody who wants to plant timber and will also give such persons £10 per acre. That seems to me to be a better form of imagination than what has struck the imaginative people across the water.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke, not about lack of imagination, but about lack of enthusiasm.  All my life I have been very fearful of enthusiasm, I have seen so many enthusiastic people getting tired.  Enthusiasm is no good if it is not based on conviction and determination. I am convinced about this question of forestry, about the need for its development and of its utility to the country, and I am determined, while I am in this office, to do everything I can to forward the development of forestry.  Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about what the Minister for Agriculture said in 1928.  He might just as well have talked about what Gladstone said in 1870.  I would remind Deputy O'Sullivan that a false consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds or, if I might put it in the more homely phrase of Deputy Dillon, we live and learn. He also argued about arable and non-arable land.  In dealing with forestry, we do not discuss arable land and non-arable land; we talk about land that is plantable or non-plantable.</P>
    <P>He also spoke&mdash;and Deputy Murphy spoke of it, too&mdash;about the number of unemployed men who could be absorbed into forestry, the number of men who are now attending at labour exchanges and who might be immediately utilised in the development of forestry.  Evidence given before the <Col N="2364" /> Royal Commission in 1909 was very adverse to the use of the unemployed in towns in planting trees, as it was found that such men were unaccustomed to the spade and few of them were able to stand the rough weather of winter.  Anybody who has any experience of the beginning of the Army Construction Corps and the attempt to use young men from the towns on the bogs, will realise the difficulty of absorbing in such an employment as forestry the unemployed men of the towns.  It cannot be done.  But we can, by the development of forestry, employ from year to year more and more men on a permanent staff and, from year to year, we can absorb more and more men in temporary employment.</P>
    <P>It is impossible, even if we could, to employ great numbers of unemployed men from the cities and towns in forestry plantations.  I have some figures dealing with forestry plantations. In one case of 6,000 acres, planted between 1919 and 1941, employing on the average 40 men, it is hoped in 1951 that the numbers employed will rise to 200 men.  &ldquo;Men or trees&rdquo; stated Deputy Dillon. Deputy Cogan was anxious to know something about the comparison of sheep and trees.  I find it is calculated that the plantation of 100 acres means the displacement of 110 sheep.  The average production from such land would be 6.66 lbs. of deadwood, and 1.75 lbs. of wool.  Each acre produced 1½ tons of wood per annum.  I think it is reasonable enough to believe that timber is a good substitute for sheep in many places.  The most dangerous, thoughtless, unenlightened speech made against the Bill was that of Deputy Dillon, who asked: &ldquo;Are we to have men or trees?  I am in favour of men&rdquo;.  It is not a question of whether we are to have men or trees. He might just as usefully have said it was a question whether we will have moustaches or mushrooms.  The fact of the matter is that if you do not have trees you will tend more and more to depopulate this country.  It is a known fact that industry follows the forest.  It is a known fact that <Col N="2365" /> erosion, tremendous erosion, has been caused by de-afforestation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan mentioned just now what America had been doing in regard to forestry.  That was a bad statement for Deputy Coogan to make, because America has destroyed the American land by de-afforestation, and it is only now that America is trying to repair the evil.  Also in America, it might be as well for Deputies to know, a good deal of soil destruction has been done by placing too many sheep on light-soiled land.  You can have more sheep if you have more forest. We can have more men if we have more forest.  Those who talk of this question as one between men and forest, simply do not know what they are talking about.  In the Forestry Department we have no difficulty in getting all the money we can use for forestry development.  We have sufficient labour in this country, and we have sufficient experienced foresters to direct these workers.  We can, I believe, in the very near future secure all the material for its swifter development. The one thing we need is land.  There may be places in County Meath that could be utilised for forestry but Meath has the reputation of having land that is, at least, as good as the land in County Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been too much outcry about the difficulty of trying to get land in County Meath for forestry.  We certainly cannot now use land for forestry that could be utilised for agricultural purposes.  We have to be careful in selecting the land that we are going to utilise.  We are up against all sorts of opposition in regard to the land we need.  Deputy Bartley raised a question about land at Ashford.  That was land we secured for the purpose of forestry.  The land was eminently suited for the purpose, and yet it is declared that congestion is so rampant in that area, that it must not be used for forestry, but must be used for division amongst the people.  I think that is bad policy.  We in the Forestry Department have taken every care not to tread on the corns of small holders, or those who need land, because the compulsion <Col N="2366" /> here is a limited compulsion. We cannot have compulsion in the sense in which that word is ordinarily used.  We have to cultivate goodwill. There can be no forests without the goodwill of the people.  We find, where we have secured a block of land for forestry, that when the people realise the benefit that forestry conferred upon them, there is less difficulty as the years go on, in getting more and more land in that district to swell our original holding.</P>
      <P>There must be rights of way, and people through whose land rights of way are insisted upon must be properly protected and properly compensated. I would say, particularly to rural Deputies, that this question of the preservation of many rights of way is overdone.  There are many ancient rights of way in this country, the need for which no longer exists because roads have replaced these rights of way in many places.  Many of the rights of way across private holdings are a great source of litigation and trouble amongst farmers.  Every Deputy knows that.  There are rights of way which are very tenuous, for which there is no particular need and which are merely held by those who hold them because of the spirit of acquisition that is held in every man.  The fact that, over the past 20 years, we have had to have compulsory powers only on two occasions is a very good omen for the future of the wisdom with which the policy of forestry will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there is anything else I wanted to say because, as I say, each Deputy, as he got up, cancelled out the previous Deputy's speech.  But, I do want to say again, the work of forestry development in this country is primarily a State job&mdash;it can be done by nobody else&mdash;and the State work is to try to produce timber of commercial value.  Somebody has asked the question about the percentage of hardwoods. The average percentage is 12 per cent. of hardwoods to the rest of softwoods.  Local authorities do not seem to me to be effective instruments for the production of forestry.  The Central Government is the apparatus whereby you can develop forestry in this country.  I pointed out to the <Col N="2367" /> House a while ago that there is no farmer in this country who has not got on his farm a waste acre of land. Every farmer Deputy knows that there is a tremendous waste of land on every farm and there is a waste acre, surely, for an acre of woodland in every farm. Every advice, every assistance will be given by the Department of Forestry to the farmer who plants an acre of land and they will also give him £10 free grant.</P>
    <P>There has been a Turf Development Bill before this House.  The Turf Development Bill is directed towards producing fuel in this country in the belief that coal will never again be had in the same quality, in the same quantity, or at the same price that we had it before the war.  That difficulty will definitely arise for us.  It is overlooked, however, that many a farmer in this country who had turbary rights which would last his household for the next 100 or 150 years has, because of the high price of turf during the past six years, almost completely cut out his banks.  Our bogs are not inexhaustible. If there is, as I am sure there will be, a scarcity of coal in this country, our bogs will disappear very swiftly.  I think it is the best investment that any farmer could make for the next generation to take advantage of the offer by the Department of Forestry, of their advice and assistance, and £10 an acre, to plant trees on his land in one compact block.</P>
    <P>I suggest again that this Bill is merely a consolidating measure.  It asks for very little extra powers.  It merely makes more clear the powers, makes them possible of being put into operation.  It does not, possibly, clearly set out policy in regard to forestry but everybody knows what the policy is.  The amount we aimed at was 10,000 acres a year, with an ultimate area of 700,000 acres.  I believe we should move much more swiftly.  I think it can be done, providing we can get the land.  That is the only difficulty. It is time enough to make any changes in our view as to what the ultimate acreage should be when we have achieved to a certain amount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett raised the question <Col N="2368" /> of the wages and conditions of forestry labourers.  I intend to make no defence of the wages of forestry labourers other than to say that the wages of forestry labourers must be adjusted to the current rate payable by agriculturists. I have always believed that labourers everywhere in the world are not paid what they are worth to the world.  I believe every single one of us will have to change his point of view very soon in regard to the wages being paid to labourers.  If this is a Christian country, at least Christianity should apply to labourers as well as to everybody else.  I cannot adjust forestry wages if they must be related, as they must be, to agricultural wages.  Possibly a number of the matters that were raised here would come on better at the next stage.  I recommend the Bill to the House and suggest that it is a valuable measure.</P>

      <Col N="2369" /> I have a motion on the Order Paper to set up a commission to examine this whole question of how tenants are selected; what measure of prosperity the tenants who have been selected in the past have achieved; and what unit of land is considered from experience to be an economic unit.  In connection with a lot of those people who are in trouble now and who are not carrying out a good system of husbandry, it may happen that it is not their own fault, that they were fixed on to a parcel of land by the Land Commission, and that it was not economically possible for them to achieve any degree of success.  Because of their circumstances, they may have been forced to set the land by conacre or for grazing purposes.  The purpose of the amendment is to hold up any action that the Minister may propose to take, if he gets this measure, until that examination is made; to give the commission that I propose should be set up an opportunity of examining the whole problem; and that until we have their report before us this measure should not be put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I think it would permit of a proper investigation being made into the circumstances in which land has been allocated up to the present and that such a commission as Deputy Hughes recommends would provide for a better type of allottee than at present.  I think, therefore, it would be wise to suspend the operation of the Bill until that commission has had an opportunity of reviewing the position. In a good many cases, question other than the suitability of an applicant had to be taken into consideration.  For example, in areas such as the Midlands, where there was a lot of land to be divided and where it was found to be advisable to bring in allottees from the West, it was considered good policy, perhaps for social reasons, to give land to practically every local person who applied.  That was probably in order to avoid discontent.  The result was that a number of applicants were accepted who were not suitable. Then, again, in connection with the division of estates there is provision for an allotment of land for employees <Col N="2370" /> on the estates.  In many cases, these employees, while deserving of compensation on account of the loss of their employment, might not be the most suitable applicants.  The whole question requires to be investigated and, pending such an investigation, I think it is desirable to postpone the operation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Most Deputies are aware that when we discussed this Bill on the previous stage, I was very much impressed by certain points made by certain Deputies, and I asked representatives from each Party to meet me to discuss the Bill and to see if we could get any agreement anywhere. They very kindly consented to meet me and we had a discussion.  When the discussion was over, I had a further discussion with the officials of the Land Commission, and, out of their experience, out of their knowledge of all the difficulties which had been created by these people for them and out of their knowledge of the evil which has been done, they were at one in believing that nothing but the whole Bill would cure the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the view that because of their experience, because of what I know of their character and their wide tolerance, I could not take any action other than to agree with them.  Yet the thing troubled me.  I am a believer in the preservation of liberty.  I dislike too much compulsion, and in spite of the fact that the officials and commissioners of the Department of Lands, who should know the facts and have the experience, believed that the Bill <Col N="2373" /> was the only thing which would cure the disease, I decided to accept Deputy Hughes' proposal in regard to Section 4, to substitute &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; for &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo;.  On that, there is a possibility that an error might be made.  There is possibly a need for a little leeway in regard to a decision as to what constitutes proper husbandry, and I am prepared to accept &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; for &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo;, but there can be no question at all about the man who will not live in the house.</P>
    <P>Residence in law, as Deputy Coogan knows, is not residence in fact.  We have it very often in income-tax cases and sometimes unfortunately in divorce cases, and what the courts will hold as residence in law may not at all mean what the Land Commission must insist on as residence in fact&mdash;the common-sense fact that a man is in continual residence.  If he is not residing in the house on the land, he certainly cannot be working the land.  Because there is that tremendous difference between residence in fact and residence in law, I shall have to insist on keeping Section 2 as it stands, but I am prepared to accept &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; in relation to Section 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What I object to, notwithstanding what the Minister has said about the difficulty with regard to occupation in fact and occupation in <Col N="2374" /> law, is that if a man is charged in court with failing to comply with a contract, the other party to the contract can walk in and his certificate will be conclusive evidence.  Surely that is not a fair trial.  The individual is at least entitled under the common law to an opportunity to defend himself, but here he is given no such opportunity.  The Minister wants to deny the individual any opportunity of defence because his Department will produce a certificate which is conclusive and final evidence and cannot be questioned.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty, but why can he not accept <i>prima facie</i> and then put in a definition of satisfactory occupation from the Land Commission point of view?  Why must he leave it to the court to decide what is occupation?  I suggest that my proposal is his way out of the difficulty, and I appeal to his fairmindedness to give a man an opportunity of stating his case in court.  There might be some question of difficulties&mdash;a death might have occurred which upset the whole family for a period of six or 12 months&mdash;which might be overlooked by the Department and an individual will certainly feel aggrieved if he is brought into court and given no opportunity to explain his case.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.  He has agreed to give way in relation to Section 4, and with regard to this section, he ought to frame his legislation in such a way as to give the tenant an opportunity of making his defence.  We could get over that difficulty by defining what occupation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate the Minister's viewpoint on this matter of residence.  It is an exceptionally difficult matter to define in law. Income-tax cases have been cited, where you can have a man living in England for the greater part of his lifetime and yet in law it may be a very difficult question to decide as to whether or not he resided in England or his domiciliary residence is here, whether he has given up his residence and gone abroad.  That can conceivably arise on this point and I can appreciate the reasons why the Land Commission have seen fit to put in &ldquo;continuous residence to their satisfaction&rdquo;. <Col N="2375" /> I think what Deputy Costello had in mind was not so much the matter of residence at the matter of direction.  It is not clear from the section in what manner a direction would be given by the Land Commission. It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission may... give a direction to the purchaser to reside continuously to their satisfaction in the dwellinghouse, as on and from such date...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In what way is that effected?  Is it by personal service, is it a verbal direction or is it by posting a notice on the empty dwellinghouse?  I am assuming that was what was operating on Deputy Costello's mind, as the paragraph he seeks to delete says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a certificate under the common seal of the Land Commission certifying that a direction under this section was given to the purchaser, that the direction has not been revoked and that the purchaser has failed to comply with the direction shall be conclusive evidence for all purposes of the facts so certified.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is merely relating to the direction. Was the direction, in fact, given?  A certificate from the Land Commission to say that a direction was given will be sufficient, though in actual fact the person on whom the direction is going to operate may not have any knowledge of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes talks of contracts.  If there is a contract at all, it is of a very special type, where one party contributes nothing and the other party does all the giving.  Surely that is a special type of contract, where one person does all the giving and covers the gift by certain instructions. If those instructions are not carried out&mdash;instructions which are not only for the benefit of the country but for the benefit of the man himself&mdash;<Col N="2376" /> surely the contract is void, if it exists in the ordinary sense?  The courts, of course, must be very careful of individual liberty&mdash;that is their duty&mdash; and, particularly in all cases I know of, the court will take the side of the individual against the State.  It is a question of a common-sense view as to what constitutes actual residence, day to day residence of a man who is inclined to do the work he has contracted to do.  He has contracted to do certain work and has accepted certain conditions when accepting the land as a gift.  If we go into court and take in <i>prima facie</i> evidence, taking the words <i>prima facie</i> instead of &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo;, we are still in the position that the court will decide that a certain type of residence, a &ldquo;hit-and-run&rdquo; residence, as in the case of a man who goes back to his father, will constitute residence in law.  We have no answer to that.  We want residence in fact.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes has mentioned hard cases.  There is no organisation anywhere which has been as careful and as tolerant as the Land Commission has been with all these people.  The whole land tenure trouble and the whole question of land occupation is bristling with difficulties.  There is a public opinion here created through our history and one must be especially tender with it.  I was amazed, in the beginning of my experience with the Land Commission, at the broad tolerance and easiness with which they handled the subject.</P>

I think the House should give us this particular section, because evil exists, though it is a circumscribed evil and deals with a very small section of the farmers in Ireland. This is necessary for the benefit of all the farmers.  It would be a bad thing that houses built at public expense should remain empty or that land provided at public expense should not be utilised.  You can depend on the tolerance and fair play of the Land Commission, which has had such a good reputation for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to condone a tenant being absent from a home which has been provided for him by the State and I would be as vigorous in my condemnation of that as the Minister.  We cannot tolerate a situation where there are hundreds of houses not properly occupied.  I am in agreement with practically everything the Minister said, but take exception to his trying to defeat the function of the court by bringing in &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo; that cannot be questioned. If the Minister has such respect for liberty, justice and fair play, why not allow the court to function in the ordinary way, to weigh the evidence on both sides and make a decision in justice to both sides?  Surely, the Land Commission is in a position to submit evidence that a man was not in satisfactory residence?  The Minister has a powerful institution there, with all the machinery of the State behind it, but he wants to tie the hands of an individual and deny him the right in law to defend himself in a court of justice. That is what we cannot stand for, that is what we cannot meet the Minister on.  I am trying to give the Minister a way out, by asking him to ignore previous definitions and give a definition of his own in this measure and accept a certificate of the Land Commission as <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministry has drawn a distinction between good husbandry and the occupation of a house and says he cannot give way so far as occupation is concerned.  He has explained the difficulties regarding actual residence and the interpretation of residence in law. I am sure Deputy Coogan appreciates that difficulty more than I do.  I understand there is a difficulty there, but I feel it should be overcome.  I feel it is so much more important that we convey to every individual in this country, when he is brought into court, that he is satisfied that he has got a just and impartial decision.  If you propose to operate courts by taking away from the individual brought in the right to defend himself, there will be no respect for justice or the administration of justice.  That is a very important matter for the Minister to take into consideration.  Every individual should be made feel satisfied <Col N="2378" /> that the administration of justice by the courts is fair and impartial.  No man can feel that if we try to say that the State is so powerful that a certificate by a Department must be accepted by a judge, who is dispensing justice, as conclusive and final and incapable of being questioned by anyone. I think that is a big issue and the Minister ought not to be directed solely by civil servants.  Perhaps they are not the best judges to advise the Minister.  Naturally the civil servant, once he decides that certain things must be done, tries to get machinery that will put aside all difficulties so that his object can be attained.  There is a very big principle involved in this and I would not be prepared to give way on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to accept the Minister's view that this is a very special type of contract&mdash;the contract entered into between the Land Commission and the tenant.  If you take that view, you might take the view that every contract is a very special contract, because all contracts differ.  There is a definite contract between the Land Commission and the tenant, and it is not true, as the Minister asserts, that all the giving is on one side and all the taking on the other.  The tenant who enters into occupation of a holding allotted by the Land Commission has to give also.  He has to undertake to pay a given annuity, to repay as far as lies in his power the purchase price of his holding, and the annuity is fixed on the ability of the holding to pay it.  The tenant enters into a contract to pay for the holding over a period of years and he enters into agreements also.  There is, therefore, a definite contract between the tenant and the Land Commission and it is not a contract which, in my opinion, can be set aside by one party to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unreasonable to assume that the courts are unfair to the State, where an issue arises between the citizen and the State.  I think that is an unfair assumption.  I think we must in all legislative proposals base our case on the assumption that the courts are strictly fair, just, impartial and disinterested <Col N="2379" /> and that they will decide every issue on its merits alone, and if the State, through the Land Commission, puts up a reasonably good case, as they can where there is a glaring instance of a person failing to reside on a holding, then the court will give its decision in favour of the Land Commission. I think we ought not definitely to assume that the courts are biased in favour of the tenant and against the Land Commission.  I think all past experience has shown that, on the average, the courts are fair and just and can be relied on to do justice, even to the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I think there is some merit in the suggestion that Deputy Hughes has put forward as a way out of this difficulty, though I appreciate that the draftsman will have considerable difficulty in getting a definition of continuous residence.  Continous residence is a very different thing from permanent residence.  I do not want to go into the whole question of residence. It is really a question of the intention, of the <i>mens rea,</i> the mind of the man, whether he intends to make the particular house his home or not.  All these questions would arise if we go into that subject.  There is some merit in the suggestion put forward that a formula might be found that would meet the point raised by Deputy Hughes, to define occupation or residence and then let the Minister have the powers he wants in Section 2 (b), paragraph 5.  Perhaps he will look into it.</P>

      <P>The certificate of the Land Commission will be based on an occasional inspection of the house.  It might in this case be a frequent inspection but in the ordinary case the inspector might visit the house once or twice a year.  A lot will depend on what he finds on the date of the inspection.  On the basis of the inspector's report the Land Commission certificate will be issued and it is produced in court as conclusive evidence of the failure of the occupant to reside in the particular house.  It is a different proposition from what Deputy Moran has in mind:</P>
      <P>I can see considerable difficulties. There may be cases in which anything could happen.  On the day of the Land Commission inspection the new Public Health Bill might be operative and the furniture may have been taken away to undergo a disinfecting process.  The house might be empty and on that the inspector's certificate might be furnished. In such circumstances the man might have a very good case but the certificate would be there.</P>

      <P>There is no question as to the justice of the courts.  Deputy Coogan has adumbrated that there is a difference between ordinary residence and continuous residence.  Now we want continous residence.  I recently read a book on America.  An Irishman making a speech spoke of a very well-known lady who was a millionairess&mdash;she had 20,000,000 dollars. &ldquo;Everyone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;knows Hetty Greene.  She lived, worked and had her being in New York, but now we find when she is dead she died in New Hampshire, where there are no death duties.&rdquo; That is what is going to happen.  In a particular case, are we going to have pure questions of law? <Col N="2381" /> The Deputy is not giving me a way out; he is giving the recalcitrant a way out.</P>
      <P>The inspectors cannot live in the house.  They make constant inspections. They find a rag of a curtain in the window and, possibly, a bed or a chair installed in the house.  There is not a hen to cluck or a dog to bark at anyone; no appearance of life at all.  And it is not one inspector who goes; there may be two or three inspectors going out at different hours of the day on different days of the week and yet there is not even a mouse stirring in this house.  Then your friend will go into court and say he was visiting his poor, paralysed father on that particular day when the Land Commission inspector visited the place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appreciates that the whole line of judicial decisions since 1860 has been that sublettings for purposes of conacre, agistment, or disturbance are not breaches of the condition against subletting. Now, the Minister is proposing, under Section 3 (a), to bring in any agreement or undertaking to purchase a holding or parcel of land from the Land Commission, whether entered into before, on or after the operative date&mdash;that is the date of the passing of this Act&mdash;and containing a condition whereby the purchaser agrees not to sublet or part with possession of the holding or parcel or any part thereof until the holding or parcel is vested in him.  He is cutting right across a whole line of decisions since 1860 in this, and he is going back.  He is making the condition retrospective because he says, &ldquo;whether entered into before, on or after the operative date&rdquo;.  I think when Deputy Costello put down this amendment, what he had in mind was this line of judicial decisions that has operated since 1860 and that you may conceivably create havoc in certain directions, if you let in the word &ldquo;before&rdquo;, that you may interfere with lettings which were, when they were made not, according to the case law in this country, a breach of the condition against subletting.  That is the position you are creating now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know sufficient about these matters to know exactly what he has in mind but I can see that he feels that if you let this in you may be opening up a whole host of difficulties for people who have acted in accordance with the law in the past and in accordance with the decided law of the <Col N="2385" /> country.  The Minister knows quite well that a condition against subletting was never held by our courts to include lettings in conacre, to pasturage or agistment.  You are bringing these in now.  There may be very good reason for bringing these in but my point is that I certainly would not make the provision retrospective. I think the Minister should at least hold with us in that, that the provision in this matter should not be retrospective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a similar amendment on the Order Paper&mdash; amendment No. 8.  The reason I put it down was that, assuming this is taking place, before the passing of this Act, the citizen had not broken the law; as a matter of fact, he had obeyed the law.  There is a long continuous line of judgments up to the moment on that matter.  This House is now going to say that that man had done an illegal act when in fact what he had done was good law and he had not broken the law up to that.  I object to this whole section for that reason.  Of course, if it is confined to all these lettings made to allottees, it is not so bad.  I take it it will not affect the general landlord at all; that it will only affect lettings to allottees.  I certainly very strongly object to making it retrospective.  It was good law up to the passing of this Act for the man to let his land in conacre, agistment or pasturage.  That was held not be a breach of a condition, and if you now let in the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; in this section, you then make illegal what was perfectly legal when the man did it.  I think, while the man should not have done it, provision should have been taken in the Act when it was being passed.  Very often when these Land Acts were being passed since 1933, we attempted as <Col N="2386" /> best we could, and with the utmost reason, to put forward reasonable amendments.  Every one of them was fired out, one on top of the other, <i>in globo.</i>  Not one of them was accepted. To the Land Act of 1933 I put down 48 amendments, and each one of them was fired out.  Now, after 14 or 15 years, the Minister comes in with a drastic thing like this to determine that a thing was bad law which was in fact good law.  That would be a very improper thing, and a very unjust thing, in view of the manner in which Land Acts in the last 14 or 15 years have been rushed through the House.  It is not just, it is not right and it should not be done.  There is no use in holding inquests as to why it was done, as to why these Bills were rushed through the House.  They were carried by a majority without any consideration at all.  No appeal, no reason, would be listened to.  Now, when a defect is found in 1946, we are going to make it retrospective, we are going to make an act illegal which was in fact good law according to the whole line of decisions from the passing of those Land Acts to the present moment.</P>

      <P>I believe they should be made to carry out a system of good husbandry.  I believe we should prevent conacre and subletting.  What we object to is, the interpretation of the law as it stands at present, permits people to make that subletting. The definition of the word &ldquo;subletting&rdquo; does not cover letting for the purpose of conacre or agistment.  If that is so, the Minister under this Bill is imposing a new condition on those people that is not in their agreement. For that reason, I think it is unfair to include agreements that were entered into before the operative date. I think that is what Deputy Costello had in mind when he proposed to delete the words &ldquo;whether&rdquo; and &ldquo;before&rdquo;, because, definitely, you are imposing a new obligation and a new <Col N="2387" /> condition that was not there and in so far as you are doing that, you are doing an injustice to them.  As I say, we do not want to condone subletting but, if a mistake has been made, I think it would be very harsh and very unjust to try to make that provision retrospective.  The only thing you can do is to try to induce them by advice and otherwise to use their land themselves and to avoid conacre lettings and agistment.</P>

      <P>This section derives directly from the signed agreement of the allottees which derives again directly from the 1923 Act.  Steam-rolling Bills through the House is not a very nice thing, but I looked up to see what the general opinion of the debates was of that particular section of the 1923 Act, and I find there was no debate at all on it.  This section derives from the agreement which the allottees signed.  That comes directly from the 1923 Act.  Deputy McMenamin, of course, knows a good deal about Ulster tenant right and knows that as a result of Ulster tenant right conacre is a different thing in Ulster.  It carries certain commitments. It means keeping the soil in good heart and treating it properly.  Here are people who signed this agreement.  We know there are many of them who have let that land for any kind of usage, never trying to do a stroke of work on it.  We give them the land.  I think, even though it is an evil, it is a limited evil.  The argument has been made that Land Commission inspectors have been unwise in their selections. There are bound to be mistakes and there are bound to be mistakes when men will try to deceive you to get a benefit.  While I am in general a great lover of my fellowmen, I am not at all deceived by men who look for something for nothing.  I know the things they will say and do.  I was wise enough as a T.D. ten years ago to know when a man got a new deposit receipt for me, to point out he had so much money, to know there was very little use writing to the Land Commission about him because that belonged to somebody else.  This section is not retrospective.  The Bill is directed <Col N="2388" /> towards curing a limited evil, which is an evil, and will not affect people such as Deputy McMenamin has in mind, people who let conacre in the ordinary Ulster fashion that Deputy McMenamin knows.  It is to get the best that can be got out of the people who have received a gift from the State at huge State expense.  I think the Deputies ought to give me the section.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister more clearly to define what is conacre and lettings for conacre, and what is not.  That is the difficulty about the whole thing.  If land is let temporarily for a period of 11 months, is that a conacre letting?  I should like a clear definition.  I understand that according to law you cannot let for more than 11 months without running the danger of losing it.  I agree with the Minister that this section is necessary, but it is possible that slight hardships or probably great hardships may arise under the section if it were operated to the full and according to the wording of the section.  Probably the Minister can recall a person who has been given a portion of land in the last 20 years and is living on it and using it to the best advantage.  That man may be unable to do the tillage required under the tillage Order himself.  He may ask one of his neighbours to do his tillage and he may let two or three or four acres for the purpose of having his tillage done.  Perhaps he may let a meadow.  He may be a perfect tenant in every other way.  I can see hardships arising for tenants if this section were operated to the last letter of the law.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coogan has quoted the Deasy Act of 1860.  I have come across the heads of a suggested legislative enactment by Isaac Butt in 1867 in which he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I propose to bind the tenant to proper cultivation of the farm, and to the maintenance of all improvements; and, in the event of his failing in either of these conditions he incurs, in like manner, the forfeiture of the interest which the statute confers upon him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Isaac Butt many years ago put in very succinct language what I should like to say.  Again, when the Bill becomes law, it is not mandatory on the Land Commission to take action against a tenant.  It is not retrospective.  It deals with a certain limited number of people.  It does not compel the Land Commission to take action.  Knowing the officials of the Land Commission and their desire to nurse these people into good citizens, I can recommend the section with the fullest confidence to the Dáil.</P>

Anybody who wants to let land, instead of calling it an 11-months letting, which the Minister could possibly get them on before, they will call it a conacre letting.  I must confess, however, that I find difficulty in understanding the wording of the section, because it would appear on the face of it to be retrospective. Perhaps there is some reason for it, but I find difficulty in understanding it.</P>

      <P>I am quarrelling with the word &ldquo;before&rdquo;.  Will the Minister agree to take out the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; and then we will be perfectly satisfied with this section?  I have a feeling that if you leave in the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; you are importing into past lettings a condition which did not exist when these lettings were made.  These lettings were perfectly lawful lettings according to the law of the land when made.  If you put in the word &ldquo;before&rdquo;, the section has a retrospective effect, and it may render unlawful a number of acts which were lawful when they were carried out.  I <Col N="2390" /> think the principle is bad apart from any other consideration.  We sympathise with the Minister in what he is endeavouring to do, namely, to prevent those people who got land from the State from misusing the land or carrying on bad husbandry.  But we want to prevent any possible injustice happening because of the past.  We do not want to go back to the past. We will give the Minister a free hand for the future without tying him in any way.  I think that, if he takes out the word &ldquo;before&rdquo;, he will not be tied.</P>

      <P>That Emergency Powers (373) Order, 1946, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Order, in effect, provides that Orders made under the Emergency Powers Acts, whether by the Government or by a Minister under the Order entitling a Minister to make such an Order, are to be judicially noticed in the courts without proof.  In other words, a person can be tried and convicted under an Emergency Powers Order without a copy of that Order being produced to the court or proved. <Col N="2392" /> I can find no justification whatever, even in expendiency, for the making of this Order.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will bear with me for a few moments, I can give the history of how this Order was made, and I think that language of emphasis, much less language of exaggeration, is not required to bring home to the House the seriousness of the making of this Order.  Deputies are aware that, under the Emergency Powers Acts, beginning in 1939 at the commencement of the war, the Government were given extensive powers to enable them to meet the situation created by the world war which was then at its inception. Under Section 2 of the parent Act of 1939, the Government were empowered to make by Order during the emergency&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;such provisions as are in the opinion of the Government necessary or expedient for securing the public safety or preservation of the State or for the maintenance of public order or for the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A number of categories were mentioned in that section to which I have referred.  The Government were uncontrolled so far as the powers conferred on them by the Oireachtas were concerned in relation to the type of Orders they were to make, but the Oireachtas gave them a headline that the Orders were to be made only where such Orders were necessary or expedient for the public safety, the preservation of the State, the maintenance of public order or in relation to matters connected with essential services and supplies.  It passes my imagination to conceive how the making of this Order falls within any of these categories, made, in particular, at the time at which and in the circumstances in which it was made.</P>
    <P>The particular Order costs only 2d. and to prove that Order in a criminal case in court, all that is necessary for the solicitor or counsel appearing for the State is to hand it across two or three feet of space to the registrar of the court.  This Order has been passed to enable that small formality to be dispensed with.  In order that counsel <Col N="2393" /> for the State may not have to put into the hands of the registrar of the court Emergency Powers Orders costing a few pence, the provisions of the Emergency Powers Acts have been invoked.</P>
    <P>A case was brought against a man named Kennedy for alleged infringement of Orders in relation to, I think, sugar, and that case gave rise to the circumstances in which this Order was passed.  He was convicted by the Special Criminal Court &mdash; the military court or military tribunal, as it is popularly called&mdash;and it is a matter perhaps of some significance that in the course of that case counsel for one of the parties being prosecuted in connection with the sale of sugar had to direct the attention of the court to the fact that apparently the State itself did not know the Orders under which the proceedings were being brought, because it appeared that defending counsel knew the Orders better than the State itself and had to point out that some of the indictments brought against some of these men were in fact brought under Orders which had in fact been repealed, and a verdict of not guilty had accordingly to be entered by the court in respect of some of these charges.</P>
    <P>I have verified that statement from the counsel engaged in the case&mdash;I was not myself engaged in the case until a later stage.  At all events, in respect of some of the charges, a conviction was obtained, and at no time during the hearing of that case were the Orders under which the proceedings were brought and in respect of which it was alleged that criminal offences had been committed by the defendants, proved before this lay tribunal of military gentlemen.  Heavy penalties were imposed and the matter was brought to the Court of Criminal Appeal who set aside the conviction on the grounds that these Orders had not been proved.</P>
    <P>In the course of the judgment in that case, the principle upon which the judgment proceeded was stated by the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the court.  When I read that judgment and draw the attention of Deputies to the provisions of this Order, it will be clear that this Order, <Col N="2394" /> which was passed under the authority of the Emergency Powers Acts and is supposed to be justified by reference to an emergency situation, in effect and in fact contravenes one of the most fundamental principles in criminal law and in the conduct of criminal cases in court.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Davitt, in giving judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal, setting aside those convictions, enunciated a principle&mdash;a principle which is centuries old and which we are supposed to have taken over and certainly thought we had taken over.  The learned judge, giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in this case, restated and emphasised it anew. It is the principle which was abrogated and given no adherence to by counsel for the State conducting these prosecutions.  The learned judge said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The burden of proof which rests upon the prosecution in a criminal case cannot, however, be eased in this or any other case.  Every fact necessary to establish the guilt of an accused person must be proved clearly and beyond reasonable doubt. Not merely that, it must be proved in evidence at the trial.  It is not sufficient if the court satisfies itself otherwise than by the evidence submitted at the trial.  The proper way to establish the fact that the Orders in question were properly made in exercise of the powers conferred by the Act of 1939 was by providing that fact by evidence, either by one of the methods provided by Section 4 of the Documentary Evidence Act, 1925, or otherwise.  This was not done.  It is not sufficient to establish, if it could be established, that the Special Criminal Court itself had knowledge of what ought to have been proved in evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every lay man knows&mdash;to adapt the old cliché consecrated by Macaulay, &ldquo;every schoolboy knows&rdquo;&mdash;that the burden of proof in a criminal case rests on the prosecution.  It is merely stating an old principle, a principle that was nullified by the proceedings in this case of Kennedy.  This is the principle which has been abrogated by this Order, No. 373, which is the subject <Col N="2395" /> of the present motion.  It is now no longer necessary to prove these documents in evidence.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there have been vast quantities of these Emergency Powers Orders promulgated by the Government.  There is no statutory obligation on the Government to publish any of those Orders.  In this connection, may I refer in passing&mdash; apologising to Deputies for anything that may appear to be technical&mdash;as it is of very grave import and bringing with it the consideration of a very wide principle, to the Rules Publication Act, 1893.  That was a British statute and provided that, in respect of certain statutory orders, it was necessary to give notice of the making of those orders before they were made, in the <i>Official Gazette</i> or otherwise.  That Act does not apply to Orders of this kind, which are to be laid on the Table of the House.  As a matter of fact, the opinion has been held, since the establishment of this State, that that Act is, to say the least of it, of doubtful validity in this country, having regard to the constitutional changes which have taken place.  Reference is made in one famous case, where two people were executed, to the fact that the Rules Publication Act of 1893 did not apply to the Emergency Powers Order in this case.  I will refer to that in a moment.  It shows the evils which may result from the continuance of this Order, if the Government insist on its continuance.  The position is that a Stationery Office copy of one of these Orders, costing a few pence, is sufficient proof of its existence and all that is required in a Criminal Court is for the prosectuor to hand it into court.  Now, this simple operation, this inexpensive operation, may be dispensed with, on this Order made by the Government.  Of course, in Kennedy's case the conviction was quashed.</P>
    <P>The next step in the history of this transaction was that the Attorney General prosecuting in this case, gave himself a certificate for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.  He did not ask the court, as is laid down in the statute, for leave to appeal against the <Col N="2396" /> judgment.  Where a matter raises a question of exceptional public importance and where it is desirable in the public interest that there should be a decision of the Supreme Court on a point of law in a matter arising out of a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, there can be an appeal, under the statute, to the Supreme Court, if the court gives a certificate or if the Attorney General gives a certificate.  In reference to that simple matter, all that had to be done was to spend a few pence on a Stationery Office copy of the Order and hand it a few feet across to the registrar's table.  That was regarded by the Attorney General as a matter of exceptional public importance, in respect of which it was desirable that there should be a decision of the Supreme Court, in the public interest.  I pass over any action of the Attorney General in giving himself that certificate.  The case came before the Supreme Court and at that stage I came into it and argued it before the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The point was raised that there was no appeal given to the Attorney General against an acquittal or conviction, against the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal quashing the conviction and directing an acquittal&mdash;as happened in this case.  That was argued fully for several days by leading counsel of the State and eventually, on a Thursday afternoon between three and four o'clock, the Supreme Court gave their judgment, holding that no appeal lay in the circumstances of that case, no appeal from an acquittal and no appeal from an order of the Court of Criminal Appeal directing a conviction of the Special Criminal Court to be quashed and an acquittal to be entered.  That happened on Thursday afternoon and this Order was made on Friday morning, within a few hours. The Order is dated 1st February, 1946. The judgment of the Supreme Court in the Kennedy case holding that the Attorney General had no appeal was given on the day before in the late afternoon.  What was the necessity for the undue haste in making that Order? All that was required in the Kennedy case, as I have said, was to hand in the Orders.  Apparently, even in the <Col N="2397" /> Kennedy case, not merely were the Orders not handed in, but the State apparently did not know or were not fully apprised of the various orders in respect of which the prosecutions were being brought.</P>
    <P>Now the position is that anybody may be prosecuted under an Emergency Powers Order and not a single document of any kind&mdash;either a Stationery Office copy or a copy printed or typewritten &mdash; need be handed in.  There is no necessity for proof.  That is the position of the law as it stands at the moment.  I would ask Deputies, in the light of those facts, to advert back to Section 2, which gives power to the Government to make that Order and I would ask them to remember the circumstances in which the section was passed, with a world war breaking out and when we were threatened with very grave repercussions from that war, even if we escaped the full consequences of it. Was it necessary for the Government, with that undue haste, to pass an Order saving the State a few pence and a solicitor a little expenditure of energy in leaning across a few feet of space and handing that to the registrar of the court?  How was that necessary &ldquo;to secure public safety or the preservation of the State, for the maintenance of public order or the provision and control of supplies essential to the life of the community?&rdquo; The day after that judgment was delivered in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the position was the same exactly as it was the day before, except in so far as Kennedy was concerned. He got out of it.  The same rule applied under the Documentary Evidence Act of 1925, which was referred to in the judgment of Justice Davitt which I have mentioned.  It was necessary to prove that the document in evidence was in existence, to go through the simple procedure I have already described two or three times.  That was deleted and, in order to save a few pence and a small expenditure of energy, literally hundreds of pounds, if not more, have been expended in legal costs and a conviction upset.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2398" /> I ask Deputies to say that this Order is a gross abuse of the powers granted under the Emergency Powers Acts. Last July, when the Government came into this House and asked for the continuance of these powers, the case was made that it was the intention of the Government to get rid, as quickly as possible, of all these powers under the Emergency Powers Acts except to the extent that it was absolutely necessary to exercise those powers largely, if not entirely, in relation to matters of supply.  The idea, it was suggested at that time by the Taoiseach, was that he only wanted the minimum of powers and, without committing himself, he said he merely wanted them to see that the country would have sufficient supplies.  We have, fortunately, in this country been living for the past 12 months in a state of great peace, in a state where the courts are functioning normally, properly and well, and why it should be necessary for the Government&mdash;I say it without undue emphasis and certainly not with exaggeration&mdash;to abuse the powers conferred on them by the Emergency Powers Act of 1939, passes my comprehension.</P>
    <P>It is possible to make a case to show the evils that may come from the existence of this Order.  It is probable that no counsel conducting a prosecution will have the effrontery to say: &ldquo;There is an Emergency Powers Order in existence, I will tell you what it is, and it is this,&rdquo; and the court will have to take it.  I repeat what I said a short time ago, and on which I was more or less abused by the Taoiseach.  There has been the utmost difficulty in getting these Emergency Powers Orders.  It is impossible even for a trained lawyer, whose job it is to know what these Orders are, to follow them.  I will ask the Minister for Justice to give to the House&mdash;if he does not do so now, I will ask him by way of Parliamentary Question&mdash;how many Orders have been made since 1939 under the Emergency Powers Acts.  It is impossible for anybody to follow them.  I made the case that it was possible for Orders to be made by the Government and people not to be able to get a copy of them.  The <Col N="2399" /> Taoiseach told the Leas-Cheann Comhairle then that he was not accusing me of telling lies but, whether he was or not, I had a procession of my colleagues at the Bar next day telling me of the various times when they tried to get Orders and could not.</P>
    <P>In one case, where counsel was unable to get an Order, he rang up the Department and asked whether the facts he gave them were covered by any Emergency Powers Orders.  After a certain amount of finessing he was told they were.  He asked could he have a copy of the Order, but they said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, there was no copy available. Finally, he got a typewritten copy.  If he had not gone to the trouble of ringing up the Department his client would have been prosecuted under an Order that neither he nor his counsel could get.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to one case, or rather comment on a case which occurred some years ago, so that I may not be accused of exaggeration or stating what may not be in fact the truth, as the Taoiseach was good enough to say. I refer the House to a judgment of the late Chief Justice in the case of the State (Quinlan) against Kavanagh and others.  The report is in the 1935 Irish Reports, at pages 262 and 263.  I was engaged in the case.  A writ of habeas corpus was obtained; a conditional order was obtained in respect of Lieutenant Quinlan who, it was alleged by us, was illegally detained.  The Supreme Court held that he was and released him and, having been beaten on every point, on the last line of defence the State counsel purported to justify the detention of Lieutenant Quinlan under regulations made under Article 2A prescribing prisons into which men arrested under the provisions of that Article could be detained.  These are the words of the Chief Justice in his judgment, which is in the Irish Reports for all time.  He referred to the regulations made under Article 2A, Section 10, sub-section (2), naming a list of nine prisons in which prisoners might be detained or imprisoned, and then he goes on&mdash;these are his words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The court asked for a copy of the regulations to which he, that is, <Col N="2400" /> counsel for the State referred.  None could be supplied.  Neither party before the court had a copy.  Enquiry at the Law Library elicited the information that no copy had been supplied to the Law Library and apparently their existence was unknown. The court then inquired of counsel for the State whether, if the court sent a messenger to the Stationery Office or the Government Sales Shop for Official Publications, a copy could be purchased, which we were prepared to do immediately. The answer was that a copy could not be procured in that way because the document was not on sale and could not be purchased either by the public or even for our official use. We then asked whether the document was not in print and whether printed copies could not be supplied for the use of the court.  The answer by State counsel was that the regulations had not been printed, and that the court would not be furnished with a full copy of the regulations in print or in any other form, but that counsel proposed to hand to the court certified typed copies of extracts from the regulations containing those parts of the regulations upon which they intended to rely and base their argument and they declined to allow the court to see any other part of the regulations or to consider them as a whole with reference to the intended argument.  It is difficult to speak with restraint of such a proceeding. It is questionable, indeed, if one should speak of it with restraint.  It is an affront to the court.  To permit it would be a travesty of justice, and, for my part, I reject an argument so proffered as incapable in law of being entertained by any court of justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the judgment of the late Chief Justice in reference to regulations which are not Orders under these Emergency Powers Acts.  But there can be no doubt that such a state of affairs as was adverted to by the Chief Justice in the judgment which I have read, and which I myself copied from the Official Reports, can be repeated with impunity if this Order is allowed <Col N="2401" /> to remain in force.  The subject-matter of the comments by the Chief Justice were regulations made by the Government, or by a Minister, I think.</P>
    <P>That there were Orders of the Government passed under the Emergency Powers Acts and under which two men were arrested and detained and subsequently tried and executed, and that they exist, I will also demonstrate by reference to the Official Reports.  There were two Orders made by the Government and under these Orders two men were arrested and detained and could not be given, and were not given, a copy of the Order under which they were arrested and detained, nor could their legal advisers get it.  They then applied for a writ of habeas corpus and at that time, when the conditional Order was applied for, those Orders were not procurable and had not been printed or published.  The case to which I refer is the case of McGrath and Harte, and it is reported in the Irish Reports of 1941, the report beginning on page 68 and the judgment of Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy, to which I need only briefly refer, begins on page 69:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The subsisting committal Order, entitled under certain emergency laws (1),&rdquo;</P>
    <P>those are the laws to which I have been referring&mdash;that is, the Emergency Powers Acts&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;justified the detention by reference to two Orders, called the Emergency Powers Orders (Nos. 41 and 41A), 1940, under which the trial was held. It appeared that the making of Order No. 41 had only been announced in the last number of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>; it has been the practice to print, in the Statutory Rules and Orders series, and put on sale, Orders entitled Emergency Powers Orders, which cover a wide variety of topics, but it appeared that Orders Nos. 41 and 41A, being very recent, had not yet been published and that the solicitor for the prisoners had not succeeded in obtaining them.  The prisoners stated that these Orders had not been supplied to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In an ordinary case I could have adjourned the application, to be renewed as soon as official prints or <Col N="2402" /> certified copies of the two Orders had been procured, but this course was not open to me in view of the immediate imminence of the execution of the death sentences.  In this dilemma I made a conditional order for each man, because I could not, in a capital case, without seeing the text of the two vital Orders, make the grave assumptions against the condemned men involved in blindly taking for granted the contents of the two Orders as justifying the departure from ordinary law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that these two men were tried and sentenced to death under Emergency Powers Order which had not been published, of which they could not get a copy, and of which their legal advisers could not get a copy.  They were, of course, subsequently supplied when a writ of habeas corpus was applied for, and the court held that the Orders were valid, but the men were executed.  I refer to that case as emphasising what did occur, and as pointing to the dangers of what may occur if this Order proceeds. There is no obligation, so far as I know, on the Government to publish, much less to print Orders, made under the emergency powers code.</P>
    <P>A recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal has laid it down&mdash;and I hope this House will take note of the decision, if and when the Government comes this year for a continuance of the power of the Emergency Powers Acts&mdash;that in reference to the obligation imposed on citizens of this country by Emergency Powers Orders, it is the duty of citizens to find out for themselves what their obligations are, and even in cases where in ordinary language a citizen would be justified in assuming that an offence would not be committed, by adopting that course of action, if he makes a mistake, he must take the consequences.  The position is that these Orders need not be published; they need not be printed. There is no obligation on the State to furnish any individual citizen with any of these Orders.  The citizen must find out for himself, how he can, and where he can, whether he has committed any <Col N="2403" /> offence under the Order or not.  If he is prosecuted, the position is that either the solicitor for the State, or counsel for the State, or whoever conducts the prosecution, need not produce in court, or prove in any way, the Order under which a man is going to be prosecuted and condemned.  The court is supposed to know and to take judicial notice.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine a court acting without seeing one of these Orders in some official form.  That is not the point.  The point is that it may happen as it happened in the McGrath and Harte case, where two people were tried, convicted and sentenced to death under two Emergency Powers Orders which had not been published. Private citizens might find themselves infringing the law unintentionally because they cannot get these Emergency Powers Orders when they are not available.  Experience has shown how difficult it is&mdash;not very frequently&mdash;in some cases to get these Orders.  There are instances where the Orders have not been published, certainly for some considerable time afterwards.  Whether you know that these Orders are there or not you inadvertently commit an offence under one of these Orders and they need not be proved in court.  Much of what I have said would be ground for annulling this Order, even within the legal and moral powers of the Government.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised the aspect that there was no justification whatever for making this Order, or for the promulgation of such an Order under the emergency powers conferred on the Government under these Acts.  That Order, in my submission to the House, is entirely unjustified by any of the powers which it was intended by the Oireachtas to give the Government. There is, in fact, no justification or necessity for it.  I stated several times, and I repeat, for the benefit of those who were not here when I said it before, that all this Order does is to save State counsel the trouble of leaning across a few feet in court and handing to the registrar a print of the Order printed and published by the Stationery Office which costs only a few pence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2404" /> How was the State jeopardised? Where did the public interest suffer by that?  I submit to the House that it would be wrong and unjust to allow this Order to continue to have the course of law, as, apparently, it has at the moment.  Accordingly, I press upon Deputies to look upon this matter as calmly as possible, and as calmly as I tried to put the case, feeling as I do very strongly, that the annulment of this Order is necessary; that it is a violation of the fundamental principles of criminal practice and criminal law; that a person is not proved guilty until the State by evidence proves his guilt beyond all reasonable doubt; and not merely proves it by evidence, but by means by which facts and documents are put in evidence in accordance with well - established and old - established criminal procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say is this, that the Order is entirely and absolutely necessary. The Deputy spoke about proving the Order.  I am sure he did not deliberately mean to mislead the House.  The ordinary layman is probably not aware that the practice in the Special Criminal Court has been, since it was set up, for the registrar to obtain copies of every Order and, whenever a case was brought, each member of the court was given a copy of that Order.  It was not considered necessary that counsel should go through the formality that has been described by Deputy Costello of actually handing in the Order, seeing that the members of the court already had the Order.  Apparently that was not in accordance with the law.  The Court of Appeal has held that that should have been done.  But the practice in all these cases has been, as I say, for the registrar to procure copies of these Orders and hand each member of the court a copy of the Order.  As a matter of fact, in the case which the Deputy has been describing, the details of these Orders were dealt with and actually it was in the transcript of the evidence, although, naturally, as the Order was not proved in the accepted manner, that is, by counsel saying formally, &ldquo;I hand in this Order&rdquo;, that does not appear, because, of course, it <Col N="2405" /> did not happend and, as I say, it was believed it was not necessary.  That has been the practice.  The result would be, if we were not to make this Order, that every case that has been tried by that court would be in doubt; it could be quashed, possibly, because that formality was not gone through.</P>
      <P>I will admit immediately that if the court could not get these Orders and if people did not know about them and did not get them, that would be entirely unjust.  I have made inquiries and I am given to understand that at no time was that the position with the Special Criminal Court.  In the case mentioned by Deputy Costello, the Order that was made was an Order sending these particular people for trial, not before this Special Criminal Court but before a military court which was set up here at a very critical period when some police officers had been shot down&mdash;as most Deputies will remember&mdash;and a special court had been established with the full consent of the Oireachtas to deal with crimes of that type.  It was necessary for the Government to make an Order sending these people before that court.  Some judges, I believe, were of the opinion that it was not necessary to make that Order at all but, anyway, as a precautionary measure, that Order was made and, of course, it was, as everyone acquainted with the proceedings at that time will remember, a time when everybody felt that actions of the kind that were being dealt with by that court had to be dealt with promptly in order to put down a terrorist attack on the State.  So, to rely on that, I do not think is fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy has left the House under the impression that the court has been proceeding in the absence of these Orders.  It has not. If we did not make this Order, as I say, all the cases would be in doubt. Some of them were not punitive.  Take the Rent Restrictions Act.  If a case was tried under that Act and the Order had not been proved, that case might be upset.  The Deputy did not inform the House, which is composed mainly of laymen, that an ordinary Act does not require to be proved, that the court take judicial notice of an ordinary Act <Col N="2406" /> of Parliament&mdash;that it has not to be proved.  It is up to me to let Deputies know that that is the position. Deputy Costello has not told us that it is not the position, but he did not inform us that it is the position.</P>
    <P>In Section 10 of the Emergency Powers Act it was thought that we had provided that these Emergency Powers Orders would be in the same category as Acts.  That was the intention and on that assumption the counsel always acted until it was challenged.  I think the first occasion it was challenged in the court was this case of Kennedy.  So that, all these cases have gone on ever since the establishment of that court, and no case, apparently, was appealed on the point that the Order had not been proved.  Therefore, it really amounts to a technicality.  Admittedly, counsel was not acting in accordance with the law, as decided by the Court of Appeal.  We say that it is absolutely and entirely necessary that we should make sure of the position and not leave it in doubt.</P>
    <P>As to the retrospective part of it, the intention under Section 10 of the Emergency Powers Act was that these Emergency Powers Orders should have the same effect as an ordinary law. That is not the case, according to the decision of the court, and in making this Order we have simply made that position secure.  There is no question about our right to do it.  The validity of the thing has been established.  I am not going to follow all these cases except to make it clear that there is nothing new in this.  The practice has been followed ever since this court was set up, not alone in this court, but I understand that the position in the ordinary courts, the District Court, and the Circuit Court, is somewhat the same.  Take the case of breaches of the tillage Order.  I understand the practice was that when the first of these cases came before the court, the State Counsel generally proved the Order once.  He just handed in the Order on the first occasion, and from that out took it for granted that the court had knowledge of the Order.  There is just a danger that if this Order were not made, every one of those cases could be reopened and we would have a state <Col N="2407" /> of chaos, which, of course, the Government is not going to stand for. Therefore, I say, there is every necessity for this Order and every justification for it.  I have put the case as plainly as I possibly can, and I want Deputies to know what exactly the position is.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy Costello, because I am completely incapable of doing it, into the events which happened in the different courts operating or dealing with cases prosecuted under the various emergency regulations, but I do state that it came, not once, but many times, inside my own knowledge, hearing lawyers complain to me, merely because I was a Deputy, of the impossible position they found themselves in from time to time in defending clients and being unable to get copies of the emergency Orders under which their clients were being prosecuted.  That is a matter which those closer to the courts have far more knowledge of than I have.  What strikes me about this particular motion is, it is a motion to repeal or rescind one Emergency Powers Order made in February, 1946. In any ordinary democratic Assembly, in any State having a Parliament, whose function it is to make laws, it is normally regarded as unique and entirely exceptional that a situation should arise where any citizen of that State would be arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned for any offence against any Act not passed through that particular Parliament.  Some six years ago we met here at night, under the shadow of an immense and terrible war, when none of us knew how rapidly we might be engulfed in that war, and the Government brought in an Emergency Empowering Act, and in that Act they asked for powers to replace legislation by regulation, by emergency Order.  The case made was that such terrible difficulties might arise during the war that the ordinary speed of legislation would be unable to cope with those difficulties; that the procedure of legislation was rather slow, and that situations might conceivably arise during the course of the war when something had to be done <Col N="2408" /> imperatively, and it would be impossible to deal with it through Parliament. That was the case made, and that case is there on the records of this House.  The power asked for by the Government to legislate by emergency Order was in the event of some terrible crisis where Parliament could not operate, in the event of some imminent danger, where it was necessary to take speedy action, and where delay would be dangerous.  We went through the five years of that war from beginning to end.</P>
      <P>Seven months after the war is completely over and is just history, we have this kind of felon-setting emergency Order still being made, not honouring the pledge given by the Taoiseach last December, speaking for the Government, that it was their intention to get as rapidly away as they safely could from utilising all powers under the Emergency Act and that the continuation of that Act would only be used to the extent that is essential in the public interest.  I wonder will the Minister tell us what is the use of the head of the Government, speaking in his own name and claiming to speak in the name of the Government, making a statement to that effect, where the honour of the individual and of the Government is involved, that during the continuation of that Act it will only be used to the very minimum extent and to the extent necessitated by the public interest.  Was this some case of dire necessity?  Was this some situation that could not be dealt with other than by an emergency Order passed between daybreak and twilight; passed, as Deputy Costello told us, some 18 hours after a certain case had been dealt with?  My support of the motion before the House is the measure of my opposition to a Government, after the war is over, continuing to use and to abuse powers that were reluctantly given to the Government only to deal with really acute emergencies that might have arisen in the course of the war.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputies will consider this matter calmly, because it should not affect their political opinions or affiliations. <Col N="2409" /> Anybody who listened to this debate, particularly Deputies who have no experience of legal matters, cannot but have been unfavourably impressed by the weakness of the argument which the Minister put forward.  It may be that there are good grounds for the introduction of this Order, but, if there are, they have not been given to the House.  The Minister said that in the ordinary way in the Special Criminal Court the Registrar had copies of the various Orders, that they were available, and that it was unnecessary and was not the practice to produce these Orders before the court.  I want to inform the House that at the time of the specific case to which Deputy Costello referred, the Kennedy case, there were a number of other people charged and there were at least three or four sets of defending counsel and solicitors.</P>
      <P>At the beginning, and on a number of occasions during the course of that trial, the point was made that these Orders had not been put in evidence. An opportunity was given to State Counsel to hand in the Orders and they declined to do so.  If, as the Minister asserts, the ordinary practice is that these Orders are in the possession of the Registrar, then in this case, in which at least five people were charged, these Orders were not in court.  Not alone were they not in court, but during the course of the trial it transpired that the Orders under which certain charges were being preferred against the accused people had been repealed. During the course of the trial, the court had to make amendments to the charges to which the accused were pleading.  I do not know whether Deputies are aware that it can make a considerable difference to an accused person if he finds himself charged with doing or conspiring to do certain acts between certain dates.  In this particular case some of these Orders were not available.</P>

      <P>Only for the defending counsel they would have been found guilty.  If the individual was not able to brief counsel he would have been found guilty, because the court was not made aware of it by the State.  I want to impress on Deputies that, in this particular case, only for the fact that the defending solicitor and counsel had procured at considerable difficulty these specific Orders these people would have been convicted under Orders which were no longer in force. Time and again, the Taoiseach said that these Orders would not be retained any longer than the necessities of the emergency justified.  It is now almost a year since the termination of hostilities, and we have had over six years of the Emergency Powers Act. Deputies must realise that, not alone is the necessity for these Orders draw- <Col N="2411" /> ing to a close, but that it is entirely unnecessary and unfair to people who may be charged in the future to bring in an Order of this kind at this stage of the emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the principle that rash people rush in where angels fear to tread, I intervene briefly in this debate.  Like other Deputies, I am accustomed to having shoals of these Emergency Powers Orders delivered to me.  I have often wondered how the average citizen who is affected by these Orders can hope to study their provisions and keep within their various requirements.  There is, however, or, at least, I believed there was, one safeguard for the ordinary citizen, that is, that when brought into court he would not be convicted of having violated any Order until the court was satisfied that he had so violated the Order and until the Order was produced in court as definite evidence of the fact.</P>
      <P>Emergency Powers (No. 373) Order was delivered to me some time ago and I must confess that, as a layman, I did not know exactly what it meant.  There are only two or three operative words in the Order, and I gather from Deputy Costello that its effect is to ensure that it will not be necessary in future to prove the existence of an Emergency Powers Order in order to get a conviction. The Minister asserts that a similar position operates in regard to Acts of the Oireachtas, but surely he will acknowledge that there is a very fundamental difference between Acts of Parliament and Emergency Powers Orders.  There is at least a distinction in the manner in which they are enacted. Acts of Parliament require considerable public discussion before they become law, and the public have some chance of knowing that they have been enacted, but half-a-dozen Emergency Powers Orders may be made in one night and they immediately become operative.  The ordinary citizen has no protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>And possibly a copy of an Order may not be circulated, as Deputy Davin suggests.  It has been <Col N="2412" /> decided by the courts that it is absolutely necessary to have these Orders proved in court, and I think the courts would not decide that it is necessary to have them proved without very good reason.  There have been very good reasons why they should be so proved. There might be dangers of a miscarriage of justice, or of persons being accused of offences under Orders which might possibly have been repealed, and therefore it is the opinion of the courts that these Orders should be proved in court.  That was a wise and prudent decision on the part of the courts, and a decision which should not be set aside by an Order such as this.</P>
      <P>I think a very useful purpose has been served in seeking to annual this Order.  I am expressing my opinion merely as a layman.  Laymen do not have the opportunity to know all the procedure in the courts, to know all the implications of various Acts and regulations, unless they learn by very costly experience.  I have not had an opportunity of learning the law either in the formal way of studying it as a member of the legal profession or of studying it through the courts, and I am speaking purely as a layman.  On the face of it, I think this Order is unjustifiable.</P>

Let them say what is in their minds and let them say whether they approve of this view that, <Col N="2415" /> because a policeman was shot, we cannot attend to the formalities of the carrying out of justice in connection with such a murder.  At any rate, I say that it is a welcome conversion. Let all the opposite side of the House luxuriate now in the mood that is on them.  It has taken a good many years to bring them to that point.</P>
      <P>What is at issue in this matter? Simply this: whether slovenly prosecutions should be allowed to go on or not.  The Government have been armed&mdash;better than any Government outside dictatorships in the world have been armed&mdash;with powers to repress violence, and not merely to repress violence but to do anything which they state is required for the purpose of dealing with this country in a state of emergency such as now exists.  They are given every power.  They are given power to pass Emergency Powers Orders, to lay them on the Table of the Dáil and to give us information about them, and, until we get the House by a majority to refuse them, they can operate on them and everything they do under them, even though they are eventually repealed, is good and binding.</P>
      <P>Not merely that, but under an Emergency, Powers Order they can produce subsidiary instructions, which need never be put on the Table of the House. What we object to is that they have attempted several times to act on Orders which were not even published and, on one occasion, the notable case of McGrath and Harte, they operated so far as to get a sentence of death passed on people, who may have richly deserved it, without the Orders that were necessary to justify that position being produced to the court, and without those Orders being published, the judge who gave the conditional order in that case saying that those Orders had not been published.  We ask that they should be published and we ask that people should get knowledge of them.</P>

    <P>We ask that there should be an opportunity to those who represent them, even if they are criminals, to have the Orders looked through, to find out if they mean what counsel for the <Col N="2416" /> prosecution says they mean, to see whether the court could be coerced into holding that they mean that or something else, to see whether there is any flaw in them, instead of merely having some counsel briefed by the State appearing before the court and saying: &ldquo;I tell you what is in the Order and you must act on that.&rdquo;  All that counsel has to do is to produce the document and hand it in, but it makes for great ease and convenience not to have to hand it in, it makes for greater ease and convenience not to have to make it at all, it makes indeed for considerable administrative ease&mdash;even though a man's life may be at stake&mdash; to make the Order after the event and to justify what has been done.</P>
    <P>We suggest that that is not right, when a man's life is at stake.  What we ask is that these things should be proved in the ordinary way.  There have been notable instances, to which my friend Deputy Costello has referred to-day, in which the courts have used language not measured by any restraint whatever, upon the practice of attempting to get people condemned, sometimes to death and sometimes to sentences of imprisonment, on Orders that were not proved or established, or shown not to have been in existence at the time the sentence was passed.</P>
    <P>Is there anything new in the way of hardship in asking that, before a man's most precious possession, his life, is taken from him, the statements on which the court is asked to condemn him to death be produced to the court? That is what we ask.  I suggest that, apart from that element of natural justice, it keeps the whole Department on its toes and tends, therefore, towards efficiency and prevents inefficiency.  It prevents ignorant and inefficient prosecutions, by having certain particulars required by the courts when prosecutions are brought against people.  The judge who decided the Kennedy case said that the burden of proof which rests upon the prosecution in a criminal case cannot be eased in this or in any other case.  Is that not a good statement of fact?  Would it not appeal to most people, that when a man is going to have either his liberty taken from him or his life taken from him, the <Col N="2417" /> most exhaustive burden of proof should be put upon the prosecutors in a case and should be satisfied to the point that a court will say: &ldquo;You have convinced me that every bit of the onus of proof put upon you has been discharged&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Why is there all this meticulousness about what the Minister would be pleased to term &ldquo;criminals&rdquo;?  First of all, in this country, we still carry on the pretence that people are innocent until the last moment when a sentence of guilty is pronounced against them. Why are we so careful of people who, from the point of view of the man in the street, taking the case made in an effective way through the newspapers, may be considered guilty of some crime?  Why should we all be so subservient to the criminals?  First of all, there is a tradition in this country, a tradition which goes back very far, right to the roots of Christianity. Under it we may see an inefficient Minister slaughter calves, but it is not so easy to see another inefficient Minister kill human beings.  The difference is that the human being is distinct from the calves, because he has a soul, because he is a Christian, because there is something attaching to his dignity as a human person which requires that he should not be treated as one treats an animal.  What is required with regard to these people? All that tradition has given to us and all that we pretended to incorporate in the Constitution in the year 1937, with regard to the trial of human beings. We were not even content to say that we had to have an independent judicial authority to try them.</P>
    <P>We adopted the same scheme as in other countries, where human life is regarded as something essentially sacred, and we would not let even a professional judge deal with those people on his own.  We thought we would not have even the sort of tribunal which sometimes sits on the judicial bench.  We would not operate that in its entirety, so that a man might come to be tried with the result that either his life or his freedom would be in jeopardy.  We said in regard to all that: &ldquo;We even take you away from the scope of the professional judicial <Col N="2418" /> authority and give you into the control of 12 people like ourselves.&rdquo;  We have adopted the system here, or have pretended to adopt it, of having judge and jury to try criminal matters.</P>
    <P>Then we discovered that this Constitution of ours, which pretends to grant all the fundamental rights that any modern Constitution does assure to its people, only granted them in a weakened form.  We found, in connection with the Offences Against the State Act, that it was possible here for a Minister for Justice to sign a foolproof warrant, scheduled in an Act, and send a man to jail, without charge or without any prospect of even a charge being brought against him.</P>
    <P>We removed that man, not merely from the jury but from the judge. Then we found also that, in our Constitutional scheme, we could establish the Special Criminal Courts and when we established them we could send our people before judges, but without juries.  Even though there was an appeal to a judicial tribunal, we effectively did away with the right of a man to be tried by 12 people of the same type as himself.  We eased the Minister's situation in connection with the Offences Against the State Act, by giving him power to send named people to jail, on what I call a fool-proof warrant.  We have arranged all sorts of devices for the Minister, by refusing to put upon him the burden of proof put upon an ordinary person, put upon the State ordinarily in a criminal case. We allowed him to take people away from that survey of the ordinary courts and send them before a special court.</P>
    <P>We gave the Government one monstrous Emergency Powers Order, which enabled them to change the whole law of evidence in regard to people brought before special courts, where a man could listen with his elbows on a counter to a conversation, and take it down without the knowledge of the person who was speaking and could produce it in court without producing the individual who was said to have made a confession.  That could be put in and urged, in order to have a man condemned, either to death&mdash;as was done in certain cases&mdash;or to the deprivation <Col N="2419" /> of his liberty.  We have abrogated the rule of evidence in that matter, the ordinary rule which says that, if a person is alleged to have made a statement, that person should be produced in court.  We have given the Minister power to take down and put forward a record like that and keep the man who was said to have uttered those words out of the witness box, and the State has sent men to their death on conversations alleged to have been taken down in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got away from it, to show how we have short-circuited what we have done.  We allowed the Minister, during the emergency, to deal with what are called emergency cases.  Now, at the end of it, all we ask is to allow the Minister to get the courts to take judicial notice of Orders, even of Orders that are not published Orders and proceeding from the Department.  However, the courts are to take this in their stride, on the statement of some prosecutor, and the court is not to be allowed to analyse the Order.  Counsel is not to be allowed to see what he can do to pick holes in the Order and see where there is any loophole of escape for the alleged criminal.  All this is done, not because there is really any question of people breaking through the law, not because of any defect in the ordinary courts, not because the courts refused to stand up to their duties, not because the courts have been found to be amendable to pressure from the accused, such as used to be put on juries long ago.  None of these things have been happening and the courts have been running quite smoothly.  The only thing that has happened in recent months is that prosecutions have been becoming more <Col N="2420" /> and more inefficient and those briefed by the Minister, through the Attorney General, are notoriously incapable of attending to the ordinary laws in connection with the running of cases.  The Minister now has to fortify them by this, which means that they can now go into a court of law and say &ldquo;Well, if we do not produce an Order, that is no matter; the Order is there and, if we refer to it, well and good.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Remember what may happen. McGrath and Harte are an example&mdash; men condemned to death on Orders that were not published.  Supposing that the Order were published and it was found there was any flaw in it, irreparable harm has been done if a man has been executed.  The judge, in granting the conditional Order, said that he might not have thought of this point ordinarily, but, he said, a certain course was not open to him in view of the immediate imminence of the execution of the death sentence.  Will people reflect on that?  Men had been condemned to death.  They were awaiting execution.  The death sentence was imminent and yet the Orders on which the court had purported to send these men to their death had not been published or produced in court.  Supposing there had been some infinitesimal flaw in these Orders which meant that the court, on seeing them, would not have sent the men to their deaths, and they had been, nevertheless, executed, how would the Minister excuse the judicial or the Ministerial murder which would have been effected under these conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way he proposes to evade that particular matter is this Order.  Every subordinate instrument is now taken in evidence as if it were a statute.  That is, whether it is available to the accused and his representatives or not; that is, whether it had been published or not; that is, simply if it is made up on the morning of the execution in the Minister's office and, on the occasion on which an appeal is taken&mdash;fruitlessly in the circumstances&mdash;the Minister can justify himself <i>post factum</i> and <i>post mortem</i> by the production of an Order.  Weighing the cases one against the other, have we any respect in this country still for human life? Even though it is that meanest of all <Col N="2421" /> creatures, an alleged criminal, as long as that man is at the point of being merely alleged to be a criminal, has he rights in this country?  Has he the right only to have this, that whatever is the evidence against him should be produced against him, that if a prosecutor wants to rely on an Order he should put it in?</P>
    <P>This is not a question of extreme difficulty of proof.  It is a matter of making the public clear as to what is happening.  It is a matter of having publicity.  It is a matter of having the court knowing what it is doing, and having the court knowing what it is doing by reliance on a printed sheet instead of what somebody says of it. In England many years ago a judge declined to allow that a statutory Order became operative from the same date as it would have been operative if it were a statute, and his simple grounds were those, that in connection with a statute there is great publicity. The matter is produced in a piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>Those who are concerned about it can get a certain amount of public opinion forming for or against it.  If it is a piece of ordinary legislation, there are five stages to it in one House, and if it is bi-cameral, there are eight or nine stages.  There is delay and the public can be taught whatever there is to be known about it.  There is the whole force of publicity and of public opinion backing or being against whatever is proposed.</P>
    <P>As against that you have Orders.  An Order may be laid, as it was called, on the Table of the House, or put in the Library.  A subordinate instrument need not be so published.  With regard to a subordinate instrument&mdash;and that is where the great grievance is in connection with this Order&mdash;it need never see the light of day and there is no question of public opinion forming around it.  There is no question of anyone arguing for or against, because the matter has not appeared.  The Minister thinks of something and embodies that in some typescript; that is lying in his office and it is sufficient to enable a prosecutor to say: &ldquo;This is the Order and this is what you, the courts, must take judicial notice of&rdquo;.  Nobody has a <Col N="2422" /> chance of arguing about it, no one knows what is in it, and the counsel appearing for a man may not get a chance of analysing the instrument to see if it correctly carries out the idea behind it.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, we are asking the House not to permit itself to give anything so wholly dictatorial as this Order would demand.  We ask the House to see that if these Orders are to be produced in court, they ought at least to be capable of proof and that means only one thing, that Orders will be of such a shape and form that they can be handed in, and of such a shape and form as that people can analyse them to see if they effectively mean and will carry out what they say.  If you do not do that, you might as well give the man whose interest in keeping down the slaughter of police&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Holidays (Employees) (Amendment) Bill, 1946&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will have seen, the principal object of this Bill is to amend Section 2 of the Holidays (Employees) Act of 1939.  It may be desirable, therefore, at this stage to say briefly, that it was designed to provide two advantages, which were hitherto enjoyed by industrial workers and commercial workers, for a large body of workers who are not covered by the Conditions of Employment Act, or by the Shops Act.  These two advantages were, that it provided payment for seven days' annual leave and provided payment for six public holidays or for <Col N="2425" /> substituted Catholic holidays.  But, while the Act of 1939 made provision for the grant of holidays in the form of annual leave and provided for the payment for public holidays or substituted church holidays for a very large number of workers&mdash;including domestic workers&mdash;it made no provision whatever for payment for annual leave or for public holidays or Church holydays so far as agricultural workers were concerned. They were definitely excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  It was then believed that the main reason for their exclusion was an intention to introduce a special Bill which would extend to agricultural workers at a later date and that an effort would be made to provide for agricultural workers some of the protection at least which had up to then been provided for urban and city workers.  However, although efforts have since been made to direct the Government's attention to the necessity for levelling up to urban standards the wages and conditions of agricultural workers, no tangible evidence is forthcoming of any intention on the part of the Government to do that, and we have seen efforts to induce the Agricultural Wages Board to direct its functions towards the provision of holidays for agricultural workers fail to achieve their objective.</P>
      <P>I think we have now got to say, unless we are satisfied to condemn the agricultural worker to a positively inferior position in relation to the urban worker, that the time has come to extend to the agricultural worker in respect of holidays the same type of privileges as we extend to urban workers and to domestic workers, whether they are urban or rural workers.  The Act of 1939 provides holidays&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;for domestic employees, although it provides no holidays whatever so far as the producing agricultural worker is concerned. This Bill, therefore, seeks to remedy what I can only describe as an unfair discrimination against agricultural workers in respect of the denial to them of paid annual holidays and payment for public holidays or substituted Catholic holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main section of the Bill is Section 4, which seeks to make amendments in Section 2 of the Holidays <Col N="2426" /> (Employees) Act of 1939.  The effect of the proposed amendment is to extend to agricultural workers the same privileges in respect of payment for holidays as was granted to other classes of workers in the 1939 Act, and to industrial and commercial employees in the Conditions of Employment Act and the Shop Acts of earlier years.  It is only in respect of Section 4 of this. Bill that the provisions of the Holidays Act, 1939, are affected.  The remaining sections of this Bill are purely formal in character, and are usually associated with amending Bills.  I think I should say at this stage that, making as close an estimate as I can, I have ascertained that approximately 130,000 agricultural workers are likely to be affected by the Bill, but not all of them would be affected in respect of payment for public holidays or substituted Church holidays, because many agricultural workers already enjoy, in accordance with local custom, payment for Church holidays or payment for bank holidays.  Not all of them enjoy these benefits, but in so far as they do enjoy them, the Bill simply gives legal form to a long-standing custom, and its enactment would mean that those farmers who unreasonably withheld payment to an agricultural worker in respect of Church holidays would be obliged to conform to the better standard set by his more generous neighbour.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill, of course, is that it seeks to give to agricultural workers benefits which have too long been denied to this very neglected class.  While it is true that probably 130,000 workers would be affected by the Bill it is equally true, I think, that a very substantial proportion of these workers will not be able to benefit even by the Amending Bill because of the conditions which apply to the grant of holidays under the Act of 1939, namely, a worker must be in continuous employment for a certain period&mdash;150 hours in a month or 1,800 hours in a year&mdash;but these are blemishes inherent in the parent Bill. It is unfortunate that they should be carried in equal measure into this Bill but if we could establish at this stage the principle of extending to agricultural workers the holiday privileges <Col N="2427" /> which are enjoyed by other workers, whether in urban areas or rural areas, in non-agricultural employment, we would be going a good distance towards meeting a long felt want so far as recognising the merits of agricultural employment in this country. I calculate&mdash;and the calculation is at best a rather rough and unscientific one&mdash;that approximately 80,000 agricultural workers would enjoy paid annual holidays if this Bill were enacted and that the cost of conceding these holidays would be approximately £160,000 per annum.  In some respects, that estimate may be high, because it has to be remembered that not all the workers who will get paid holidays under the Bill will have to be substituted in their employment on the farm.  So far as the employer is concerned, he may find ways and means by which the holidays can be given at times which will not involve expenditure in the employment of a substitute for his regular agricultural worker who is on holidays.  At all events, we can perhaps get even a closer approximation of what the grant of paid annual holidays would mean so far as the agricultural industry is concerned if we look at the problem from the point of view of the agricultural worker's annual income and the percentage increase in paying that income involved by granting him a week's annual holidays with pay.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, an agricultural worker&mdash;as most of them have to-day under the Agricultural Wages Board minimum wages regulation&mdash;has a weekly wage of, let us say, £104 per year, or £2 per week, and if you are going to give to the agricultural worker one week's holidays with pay, then at the most it can be said that you are imposing on agriculture a gross charge of an additional 2 per cent. in respect of expenditure on the workers engaged in the industry.  When you consider the volume, whether it is the gross volume or the net volume of agricultural production in this country, especially from 1938 to date, I think everybody will recognise that an increased expenditure on wages of not more than 2 per cent., or a total expenditure <Col N="2428" /> of not more than £160,000, represents a trifling proportion of the agricultural output in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>Many urban workers, by means of collective bargaining, have secured for themselves very much better conditions than are enjoyed by agricultural workers to-day.  They have been able, through trade union action and the corollary of collective bargaining, to have their working hours reduced from about 48 down to that level and, in most instances, down to 44 per week. They have long established the principle of payment for overtime.  In many instances, they enjoy holidays much longer than we are asking for agricultural workers in this Bill and, generally, they have been able to establish a certain constancy of employment and their recognition as an indispensable factor in industry.  So far as the agricultural worker is concerned, unfortunately he has not yet had the sense to embrace trade union organisation and to display the enthusiasm and the intelligence which have marked the industrial and urban workers' approach to that problem.  Until the agricultural worker has sense enough to realise that he has an enormous potential strength by the organisation of one agricultural worker with another, so long will he be compelled to tolerate the low standard of living he is compelled to tolerate to-day.</P>
    <P>In view of the number of Bills which we have had to provide holidays for the protection of all other classes of workers, I should like to ask what is wrong with the agricultural workers' occupation or with the agricultural worker that, practically alone amongst the workers of this country, the Legislature says: &ldquo;You will not get holidays&rdquo;? Is it because we think agricultural employment is inferior employment? Is it because we think agricultural work is not as good or as important as domestic work?  Is it because there is a definite policy of allowing the standard of living in agriculture to deteriorate progressively that we decline to give to underpaid agricultural workers the same protection in respect of holidays as we give to the urban worker who, by means of <Col N="2429" /> trade union action, has been able to compel attention to his grievances which the unorganised worker has not been able to do so far?  Is it any wonder that agricultural workers leave the rural areas and drift into factories in the cities and towns where they can enjoy the paid holidays denied to them on the land, where they can get a rate of wages which trade unions can negotiate for them under threat of strike action, and where they can get that measure of protection which, as a result of long struggles, has been built up for the urban worker?  If we are to keep the worker on the land and if we are to ensure that he will have a dignity in his vocation on the land, then we have to plan progressively to extend to him conditions which are in no sense less favourable than the conditions which the urban worker enjoys to-day and which he has been able to secure by means of organised action.</P>
    <P>I think the figures which I have given as to the cost to this measure show clearly that it is not imposing on agriculture an impost which agriculture is incapable of bearing.  According to the new volume of National Income and Expenditure 1938-1944, the position in respect to agricultural output is that the net value, at current prices, of agricultural output in 1938 was approximately £41,000,000 and that in 1944 the net value of agricultural output was £90,000,000.  Therefore, with a net agricultural output of £90,000,000, this Bill imposes a charge on the agricultural industry of approximately £160,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication released by the Department of Finance to-day, entitled National Income and Expenditure, 1938-1944, page 37.  While you can see from the figures which I have just quoted that the net value of agricultural output has increased from £41,000,000 to £90,000,000, the wages in the agricultural industry have increased only by 47 per cent.  The net value of agricultural output has increased by approximately 95 per cent. The percentage increase of agricultural wages is only 47 per cent.  The additional charge which the grant of <Col N="2430" /> paid holidays to agricultural workers would impose would be the equivalent of raising their wages by as little as 2 per cent., and, certainly, in no case could it exceed 4 per cent.; that is on the assumption that farmers do not in every case pay workers in respect of Church holidays or public holidays. I think the value and the volume of agricultural output&mdash;because not only has value gone up, but the net volume related to 1938 prices has risen from £41,000,000 in 1938 to £43,000,000 in 1944&mdash;show again that both in volume and in value agriculture has improved and that it certainly is not being asked to carry any heavy impost by extending to agricultural workers, who have made that increased volume possible, the moderate annual leave allowance provided for in this amending Bill.</P>
      <P>But, even if one had not got these incontrovertible official figures about the ability of agriculture to pay the small increase in expenditure which will be involved by the passage of the Bill, we have a number of quotations from members of the Government, all indicating how well-off they think agriculture is and how capable they think agriculture is of paying.  Speaking in the Dáil last year, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, in volume 95, column 2217:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One section of the community is undoubtedly better off as a result of the war&mdash;the farmers.  The real income of the farmers ... has increased since 1939.  It has increased by approximately 50 per cent.... the only section of the community which is better off in a real sense&mdash;in the sense that they can buy more than they could buy previously&mdash;are the agriculturists.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in volume 94, column 1471, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...while the cost of living has gone up 70 or 71 per cent., agricultural prices have gone up by something like 97 per cent.  That is a clear indication that, taking it all in all, the farmers have been able not only to compensate themselves for the increased cost of living, but to improve their position relatively.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he was Minister for Finance, as he was last year, Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly, <Col N="2431" /> now the President, stated in volume 96, column 1326:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farmers were never better off in their history than they are to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some time earlier, speaking on the Vote on Account in volume 92, column 2526, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The agricultural index figure has practically doubled since 1939.  The cost of some things has more than doubled.  In 1939, over the 12 months, milk was 5.3d. sold to creameries; at present it is 1/-.  Farmers' butter in 1939 was 1/0½ per lb., now it is 2/4 retail....  The average per barrel for wheat was 29/7d; it is now 48/6, plus a credit voucher of 2/6 for fertilisers. Oats was 12/8 and is now 35/-; sugar beet was 46/6 and is now 80/-.  The agricultural price index of 100 in 1939 was practically 200 in December last.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are tributes by members of the Government, all responsible persons, indicating that they regard agriculture as being in a prosperous position.  Each has testified to the fact that, in their opinion, agriculture is better off than ever it was.  One of the speakers, then Minister for Finance, and responsible for checking national income and expenditure and seeing to its allocation and distribution generally, went so far as to say that the farmers were never better off in their history than they are to-day.  If that is the position, it is not unreasonable to ask the agricultural industry to extend to agricultural workers&mdash;it is a mere modicum of gratitude for what we owe the agricultural workers for their services during the past six years&mdash;the same facilities in respect of the grant of paid annual holidays as are extended to other classes of workers.</P>
    <P>It is with knowledge based on these quotations from official publications, speeches by Ministers indicating the prosperous condition of agriculture and a sense of justice of the claim that, when we are granting paid holidays to other workers, we ought not to deny them to agricultural workers, that I ask the House to give a Second Reading to this Bill.  It will be a gesture, a long-overdue gesture, to agricultural workers who, so far as <Col N="2432" /> this House is concerned, have not got much from it in the form of protective legislation designed to raise their wages or their conditions of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Jun.) Mr. Larkin (Jun.)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Jun.)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well that Deputies, and particularly Deputies on the Government Benches, should realise the trend of legislation which this Bill is intended to fit into.  If we go back to the period of 1936 when we had presented by this Government the first major piece of legislation dealing with conditions of employment, we will recall that at that time attention was given to the position of agricultural workers, but, for some reason which still seems to require explanation, the actual legislation passed and made law dealt, in effect, with those sections of workers who were not in the most immediate need of this protective legislation, because the earliest Bill which became law, the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, gave to industrial workers certain protection, including the provision of paid annual holidays and payment for public holidays, which in a very large number of cases they already enjoyed.</P>
      <P>Therefore, what this Bill proposes to do is to remedy a defect in our labour legislation since 1936 and to give proper priority in the order of the conditions of their employment to that section of wage earners who, by the nature of their employment, their contribution to the country's economy and in particular the services they have rendered within the past six years, are entitled to that improvement in their labouring conditions before any other section of wage earners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been in a way more fitting if it had been possible for this Bill to come from the Government Benches, in the first instance, because they had set their hand to the task of bringing forward this Labour legislation over a period of years, and it was accepted they were pursuing a particular policy in relation to different aspects of the matter, and that, in the course of time, this section of the agricultural workers would receive the attention to which they are entitled. It is only because it has become clear, <Col N="2433" /> from continuous questioning and pressure on responsible Ministers, that there is apparently a lack of appreciation of the urgency of this aspect of Labour legislation, and not only because of a recognition of the innate claims of these men and women who are covered by the Bill, but also because we feel that this House owes to this section of workers a debt which now must be paid, and this defect in our legislation remedied, that this Party has brought forward this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, particularly fitting that the Bill is brought forward by a Party which, in the main, is regarded as representing industrial workers, and in presenting the Bill to the House, those of us who speak for industrial workers accept that agricultural workers have a prior and a stronger claim for these improved conditions of employment over that of any other section of wage-earners. From that point of view, I feel that we should proceed to examine the claims of the Bill now before us. In the course of legislation dealing with the granting of paid holidays, we started at a particular point in 1936, when we granted paid holidays to industrial workers.  We then found there were certain gaps, and we remedied those in the 1939 Act.  One of the most peculiar anomalies of the 1939 Act is that in it we provide paid holidays to the extent of 14 days in the year to a domestic worker employed in a farmhouse, but we do not provide any holidays to the agricultural worker on the farm itself.  In other words, the man, or possibly the woman, who is working on the farm, with long hours, heavy, laborious work, exposed to all the elements and vagaries of the weather, was not granted this like privilege of an annual rest and cessation from labour by the very Act which gave it to the worker engaged on the same farm and by the same employer, working within the house and sheltered from the elements, and very possibly working a lesser number of hours per week, and certainly not engaged in such strenuous labour. Surely, the logic of the situation recommends a rectification of that position to-day?</P>
    <P>In dealing with the arguments presented by Deputy Norton in support of <Col N="2434" /> the Bill, it appears to me that, from any viewpoint, there could be only one sustainable argument as to why this Bill should not receive general support in this House to-night.  That is the mention he made of the cost of implementation, in so far as the agricultural industry is concerned.  We might regard that from two points of view, firstly from the viewpoint of the national economy, that we have the basic economy of the country to consider and we are dealing with a section of people who are giving particular and valuable service to the national economy in the course of their work in agriculture.  We might relate their scheme for paid holidays to the conditions under which they work.  We might have regard, in the first instance, to the fact that, according to official statistics, the average rate of wages for the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties is a sum of 40s. per week, for which sum they are required to perform up to 54 hours' work in every working week. We have not even gone so far as to prescribe maximum working hours per week, as we do in trade boards dealing with industrial workers.  We merely state that the hours of work in excess of 54 shall be paid for at overtime rates.  So we have the position of 130,000 persons, both male and female, giving service up to 54 hours in the week for a return of 40s.  That in itself should be the strongest recommendation for the Bill.  Here we are dealing with a body of workers whose recognition for the labour they provide for this industry is not in any way on a generous basis.  It may be argued that industry can provide a more generous return.  It may be argued that the hours are essential to the industry. Surely, if that is the position and it can be shown that we can give some slight recognition, privilege or improvement to the workers, and will not place any intolerable burden on the industry itself, in all fairness the claim should be recognised?</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with an industry which has undergone a very rapid expansion in the emergency years.  The actual cost that could be placed on the industry by granting the provision in the Bill to these workers is not in any way a very significant percentage increase <Col N="2435" /> on the total output of that industry. It is necessary to examine the position a little more closely.  Those of us who are familiar with the operation of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, will be quite well aware that, although we speak of 130,000 agricultural workers being covered by the provisions of this Bill and though we might say that, to find the cost of granting holidays to those workers, we must take a multiplication of 130,000, in the first place, by £2 each for the annual holidays and, secondly, by a further sum of £2 to cover public holidays and Church holidays, in actual fact no such multiplication will take place.  First of all, we have to realise that, of these 130,000, quite a large percentage are temporary or casual workers.  From my own experience, I would say that from 30 to 50 per cent. of the total engaged in agriculture is composed of casual workers, engaged on a temporary basis, who cannot qualify for the full seven days' annual holidays, but only for partial holidays in the year, based upon their capacity and their opportunity to work consecutive periods of two months in which they will perform 300 hours in a particular period and, in relation to each particular period of two months, they will be allowed one day.  They will also be allowed public holidays or Church holidays, where they work for five weeks continuously and 150 hours in those weeks.  Even in the mild conditions, amended even by the Act of 1936, many of those temporary or casual workers will find it impossible to qualify for these partial payments in respect of annual leave or public holidays. Even granting that they do qualify in full, the sum to be met is still small in comparison with the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>We are still left with the permanent agricultural workers and I suggest to Deputies, especially those connected with farming operations, that by dealing with this matter on a practical basis, they will discover that the actual additional cost will be little or none. We have in industries in cities certain practices and rules, established through organisation and custom, whereby men going on holidays are replaced by <Col N="2436" /> others employed.  Therefore, because of the annual holiday for a week or a fortnight there is an additional cost to the employer.</P>
    <P>In a great many industries, however, especially in commercial pursuits, and I take it for granted in agriculture, the case will be that where the constant man has qualified for the full seven days, he will be granted that holiday, at the particular period of the year, at the discretion of his employer, which suits the employer.  It will not be granted at the busy period and, therefore, it is almost certain that no worker will be employed to replace that man, that the work will be left over until he comes back, or be performed by the farmer or his family or by other workers on the farm.  That means there will be no additional financial cost form that point of view.  The total cost which may have to be met by implementing the provisions of this Bill will be very small, in comparison with the total value of the output coming from the industry to the labour of those individual farmers and agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I trust that this measure will be dealt with by Deputies, irrespective of their Party affiliations and that there will be Deputies of all Parties who have connection in one way or another with agriculture, ready to show their appreciation of the men and women engaged in this industry.  I am asking that that appreciation should come in the first place from them rather than from the industrial workers.</P>
    <P>Many of the statements we have heard here and on public platforms, paying tribute to the services rendered by the agricultural community during the past six years, should now be given effect to in practice by members of all Parties.  That is what is proposed in this measure.  Many of us, who take a different view of conditions in agriculture from those who speak for the farmers, might have much more extravagant ideas to put forward for agricultural workers, but we are dealing here with a practical proposition, granting to some 130,000 men and women recognition which is extended to practically every other worker in the State, from the highly industrialised worker to the worker in the factory, the <Col N="2437" /> domestic worker and those engaged in transport.  We recognise that, by our existing legislation, we provide a paid holiday for the clerical employee, engaged for 36 hours per week under ideal conditions and very often for very remunerative rates of pay, and still deny it to the agricultural worker, working 54 hours a week in strenuous forms of labour, exposed to the elements, for a return of a wage of £2 per week.  Surely, in justice and equity, we cannot continue that position any further?</P>
    <P>I will close by asking Deputies to pass this Bill for the sake of the agricultural workers.  I hope that the representatives of the farming community will give vent to a spirit of generosity and appreciation of the part played by those who have been associated with them during the past six years in carrying through the effort on behalf of the country, by supporting this measure, regardless of which bench they may sit on in this House. I hope they will show that they intend not only to give recognition to these workers but, more important still, that they will take upon themselves part of the responsibility of making conditions in agriculture such as will not only make it possible to attract and retain the members of the farming community and their families, but also attract to agriculture something equally essential, men and women prepared to engage in agriculture for a weekly wage.</P>
    <P>If agriculture is to be the basic form of industry in this country, then it must have adequate assistance in the way of labour.  In the House the other day we listened to Deputies referring to the shortage of labour in certain of our rural areas.  We heard complaints that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not sufficiently alive to what was going on and was not enforcing certain powers given to him by the House in order to ensure that there would be a sufficient supply of labour in the rural areas.  From the rural areas, we were told, young men and women were departing not only to our towns and cities, but out of the country.  Surely, if we are to have any hope of maintaining in the rural areas that blood and sinew and mental ability <Col N="2438" /> which are the foundation of our economic progress, sooner or later we must make a start in making agriculture attractive to the young men and women engaged in it.</P>
    <P>I suggest to farmer Deputies, and particularly to Deputies on the Government Benches, that they should make a favourable decision on this issue.  I would point out to them that to take a wrong decision at this time would be bad, not only from the point of view of the immediate situation facing the country but, more important still, it would be bad from the point of view of giving to our people any impression that we are not going to make improvements in this basic industry.  I urge that we should now make an effort to rectify the defects that have existed in our labour legislation since 1936 when, instead of starting with the most important section of our wealth producers, we started at the top with those who had attained a privileged position. We should give now to the agricultural labourers what is long overdue&mdash;what should have been given to them 12 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton, in recommending this Bill to the House, based his main argument on the idea that the same type of privileges, by way of holidays, which are enjoyed by factory workers, should be extended to agricultural workers.  While we all may readily acknowledge the general principles of holidays with pay for agricultural workers, I am sure the Deputy realises, although he did not specifically refer to the matter, that because of the natural rotation of seasons&mdash; not affecting most industries&mdash;there is no common denominator in which the conditions of employment can be measured and compared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From many years' residence amongst the members of the agricultural community, appreciating their work and wondering at times at the successful economy of their homes under the limitations of their incomes and general resources, I, and I am sure every Deputy, must admire their spirit and the way in which they have carried on at a fair standard.  A close scrutiny of the whole matter shows the very complex nature of the problem.  We all <Col N="2439" /> realise that an ordinary factory can be closed down regardless of the season of the year.  It can close down in the summer and give to its workers at the most desirable time the holidays that they deserve and desire.  It is not so with the agricultural workers.  The time most fitting for holidays is the very busiest for the farming community, and it is a very vital time for the country in general.</P>
    <P>The whole question has to be examined in a way that will get us down to some fundamental idea where we can meet the problem and grant the concession without, at the same time, interfering with the general economy. Most of us know that at certain seasons of the year when the agricultural worker who is industrious wants to till his own little plot and grow something for his own family, the farmer in many districts will give him a day or two off, give him his horses and his machinery, and allow him to till that plot to his own advantage.  We all know also that when the products of these plots are ripe for harvesting and when the farmer himself is threshing, he allows his worker to come along in the evening or in the afternoon and bring whatever little wheat or oats or other products he has grown to the farm and thresh it there, with the help of the farmer and his other workers, without additional cost to the worker himself.</P>
    <P>These things happen every year. There is a certain tradition of cooperation between the farmer and his worker, particularly in cases to which reference has been made here&mdash;cases where the workers continue in the service of the same farmers over a long number of years.  When a farmer gets good and suitable workers he is anxious to keep them.  He grants them all these facilities and they are enjoying them without any loss or anything else of that nature.  Simply by custom and agreement many workers get the privileges which are incorporated in this measure. Deputy Norton has said that the passing of this Bill will cover all of what he calls the blemishes of Section 4 of the Act of 1939.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Having heard the reply of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to Question No. 9 on the Order Paper to-day, I had reluctantly to give notice of my intention to raise the matter on the adjournment, because I was not satisfied with the reason given by the Minister for his refusal to appoint the former trustees of the National Health Insurance Society.  The Minister stated that only one of the three former trustees had been reappointed, because the other two declined to give written assurances on conditions held out by the Minister.  We were not told who the third trustee was.  I understand he is a subordinate of the Minister, a civil servant working in the Minister's Department.  It is only reasonable to assume that he would not follow the independent course adopted by his colleagues.</P>
      <P>My main reason in raising this matter on the adjournment is to point out that this is a further definite indication of a tendency on the part of the Minister to adopt a dictatorial attitude in all matters within the responsibility of his Department.  As to the refusal of the two trustees to give the Minister the assurance that he asked for, the communication, which I had the privilege of seeing, was not a proper one.  These men had given no less than nine years' service.  I understand that during that time, year after year, not only were they reappointed, but a very special tribute of appreciation was paid to them for their previous services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During their period of service they succeeded in getting the Department to make available much earlier than the Minister or his Department intended additional benefits for members of the society.  I understand the view of the Minister's Department was that a reserve of £12,000,000 should be available before they would approve of the distribution of additional benefits. Through pressure, and due to the efficiency of the trustees and the committee of management, these benefits were <Col N="2441" /> made available much earlier.  Another remarkable achievement and proof of the efficiency of the management and of the trustees, was that by wise handling of the funds of the society, and by investments, they added to the reserve fund not less than £10,000.  I think the House will agree that these trustees, who gave such a long period of good service to the society, should merit more respect from the Minister, when they were due for reappointment. This is a matter to which the Minister ought to direct his attention, because if it is to occur again to people who give free and valuable time to the welfare of such an important section of the community as members of the National Health Insurance Society, grave harm will be done to such desirable efforts in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on this matter, but, in doing so, I hold no brief for any of the former trustees, nor am I in any way interested as to whether they are appointed or not.  This is from the personal point of view.  I think the dismissal&mdash; it amounts to dismissal&mdash;of two of the former trustees raises a question of considerable importance, not merely as affecting the National Health Insurance Society, but also future public appointees whom the Minister desires to put on this body or any similar body over which he has power of appointment.  If they have not only to give an assurance of the type which the Minister requested from the existing trustees, but have further to assure him, in the event of any intended action on the part of a trustee which might conflict with the Minister's opinion, that they will so inform him, in order that happy and cordial relations may continue, I think that raises an important question.  An individual is appointed to a position covered by statute, which statute contains a specific provision dealing with the functions, powers and duties which are normally laid down and which are further prescribed by regulation.  If over and above the prescribed conditions under which he holds his appointment, he has to give an assurance to the effect that he will not in any way disagree with the Minister, that is a <Col N="2442" /> suggestion almost that all the functions of the trustees are carried out with the Minister's consent.  I think the Minister will have difficulty in getting anyone, other than mere yes-men or people who are subordinate in some other way to the Minister, to accept such nomination.</P>
      <P>As I understand it at the moment, of the three trustees who were trustees for a considerable period, one of them was appointed just a few years before the period of office of the other two terminated, and he was a civil servant. One of the other trustees held office for nine years.  During that time the funds at the disposal of the society increased considerably.  I think the trustees may take justifiable pride in their investments, but, irrespective of whether the funds increased or decreased, the trustees acted in accordance with the regulations laid down, and not alone the Minister's predecessor, but the Minister himself, appointed these trustees.  I think he appointed at least one of them more than once, but, apparently, in 1945, after the announcement of the proposals by the Bishop of Clonfert, the Minister no longer felt himself in a position to reappoint the existing trustees.</P>
      <P>I think that in future, if people with independent minds, who value their own opinion, are to accept nomination for such an office or offices they will do it only on their own conditions or, if they do it on the Minister's conditions, they are fixed automatically with notice that if they disagree in any way, even in thought which they propose to translate into action, then the Minister may immediately dismiss them.  I do not know whether Deputies are aware but, as the Act stands, the Minister may remove any trustee from office at any time, and it seems unnecessary that he should not alone have the power to remove the trustees, but should also get an assurance from the trustees that they will only act in a way which conforms entirely to his opinion.  I think that the autocratic powers and influence of the Minister and his Department have gone sufficiently far and that this further indication of them is not a good sign for the future of this society and is one which I, in company with Deputy Pattison, deplore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what all this pother is about. The two Deputies who have just spoken on this matter seem to assume that the persons who are appointed by the Minister to these positions are appointed on a secure judicial tenure to hold office for life.  Of course, that is not the position at all.  These gentlemen were appointed from year to year. None of them held a continuous appointment for nine years.  It is true that one of them was appointed once and reappointed subsequently eight times.  Each such reappointment was an expression, if you like, of confidence on the part of the Minister in the wisdom and the prudence and the discretion of his appointee.  Deputy Cosgrave has referred to the functions, powers and duties of the trustees, quite forgetting that the Minister has superior powers, and superior functions and superior duties, that it is he who carries full responsibility in a matter of this sort, that it is he who has the power of appointment and the responsibility for making an appointment. If he is to exercise that power wisely and to discharge that responsibility adequately, the first thing that he must do is to satisfy himself that those whom he appoints will, as I say, in the public office to which he appoints them, act with wisdom, prudence and discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a matter arose which indicated a failure on the part of his appointee properly to appreciate the position of the Minister responsible for them&mdash; the Minister to whom they owed their office&mdash;I do not think that he would be justified in reappointing such persons unless he were in a position to satisfy himself in advance that nothing would arise in future to disturb the relations which ought to exist between the Minister on the one hand and those in whom he has reposed his confidence&mdash;because that is what is involved&mdash;on the other.  As Deputy Cosgrave has reminded the House&mdash; the Minister&mdash;I do not want to drag myself into this unnecessarily&mdash;the Minister under the Act in relation to this society and those whom he appoints has very wide powers indeed. He has, as Deputy Cosgrave reminded <Col N="2444" /> the House, the power of removal.  It is a power which was not exercised by me.  It is a power which I think everybody would agree should not be exercised except in extreme circumstances. It is a power which if an occasion arose in which it had to be exercised, everybody would regret the occasion.  But, I had in this instance to take precautions in advance.  For it was quite clear that there was some lack of understanding on the part of those to whom I had previously given my confidence, as to what I regarded as the proper relationship which ought to exist between them as officers of the society on the one hand and myself as Minister responsible for the administration of all the National Health Insurance Acts on the other.  I had to assure myself, therefore, that if they were reappointed no future occasion for misunderstanding would arise.</P>
    <P>And what were these gentlemen asked to subscribe to?  First of all, I think everybody will agree that for the proper working of the National Health Insurance system as we know it, there should be close and cordial and harmonious relations between the Minister on the one hand and the committee of management of the society on the other.  We do not want to conduct a sort of public dispute in relation to every matter about which a difference of opinion may arise.  We do not want to have the committee of management running off the rails and the Minister having to put the society back again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to have close accord between us, because if that accord does not exist, then there can be no progress.  Whatever progress the society makes it can only make with the assent of the Minister, and it can only make after it has persuaded the Minister to submit to the House the legislation which is necessary to allow the society to grow and develop.  Deputy Pattison referred to the additional benefits and suggested that the trustees were primarily responsible for them, that in regard to the additional benefits, the introduction of which required the passage of legislation by this House, the trustees, <Col N="2445" /> in some way or other, had forced the Minister's hand.  Let me say in relation to the Deputy's suggestion that the legislation in question was not introduced until after the actuary's report had shown that it would be financially practicable to introduce this scheme of additional benefits.  Let me also say this, that the plan of a unified society was first conceived, not by either of the trustees, not by any member of the committee of management, but by my predecessor in Local Government.</P>
      <P>One of the definite purposes which the Government had in view in promoting that legislation and bringing the unified society into being was that it might be able to provide additional benefits for its members.  Now the Government, which had preserved, if you like, a considerable number of members of former societies from the fate which would have overtaken them when these societies became insolvent and which had put national health insurance in this country on a proper financial basis, were not going to jeopardise what they had already done by introducing these additional benefits at an unduly early stage, no matter what pressure were brought to bear upon them by any member of the committee, no matter how influential. Furthermore the Act to provide these additional benefits was submitted to the Government by me as Minister for Local Government and Public Health and was introduced here under my auspices and put through this House by the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward.  I can assure Deputy Pattison that that would not have been done unless we ourselves were convinced that the time had come to do it, and no amount of pressure would have made us do it.  Therefore, we can abandon this idea that any member of the committee of management was able to influence the Minister for Local Government one minute before he thought the time was ripe to make the advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying that there must be close and cordial relations existing between the committee on the one hand and the Minister on the other, because unless these relations existed there could be <Col N="2446" /> no progress on the part of the society and no improvement in the condition of its members.  If the committee of management, the trustees, or any other officer of the committee had been at loggerheads with the Minister for Local Government of the day, the additional benefits provided for in the Act of 1942 would not be on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the Minister who is going to appoint persons should, as I have said at the beginning, have absolute confidence in their wisdom, their prudence and their discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>What about public confidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When, as I have said, it becomes clear that the committee and the Minister had become separated and taken divergent paths, not I must say by any action on the part of the Minister, and that it was necessary for me to reestablish the relations which had previously existed, and which should not have been broken, I had to make certain that those whom I proposed to appoint would accept what I regarded as the fundamental condition of their appointment, that is to say, that they would strive to ensure that a close and cordial liaison was maintained between the committee of management and the Minister.  What objection could there possibly be to asking a person whom one is going to appoint to assent to the proposition, that if you place him there as your appointee he will at least try to ensure that the fundamental condition which is essential if the affairs of the society are to be properly conducted will be honoured and accepted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing was that, should anything arise which might disturb these harmonious relations, the person in whom the Minister had reposed his confidence should inform the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary who appointed him so that we might have an opportunity of discussing this matter, in an endeavour to preserve those close and harmonious relations which I regard as essential for the well-being of the society and of the members of the society.  I cannot see why any person can regard it as unreasonable, <Col N="2447" /> when there was clear indication that these principles were not properly appreciated, that I should make certain before I appoint him that they had been brought to his notice, so that I would not have to proceed with the unpleasant duty, if a similar incident occurred, of having to remove him from office.  I think indeed that in this matter I acted with some forbearance.  I have no apology to make for the fact that I endeavoured, as I have said, to restore a proper relationship between the Minister on the one hand and the society on the other.</P>
    <P>Let me say this.  The Minister is independent in his judgment too, and has his independence to preserve.  I <Col N="2448" /> think it would be a rather absurd position in which to place the Minister, who is responsible to the House and responsible to the people, that his independent judgment should have to defer to the judgment of his appointees. Surely that would be to turn the whole position topsy-turvy.  Do you not think that if appointees find they are in conflict with their Minister the first thing for them to do is to resolve the ambiguous and invidious position in which they have placed the Minister by offering their resignations, not by waiting to have them asked for?</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Thursday, 14th March.</P>
