      <P>Such a statement was issued by the Government Information Bureau on the 11th November. The terms of the statement are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the first of the corvettes which the Department of Defence has purchased from the British Admiralty is now ready at Devenport for handing over.  The officer who will command the vessel has left Haulbowline with a crew to take over the ship.</P>
      <P>The ship will be commissioned this week by order of the Minister for Defence as a public armed ship of Ireland in the name of &lsquo;L.E. Macha'.  The prefix letters `L. E.&rsquo;, which stand for Long Eireannach, have been officially adopted for use in the naval service.  Macha was an Ulster Queen to whom is attributed the founding of Eamhain Macha, or Emania, now known as Navan Fort near Armagh.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to appoint in the near future an experienced naval officer as director of the naval service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> A small number of N.C.O. technicians are being seconded from the British service to initiate training on equipment not hitherto available to members of the Irish Naval Service. The ship's complement is five officers and 45 ratings.</P>
    <P>The armament includes 4", 2-pounder and Oerliken guns.  The vessels are also fitted for mine-sweeping and depth-charge throwing as well as with the latest Asdic, Radar and radio equipment.</P>
    <P>The naval service remains part of the Defence Forces.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will give the names of the countries whose citizens are required to obtain the special visa of the Irish Government before entering this country; if he will state, in respect of each country, the place at which such visa is to be obtained; and whether it is his intention to endeavour to make a mutual arrangement, with any of these countries, under which the visa requirements may be discontinued.</P>

      <P>Nationals of all countries, except those covered by the Aliens (Exemption) Order, 1935, are required to obtain an Irish visa before entering this country.  The exempted countries are Australia, Canada, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, India, Newfoundland, New Zealand and South Africa.  Irish visas may be obtained at the nearest Irish Legation or Consulate or, in the case of countries in which we are not represented, from the Department of External Affairs.  The question of arranging visa abolition agreements with certain countries is at present under consideration, but I am not yet in a position to make a statement on the subject.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said it may be obtained at the nearest Consulate <Col N="1089" /> or legation.  I did not want to give a long list of the various countries.  Those that are exempted form a relatively small number and I gave the answer by way of indicating the exempted countries.  I indicated what the exemptions are.  The main point is that the visa may be obtained at the nearest Irish legation or Consulate.  In the case of other countries it may be obtained here in Dublin from headquarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is satisfied that the employers' representatives appointed by him to the Labour Court are fully representative of the interests of agricultural employers, who are the largest body of employers in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never intended that the members of the Labour Court should be representative of any particular section of employers or employees and no provision is made in the Industrial Relations Act for such representation. In accordance with Section 10, sub-section (4) of this Act, I designated the Federated Union of Employers to nominate each employer's member of the Labour Court because I considered this trade union of employers to be most representative of the interests of employers generally for the purposes of the Act.  I would remind the Deputy that the functions of the Labour Court in relation to agricultural workers are restricted to those mentioned in Part VI of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Labour Court as at present constituted consists of two representatives of labour, two representatives of city business men and one labour chairman; and does he think that it is a court to which farmers can be properly summoned or a court which would be competent to deal with questions relating to farm workers' wages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The court is constituted in accordance with the terms of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it never was intended that agricultural labour disputes would be brought before this court, which was intended only for the purpose of conciliation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> It is being operated to summon agricultural employers before it and, as I read the Act, I can see nothing to prevent the court from making awards in connection with agricultural wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that, when I introduced the Industrial Relations Bill, it did not provide for the inclusion of agricultural workers within its scope.  It was the Dáil&mdash;and I understood that all sections of the Dáil were agreed on it&mdash; which included agriculture in the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil agreed to the extension to agricultural workers, for the purpose of utilising the machinery of conciliation which the court provided. The Dáil did not intend that farmers should be summoned before this court or that it should have power to make awards against agricultural employers.  That was never intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Dáil intended is clearly expressed in the terms of the Act as passed by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to consider the desirability of amending the Act, in view of the extensive powers which this court is taking and which were not intended at the time the Bill was passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy say how conciliation can be effected if the parties are not summoned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will realise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is becoming a debate.  If the Deputy has a supplementary question he may put it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that this court could serve a useful purpose if both parties to an agricultural dispute appealed to it to use its offices for conciliation purposes? I think that was all the Dáil intended the court should do, but apparently its powers are being extended further than was intended.  In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's <Col N="1092" /> reply, I will raise this matter on the adjournment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether his attention has been drawn to the announcement recently made by Mr. Clayton, Assistant Secretary of State, United States of America, giving public notice of the intention of the United States Government to conduct trade agreement negotiations, probably to begin in April, 1947, in Geneva, with all the Big Five Powers plus all the British Empire countries joined together by preferential agreements; if he will state whether he has received a communication from the United States Government in relation to these proposals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report of the announcement made by the United States Assistant Secretary of State.  This announcement relates to a meeting convened by the United States Government to be held next spring and to which 18 States of the greatest trading importance have been invited to send representatives.  This country is not included amongst the countries so invited.</P>
      <P>This meeting is preliminary to a full international conference to be called later for the consideration of the American proposals for the expansion of world trade and employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure contemplated includes, first, the holding of a <Col N="1093" /> preliminary conference between the States of greatest industrial importance and the preparation there of draft proposals to be submitted later to a full international conference.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that, in a communication to the National Union of Manufacturers in Great Britain, the president of the Board of Trade has stated that Imperial Preference will be contracted only as part of a general settlement advantageous to Great Britain; that there was no question of unilateral surrender of preferences, and that, on the contrary, there must be adequate compensation for all parties affected; and if he will state whether any consultation has taken place with the Government of Great Britain on the effect, on this country, of any contraction of Imperial Preference, and on the manner in which compensation in respect of such contraction could be arranged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a newspaper report containing a reference to the communication issued by the president of the Board of Trade.  There has been no consultation of the kind mentioned in the final part of the Deputy's question and no such consultation is likely for some time.  As the Deputy is aware, this country was represented at trade talks in London last month in which Commonwealth countries participated, when there was a general exchange of views on the American proposals for expansion of world trade and employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger that the building programme may be held up <Col N="1094" /> through shortage of skilled tradesmen is, I believe, appreciated by the people in whose hands the remedy for the situation lies, namely the Federation of Builders and the various building trade unions.  These bodies are aware that the existing haphazard methods of recruiting and training apprentices are unlikely to provide the building industry with the skilled personnel required for the completion of the large building programme which has to be undertaken.</P>
      <P>Committees composed of representatives of employers and workers are at present engaged in the preparation of new apprenticeship schemes for the principal skilled trades of the industry.

The alternative is to give them a ticket for the workhouse.  They cannot raise crops without plenty of farmyard manure.  These are people who till from 60 to 70 per cent. of their land.  If they are to raise even a fair crop, they must have plenty of farmyard manure.  To get that, stall-feeding and pig-feeding are required and these are the two things which the Minister killed by the economic war.</P>

      <P>During the emergency, it was found necessary to organise a marine service within the Defence Forces.  As a result of the experience gained during the emergency, it is proposed to retain this service, which has been renamed the &ldquo;naval service&rdquo;, as a permanent component of the Defence Forces and to organise, train and equip it, so far as the resources of the State allow, to carry out usefully its contemplated peace-time and war-time functions.</P>
      <P>Three corvettes have been purchased from the British Government and a further three will be purchased later. The corvette is regarded as being the most suitable type of general service vessel for this country's needs.  The most useful of the existing vessels of the service will continue to be maintained in operation.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the service has been altered to provide complements for the new vessels and also to provide for the increased administrative staffs, etc., which are necessary as a result of the proposed permanent retention of the naval service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision has been made for the appointment of a director of the service, with the marine rank of captain, which is the equivalent of the military rank of colonel.  The officer to fill this appointment has been specially recruited, owing to the necessity of obtaining the services of an <Col N="1102" /> officer possessing experience of modern methods, equipment and tactics and with the ability and training necessary for the efficient organisation of the naval service.  The officer in question is being granted a short-service commission for a period of five years.  It will, probably, be necessary to secure the services of two additional officers on a similar basis to deal in a specialised manner with questions of training, administration, supply and maintenance.</P>
    <P>A number of serving officers have been appointed to short-service commissions for a period of five years in the naval service.  These officers, previously, held temporary commissions either in the forces or in the reserve of officers.  It is proposed to recruit this year by open competitive examination at least 12 cadets who will be trained as naval officers.  It is hoped to recruit a further 12 next year. Recruitment will also be necessary of a number of other ranks, particularly warrant officers and chief petty officers.</P>
    <P>The 2nd line units of the marine service, popularly known as the &ldquo;maritime inscription&rdquo;, will be organised as a component of the naval reserve and the necessary regulations will be promulgated shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The emergency powers Orders relative to the felling of roadside trees have been continued in force by the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, and it is not at present proposed to revoke them.  As I explained on a previous occasion, the extensive felling of roadside trees during the emergency, prior to the making of the Orders, created a <Col N="1107" /> serious military problem, so much so that an inter-departmental committee has been set up on the directions of the Government to consider the question of the continuance in permanent legislation of restrictions on the felling of roadside trees and to prepare a scheme for the encouragement of the planting of such trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the difficult situation which has arisen owing to the fact that the turf crop has failed to a great extent, and that there is danger of a serious shortage of fuel, would the Minister not consider making some temporary amendment of the Order so as to allow timber to be cut in certain cases where there is grave need for fuel, pending a final decision of the question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Military Service Pensions in Galway.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state the number of persons, in County Galway, who applied for military service pensions in respect of service in 1916; and how many such persons were granted pensions prior to 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to state the number of persons in <Col N="1108" /> County Galway who applied for military service pensions in respect of service in 1916, and it would not be practicable to obtain the information. The Referee completed 222 favourable reports, qualifying for pension, in respect of applicants under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, whose military service consisted of or included service in County Galway in Easter Week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that William Corcoran (reference number 9368) applied for a military service certificate in respect of service in 1916 only in County Galway, and was refused such certificate; also that, following an appeal to the High Court, his case was reviewed and a certificate granted; further that, in giving judgment, the High Court judges expressed disagreement with the Referee's interpretation of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;, and that, as a result of this judgment, a number of applicants, having similar service in County Galway have been awarded certificates; and whether, in view of this decision, he is prepared to review the cases of all applicants in the County Galway who have been refused pensions owing to a misinterpretation by the Referee of the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are as stated in the first part of the Deputy's question. In regard to the second part of the question, one of the three High Court judges in giving judgment expressed himself as not being in agreement with the Referee's interpretation of the expression &ldquo;active service&rdquo; but added that it was immaterial to the determination of the matter before the court.  In the course of his judgement, the judge stated that the Referee cannot be compelled by mandamus to decide in any particular way the question of what amounts to active service, since the Act does not define active service. The discretion as to interpreting the expression is vested in the Referee, and the judge stated that he appeared to be exercising his discretion judicially.  In eight other cases the Referee's original findings, that the <Col N="1109" /> applicants were not persons to whom the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, applies, were quashed by the High Court.  These cases were then referred to the Referee for further reports, in consequence of which the Referee has furnished new reports qualifying for pension.</P>
      <P>In regard to the concluding portion of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the terms of Section 5 of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1945.  Having regard to the terms of that section, I am no longer in a position to request the Referee to review any reports made by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that only one of the three High Court judges disagreed with the decision of the Referee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, all three judges, Mr. Justice Maguire, Mr. Justice Davitt and Mr. Justice Haugh, in the High Court reversed the decision. How, then, can the Minister say that only one of the three disagreed? I have a report, a copy of which I have sent to the Minister, which states that the three judges completely disagreed with the Referee's decision.  This really is the matter I want to put to the Minister.  According to the Referee's report, some 600 to 700 people in County Galway took part in the 1916 Rising.  It now appears that 222 of these were granted service certificates entitling them to a pension. Eight of those who were turned down went to the High Court and succeeded. There are still about 400 who have as good a case as the eight who were lucky enough to go before the High Court.  Is the Minister now going to give an opportunity to these 400 people to qualify or to make application for a pension?  Why not do it?  I have here a letter from one of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is from a 1916 man who is now going around asking someone to give him the price of tobacco.  Will the Minister, in view of <Col N="1110" /> the fact that the High Court quashed the Referee's decision in eight cases, give an opportunity to the other 300 or 400 people to put their case forward?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me to make a statement.  If he does not wish to hear it I will sit down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are quite welcome to make it.  That is why I put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, the Referee having reheard the cases and probably having additional evidence submitted to him, reversed the decision.  He was quite right in reversing the decision if in his opinion there was additional evidence on which he was satisfied that these men had 1916 service.  Every one of the individuals in whom the Deputy is interested had an opportunity of appearing before the Referee and of convincing the Referee, if he had the evidence to convince him, that he was also a person to whom the Act applied.  They failed to convince the Referee and failed to secure service. I should mention that, in spite of what the learned judge may have said with regard to the case, three judges acting <Col N="1111" /> as Referees have given the same interpretation to &ldquo;active service&rdquo; as the original judge.  So far as I can find out, there has been no differentiation in the manner of deciding what is and what is not &ldquo;active service&rdquo; since the 1934 Act first operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my supplementary question and that is why I have to repeat it. These people went to the High Court and three High Court judges stated that they were entitled to a certificate. The cases came back to the Referee and these eight people got pensions. What about the 300 or 400 people who have the very same case as these eight people?  Why not give them an opportunity, instead of having them at the county home and&mdash;some of them&mdash; cadging the price of tobacco?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out to the Minister that under this Bill workmen's compensation was not being taken over.  The Minister pointed out in his opening statement that notwithstanding <Col N="1128" /> the appointment of two new Ministers and the co-ordination of the various services, he could see no means of economics being effected.  Does that mean that the people in need of assistance or benefits will have the same trouble and the same difficulties to contend with and that the means test is to be continued?  If so, the appointment of a Minister in charge of the Department instead of a Parliamentary Secretary will not mean anything for those people for whom all Parties in the House are interested in securing social services and benefits such as have been granted in many other countries. While I welcome the Bill as the first step towards having a Minister to deal with these problems, I would have preferred that some statement would have been made in connection with the work that the Minister will have to perform in regard to social services.  The Government should have put forward some plan for the new Minister to carry out and not wait for the Minister to be appointed in order to hear his views. The plan put forward by the Most Reverend Dr. Dignan could easily be put into operation and economies could be effected by doing away with duplication.  I regret that such a statement was not made by the Minister when introducing the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the national health insurance service will be taken over.  He omitted, however, to say whether the present miserable benefits are to be increased.  These are points that would give some encouragement to the people who are waiting for some of the things to be outlined under the social service scheme.  It would give them some hope for the future if, when the Minister is appointed, he will have full power and authority from the Government so that there will be no unnecessary delay in putting into operation the services which the people need. We should like an assurance that the first step of the Minister will be the establishment of these social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that some move has been made by the Department to bring relief to tubercular patients, and I welcome that.  Every Deputy who has experience of public boards recognises the serious position in connection with the increase of tuberculosis.  Arrangements <Col N="1129" /> have been made for the maintenance of the family of a breadwinner who is undergoing treatment.  That is an improvement.  We want to try to get the disease in the initial stage. That is where we will require the co-operation and assistance of the local dispensary doctor. He knows the family circle. He knows the history of the people in his area and if he is given some emolument in consideration of the special work he has to do so as to increase the miserable salary he receives at the present time, he will be able to detect a case in the early stages and have the patient removed for sanatorium treatment.</P>

      <P>Some improvements have been carried out, but I suggest that under the new scheme some arrangement should be made that either the Minister for Health or the Minister for Social Welfare should seek the co-operation of the dispensary officers.  I do not wish to prolong the debate, but I do want to point out that the Minister vaguely hinted that at some unspecified time a social code would be put into operation.  I would like the Minister, when replying, to give some indication as to when that code will be put into operation.  We want an assurance that this new step towards the establishment of social services will be on a more humane plan than what we have had.  I welcome the Bill for the reasons I have stated.  It will be necessary, as a first step, to have the Ministers appointed and then to have the plans put into operation. I appeal to the Minister to remember the points I have made and to indicate, when replying, when he hopes the social service plans for the State will be put into operation.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill presents the Dáil, as the direct representatives of the people, taxpayers and others, with a very serious situation.  Conscientiously, each of us is bound to examine this measure very thoroughly and to satisfy himself very fully that the creation of new Ministries is necessary in the best interests of the people, that their creation for bad times as well as good, will not place an undue burden on the backs of the people and that in fact the only feasible manner in which a thoroughly unsatisfactory state of affairs can be rectified is the creation of a multiplicity of new Ministries.  There is a danger, particularly in the Parliament of this country, that we plan our expenditure according to the tide of prosperity that is temporarily running into the country and not according to the normal capacity of the people to pay.  At the moment and for some years back we have had a flood of wealth pouring into the country, wealth that came from an <Col N="1131" /> evil fountain-head.  The measure of that wealth was the degree of misery elsewhere and our capacity to produce. The value of our produce was enhanced because of the appalling plight of people elsewhere.  It is well for every one of us to remember that the kind of wealth that flows out of a war is a very temporary kind of wealth and that following every war there is a slump. Our plan for expenditure should be based on our capacity to pay and maintain in the years of slump rather than the ease with which we can face the expenditure in the years of opulence.</P>
      <P>Here we have a proposal, 25 years after the State was established, when our Civil Service should be far more efficient than it was 25 years ago, when the capacity of each individual and of every section and sub-section to handle more and more work should have grown and developed with experience, when we are catering for a country that has not extended in territory and that has actually reduced in population, to establish three new expensive Ministries, in perpetuity, because the Minister knows and every Deputy knows that it is the simplest thing in the world to establish new Ministries but that once established they are there as firmly planted in the soil as the Rock of Cashel.  The Minister says, and says truly, that there has been a certain demand from different quarters for the establishment of new Ministries, for a Ministry of Health, for a Ministry of Social Welfare.  There are demands for a great number of things and those demands have not been conceded with the same haste and generosity as this particular demand has been conceded. I do not believe that that demand was very general or very prevalent.  I do not believe that that demand came to any extent from the masses of the people.  But the demand was made. It was made sometimes by members of the medical profession, at other times by people who were rather disgusted and disappointed at the measure of assistance that we gave through the channel of social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical profession, or members of the medical profession, occasionally <Col N="1132" /> asked for a Ministry of Health and the volume of that demand was the measure of the dissatisfaction they were expressing with the present Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The only way out they could see from the strangle-hold of a Department that was crushing the initiative, the life, the enthusiasm and ambition out of the medical services of this country was the creation of a special Ministry of Health.  Every doctor felt that with the acromegalous development of the Department of Local Government and Public Health professional opinion was becoming telescoped and submerged; that the lay mind was so rapidly developing that the professional mind was being subordinated and the work of the medical profession was being completely crushed in the way of initiative. The only way they could see out of that hopelessly impossible state of affairs was to suggest the creation of a Ministry of Health in the hope that, inside that new Ministry of Health, the medical minds would be treated as the minds of experts, and that the guidance of those medical people would be accepted, always, of course, subject to the financial requirements and the financial capacity of the State.  But they felt that, in a Ministry of Health, the medical mind and the medical advice on medical matters would not be subordinated because any particular rank inside the Department was designated to the medical adviser if there was any other way out than the creation of a new Ministry that would meet the demand in so far as it came from the medical spokesmen.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking on a subject that I have not a deep interest in.  I am not speaking on a matter that I have not had long experience of.  I have been for more than 30 years practising the profession of medicine in different capacities: as a general practitioner, as a dispensary doctor, as a departmental medical director and as a county medical officer of health for a considerable number of years.  I practised that profession under two régimes.  I practised it under the British Local Government Board, as it was known, and I practised it for the last 25 years under the Department of Local <Col N="1133" /> Government and Public Health.  My activities to get rid of British control, British domination and interference with the affairs of this country were as great as my capacity to serve.  I have no brief for that particular form of rule, but as a medical man, and speaking with that length of experience I do say that the medical profession was free to practise its profession far more freely, and that the requirements of that profession were far more speedily met when the work of the medical profession of Ireland was carried on under that Local Government Board.  There was speed and there was ample consideration for its requirements. You were dealing with a medical man who understood medical problems and was in a position to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  When a medical inspector under the Local Government Board in the past visited any of us in our districts and we required something that medical man would argue it out with us there and then.  If he was medically satisfied that the proposal was a sound one he would say: &ldquo;You can take that as done; I will put that through&rdquo;. The reason was that there was a medical commissioner in that Department who was as high as the highest layman, and he could go directly to the Minister in charge to give expression to the medical requirements of the situation.  There were no buffers, laymen, between that medical commissioner and the Minister, who was in a position to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the earliest economies in this State and, as it transpired, one of the most unwise economies, was the abolition of the post of medical commissioner in the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  You then found a situation where you had the Minister, the Secretary, the departmental chiefs and the medical inspectors underneath, so that the views of those medical inspectors, no matter how many changes of title took place, were sifted, modified and moulded before they reached the Minister. There were hundreds at first, and thousands in the end, of water-tight, air-tight and sound-proof sub-departments which grew up within the <Col N="1134" /> Department of Local Government and Public Health, every one of them being a delaying factor.  If I am to talk candidly on this matter I must say that, as numbers increased&mdash;and numbers did increase in that Department and increase far beyond the capacity of the country to bear&mdash;inside that Department you had increased interference with every professional officer, private practitioner, voluntary hospital and public medical officer in the course of his duties, and the more interference you had the less professional work was done.  The more time that was tied up in explanatory correspondence the less time you had to practise your profession.  I am stressing that particular point because I firmly believe that, instead of the creation of new Ministries, expensive, extravagant and unwanted Ministries, a little reorganisation, a little simplification inside the Department would remove the impossibly chaotic condition that is there at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister based his case, to a great extent, on the complexity of the departmental situation that has grown up inside the walls of the Custom House.  He told us that to disentangle the various services that are there would in itself be a formidable task, and would take a considerable length of time.  The Minister was rather modest in his description of the complex structure that has grown up there. He was rather optimistic in thinking that it could be disentangled even in the time that he gave to it.  Bedlam itself would appear to be a society based on absolute efficiency and harmony in contrast to what has grown up inside the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  You have antediluvian dividing walls there that cannot be either scaled or pierced; you have services operating under that Department that are crippled and semi-paralysed by trying to graft the legislation of 1936 on legislation that was enacted in 1856.</P>
    <P>You have departments that were operating the enactment of 1856 still sitting rigidly over those old antiques in a pathetic endeavour to adjust them <Col N="1135" /> to modern legislation, modern requirements and modern conditions.  The result is that any individual working under that machine has got to try to divide himself, his time, his labours, his costs, his duties into so many fractions in order to comply with the various antiquated Departmental sections and sub-sections.  Supposing some Minister with initiative, with consideration for the taxpayers, and with an eye to economy, were to say: &ldquo;This whole code of legislation has become too complicated; this whole code has got into a terrible tangle&rdquo;&mdash; as the Minister himself has said&mdash;&ldquo;let us try if we can blast down all these old impenetrable walls that have been erected around public health over the whole of the last century and see if, thereby, we cannot achieve a greater measure of efficiency, better results and more harmony inside the Department.&rdquo; The first and obvious step to take would be to break down the barrier&mdash;the old hoary sub-division&mdash; between poor law and public health. That old poor law code has been in existence since about 1864.  When this century was reached the whole world suddenly became alive to the importance of preventive medicine as well as curative medicine.  When conditions in this country opened the way to us to keep abreast of modern progress in the field of medicine we started our public health services, but we kept the old dividing line between poor law, medical services and public health medical services.  We kept the new public health services in such a position that it was impossible, without considerable delay, very extreme difficulty and an immeasurable tact to carry out our duties.</P>
    <P>Let me give the Minister a simple illustration.  Very often it is the man immersed in a great department who knows least about that department, its working and its inner ramifications.  I remember once meeting a friend of mine.  He was a technical man, and he happened to be in England at the outbreak of war.  He found himself with an appointment in the navy.  A couple of years later he came home and I happened to meet him.  I said <Col N="1136" /> to him: &ldquo;I suppose you know all about the sea now.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I know less about the sea than when I left here, because I have spent all my service life in a submarine immersed in the depths of the ocean.&rdquo;  I relate that story to a Minister immersed in a Department.  The fact of being inside that Department may mean that the Minister knows least about it. In every case one sees the structure of a building by standing away from that building rather than peeping at it from the inside.</P>
    <P>Now, in the first place you had this dividing line between public health and poor law.  You appointed your public health service in every county.  That service was responsible for certain things&mdash;tuberculosis, infectious diseases, the supervision of midwifery, and so on.  But no one engaged in that service must cross the dividing line into the field of poor law.  You are responsible for tuberculosis cases; but if your tuberculosis cases go into the county institutions they immediately become poor law cases and you have no right to follow them through the doors of the institutions.  You are responsible for infectious diseases.  They are treated in the county fever hospitals, but the county fever hospitals are poor law institutions and you must shed your responsibility at the doors.  You are responsible for midwifery and maternity work but you have no contact with the medical officer because he is a poor law medical officer.  If a man starting on his day's work visits in turn a tuberculosis case, an infectious disease case, a school, and supervises a midwife his expenditure for that day has got to be regulated under four different headings of expenditure.  The cost of his travel has to be apportioned as between the length of time taken or the mileage covered in each particular case. A whole field of accountancy has grown up around that complicated system, making work down below, making worry down below and making work and worry at the top.  That was further extended when tuberculosis grants came into force and when food and clothing were to be given to the tubercular, when one child in a house might be getting treatment under a specific <Col N="1137" /> medical service scheme and another under a tuberculosis scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a multiplicity of channels of accountancy.  There is a multiplicity of sections and sub-sections under which you are queried with regard to every activity.  That results in such a complicated system inside the Custom House that no one person could control it.  My suggestion is that all this work could be simplified from within if, instead of making a multiplicity of grants to the various local bodies&mdash;one grant under the heading of school medical service, another under the heading of tuberculosis treatment, another national health block insurance, another for child welfare and maternity schemes, and another for free meals&mdash; all that were averaged out and one comprehensive grant made to every administrative area, with one system of accountancy for its expenditure.  In that way the whole matter could be simplified and the complication that present existing would be removed and the necessity for the establishment of three new Ministries might never arise.</P>
    <P>I hold that in the best interests of the taxpayers of this country we must, first of all, find out if the system cannot be remedied by a simplification of the machine and an internal reorganisation of the already existing system.  The Minister in his speech and in his White Paper points out developments that have taken place in the last 25 years&mdash; immense developments and remarkable progress both in the field of social services, curative medicine and preventative medicine.  If we had a sensible administration on top that immense and spectacular development would have resulted in less work at the top and not more.  In the old days under the Local Government Board the medical service was just the hospital service and the dispensary service.  If there was an outbreak of infectious disease it was the duty of the dispensary doctor to treat the sick.  He had very little time and very little opportunity to grope for and search out the origin and the cause of the outbreak.  The Local Government Department had to <Col N="1138" /> send down in those days investigators and inspectors who would follow up the outbreak of that infection.  They might cover up to six, seven or eight dispensary districts further away before they found the source and eliminated the cause.</P>
    <P>With the development of public health services all that work was done centrally in each county or by co-operation between the county public health service in one county and in the next and you had the pooled information and the combined efforts of the new public health services in every county, working either individually or co-operatively.  You had a great amount of work that previously had to be undertaken and investigated from on top, done locally.  But with the greed of the bureaucratic mentality for expansion and further expansion, the more work that was being done below, the more sub-departments or sub-sections and sections grew up within the Custom House.  First of all, you had the public health nucleus in each county.  No sooner did they begin to inspect schools than a school section developed in the Department.  No sooner did they begin to aim at central notification of births or infectious diseases than that was duplicated on top.  No sooner did they embark on schemes, within their administrative areas, of maternity and child welfare, than a duplicate section started on top.  In other words, the more work that was done below and the greater responsibility that was undertaken by the services functioning down below, the more the overhead staffs doubled, quadrupled, increased and expanded.</P>
    <P>Having got the staffs, what is the result?  Every one of these sections must keep files alive.  They must keep writing, putting their queries.  They must keep interfering, so that the body that started out to do professional work found itself so glutted with these queries and interrogations that in the end they found themselves doing less and less professional work. You had highly-paid professional men becoming third-rate clerks and the greater portion of their time doing a job that could be and should be done by clerks.  With the growth on top <Col N="1139" /> with the numbers not mattering, with costs not mattering, any one of these men who should be field-men down below would not succeed in getting sanction for as much as one auxiliary typist to deal with the work below. Those men who were field-men for five days a week are now field-men for only two days and office-men for the rest of the week.</P>
    <P>The development of work and responsibility down below should not lead to a consequential expansion up above.  It should, in fact, if there was a sensible administration, lead to a reduction in the numbers on top. Neither the present Minister nor any other Minister can build up little sections, little cells, without these little sections and little cells becoming active.  They do not like idleness, and the degree of activity is measured by the extent of interference with people who are competent to do their job and who are doing their work competently. Walk into any of the old established, internationally famous hospitals in the City of Dublin, hospitals that made a name for Irish medicine hundreds of years ago, hospitals that attracted ambitious medical men from the Far East and the Far West to come here to learn their profession.  What is the complaint inside the doors of every one of those hospitals?  It is that they are driven distracted by the intensity and continuity of interference in petty matters by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  But you cannot have officers in idleness. The multiplicity of officers appointed inside that Department in recent years will find something to do, and it does not matter if that something is putting queries to a busy surgeon who would be better employed in the operating theatre than sitting at a desk to answer queries with regard to the number of overalls laundered per annum from his operating theatre, or some such question.  I have seen it go to the extent of querying the time taken by a specialist to do a certain number of cases and asking what steps would be taken to ensure that that specialist took a minimum length of time for his cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> When I referred to this practice as outdoing bedlam, I was speaking with knowledge and with absolute sincerity. There is no man inside the Department but knows the degree of chaos that has been created by over-staffing and by the jealousy to hold on to whatever happens to be there at the moment. A little fluidity of the staffs and less established sections would lead to a much smoother movement of the whole machine of medicine.  A little fluidity and the breaking down of these old barriers would lead to harmony between the centre and the periphery. But in order to accomplish that, it is not necessary to create a number of new Ministries.  The medical mind that has been telescoped in the Department should be put back&mdash;rank or pay are not my consideration&mdash;where it was under a Government that had centuries of experience behind it.</P>
    <P>The new departure was a legitimate experiment, but it was only an experiment. It has failed dismally.  The Minister's advisers will tell him the extent to which it has failed.  He need not think, when I make these statements, that I do so because I speak from the Opposition front bench.  If the Minister asks his own medical people whether medical work, curative and preventive, would not be simpler and more efficient if medical views could be expressed directly to the Minister and not through departmental chiefs, no matter how elevated or glorified, it would be much better.</P>
    <P>If the Minister in charge of a Department dealing with health finds there are blocks or obstacles or buffers between him and those responsible for advising on health matters, then every one of those buffers should go.  That is what is required and not the creation of a new Ministry of Health. Such a thing would mean the creation of another horde of officials, another army that will keep themselves busy by correspondence to and from health workers throughout the State, correspondence to and from the hospitals and the treatment centres&mdash;and the more correspondence and interference the less efficient the work done.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech, which I read with interest, <Col N="1141" /> remarked on the necessity to keep the best brains in the profession of medicine at home.  What do we see across the water?  We see, right enough, a tug-of-war between the Government and the medical profession, but what do we see there, where there is a Ministry of Health?  The responbility for the direction and control of the health services in the various regions is carried out by the medical profession, not interfered with by laymen on top, or even by qualified men on top.  There are committees of regional doctors, appointed by the doctors themselves and managing the work in each region.  In this country, we have all the advantages which flow from the Appointments Commission machine, we have the measure of each man taken for the standard of appointment he is seeking, we have people going into appointments highly qualified and well experienced in their work, we have a special system of selection and we have achieved excellent results.  Yet we have more supervision, more interference, and more direction, the more we have competent people in the job.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister that a doctor has his professional conscience and I want to warn him of a tendency that has grown up of late, by circular letter and by direction, presuming to tell a doctor how he will treat a case and what particular material he will use on a case.  That is violating the very first principles of conscience in association with medicine.  No doctor would hold his diplomas for 24 hours, if he took direction or orders from anybody else as to how he treated a case under his care.  Yet that has happened. Even in the Army Medical Services, it has never been attempted.  The staff in the Department of Health is certainly perfectly free to advise&mdash;and is bound to advise&mdash;as to the modern treatment or the latest materials which have been found satisfactory elsewhere. But to presume to direct is a thing that no professional man of any standing would tolerate from a Department of Health or from anybody else. There is no member of the medical profession in this or any other country who would ever presume to direct another <Col N="1142" /> qualified doctor as to what particular drug he should use on any particular case.  He might advise and say what good results he had with it.  But with the growth and the development in the Department and the necessity for doing something each hour of each day, it has developed even to that extent.</P>
    <P>We see in this Bill, as far as the ordinary person can see, an attempt to go in two opposite directions.  Only a few years ago, we introduced the managerial system, to centralise within each administrative area the various fields of work, medical, engineering, housing, etc., under one individual. That was a step in the right direction. If the scheme fails, it is the failure of individuals.  At least in theory, the scheme is a step in the right direction. However, having centralised down below, we fractionise up on top.  At the moment, we have bodies working in the various administrative areas under one Department with one set of bosses.  Now we propose to have them working under three Departments. Which Department will be the master of the manager?  In regard to the public health services, he will function under at least two Departments. Presumably, in so far as the manager is a pivotal officer in the housing schemes, he will function under three. To which of the three Departments will he be most responsible?  Obviously, he must be responsible to each of the three, according to the field of his activities.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, the proposals in this Bill bear no evidence of any serious consideration having been given to them.  The line of least resistance has been taken.  Perhaps the most spectacular road to take is to create a multiplicity of Departments and to say to anybody interested in any particular subject: &ldquo;Oh, that will be fixed all right by the new Department of Social Welfare&rdquo;.  That Department has grown out of a perfectly sensible and perfectly obvious suggestion made by various Parties in this House, namely, that it was ridiculous to have a multiplicity of inspectors calling at the same little cottage on different days in the same <Col N="1143" /> week, each one of them giving out a little ticket or dole, ranging from 1/- to 2/6.  We suggested that those services should be co-ordinated and amalgamated into a central stream, so that there would be one inspector, one investigator, one payee and one payment. However, if the only way amalgamation or co-operation could be carried out is by the establishment of a new Department, surely that is bankruptcy of all intelligence and bankruptcy of any capacity to understand that a Government has no money to spend unless it gets it out of the pockets of the people?</P>
    <P>Taxation is so stupendous that we can only keep up the rate of spending by looting the pockets of the very poor.  When we propose three new Departments, we must measure the capacity of the poorest to pay their whack towards the expense.  New Ministries mean new Ministers; new Ministers mean new staffs; new staffs mean new sections; new sections mean new sub-sections.  Let anybody look at the Book of Estimates.  The population is smaller, the area just as big, but look at the growth of departmental services, in cost and in numbers, over the last 15 years.  Is there any one of them that has not doubled itself in numbers, trebled itself in cost, carrying the same functions for a smaller number of people?  Now we are going to multiply, not only the number of officials but the number of Ministries. I took just a glance at the numbers and cost of the Minister's Department, starting with the period 1931-32.  The cost of salaries and wages of officials, within the four walls and having nothing to do with grants in any direction outside the four walls, in 1932 was £99,000 odd.</P>
    <P>The number of persons doing the work for a larger population than we have at the moment was 236.  Five years later, for the same area, for the same or a lesser number of people, the cost had jumped to £127,000 and the numbers had jumped to 359&mdash;an increase of one-third in numbers in a few years.  That was in 1936.  This year, the cost has bounded up to £188,000 and the number of officials to 467.  The <Col N="1144" /> number of officials over the period mentioned has just doubled.  The cost has also doubled.  And the Minister complains of the complexities of that Department and tells us that it will take hard work and many months to untravel and disentangle the various pieces there.  You have 200 extra tanglers taken on over that period of years.  The solution is the beauty of the whole thing.  Not only increase the numbers further, so as to create a number of more tangles, but multiply the number of Ministries and increase the cost to the taxpayers.  It is no wonder that the Taoiseach said elsewhere that the proposals contained in this Bill will lead neither to greater economy nor to greater efficiency.  How could they lead to greater economy?  How could they lead to greater efficiency?  There is more co-operation between one Government Department in this country and another Government Department in Paris than there is between any two Government Departments in this country.  There is more co-operation between any two Government Departments in this country than there is between any two sections within a Department.  There is where you get the delay, the irritations, the cost and the inefficiency.</P>
    <P>The proposal outlined by the Minister is to increase all those factors.  The only solution is three new Ministries. Let us be logical about these things. If we are to be logical and if four, five or six subjects have to be dealt with in any Department, why not follow the line laid down here?  Why not have four, five or six Ministeries?  Why not have a Ministry for every little phase of activity which has to be supervised? Here we have a Ministry that, 16 years ago, was headed by a Minister.  There was no Parliamentary Secretary.  The Department grew because there was more work being done down below. It developed into a Minister with two Parliamentary Secretaries.  Now, it is to sub-divide itself like an amoeba and multiply itself into three brand new Ministries.  If we wanted a startling and striking example of the fact that what is wanted is to blast down all the internal walls, to have a general flow of knowledge, general freedom of conference and general understanding in <Col N="1145" /> one room of what is being done in the next&mdash;if we wanted a clear, striking, memorable example of the failure in that very elementary procedure with regard to efficiency, harmony and success, we had it in the Public Health Bill. We had the Public Health Bill coming out of that Department and put before the Dáil as a matter of vital, national urgency&mdash;so vital that we were threatened with sitting throughout Holy Week to deal with it.  Then, outside circumstances got the officer in charge of the Bill into trouble and he resigned.  Another officer from the same Department reads the Bill and drops it completely.  There is no urgency about it, good, bad or indifferent.  The fact is that there were things in that Bill that whoever is Minister for Health would never stand over.  It had come before us as the considered policy of the Government when it was not even the considered policy of the Minister for Local Government.  There is an example of water-tight, air-tight, sound-proof Departments that have grown up inside that particular institution. I say: break down all those walls, let there be fluidity when people are dealing with common or allied subjects, and it will be found that one Minister with a sensible outlook, one Minister with a desire to cut his cloth according to the measure of the taxpayer, to place the burden according to the capacity of the shoulders to carry it&mdash;that that Minister, approaching the matter with a desire to reorganise and simplify, would get the services carried out with much greater efficiency and much greater expedition without this new and extravagant proposal for the multiplication of Ministries.</P>
    <P>So far as has been indicated to us, the case for Ministry No. 3 is the control and supervision of social services. Is it our ambition to make this little island a nation of soupers or a nation of paupers?  Is it the vision of the Government that there is to be so alarming an increase in pauperisation that that particular service can be rendered only by the creation of a special new Ministry such as has never been <Col N="1146" /> required during the past 25 years? If there must be a Ministry of Health, could there not be persons inside that Department who would account for the necessary payments for those social services?  If those social services are allied to anything, they are allied to health.  You have blind pensions&mdash;a health disability.  Old age pensions&mdash;a natural disability, if you like.  Tuberculosis grants under various headings &mdash;a health disability.  National health insurance benefits&mdash;again a health disability. You are going to put the making of those payments into a Ministry over there.  You are going to have health dealt with by a Ministry over here.  Is it not obvious that those services, so closely allied to health, should, at least, be carried within the health service?</P>
    <P>Taxation, expenditure, pomp, ceremony and extravagance have reached such a point here that the worms are beginning to turn and that it is not just a case of &ldquo;Ask and you shall receive&rdquo;.  If the proposals contained in this Bill are necessary, a case will have to be made for them.  Remember, the Taoiseach previously pointed out that no such proposal would be made to the Dáil, or come before the Dáil, until Deputies had been made familiar with the case as it exists and the requirements of the situation, through a White Paper&mdash;a White Paper that would have to state coldly, calmly and precisely why the present structure had failed and why three new structures were necessary.  What has become of that White Paper?  Is it that a case cannot be put down in black and white?  Is it that there is no case to make?  Is it that the only case that can be made is to point the finger of failure at the political head of the Department of Local Government and Public Health for the last 15 years?  If things got into a mess, either through lack of intelligent supervision or because there was not proper co-ordination, it is not fair to turn to the taxpayers and say: &ldquo;There is one mess already; give us three more messes and pay for them.&rdquo; Is not the obvious remedy to get someone to look into the internals of the machine that has gone <Col N="1147" /> wrong and see if it cannot be lubricated and repaired rather than to say: &ldquo;Leave us the machine that has gone wrong and, if you can pay for it, give us two other machines that will do the work that should be done by one?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was rather disappointed with the last speaker, because I expected that he was going to give us an intelligent lead on this question.  Instead of that, he really reminded me of the old story of the man with the ass.  I am very sorry indeed that Deputy O'Higgins has not seen fit to welcome what I look upon as a real advance towards promoting social welfare and the public health of the country.  The last speaker has stated that one man should be capable of doing all this work.  During the last few years public opinion, the public conscience, the public Press and everybody concerned with public health have been making demands for a better public health service and appealing for a more enlightened social service.  About a fortnight ago I was speaking to a manufacturer in this city who told me that up to six years ago he had a very serious problem in his factory owing to the fact that a number of workers were continually going sick. He decided in conjunction with some other directors to pay a special medical officer to attend to the health of the staff.  The proprietors of this factory had a very praiseworthy outlook so far as the health and welfare of their staff were concerned.  They decided to expend a few thousand pounds a year in the manner I have indicated, and inside four or five years the health of the staff had so much improved that the expenditure on sick benefits was reduced by about 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>We have heard the last speaker state that the expenses of the Local Government Department have increased by 100 per cent. since 1932.  It is a pity that in a matter of this kind politics have always to be introduced in this House.  We must remember that since 1932 under the Fianna Fáil administration a number of additional benefits have been extended to various people who were in need of them.</P>

      <P>I am sorry. Even at that, we have frequently heard reports in this House that people cannot get a reply from the Local Government Department and we have heard various recommendations about speeding up the machine.  I do not want to introduce personalities but let us take, as an instance, the position occupied by the last speaker himself.  What would he think if he were asked to carry out the duties of the chief engineer and those of the chief veterinary surgeon as well as the duties of the chief medical officer in his county?  If you want service, you will have to pay a person who will be solely responsible for each of these jobs.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as a step in the right direction, because there is great need in this country for more up-to-date services in so far as public health and social welfare are concerned.  We are not pauperising the country by establishing a Ministry for social welfare. I have been associated with social welfare movements of different types for the last 20 years and I am delighted that a Ministry for social welfare is to be established at last. There is a wide field of activity for such a Minister in this or any other country.  In this country, we meet many people who do not care how their less fortunate neighbours are circumstanced and if we have not a Minister, whose responsibility it will be definitely to take a deep interest in such people and to co-ordinate the various social services, we cannot expect our poor people to be contented or that their grievances will be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to speak at length but I should like to refer briefly to the public health side of this question also. We have a long way to travel yet before we can say that our public health services are perfect.  Here you will have a Minister who will be directly responsible for the public health of the country.  His job will be solely concerned with public health alone and he will have no functions as Minister for Local Government.  The work of the <Col N="1149" /> Local Government Department has grown beyond all leaps and bounds owing to the various services that have been initiated for the people.  If the health of the people is going to be improved, if the social welfare of the people is going to be improved and if local government administration is going to be improved, surely the people will get service for whatever extra expenditure may be necessary as a result of the creation of these Ministries? I believe all the complaints that have been made about extra cost are so much eye-wash.  If money is expended for services that are efficiently run, I do not think that money is spent badly.</P>
    <P>The duties attached to the Department of Local Government and Public Health have increased so enormously that it is impossible for any one man to supervise them.  The Minister is only a human being and cannot do the impossible.  Indeed the work of the other two Departments will be so heavy that it will take two intelligent Ministers all their time to do their jobs well.  I have much pleasure in welcoming this measure as a most desirable step in relation to the welfare and health of the people, and I hope the action of the Department of Local Government will be an example to other countries throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister's case for this Bill and having had the advantage of reading it since Friday last, it is obvious to me that the prime reason for the setting up of two new Ministries is that the Department of Local Government has become so unwieldy, so involved, and, as the Minister said with regard to some of the services, so complex that it is no longer possible for the Minister to manage the services rendered, and, at the same time, give effective execution to the various directions and functions under the control of different sections of the Department.  As I understand it, that case does not justify for a moment the step proposed, namely, the establishment of two new Ministries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For quite a considerable time, a Parliamentary <Col N="1150" /> Secretary in the Department of Local Government has been solely responsible for the public health side of the Department, and, approximately two years ago, an additional Parliamentary Secretary was appointed to deal with the other functions of the Department.  He was assigned certain specific functions and particularly old age pensions, roads and other matters directly under the control of the Minister. Assuming that the Parliamentary Secretary dealing with public health had under his control all the necessary material and that certain staff were assigned solely for public health matters and that, at the same time, he had the assistance of the other sections of the Department which was necessary for the carrying out of these functions, I think we are entitled, before assenting to the establishment of two new Ministries, to hear from the Government some case for the establishment of a separate Ministry.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, that Parliamentary Secretary had functions which confined his attention to public health matters and other subsidiary services. A number of the activities which are now to be placed in the care of the Ministry for Social Welfare bear very materially on public health matters and on the health of the people, but I think they do so merely because other factors, such as lack of sufficient wages, lack of sufficient nutritious food, force people, and a large number of people, to exist, either through not having sufficient wages or because their wages are inadequate to meet the rising cost of living, on the benefits they get from the various social services.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in this House and elsewhere to imagine that every step which means an increase in the benefits administered either directly by or under the State, whether on a contributory basis or by means of direct grant, is a step forward so far as the community is concerned and a step forward from the national point of view. That is an entirely erroneous view, and a policy which is absolutely detrimental when carried, as it is being carried, to a very extreme degree in this country.  So far as I understand <Col N="1151" /> Catholic teaching, the first essential is a wage adequate to provide the various necessaries of life and to meet the other commitments of families not quite in the category of necessaries, but nevertheless required.</P>
    <P>Because of a number of factors, economic and otherwise, the State for a number of years&mdash;and when I speak of the State, I do not mean particularly this State, but States in general&mdash;has striven to meet the deficiency in wages by various artificial means.  The most notable of these in our memory was the introduction of old age pensions in 1909, and, since then, various other benefits, including national health insurance in 1911, have contributed to the measure of assistance granted by the State to supplement the deficiency in wages.  But surely it is an entirely erroneous view and bad national policy to consider that every time we add something by way of State subvention, whether assistance in kind or in cash, it is a step forward, when, at the same time, wages are insufficient in many cases to meet the requirements of the average family and when all these benefits, so frequently lauded in such eloquent language by members of the Government and Fianna Fáil spokesmen, are increased at a time when an ever-increasing number of people are emigrating.  If people emigrate from the system in operation here, it is because that system has a bad effect economically on their position, in that it does not enable a father of a family or a person who contributes towards the maintenance of his family, whether parents or sisters, to provide essentials.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that everyone accepts any measure which will increase the benefits available to the community, any policy which will make better or more adequate provision for the public health; but I cannot subscribe to the view which is current and which apparently finds favour in many quarters that an increase in benefits, in the number of services dispensed by a Ministry and in the assistance, either in cash or kind, which Ministries give to the people, is a step forward.  The view that the ever-increasing interference and control by the Department of Local Government is for the benefit <Col N="1152" /> of public health is one which has no basis in fact or in the statistics on public health which are available.</P>
    <P>It is significant that, while all these increases in interference and control from the Department of Local Government have grown, at the same time, certain very disturbing features in the health of the people have also grown; that we have had with this increase in the various sections of the Department of Local Government an increase in tuberculosis and in gastroenteritis. If the particular section of the Department which was under the control of a Parliamentary Secretary has not been able to deal with these increases, then I think we ought to get an explanation before we are asked to establish a new and separate Ministry.  We ought to hear first why the Public Health Bill, which was rushed through some of its stages with considerable energy and not a little insolence, has now been withdrawn. My mind goes back to an occasion when the Deputy who has just spoken used almost the same phraseology in welcoming the Public Health Bill as he used now in welcoming the two new Ministries.  He did not, however, advert to the fact that the Public Health Bill has been dropped. We are entitled to an explanation as to why the Public Health Bill has been dropped.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister and those responsible for the various sections of whatever measure replaces the Public Health Bill that before that measure is introduced, a measure dealing with professional and highly technical matters, the outlines of it at least should be placed before the particular professional bodies concerned.  It was notable that the Public Health Bill never had the benefit of the considered views of the medical profession.  The Medical Association and the various interested parties affected by the Bill were either ignored or were not consulted before it was introduced.  I suggest that in a Bill of this kind where highly technical matters are involved, people with skilled training and practice in the various branches of their profession should be consulted on the broad outlines and that it is a matter for the Department and Parliament <Col N="1153" /> afterwards to deal with the more detailed provisions of a measure of that kind.  In a matter of that kind, where highly technical questions are involved, professional opinion should be got. That professional opinion can be got independently of politics.  The people who are in a position to give that opinion must, in view of their numbers, represent all sections of political views. These people are in a position, from the theoretical and practical point of view, to give the benefit of their experience to the Department and the benefit of that experience should be translated into the measure.  At the same time, all interested parties, such as the various nursing associations, should also be consulted.  It would be advisable to get their views and it will then be open to the Department and to the House to reject or accept these views, as they think fit.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the case always made for a Ministry of Social Welfare is that it will not merely co-ordinate the various social services but, in addition, it will reduce overlapping and economise on the administration of the services.  But, apparently, the Ministry of Social Welfare which is to be set up is to be of a different kind.  I refer to the Taoiseach's speech in the Dáil on the 30th January, 1946, as reported in volume 99, column 168, of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The results of the consideration given to them will be found in a White Paper which will shortly be published.  On the whole, the conclusion which the Government has arrived at is that neither scheme is at all satisfactory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was referring to the scheme proposed by the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan for the amalgamation of social services and also to the scheme prepared by the Medical Association.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These will be set out fully in the White Paper, which will also contain certain other proposals intended to form the basis for consideration of the reorganisation and extension of the existing public health and medical services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this is the White Paper, then I submit <Col N="1154" /> that it falls entirely short of what was promised in the Taoiseach's speech last January.  Surely we are entitled to know what are the Government's views on the social services and what are the proposals of the Government for reducing the overlapping which at present exists and which necessitates very considerable expenditure which might be reduced if the services were properly amalgamated.  In the same speech the Taoiseach stated that he did not think the co-ordination of these services would reduce the overlapping or in any way make for a reduction in the expense of administration.</P>
    <P>I think this House, before it consents to the proposal to set up two new Departments, should consider seriously and anxiously the fact that, according to the Taoiseach, this new Ministry when set up will neither effect a reduction in the expenditure nor any improvement in the efficiency of the services.  Surely the whole basis of all social services recently has been to reduce the number of inspectors and the number of forms that recipients have to fill up.  Surely the aim of the Beveridge scheme and other kindred schemes was to reduce the number of forms and the number of inspectors while at the same time paying full benefits to the recipients.  It is an extraordinary thing that a person in receipt of a widows' and orphans' pension and also of the fuel and light allowance cannot have both schemes administered at the same time.  Some widows will be in receipt of a pension and not in receipt of the fuel and light allowance, while others will be in receipt of both.  Surely it would be a simple matter to have one form by which a person might get the full benefit of both these schemes or only the benefit of one.  It is an extraordinary thing that we have this multiplicity of forms and of sections in Departments dealing with the same form of assistance. This House deserves to get from the Government an authoritative and clear statement in a White Paper of the Government's intentions in this matter.  It should not merely be handed over to a Minister who says that his Department is very complex and over-burdened with a multiplicity of functions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> In considering this matter, we cannot but dwell on the enormous increase in taxation which has burdened the community in recent years.  Not alone is it expected that there will not be a reduction but, under the County Management Act as administered by the Department of Local Government, the local rates in every area are going to rise.  The tendency everywhere is for an increase.  In the past it was claimed for that Act that the local authority was paramount so far as financial matters are concerned but there is a proviso in one of the sections of the Local Government Act, of this year, whereby the Minister may, if he is dissatisfied with the rate struck, direct the local authority, after an inquiry, to strike a higher rate or to provide a particular service.  That may not be strictly germane to this debate but it is, at any rate, pertinent when we consider the complexity of the functions of the Department of Local Government and when we consider that these functions are providing services that are certainly no better than the services given in the past and that many of them are far worse.</P>
    <P>It is a matter which demonstrates clearly the tendency which is developing in all Departments, particularly the Department of Local Government, to have an ever-increasing number of civil servants, an ever-increasing effect of bureaucracy together with a lack of proper co-ordination, lack of proper preparation of schemes and considerable delays in everything that local authorities have to do with the Department.  The functions, responsibilities and duties of the Minister and the Department have multiplied out of proportion, and necessitate at this stage of our history the creation of two new Ministries.  In the normal way these functions could be discharged effectively, properly and fully by competent Parliamentary Secretaries with a competent and energetic Ministry. The Department has suffered from some form of internal strife which has rendered all activity in the Department almost nugatory, which has produced extremely bad effects on many sections of the community and which we now <Col N="1156" /> see exemplified in the withdrawal of the Public Health Bill and the introduction of a Bill to establish two new Ministries.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the House is entitled to a fuller, clearer explanation as to the necessity for the separation of the various functions of the Department under two new Ministries.  Many of these functions are correlated and impinge almost daily on one another. These functions in the normal way should come under one Ministry, if necessary under two separate sections or under separate Parliamentary Secretaries but they should be administered under one departmental head. We now find that these functions are not merely to be split into two separate and distinct Departments but that, in addition, local government and, I presume, housing, are to be separated.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced this Bill we should have had some reference to the urgent need for houses.  It is apparent to everyone that the provision of adequate housing accommodation is one of the most vital public health services at the moment.  So far, we have had no reference by the Minister as to what steps his Department or any section thereof are taking to speed up the provision of housing for what are described as working-class families.  We are pressing ahead with an increase in social services and so far we have had not a word in regard to the first essential public health service, after wages, namely, the provision of sufficient housing accommodation, except that the functions which remain within the province of the Minister for Local Government after these two new Departments are set up will include housing.  One grave reason for the functions and sections described in the two new Bills is the fact that we have not had sufficient housing and we are entitled to an explanation on that matter.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister if his Department has at the present time any plans for a change in the administrative areas or functions of the Dublin County Council in so far as various public assistance districts are concerned.  In County Dublin public <Col N="1157" /> administration is rather complicated in view of proximity to the city and in view of the fact that the corporation control has spread into many areas which were formerly entirely within the province of the Dublin County Council. These areas and the recipients of public assistance in them are nominally under the control of the Dublin County Council.  They have received the benefits of any schemes which the Dublin County Council adopt.  They are living in close proximity to urban dwellers who get certain benefits under the corporation schemes.  I would suggest to the Minister that, in separating these functions, he should consider whatever separation of function or responsibility he proposes for the public assistance areas in County Dublin, and any other proposals he has.  While there are numerous other matters which do not fall strictly within the ambit of public health or social welfare, some of the functions impinge closely on general administration and I should be glad to hear if the Department have progressed with the proposed separation of the public assistance areas and I should like to know what proposals the Department have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it appears to me to be a serious effort to separate the multifarious activities of the present Department of Local Government and Public Health into departments of a reasonable size with a reasonable realm of activity, directed and controlled in a manner that will make their administration much more satisfactory and much more efficient than it was possible to have it under the Department of Local Government and Public Health whose activities extended over a field of administration and legislation that we now find it necessary to create three Departments to direct and supervise.  As long ago as 1932 we on these benches urged the Taoiseach to give early consideration to the question of separating the various activities then encompassed within the Department of Local Government and Public Health because we felt then, as we feel now, that it is humanly impossible for <Col N="1158" /> a single Minister, even if he is aided by certain Parliamentary Secretaries, adequately to supervise the multifarious activities of the Department of Local Government and Public Health. It would certainly be quite impossible for him to be in anything like close touch with the various activities of so large and so unwieldy a Department as that Department is to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his introductory statement, took us over the wide field which calls for the attention of those charged with the administration of his Department.  I think that anybody who has got even the most perfunctory acquaintance with the Department of Local Government and Public Health will at once acknowledge how utterly impossible it would be for any Minister efficiently and effectively to supervise and direct a Department with such multitudinous activities.  I think the very fact that all these services have been combined under the one Department is at once an explanation of the fact that the Department of Local Government and Public Health has not displayed any conspicuous ability in the matter of the administration of local government, public health or social services.  I do not say that in any carpingly critical way.  I say the very fact that it has been found necessary to separate one Department and to create three new Departments is the clearest evidence that those who have been responsible for the separation have recognised the impossibility of conforming to a reasonably high standard of efficiency and effectiveness so far as that single large and unwieldy Department is concerned. I think that the separation of the Department of Local Government and Public Health into three new Departments was long overdue, and that even now, because of our reluctance to undertake the task in years gone by, we are left with a legacy of arrears in respect of public health and social services which will tax the energies, the ability and the ingenuity of the two new Ministers to overtake because, in my view, there is an enormous programme of potentially fruitful work awaiting the attention of those charged with the administration, not only of the two new Departments but of the <Col N="1159" /> Department which is to administer the residue of the services at present dealt with by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>One has only to look at our public health legislation to realise how backward it is in relation to the legislation in operation in the Six Counties of Ireland, and how backward especially it is in comparison with the legislation in operation in the neighbouring island.  Probably, the best picture of the backwardness of our public health legislation, and of our apparent inability to grapple speedily and effectively with urgent problems, is to be found in our efforts to try to grapple with the urgent problem of combating the dreaded tuberculosis scourge in this country.  It is true that we have passed a Bill designed to provide more sanatoria, and that, so far as legislation is concerned, we appear to be thinking of dealing with that problem in a more thorough-going way than we did in the past; but, while we have passed the necessary legislation, and while the Department concerned appears to be evolving plans and thinking of doing this and thinking of doing that, the cold fact remains that it is harder for a tubercular patient to get into a sanatorium to-day than it was at any time previously.  I say to the Minister, in the hope that he will pass this on to his colleague, the Minister for Public Health, if he himself is not to be the Minister for Public Health, that some positive steps must be taken to provide, within a reasonable measure of time, the urgent sanatoria accommodation for which tubercular patients in the country are crying out aloud to-day.</P>
    <P>Another indication of our backwardness in respect of public health legislation is to be found in the fact that, while we pass Bills to deal with the evils of tuberculosis and with social, economic and public health consequences of tuberculosis, we still have not faced up at all to the nation's responsibility to those who are suffering from tuberculosis to-day.  Not even the Public Health Bill, which was before the Dáil this year and which is now to be withdrawn and reintroduced, <Col N="1160" /> got down seriously to the problem of sustaining the bread-winner who is unfortunately afflicted with tuberculosis. The Minister in that Bill took, in a half-hearted kind of way, powers to require local authorities to make allowances to tubercular sufferers.</P>
    <P>I am aghast at the prospect of local authorities being asked to make allowances of any kind to sufferers because, when one examines the scales for home assistance or examines any other type of benefit which a local authority provides, the one outstanding feature of all the activities of local authorities in that respect is that beggarliness can scarcely go deeper or reach a lower level than it can in the administration of schemes of home assistance or schemes of pecuniary assistance of any kind which are administered by a local authority.</P>
    <P>If we are ever, in this country, going to face up to the problem of eradicating tuberculosis, then we shall have to recognise at the outset that if the tubercular sufferer is ever going to be encouraged to subject himself to an examination to ascertain whether or not he is infected with tuberculosis he must be assured that, once it is discovered he is suffering from tuberculosis and needs sanatorium treatment, from that day onwards he must be guaranteed his means of livelihood. Otherwise, if he is merely going to be examined and classified as tubercular &mdash;in other words sentenced to economic death by being taken out of his employment with no source of income available for his family&mdash;then we are never going to face up properly to our responsibilities to the tubercular sufferer, and we are never, even in our lifetime, going to see that dreaded scourge eliminated from our midst. Any test which can be applied to our public health legislation in respect of tuberculosis will show that it is hopelessly deficient and utterly inadequate so far as facing up to our responsibilities and grappling with that scourge is concerned.  I agree of course at once with the Department's plans.  Nobody can accuse the Department that it does not reek with good intentions in respect of public health legislation.  Nobody <Col N="1161" /> can say that the Department is not saturated with the most earnest hopes and with the highest ambitions on paper, but, of course, when you get down to ascertain the practical application of public health services to the problems as they actually exist to-day you find that all these services are notable for their deficiencies.</P>
    <P>What I hope will flow from the establishment of this new Public Health Department is that some Minister will be consumed with the white heat of enthusiasm to ride rough shod, if necessary, over every impediment which stands in the way of giving this country a first class code of public health legislation.  It is only with a Minister who will break with the hoary conservatism of the past and will not allow difficulties, precedents or etiquette to entangle him in a web that would prevent him from doing anything that we can ever hope to build up an adequate code of social legislalation in this country.</P>
    <P>When we turn to our social services the position is equally bleak and unencouraging. Here, again, we are lagging seriously behind the Six-County social legislation, and notoriously behind the legislation in operation in the neighbouring island.  The most unfortunate part of the lagging, so far as we are concerned, is that we do not yet appear to be able to appreciate the necessity for getting away from what I might describe as the &ldquo;hunger&rdquo; standards of social legislation which exist in this country to-day.  Just imagine having legislation in operation to-day which permits in this year of 1946 of a widow receiving a non-contributory widow's pension amounting to the truly magnificent sum of 1/- per week.  Yet, a considerable number of widows in this country have non-contributory widows' pensions of 1/- per week.  If a widow has an income of 4/- per week she will get a noncontributory pension of 1/- per week; if she has an income of 5/- per week, she will get no contributory pension whatsoever under our widows' and orphans' pensions legislation.  Can anybody explain to me the kind of mentality which can devise a scale of benefits of that kind?  Can anybody imagine the type of mind which can frame pensions <Col N="1162" /> legislation in such a way that a widow, if she has 5/- a week will get nothing, and if she has 4/- per week will get the munificent sum of 1/-?  I, myself, have never been able to understand that kind of &ldquo;hunger&rdquo; mentality, or the mind that can attune itself down to these 1/- per week standards.</P>
    <P>I hope that under the new social service legislation we will make some effort to get away from that mean and niggardly channel of thought and standard and that we shall try to evolve legislation which will take cognisance of human beings as human beings and pay some respect to human dignity.</P>
    <P>Let us pass on now to our old age pensions legislation.  Can anybody conceive of anything so absurd as that legislation is to-day?  To-day we grant a pension of 1/- per week to an old age pensioner.  In 1916 we granted a pension of 10/- per week to an old age pensioner.  To-day it takes 25/7 to buy what 10/- bought in 1916.  But we still give the old age pensioner the 1916 10/-, even though it is incapable of buying to-day what it bought in 1916 and would require to-day 25/7 to put into the old age pensioner's housekeeping basket what 10/- put into that basket in 1916.</P>
    <P>Let us come now to our national health insurance code.  Under our present code an insured contributor&mdash;the breadwinner and father of a family of perhaps four or five children&mdash;earns in present circumstances £4 or £4 10/- per week.  When that breadwinner is stricken with illness we give him 15/- a week and we say to him, &ldquo;Get well as best you can on 15/- a week.&rdquo;  We give him roughly one-fifth or one-sixth of his ordinary weekly income under our National Health Insurance Acts and we expect that man, debilitated in health, to get well on a fifth or a sixth of his weekly income and we make no special provision whatever to enable him to weather the economic storm.  We place him under an insuperable difficulty when he is compelled to leave off work owing to illness.  So far no serious effort appears to have been made to evolve a code of national health insurance legislation to provide some adequate means of livelihood for those who are stricken by illness and who are compelled to maintain a wife and four <Col N="1163" /> or five children on an income of 15/- a week from the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    <P>Let us travel on from that to the scale of unemployment assistance benefits in operation.  We find here again that the scales are so low in respect of a person in receipt of such benefit that it is not possible for such person to spend more than 2d. on a meal.  That is what the State offers in an attempt to make provision against the evil and the insecurity of unemployment. The fact that we have an inadequate social service is only too true; that social service is rendered more inadequate still because of the fact that the social services of our neighbours are towering over us.  We have a clear indication that we ought to apply ourselves intelligently to the task of producing social services which will give our people something better than the beggarly rates of benefit which are paid to-day under our so-called social services.  Social services is just a euphemism for poor law standards masquerading as social services in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is urgent need for an examination of our whole code of social services if we are to provide adequate services for our people and offer them some inducement to remain at home.  The one impression made on those of our people who have been forced to emigrate and have come back here on holidays subsequently is a widespread admiration for the social services in operation in that country in which they have been compelled to seek a livelihood.  That, together with the prospect of regular employment at better rates of wages than they can possibly hope for here, is acting as an artificial stimulus in urging them to leave their own relatively undeveloped country and seek employment where conditions are more attractive than they are here.</P>
    <P>I know that it is not a popular move on my part to mention the Most Reverend Dr. Dignan in the presence of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Even at the risk of offending the highly delicate susceptibilities of the Minister by mentioning <Col N="1164" /> that distinguished ecclesiastic I feel I must do so on an occasion like this. His Lordship, after much careful thought and research, produced what is generally accepted to be a thought-provoking report in relation to health and social services generally in this country.  That report was contained in a memorandum, a copy of which was sent to the Minister, but not in the form prescribed by the Minister.  At all events the report was received by the Minister and received very considerable publicity throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's annoyance at the form in which the report was conveyed to him and his subsequent rather truculent and hostile attitude to the report and the form of its delivery, I think there was a very general appreciation on the part of the public that Dr. Dignan had rendered a very valuable public service by producing such a report on subjects close to the minds and hearts of large sections of our people.  It was rather unfortunate, both for Dr. Dignan and the report&mdash;and for health and social services generally&mdash;that the Minister should have taken such serious umbrage at the publication of the report and its receipt in a manner to be deplored by the Minister.  Whether the Minister liked the report or not or whether he felt that his own sense of dignity was offended by the publication of the report, the fact remains that the present Minister, or the new Minister, or the Government cannot afford to disregard the very valuable conclusions arrived at by Dr. Dignan as a result of his searching examination into that whole problem.  I think the report by Dr. Dignan was well worthy of examination. It represented a serious, a thoughtful and an intelligent approach to the problem of social services and public health legislation generally in this country.</P>

      <P>I am trying to give, in a sketchy way, the course which the new Minister ought to follow.  Having said that I welcome the establishment of these new Departments and the separation of the multiplied functions of the present Department, I would say to the new Minister for Health, who may read this debate, that I think there is need for a thorough reorganisation of our public health services in the direction that I have indicated. We ought to get away from existing standards and get down to a proper examination of a code of services which will give us a better fabric of social legislation than we have to-day. Having said that, my comments on the Bill come to a close.</P>
      <P>I think our Department of Local Government and Public Health has never been efficiently directed and has never been efficiently supervised, not because of any inefficiency on the part of the personnel, not because of any special inefficiency on the part of any Minister, but simply because it was utterly impossible properly to supervise such a large and unwieldy Department. The separation of that Department into three self-governing Departments of Local Government, Health and Social Welfare provides an opportunity for three Ministers to concentrate on what are urgent tasks in the matter of building up a high standard of public health, a high standard of social services and a high standard of public amenities.  If the Bill will enable Ministers to concentrate more intensively on the work of stimulating these very essential functions, then I think it is a Bill well worthy of support.  I have believed in such a separation for many years and I hope, now that it is to be brought into effect, we will see some serious effort made to get away from the crab-like progress which has been associated with the Department of Local Government in the past and that a vigorous spirit will be injected into the administration and the direction of these new Departments.</P>

      <P>When we consider the undisputed fact that sickness and poverty are, next to sin, the greatest of all human evils, we must acknowledge that a Department of Health and a Department of Social Welfare are <Col N="1167" /> very important Departments in any State.  If we were to consider the establishment of those two Departments without any reference to other existing Departments, the House would be inclined to support this Bill.  But the position which will arise when this Bill is enacted is that, while we shall have two new Departments set up and two new Ministers appointed, we shall still have all the old Ministers with all their old evil ways, and all the old governmental Departments with all their inefficiencies and incompetencies in operation.</P>
      <P>If it was decided to set up a Department of Public Health and a Department of Social Welfare and to abolish the Department of Local Government, there might be a proposal put before the House which would be worthy of support; but, apparently, it is intended that we must not only increase the number of Departments and subDepartments in the State, and that we must increase the number of officials, but that we must also increase the number of Ministers, all of whom have to be remunerated out of the public purse.  I think the present Government is big enough and bad enough to be left alone, and merely enlarging it will not make it any better.  What it really requires is a little pruning.</P>
      <P>I am sure this Bill will go through the House.  It is hardly likely that it will suffer the same fate as the Public Health Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One never knows what may happen.  I should like to ask what will be the procedure with regard to the appointment of the Minister for Public Health.  God knows there is ample work for such a Minister.  There is hardly one parish, one townland, not to speak of our towns or cities, that cannot show clear evidence of neglect in regard to matters relating to public health, the medical care and treatment of children and the care and treatment of people suffering from dangerous infectious diseases.  What we want in charge of such a Department is a real crusader, a man who will go out determined to perform a high and holy mission and, as far as possible, to <Col N="1168" /> eliminate all forms of disease.  When we are appointing a Minister for Public Health, are we to have the candidates narrowed down to the Fianna Fáil Party, to this House, or to the Oireachtas as a whole?</P>
      <P>Can an attempt not be made to go outside and find in the entire State the person most suited to fill this position, a person who, because of his gifts, his zeal and his general worthiness, should be appointed to take up this office?  Since we are making a new departure, we should approach it on the lines of breaking with old customs and traditions and should search throughout the length and breadth of the State for the most suitable person, without having regard to Party affiliations or to whether he is at the moment a member of the Oireachtas or not.  This Department of Health should be a non-Party Ministry, in which Deputies of all Parties would be able to give wholehearted co-operation to the Minister in the great work he will be called upon to do.</P>
      <P>However, I am a realist and while the ideal which I have suggested may appeal to many Deputies, I am not so sure that it will be accepted.  I can see, in the course of the next few weeks, the Taoiseach prowling through the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party, looking for a possible Minister.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, it is rather unfortunate that Walt Disney will be prowling round looking for a typical Irish leprechaun.  If the two distinguished spotters happen to spot the same individual, a very embarrassing situation might be created, as the spotted individual will have to decide whether he is to be a Minister with a substantial salary and pension or whether he should accept a leprechaunship with a crock of gold attached. That is likely to happen, but it should not happen.  There should be a complete break away from the old system. I am not suggesting that the choice of a Minister should be confined to this House or even to the two Houses.  In the sphere of the medical profession and the social services, there are <Col N="1169" /> unselfish men of great zeal, who have devoted their lives to the alleviation of disease and pain, and in the ranks of such people the ideal Minister for Health should be found.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago, when I visited one of the beautiful new cemeteries which have been established throughout rural Ireland during the last six or seven years, it struck me that there is an immense amount of work to be done.  In the particular cemetery which I visited&mdash;I have not a particular taste for visiting new cemeteries, but I had occasion to survey the layout of this one&mdash;although it had been open but a short time there were already two graves in it, one of a young man in his early twenties and the other of a girl in her 'teens, both of whom had been the victims of tuberculosis.  That is typical of what is happening&mdash;the young people in the flower of life's springtime are being struck down by disease.  At the same time, we have a huge Department, a Minister for Local Government with two Parliamentary Secretaries, seeking to cope with that difficulty.  When we divide the Department of Local Government and Public Health into three and have three Ministers, I wonder if we will not still have the same inefficiency and incompetence, if we will not still have young people struck down in the prime of life, whose lives could be saved if there were a really efficient and praiseworthy effort to grapple with and overcome this dread disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied for a moment that the mere setting up of these two new Departments will make for greater efficiency.  The first step towards efficiency is simplification.  Will we have greater simplification of the services under this new departure than we have at present?  Will we not still have a very large measure of confusion and overlapping?  We now have local government authorities whose main functions are performed by a county manager, who is responsible to the Minister, but when this Bill comes into operation, apparently he will be the servant of two distinct and possibly two rival Ministers, pulling him, perhaps, in different directions.  He will have the supervision and management of public <Col N="1170" /> health affairs in his county and in that respect he will be responsible to the Minister for Health; he will have other functions in regard to housing and road construction, where he will be responsible to a Minister for Local Government and probably he will have other functions in regard to which he will be responsible to a Minister for Social Welfare.  Does not all this division of responsibility and supervision not make for confusion and inefficiency?</P>
    <P>I am not so childishly simple or optimistic as to believe, with Deputy Norton, that the mere passing of this Bill will straighten out all the confusion and chaos which exists at present in regard to social services, health and local administration generally.  We spent the greater part of the last session here discussing a Bill which subsequently had to be scrapped.  I believe that a lot of the work which we may be doing in passing this particular Bill may amount merely to beating the air also.  When it has been enacted, we may still find the same slow progress and the same inefficiency. Shall we still find the people who suffer from tuberculosis having to wait in a long queue for admission to the various institutions?  When they secure admission, we shall still, perhaps, see them sent up into the clouds at the mountain top at Crooksling&mdash;a place where it is often-times snowing when the people in the city are sunbathing.  This Bill is a brief one.  It does not call for very long discussion but it does call for very serious consideration by all Parties and particularly by the Government, which is charged with responsibility.  It must be accepted that there will have to be a complete change of heart in regard to the administration of the services which come under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to say within reasonable compass all that one would like to say on these proposals. I thought that the Government would, over the years, have given consideration to the problem of reducing the number of Government Departments rather than to the question of increasing their number.  As I have said on more than one occasion in this House, we are apt to approach problems of this kind by way of imperial standards, with very grandiose ideas <Col N="1171" /> and schemes in our minds and, perhaps, largely influenced by what is happening across the water in Great Britain.  Let us frankly admit that we cannot attempt in this country to set up a system either of public health or social welfare on the lines advocated by Sir William Beveridge or even on the lines of the British Government's White Paper.</P>
      <P>As several Deputies have said, we have to cut our cloth according to the measure of our capacity to pay.  Our capacity to pay for such services as are adumbrated in this measure is very limited as compared with the resources of Great Britain or any other large State.  If we want a suitable comparison, we should look at what is being done in some of the smaller countries of Europe&mdash;say, the Scandinavian countries.  It is idle to stand up here and demand that this small and impoverished country should provide services such as are provided by an imperial power such as Great Britain or the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree at all&mdash;I am advocating my own viewpoint&mdash;with the approach to this problem.  I think that we are putting the cart before the horse.  The two essentials for the relief of the necessitous poor and for the improvement of their health are good food and proper housing.  If our Government were to devote their attention to providing decent housing, decent sanitation and to giving our people the means of earning a decent livelihood, under decent conditions, at the same time considering a policy whereby income earners of all classes would be given the wherewithal to live in those houses under decent conditions, we should be approaching the problem from the right angle.  No palliative of any kind, no cure-all of any kind is a substitute for a proper industrial-agricultural productive policy.  Here we have the Government embarking on what I regard as very grandiose schemes at a time when our population is falling, when almost 25 per cent. of our population is living in the City and County of Dublin, at a time when the rural towns and villages are being deserted by their people in search of employment elsewhere, at a time when very few cities or towns are able to <Col N="1172" /> maintain their existing population.  In these conditions we are going to superimpose upon our people a scheme of public health and social welfare that might be visualised for an industrial State such as Great Britain or the United States of America.  It does not fit into the economic or social conditions of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland will get quite a shock when this Government, which came into office with the promise that it would reduce taxation and the cost of the Civil Service by £2,000,000 per year, instead of that expected reduction asks them to pay for two extra establishments to administer the affairs of Local Government and Public Health.  I am not at all satisfied that, by having two Ministers instead of two Parliamentary Secretaries, we are going to get any improvement either in public health or social welfare.</P>
    <P>When I look at the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is at the moment manned by one Minister and one Parliamentary Secretary, and think of the multitude of functions which that Minister has to perform and to supervise, and when I consider the intricacies of his two Departments &mdash;on the one side, Industry and Commerce and on the other side, Supplies&mdash; and compare them with the activities of the Department of Local Government, I wonder whether it is not a case of competence as against incompetence. I want to be quite frank on this matter.  I do not think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is as well served as the Minister for Local Government has been as regards Ministerial assistance.  But when you look at the two Departments you get two different pictures.  On the one side, you get a certain air of efficiency, dispatch and business.  On the other side, you get complete inertia and muddling.  I often wonder whether some peculiar canker or plant has not got into the Department of Local Government, whether its roots have not got into the labyrinthine passages of that Department and spread from the basement of the Custom House right up to the top and whether there is not a complete strangle-hold of that Department as a result of that canker.  I thought, when the Minister for Local Government was given the assistance <Col N="1173" /> of two Parliamentary Secretaries and when the functions of that Department were segregated as between the Minister and these two Parliamentary Secretaries, we could expect within a reasonable time that the Minister would be able to extricate himself from the hopeless mess and chaos which prevailed for a long period of years in local government.  We find that that is not the position, that the Minister has to come to this House and ask us to agree to set up two new Departments of State&mdash;a Department of Social Welfare and a Department of Public Health, with Local Government taking whatever is left.  I do not think that I can see on the opposite benches individuals who are likely to provide the requisite qualifications and experience for that job.  I think that it is futile for this House to agree, in existing conditions, to give new functions to other individuals on the opposite benches in view of past inefficiency in that particular Department.</P>
    <P>I repeat that it will not make one iota of difference whether we call them Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers.  If we are ever to come down to brass tacks in this country on this whole problem of our economic and social conditions, we shall have to set up some national authority, some national body which will examine all our problems on a broad national basis.  That body will have to examine the problems of agriculture, particularly the problems of the producer in agriculture.  It will have to examine the problems of a market for agriculture, home and foreign.  It will at the same time have to examine the consumer's demand for agricultural products, at home and foreign; it will, as it were, balance and check these conflicting demands within the agricultural industry so that we can eventually arrive at a definite agricultural policy and say: &ldquo;That is that.&rdquo;  In the same way we shall have to take all our industrial problems and examine them on the same principle&mdash; see what our manufacturers want and see what our people want in the way of industrial products from our manufacturers, and balance the demands of the industrialists on the one side and those of the consumer on the other, <Col N="1174" /> the home market and the foreign market, and see what we can evolve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and all the Civil Service paraphernalia attached to two new Ministries.  The Taoiseach himself has admitted that it was with extreme reluctance he agreed to the proposal at all.  He is not satisfied that these proposals will lead to efficiency&mdash;certainly not to increased efficiency&mdash;and certainly not lead to a reduction in taxation. When we from these benches and outside in the country advocated that there should be a co-ordination of services, I certainly advocated that co-ordination on the principle that it should operate and take place within the existing framework of the State establishments.  Certainly I never visualised a position where we were <Col N="1175" /> going to add to the number of Ministries. I had the belief&mdash;and many people agreed with me&mdash;that we have too many Ministries already.  They are too expensive, too costly.  Twenty-five per cent. of our national income goes in taxation.  One pound out of every four pounds of every man's income goes back to the State in the way of taxation.</P>
      <P>I say that the proportion of our income that has to go back to the State in taxation is too high.  For that reason, I am against any increase in Government establishments which will simply add more to our taxation.  The more you add to our taxation, the greater the number of Departments you create in the country, the bigger the establishment you set up for the administration of these Departments, the higher is your cost of living and the less is your £ going to be worth. You come to the position where all this taxation is going to be unloaded back on the unfortunate consumer, the wage-earner and the salary-earning official.  I would say that we are overtaxed already and I hold that we have reached the peak point in our State expenditure.  For that reason, I cannot tolerate any measure which has for its object an increase in Government establishments in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to approach this problem on right lines and on right principles, the proper approach would be to aim to give our people a decent living wage in the country&mdash;to enable our people to live well here, whether they be engaged in agriculture or industry, whether they be employers or employees. The job of this Government is not to start at the wrong end, not to catch the wrong end of the stick, but to make a right beginning.  I hold that the right beginning is for the Government to create for our people the necessary opportunities for employment at home at a decent wage that will enable the head of a family to provide for all the needs of his family in the matter of housing, clothing and food and to have something over and above which he can put by for the rainy day.  In other words, that should be our insurance scheme against all these palliatives <Col N="1176" /> that are set out here for administration by the new Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I should like to see all these things created in the morning by the Government giving our people an opportunity to earn a livelihood on the lines I am suggesting.  I think the modern tendency in practically all States is wrong&mdash; the tendency for the State to encroach upon every aspect of our social and economic being and to reduce the citizen here and elsewhere to a state of mendicancy.  I do not want to see our people pauperised or beggarised under any guise or colour of social welfare. I would prefer to see the people independent in all these things.  I would prefer to see them getting the full employment to which they are entitled on the land and in industry, so that we could scrap all these palliatives and let the individual look after himself and his family and preserve his integrity and independence.  I think we are going too far; the pendulum has swung completely east and I want to put it back a bit.  That is why I have suggested with all due respect to the Chair that we want to examine our problems in a big way, weigh them up and balance the conflicting demands of all the sections of our people so that we can evolve a sound national economic policy.</P>

      <P>The details have all been set out in the White Paper, and surely I am entitled to refer to any matter in this White Paper.  I cannot conceive how this matter can be criticised otherwise.  It is proposed that the Minister will look after old age pensions, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, national health insurance, unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, children's allowances, services for the relief of necessitous persons and so on.  I hold that all these schemes are mere palliatives, merely tinkering with the whole problem.</P>

      <P>The essential difference between the Deputy and me on this point is that there is no money being provided in the Bill for social services and there are no social services being established in the Bill.  The question is whether for the administration of existing local and social services, two new Ministers should be appointed, or whether it should be left under one Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take it in another way then, if I may.  The scheme referred to in the White Paper is based on a variety of pensions, bounties and allowances of all kinds, and on that aspect of the matter, I want to say again that I disagree.  I think the proper approach to matters of this kind <Col N="1178" /> is that the various sections of the community should be put solidly upon their own feet, should be induced to provide for themselves and that the scheme envisaged by Most Reverend Dr. Dignan which was based upon contributions by these people would be the proper scheme.  We have gone so far in this matter of State provision&mdash;and by State provision, I mean provision either from central taxation funds or from the funds of the local authorities &mdash;that it is essential at some stage, if not now, to consider whether or not a scheme of social insurance on a contributory basis is not the proper method.  The Dignan scheme has been mentioned by other speakers and I hope I shall not be out of order in referring to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>One Deputy, Deputy Norton, was pulled up for referring to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Norton referring to the Dignan scheme at length.  However, I do not want to go into any details, beyond advocating that some system of contribution will have to be adopted, that the State resources are not inexhaustible.  I am beginning to wonder who are the poor in this country at the moment.  There is a new poor about whom we do not hear very much here.  It is not popular; they have not many votes; but they are being squeezed and squeezed out of existence, when all they want is to be left alone.  For that matter, all the country wants is to be left alone.  We have too many Government Departments, too many Government officials and too much State interference by inspectors and public officials of all kinds with our private lives.</P>
      <P>I want to see a position in which a Government inspector would be a rarity and in which our people would have no need for a Government inspector to go amongst them.  I want to see a position in which our people will have that good, sound rustic independence which would not call for the intervention of any official at any time.  If we could have that, it would be the ideal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan wonders whether we could not get a leprechaun into the new <Col N="1179" /> Department, or a non-politician.  I am afraid he is living in a fool's paradise if he thinks these two new plums of office are likely to be handed to anybody outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In any case, I think it would mean an amendment of our Constitution, but I cannot see on the Opposition Benches any individual who is likely to energise these new Departments to the extent to which Deputy Norton and Deputy Cogan want them to be energised.</P>
    <P>One thing which puzzles me in all this matter is the task which will have to be faced of linking up the co-ordination which will undoubtedly take place at the top with the co-ordination at the bottom levels.  It is not at all clear how that is to be done. Undoubtedly, our county managers will be placed in a very difficult position. Instead of having to report to and be supervised by one Minister as heretofore, they will now be reporting to and supervised by three new Ministers, and it looks to me as if the functions of the county manager will be triplicated rather than reduced.  If that position arises locally, it simply means that the county managers will look for assistance, and we will have assistant county managers everywhere.</P>
    <P>There may be a scheme in the Department which has been worked out by which that type of thing cannot happen, but at the moment I cannot see how the system is to work down the country.  It is all very well to centralise and co-ordinate functions at the focal centre, but it is difficult, at this stage at least, to visualise what will happen on the perimeter.  I can see confusion worse confounded.  I can see a demand being made by the various Ministers for a whole host of new officials to enable them to carry out their new duties, and if each Minister is to press forward his policy as energetically as is expected by some of the Deputies who have spoken, the county managers will be very much overworked.</P>
    <P>I want to say again that we should approach this matter from the standpoint that this is a small country with a declining population, with 25 per cent. of that population living in Dublin under the Minister's eye, with <Col N="1180" /> some of the balance scattered through a few large towns and the rest on the land.  Surely that is not the condition which prevails in the big urban populations of Great Britain or the United States, and, to my mind, it is futile to attempt to superimpose on our rural conditions the type of machinery being set up elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, apparently, had in mind that experts might be employed to run these services.  That suggestion is not one which appeals to me, because these gentlemen get very advanced ideas.  They try to force these advanced ideas on the Department's officials and then on the Minister and, as soon as they get a few precedents, then they come forward with new doctrines and try to superimpose these on the country.  By all means let us have our experts, but let them be controlled from here.  Expert opinion here, as it is elsewhere, is perhaps very much in advance of opinion in the country.  I would not like to see an expert Department set up that would be given a free hand, if you like, to experiment with the country.  If we are to look at what is done elsewhere, let us look to the smaller countries rather than to the big ones.  Let us see how the people in small States, like Denmark, Norway, or Sweden, have done these jobs, rather than how they are done in the big countries.</P>
    <P>Personally, I would have liked to see less haste about the introduction of this measure.  A White Paper was promised by the Taoiseach and that did not materialise.  In the absence of that White Paper, I think that a committee of this House or an independent committee should be set up to examine all the problems involved in public health and social welfare.  There need be no haste about the matter.  There is plenty of time to wait.  Despite all our statistics and figures, I do not believe that our national health position or our social position is any worse than it was 25 or 30 years ago.  On the contrary, I think it is very much improved. Because of the habit of studying figures and statistics nowadays we are inclined to forget these facts.  I think the public health of our people is better than it was, despite all these new figures and new schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> There is one aspect of the matter to which I should like to refer.  I do not know whether it has been adverted to by other speakers.  But I did read into the Minister's speech that he had some idea of interfering with the present system of education in our medical schools.  He said that he would have to decide whether our training in research and special services could be provided within the existing framework, or whether new State organisations might not have to be provided. I do not know whether he means to set up new State organisations in competition with the medical faculties at present educating people for the medical profession, or whether he intends to take steps to set up some system of control of medical education in the country.  If that be his intention, I would be strongly opposed to it.  I think that State control of an institution of that kind would not give any better results than we get at present. I think that the medical profession, like the legal profession, can be left alone to provide whatever the needs of medical education may be.  I think it would be altogether improper to subject these independent bodies to State supervision or control of any kind and that it certainly would not make for the advance of medical science.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

      <P>My approach to this Bill is mainly governed by the question as to whether or not the multifarious benefits at present administered by the Local Government Department would not be better served by segregation as proposed in the Bill.  My answer to that question is an unhesitating &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. I was surprised by the tone of Deputy Coogan's speech, because I thought he was amongst the majority of the people clamouring for the segregation of these important functions.  Public health and social welfare are intermingled with local government in the Custom House in a hopeless jumble.  I have yet to meet the Deputy on any side of this House who is satisfied with the administration carried on there.  I thought there would be a general welcome for an alteration of the state of chaos which obtains there.  I think each of these services is entitled to a separate Ministry.  Deputy Coogan said that he did not care whether those in control <Col N="1182" /> were called Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers.  Of the two, I prefer to have Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever additional expense it may entail will only be a flea-bite in comparison with the importance of the services to be dealt with. As to whether it is necessary, advisable or desirable to have separate Ministries or Departments set up to deal with public health and social services, I am surprised that anybody would have a second opinion about that.  The hope was expressed generally that more and better attention would be given to these services when separate Departments were set up to deal with them. It is unreasonable to expect any Minister to carry on the wide range of duties entrusted to him under the title of Minister for Local Government.  I think this is a wise, if belated, effort on the part of the Government to deal with the matter.  I thought it would have been generally welcomed.  We shall have to wait and see what the results will be.  We hope that the results will be beneficial and help to raise the social standards of the people.  Of one thing I am convinced and that is that they cannot be worsened.  If they cannot do something better than they have been doing, I am satisfied that they cannot do worse.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan referred to the question of full employment for our people. I do not think it arises on this measure.  Even if it did, I think these Departments are still necessary.  Even in counties where there is full employment we have people who will have to be attended to by State services. Invalids and other people who are unable to work will have to be maintained on the best standard that full employment amongst our people can give them.  Whether it is a high or a low standard, I believe you will have to have Departments to administer the services, as they are of prime importance to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this measure because I would prefer to see Ministers in charge of these Departments rather than Parliamentary Secretaries.  I believe that <Col N="1183" /> the man in charge, with the full responsibility of a Minister dealing with public health or social services, will have to apply his mind energetically to see where the faults and pitfalls have been in the past and do his best to improve these services and to make a better job of them in future.  If he is a Parliamentary Secretary, he will be more or less tied to the ideas of a Minister.  I believe that those in charge of the Departments are entitled to perfect freedom and independence both in regard to public health and social services.  I trust that these Ministers will have a full realisation of the responsibility attaching to their position and that they will get the full support of the Government and the House, whatever the expense on the rates or taxes may be, and that they will ensure that a better standard of social services and of public health, which is long overdue, will result from this measure.</P>

      <P>It is nearly too late.  If there is objection to a Bill, it is usual on the Second Stage to move its rejection. We had, as I say, very critical and very unhelpful speeches from these two Deputies.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins to-day made a fine contribution to the debate and voiced a fine criticism of the whole scheme.  With, probably, two-thirds of what he said I would find myself in thorough agreement.  His speech was certainly a fair criticism of the existing system of local government. He expressed the hope that under the measure before the House an improvement might be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> The Minister in his outline of the scheme for the setting up of the new Ministries gave us a fair explanation of the proposals and of the different headings under which it is proposed to separate the present functions of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  He outlined the functions of the proposed new Ministry of Health and of the proposed new Ministry of Social Welfare.  One or two matters come to the mind, especially of any member of a local authority. Members of local authorities can see very serious complications arising in future.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to be rather more elaborate in his explanation as to how he hopes these Ministries to function in conjunction with local authorities.  Is it proposed that, say, the Ministry of Health will function independently of the local authorities?  The Minister mentioned one function that the Ministry of Social Welfare will perform, that is, in the matter of home assistance. The Minister for Social Welfare should have nothing whatever to do with the local authority.  The two Ministers&mdash;the Minister for Public Health and the Minister for Local Government&mdash;will be a sufficient blister on local authorities without adding a third.  There has been one satisfaction with regard to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, that you were dealing with one Department and one Minister only but, in future, I can see three Ministers actively engaged and in active communication with local authorities and with the county managers, while working independently of one another.  I cannot see how that will work out.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister how the rating authority in future will operate.  Take the county councils of the future.  How are they to operate under three Ministers?  Which of the three Ministers will control the local authority as a rate striking and rate levying authority?  We do not know whether it will be the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Public Health.  We should like information on that matter.  I can see great difficulties arising in the future if even two Ministers are to control in any way the county councils.  If the <Col N="1185" /> Minister for Public Health and the Minister for Local Government are both to be in control of local authorities, I cannot see how it can work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that it can operate very well.  I hope the Minister has considered that matter and has some explanation.  It will be a difficult problem.  He will be up against many difficulties and it will be many years before any new system can be got to work smoothly.  I suggest that the Minister should make provision, in this Bill or some other Bill, for some type of liaison between the two Departments. Experienced Deputies know that all Departments work to too great an extent in water-tight compartments. If there were more flexibility between Departments it would be all to the advantage of the community, especially of the local authorities.  If the proposed new Ministries and the Ministry of Local Government are not capable of working in close co-operation the same state of affairs as was mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins to-day will result. We may have a Department of Local Government acting in a water-tight compartment and the officials of the Department being allowed to work only in water-tight compartments and not being allowed to work in conjunction with the Department administering the Medical Charities Act.  Any member of a local authority who worked on a board of health knows the difficulties that existed.  He knows that, as was pointed out here to-day, the sanatorium was the only institution in any county that was under the control of the medical officer for health.  The county hospital, the fever hospital and other hospitals, while essentially public health services, were not under the control of the medical officers for health and he had no power of entry or any function in the matter.  I am sure all that will be altered but the Minister, in introducing this Bill, did not tell us what is going to happen local authority hospitals or under what Department it is proposed they would function in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I did not say that.  The Deputy said I did not make that clear.  I am pointing out to the Deputy that I did say the county hospitals were going to the Minister for Health, that all the institutions associated with public assistance and home assistance were going to the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;in time; not immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That just bears out much further what I have said.  Take, for instance, the county home.  It is a large institution, with 500, 600, 700, 800 or 1,000 occupants.  It is associated at the present time with medical charities and public assistance.  It is going to be administered by Minister No. 3&mdash; the Minister for Social Welfare.  That is going to be very complicated and very disagreeable.  Only a few years have passed since the Managerial Act was passed in this House and since the managers were installed in office.  One of the results of that Act was that existing boards of health were wiped out.  I am sorry to say that since the wiping out of the boards of health, things have not improved, to my mind anyhow.  Many people have come to the conclusion that boards of health performed a very useful function in any county.  There will be a disagreeable state of affairs for a long time unless the matter is carefully thought out and unless the Minister has a clear idea of the function of a local authority.  I suggest that he should reduce the number of Ministers who will be dealing with local authorities to the minimum.  If it is not possible to have only one, then have two.  Medical charities or public assistance functions should be under either Local Government or Public Health.  That goes without saying.  I understand that housing is to be under Local Government. Sanitation is also to be under Local Government in the future.  These <Col N="1187" /> are all matters of detail that we can discuss later.  They are, however, matters that we must advert to and see how they are going to be operated from the local authority point of view. The Minister for Local Government is responsible for striking the rate.  I take it that the new Department of Public Health will strike its own rate, just as is done in the case of vocational education at the present time.  Will the position be that it will present its demand to the county council and get its demand in full without reference to the county council?  I imagine that the Minister must have something like that in mind.  Otherwise, I cannot see how the provision in regard to that will operate.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, it is admitted on all sides that the necessity of doing something to lighten the load on one Minister, and to separate the functions of his Department is long overdue.  An improvement as regards public health is also long overdue.  The Minister himself pointed out that a vast improvement in that direction is needed.  In my opinion, that improvement can best be brought about by having separate Ministries.  When these new Departments are set up, the administration of the Public Health Acts will pass from the Department of Local Government. That being so, I hope, and I think everyone hopes, that the list of precedents that exists in the Department of Local Government will be put in the museum.  I hope that the young officials appointed to that new Department will not see that old list of precedents which has been there since the Department was first set up.  If they do not, then, in my opinion, that will lead to better administration in the future so far as the Department of Local Government is concerned.  That Department is quite different from any other State Department in so far that it operates in conjunction with the local authorities which are elected by the people of the country.  They are democratically-elected bodies, and are in closer touch with the Department of Local Government than they are with any other State Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that, in respect to a lot of small details <Col N="1188" /> which at the moment require his sanction, if sanction were not required, and if the decision to carry out these details were left to the local authorities, more progress would be made.  In my opinion the local authority or the county manager should be given more liberty of action than either has to-day. At the moment, they are hamstrung by all sorts of regulations and red tape.  If they were allowed to function more freely, and if the Department would depend more on their ability to function properly, I think it would be far better.  Sometimes it is maddening for a local authority to find that it has to wait months and months for sanction to do some simple thing.  That is happening in the case of local authorities all over the country at the moment&mdash; that they have to wait for sanction in regard to plans for housing, for sanitation and for water works.</P>
    <P>These are quite simple things, and there should be no need to require sanction from the Department if the plans have been prepared by a proper engineer.  The Department exercises too much control over even very simple things, with the result that there is often a hold-up for six months and 12 months.  In regard to the execution of many of these works, the big end of the money&mdash;50 per cent. of it&mdash;is raised from the ratepayers by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I want to say that these local authorities are composed of very responsible bodies of men, that is taking them by and large.  They are elected in a democratic way and, therefore, being a responsible body of men they should be given much more liberty of action than they enjoy at present, to act as their own common sense advises them. I want to put that point very strongly to the Minister.  I plead with him that he should give them the fullest possible consideration.  I do not say that these local bodies should not be under the control of the Minister for Local Government.  They are subordinate to him and to the Government, but definitely in the thousands of small matters that crop up from day to day the county manager, the county council or other local authority should be given more liberty, and should not need sanction from the Department in <Col N="1189" /> regard to them.  I think that should be the policy in the future.  I think if in the past they had that liberty of action much more would have been done by local authorities in regard to public health matters.</P>

He said that the establishment of the two new Ministries would do away with a good deal of the chaotic conditions that exist at the moment.  I cannot subscribe to that point of view because I do not see that this new legislation will do that.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health and a slice of the Department of Industry and Commerce are being jumbled together to create the two new Ministries.</P>
      <P>About a year ago we were told that we had 33,000 civil servants, and that that number did not include the unestablished group of civil servants.  In my opinion, we have wasted a good deal of valuable time in the 25 or 26 years that have elapsed since we got the little measure of freedom that we enjoy to-day by not getting down to the rebuilding of the country and in putting an end to some of the running sores that we have in our midst.  Emigration is just as bad to-day as it was in pre-1914 days.  We have a system of government that needs a complete overhaul, and that, I would say, extends to all Departments.</P>

      <P>There was one Department that functioned as nearly as possible to perfection during the emergency, and that was the Department of Supplies.  The decisions come to by that Department from the very earliest date, whether they were right or wrong, were given quickly.  That was <Col N="1190" /> not our experience in the case of the Department of Local Government or of other Departments.  Not long since a case arose in regard to the appointment of an architect.  Actually, sanction for the appointment was given from the Custom House, but some days later a letter was sent down asking the county manager what was being done about the appointment of the architect.  I am afraid that the setting up of two new Ministries will not do anything to remedy a matter of that kind.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce had to carry quite a big burden on his shoulders during the emergency period with one Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health had two.  I myself could never see where the need arose unless it is that we are out with a set and specific purpose of permitting the Civil Service to increase until we reach the stage where we shall have one civil servant to every three ordinary citizens of the State.  This proposed legislation will not relieve the situation one bit.  I cannot see what useful purpose will be served by it.  I admit that at the present moment an overhaul of every Government Department is long overdue.  The establishment of a multiplicity of Ministers and Government Departments will not set matters right.  At the present time business cannot be done because matters have to pass through too many hands before they reach finality.  That is the root cause of all our present trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my short experience in the Dáil, I have come to the very definite conclusion that there is not efficiency in most of our Government Departments. We seem to be merely creating jobs. Deputy Keyes adopts the attitude that we should establish these two new Ministries by all means.  He goes on to say that, having been established, if they do not function properly it is open to us to take further action subsequently. I would remind Deputy Keyes that if we in this House establish two new Ministries, with all the inevitable expense and further heavy cost to the taxpayers and consumers generally, they will be there for all time and we shall have no power to abolish <Col N="1191" /> them.  What we are doing to-night is somewhat similar to what happens when a steam-roller is set in motion down a hill; you can start the steam-roller but you cannot stop it.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this Bill is not going to remove any of the existing evils. As a matter of fact, its ultimate effect will be to increase and multiply still further the existing difficulties relative to the transaction of public business. These two new Ministries will cost anything in the region of £1,000,000 for their administration.  There are many other things upon which that money could be spent.  It will be devoted largely under this proposed legislation towards the making of new jobs with a consequential addition of six or seven thousand personnel to an already overburdened Civil Service.</P>

      <P>I would not object to it in those circumstances.  I know that the old age pensioners are badly in need of some consideration.  I know the public health wants attention and wants it urgently.  I know that there are more tuberculosis cases in the country than can be accommodated in our present inadequate sanatoria and public hospitals.  But I know that under this proposed legislation we are not going the right way to remove the existing evils.  Poverty is the root cause of tuberculosis.  By increasing taxation we are going to still further lower the standard of living of the working classes and thereby increase still further the incidence of tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>As I have already said, every Government Department is urgently in need of overhaul.  Instead of making any effort to clarify the existing system we are going to clutter it up still more and smother it in the hazy cobwebs of bureaucracy out of which nothing but chaos can result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am entirely opposed to this measure.  I would support it if I thought that the establishment of two new Ministries would improve the situation.  I know from experience <Col N="1192" /> that they will not improve the situation. I cannot see what work can be done more efficiently under two separate Ministries than can be done by the present Minister, working in conjunction with two efficient Parliamentary Secretaries.  If the Minister is not able to work his Department efficiently I do not see how the work can be done any more efficiently by setting up two new Ministries.  They will not have any more power than the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has at the present time. He has as much power as any Minister of the State.  I think that what is required is a complete overhaul of his existing Department to enable him to put his own house in order.  The money involved in the administration of two such Departments could be spent to much better advantage on drainage, and other things too numerous to mention here.  I do not think that the establishment of these Ministries will do anything to eradicate the confusion that exists at present. There are many things which require to be remedied and there are many things requiring remedy which we have brought before this House from time to time in the form of parliamentary questions or in the form of a motion.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Flanagan hit the nail on the head when he said that a general election is the only thing which could now produce order of chaos.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, the Department of Local Government and Public Health, as it is constituted at the present time, is the most inefficient State Department in existence.  No matter what proposals are submitted by a local authority for favourable and sympathetic consideration they are invariably held up by the Department. From my experience, the Department of Local Government has been a hindrance to local authorities in trying to carry out their work in a satisfactory and efficient manner.  I am not inclined to blame the staff of the Custom House for the dissatisfaction which has been created in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this question of the establishment of two new Ministries, we must bear in mind that results will depend largely on the type of men who <Col N="1193" /> undertake the responsibilities of these Departments.  I think the Minister is introducing this measure in the House to-night because he is at last convinced that he has failed to administer efficiently the Department of which he has been placed in charge.  In every part of the country grave dissatisfaction exists in relation to the workings of the present Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The Department has ordered sworn inquiries into the manner in which local authorities discharge their duties.  The Department demanded an inquiry, in July of last year, into the affairs of that county council of which I am a member.  Seventeen months have elapsed since that inquiry took place and we have not yet received a report. I believe that a good deal of the dissatisfaction, of which Deputy Allen complained to-night, is due to the fact that the Minister in charge of the Department has acted irresponsibly during his tenure of office.  I believe that the reason why the Government has now seen fit to introduce this legislation is because of the fact that they are aware the Department is in incompetent hands and they are anxious to hand over the more important duties to some responsible person.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins in his speech to-day made one comment which appealed to me.  He said that if one had an old engine, and that old engine went out of order, one would endeavour to repair it and lubricate it; one would not purchase two completely new engines.  This new legislation is not going to add any great measure of efficiency to the present system.  I would like to say here that it might have proved very helpful if the sworn inquiries held by the Department of Local Government had been conducted within the precincts of the Custom House itself, instead of down the country.  I believe that a good many sworn inquiries should have been held into the conduct of the Minister, and the manner in which the Minister has carried out the duties of his Department. We have had in the past a Minister for Local Government and Public Health, with two Parliamentary Secretaries working under him.  In <Col N="1194" /> my opinion those Parliamentary Secretaries exercised just as much power as is proposed for the Ministers appointed under this new legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Higgins, Cogan and Cosgrave made very strong references to the Public Health Bill.  It was even suggested that we would be summoned to attend the Dáil during Holy Week, so that sections of that Bill might be rushed through.  We are now faced with the situation that that Bill is on the shelf.  Why was there all that rush and anxiety to get the Bill through some months ago?  It has now been left aside and there is no question of urgency.  A lot of crocodile tears were shed some months ago about public health and legislation was introduced to apply a remedy. Now there is no urgency at all.  I think the White Paper should contain some information as to why the legislation which occupied about three months of Parliamentary time was shelved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for that.  The information circulated to Deputies in the White Paper is insufficient.  Indeed, it is a very vague document.  One of the most important question at the moment is the housing question.  From the point of view of public health, a good deal will depend on the way in which our people are housed.  Members of local authorities can bear out the statement that for every vacant cottage, there are from 12 to 20 applicants.  We hear nothing about the urgency or the importance of solving the housing problem. We heard nothing as to how the new Minister will tackle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be denied that our social services are such as to make us hide our heads in shame.  We have people existing under circumstances that would not be tolerated in any other country.  Some of our people are facing hardships that no human beings should be asked to endure.  If the Minister will direct his attention to the social services in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, he will see we are 100 <Col N="1195" /> years behind time.  The new Department will take over such things as old age pensions, national health insurance and unemployment benefit.  We have no guarantee that conditions will improve in this respect or that the Minister who will be responsible for these services in the future will carry out his duties more efficiently than they are being carried out now.  We have no guarantee that the condition of the unfortunate citizen will improve one iota as a result of two Ministers being appointed, with pensions at the end of their period of service.  The primary consideration should be what position the taxpayer and the ordinary citizen will occupy as a result of the setting up of the two new Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen of the Fianna Fáil Party told us that members of local authorities are to be bundled up and they will not know where they stand. If Deputy Allen is right, the ordinary citizen cannot become a member of a local authority.  One would almost want to be a university graduate in order to be able to follow local government procedure.  The administration of the present Department of Local Government has been most unsatisfactory. I cannot see how the new Ministers will improve conditions when a Minister and two Parliamentary Secretaries have failed to do the job satisfactorily. On numerous occasions I have made strong representations about affairs in my constituency and about matters of national importance, and I seldom got a satisfactory reply from the Department.  If Deputies were to depend on the Minister to deal with their representations, they would wait a long time.  It is through the courtesy of some civil servants that a Deputy gets a reply.  They are courteous enough to attend to the needs of Deputies.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy Keyes that circumstances cannot be any worse than they are.  I agree that they cannot be.  What hope have we that the new Departments will bring about an improvement?  We have no idea of the policy of those Departments.  There is no suggestion that we will get increased benefit under national health insurance.  At the moment, unfortunate <Col N="1196" /> labouring men, when they are ill, are the recipients of 15/- a week.</P>
    <P>On that amount they have to maintain themselves and their wives and families, possibly four, six, eight or ten children.  The result is that they live in poverty, under conditions of abject misery.  How could it be otherwise with a mean, mangy allowance of 15/- under our social services?  We have no guarantee that the new legislation will improve those conditions. The allowance now paid is not sufficient to maintain any man, not to speak of a man with a wife and family and, perhaps, dependent relatives.  The amount is not nearly sufficient to provide a citizen with the nourishment necessary in order to enable him to work in normal good health.</P>
    <P>We have a most deserving section, the old age pensioners, deliberately and shamefully kept in misery and starvation.  They have to go to the county homes to die.  They could not live outside these institutions because the amount they receive weekly is totally inadequate to keep them.  In 1916 those people had 10/- a week. They have the same amount to-day, despite the fact that the 10/- a week in 1916 could purchase what one would have to pay 25/7 for to-day.  The Minister ought to be mighty glad to clear away from the Custom House and from his responsibility for such social services.</P>
    <P>If I thought that as a result of this legislation national health insurance recipients, old age pensioners and widows and orphans would benefit to the extent of 5/- or even 1/- a week, I would be only too delighted to support the Minister and the Department in bringing about such a happy state of affairs.  Nothing would give us greater satisfaction than to see social services introduced which would give full-time employment with decent wages to every citizen anxious and willing to work.</P>
    <P>In the past we experienced the awful tide of emigration that swept 175,000 of the cream of Irish manhood and womanhood beyond the Irish Sea to the land of our traditional enemy to assist the people there in the manufacture of war materials.  Even in years of peace they are travelling across the Irish Sea.  They are travelling now across <Col N="1197" /> the Irish Sea, because the social services are attractive there, because wages and conditions are attractive there.  Here at present we have rock-bottom wages and sky-high prices. Surely that is something to which the sympathetic consideration of a responsible Minister should be given?  The Department of Social Welfare, if established must undertake to remedy those conditions, so that our people will be catered for properly in that respect.</P>
    <P>I think it only right, while I am speaking, that I should make a reference to the public health of the country. It is lamentable to see that, no matter what part of the country one may travel in, even outside the City of Dublin, we find the county medical officers of health, when asked to express an opinion, always commenting on the long lists waiting to secure admission to the local sanatorium.  This question has been debated before and legislation has gone through this House.</P>

      <P>I quite agree that it is a question for the two new Ministers to carry on in the Departments the existing legislation, but I find that, as far as the existing legislation is concerned, the present Minister has failed to carry it out.  Where the present <Col N="1198" /> Minister has failed, how is the new Minister going to succeed?  Is he going to be any mightier a man than the present Minister, who has already failed completely?  Surely it is very improtant to this House to know how a new Minister is going to be able to carry out satisfactorily what the present Minister has failed to do.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see that special attention and consideration is being given to the all-important question of public health, as on it depends the health of the State.  I believe that very slow progress&mdash;if I may say so, no progress&mdash;has been made in that direction so far and I look forward to hearing the Minister's proposals as to what the new Department may do for the improvement of existing conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the Bill I have read, I am satisfied that this House is being asked to appoint two new Ministers and set up two new State Departments.  We are given on the White Paper the principal heads under which they are to function. Under one of those we are told that public health is one of the major matters to be dealt with by one of the new Ministers.  Where two Parliamentary Secretaries and a Minister have failed, I fail to see how the two new Ministers will do the job more efficiently.  I am surprised at members of this House, especially some of the older members, saying that when the two new Ministers have been appointed we will have a more efficient service.  We may have some new legislation introduced by these Ministers, but as far as the running of the Departments is concerned those who are here long enough know that the Ministers do not run the Departments, that it is the civil servants who do it.  Surely, the Civil Service staff that will be appointed under this legislation is the staff that will conduct the affairs of the Department and not the Minister?  As was pointed out here time and again, the Minister wrote to <Col N="1199" /> a certain local authority, as Deputy Blowick says, to know why they did not appoint an architect, when they had appointed him some six months before.</P>
      <P>The Minister is solely responsible for the administration of his Department. Surely one would imagine that the Minister appointed by the Taoiseach and by this House would have some responsibility towards his Department? I believe that, if he is appointed in charge of a particular Department of State, he has full responsibility for the actions of the Civil Service working under him and is responsible for any matter that is sent to his Department for his sanction and approval. I am prepared to stand over that, because we can be very readily told, on the other hand, that the Minister has the powers and functions in such cases.  Like Deputy Blowick, I believe this question will bring about an increase in taxation.  There will be pensions for these Ministers as soon as they retire and that will be felt not by ourselves but by the generations coming after us, if they live long enough, as they will have the liability of those gentlemen.  If you put the whole 12 or 13 Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Party together, I can safely say they are not worth the expense they are on the State at present, as the results, as far as the ratepayers and taxpayers are concerned, amount to their being a liability rather than an asset.  For that reason, if I were speaking from the point of view of a ratepayer or taxpayer, I would strongly oppose any additional squandermania.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the present Government at one stage were very anxious to see the number of Ministers in the Cosgrave Government cut down, yet we find them now, instead of knocking off a Minister or two, putting on additional Ministers.  I only hope that what the Minister says may come to light, if he sees any useful purpose in the establishment of these Departments. Certainly, I am one Deputy who can see no useful purpose to be served by the additional Ministers.  I believe it will make good jobs for a number of loyal and faithful servants who have <Col N="1200" /> approved of Government policy and may also put a couple of important Fianna Fáil front bench men in very safe and secure positions, so that, when the time comes and they have to leave the shadow of Leinster House behind them, they will have the protection of a Ministerial pension, which will carry them to the four corners of the country, at the expense of and independent of the poor taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that quite a number of Deputies are supporting this Bill under a complete misapprehension. Deputy Flanagan is obviously under a misapprehension, though from the end of his speech I confess I do not know whether he is supporting the Bill or opposing it.  He talked about what a new Minister for Health may do for housing.  He will have nothing to do with housing.  Deputy Keyes was surprised that all Deputies do not receive the Bill with open arms and welcome it.  He welcomed it as it would put an end, he said in one part of his speech, to the chaotic conditions that still exist; yet in the next breath he said he was welcoming the Bill because the position could not be worse than it is at the moment.  The Deputy went on to say that it was about time that we had co-ordination of health services under one Minister and of social services under another Minister.  He spoke as if some of the social services&mdash;the most important of them&mdash;were not as closely allied to public health as the hospitals are.  What is the foundation of good public health?  Good housing and good sanitation.  Anybody will admit that those are the first requirements. The new Minister for Public Health will have nothing to do with either housing or sanitation.  Has national health insurance nothing to do with public health?  The new Minister for Public Health will have nothing to do with national health insurance.  I could go on down the list. Instead of reducing whatever confusion and whatever chaotic conditions obtain at the Custom House, this Bill will introduce greater confusion and more chaotic conditions amongst all the local authorities.  It will drive officials of local authorities and local authorities to their wits' end to perform their functions.  Unlike other Deputies, let <Col N="1201" /> me compliment Deputy Allen on his speech.  I think that Deputy Allen's speech was a good criticism of the Bill. It was facing up to the Bill as it really is by a man who has experience of local government.</P>

Deputy Allen foresees quite clearly what will happen when the officials of a local authority and the local authority are trying to obey three different Ministries at the same time.  I do not want to say this in any carping spirit, but members of the Labour Party have welcomed the creation of two new Ministries as if that would mean an improvement in the social services.</P>

Will the Deputy not agree that bad housing and bad sanitation are responsible for a great deal of our bad health?  If they are not, we have all been misled and misinformed by expert opinion since we were able to read.  Is not ill health due in large measure to overcrowded conditions? It is only a few months since, from the bench on which the Minister is now sitting, that was preached to us on the <Col N="1202" /> Public Health Bill.  Having mentioned that Bill, may I say that, far from criticising the Minister for withdrawing it, I should like to compliment him? It is one of the few sensible things he has done since he became Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>He took jolly good care he did not.  Again, I say that the Minister was wise in that.  I should like Deputies to realise what this Bill purports to do.  It will not do any of the many things for which it has been welcomed.  If all the services which could properly be brought into the two new Ministries, were so brought, for what would we want a Minister for Local Government?  What would be left to him to administer?  The only things I can think of are roads.  If we are to have a Minister for Public Health and a Minister for Social Welfare and if all the services which would properly call for their attention are brought within their jurisdiction, what, of consequence, would be left for the Minister for Local Government except roads?  He would not even have responsibility for the village pump because the question of a pure water supply would be one for the Minister for Public Health.  I am wondering if housing and sanitation are not being retained to the Minister for Local Government merely for the purpose of justifying his retention.  I should not object to the creation of a new Ministry <Col N="1203" /> or two new Ministries simply because of their newness.  They might give good service.  Their establishment might be of value to the community. If I were satisfied that they would be in a position effectively to deal with the present deplorable state of public health, the cost in cash would not frighten me, because nobody can calculate the losses of the country due to ill-health.  But the appointment of a new Minister for Public Health and a new Minister for Social Welfare, or even of ten additional Ministers, will not cure the situation regarding public health until you get to the root of the trouble.  The root of the trouble is economic and Deputies know that quite well.</P>

      <P>Lest my speech be misinterpreted, I had better say at the outset that I welcome this Bill for the creation of two new Ministries.  I am inclined to disagree with some of the observations of Deputy Morrissey.  We admit that you could co-relate the Department of Public Health with the Department of Local Government and the Department of Social Welfare. The Deputy makes the point that housing and sanitation should be within the sphere of the Minister for Public Health because he believes that bad houses and bad sanitation are the root of all evil.  For the same reason, he could argue that you should co-relate the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is responsible for unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance, with the Department of Lands, which is responsible for the payment of forestry workers.  That argument could be made apply to virtually every Department in the State because the policy of these Departments affects the people's standards.</P>

    <P>I do not believe that this proposal will involve any squandermania or that it is reasonable to expect that the new Ministry will cost the country the large amount of money which Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches would have us believe because on the establishment of these two new Departments a proportionate number of civil servants will be transferred from the Local <Col N="1204" /> Government Department to the new Departments.  Of those Deputies who complain, I ask what is the alternative, because I think they will agree, as I am sure the Government Party and the Minister himself agree, that the administration of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, as now carried on, is an absolute failure.  The only alternative open to us is to aim at a better concentration of the functions of the Department by appointing two responsible men who can devote their whole time and energy, firstly towards the administration of public health and secondly towards the administration of social welfare.  It is not unreasonable to expect that in consequence of the establishment of these two new Ministries, the people affected by these social services will benefit considerably, if not from the financial point of view&mdash;we all know the Government's attitude towards old age pensioners and other pensioners&mdash;at least by way of receiving more attention and that they will be less subject to delay in regard to representations made on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I should like to get an idea from the Minister as to the attitude of the two new Ministries towards local bodies.  I think that far too much attention has been paid to the civil servants who will administer these two new Departments and that not sufficient attention is being paid to the unfortunate&mdash;I do call them unfortunate&mdash;officials down the country who will have to work under these two new Departments.  In that respect, may I mention that the Minister, in dealing with his Estimate some few months ago, admitted that the number of civil servants in his Department had increased from 1932 to 1946 by something like 100 per cent.?  In reply to a question which I asked him subsequently, he supplied me with certain figures from which I was able to ascertain that the staffs of local government bodies had increased during the same period only by something like 20 per cent.  I should like to know from the Minister how he can expect to have efficient local administration by local officials if he will permit an increase of only 20 per cent. in the staffs of local bodies while he in the Custom House <Col N="1205" /> can have increase in staff during the same period of something like 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>The two new Ministers in my opinion will secure greater efficiency in local administration if they adopt a policy of promotion in the various grades rather than the present system of appointment in some cases through the Local Appointments Commission. It has been proved in the case of many appointments that for a matter of three or four years the man selected by the Appointments Commission is a traince and, in many instances, it is the junior clerks who for a certain period will have to teach him his job.  He may be a man who has never had any experience&mdash;he usually is&mdash;of a corporation, an urban council or any type of local body whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I think the two new Ministers should devote some attention is the question of the definition of duties for all officials.  I assume, and it is not unreasonable to assume, that for the purpose of securing greater efficiency in the Civil Service, each official's duties are defined.  My experience in a county council is that one can go in there as junior clerk and be liable to be asked to do anything. One must be an expert more or less in practically all branches of local government.</P>
    <P>That is unfair to the clerk himself and it is certainly not conducive to efficiency in administration.  When the board of health was amalgamated with the county council, a worse state of affairs obtained than when you had two distinct public bodies.  You had officers who were conversant with, and experts in, board of health affairs who had to go over to the county council staff and it was expected that they should become experts in a different capacity.  In the case of any appointment, I would advise the new Ministers and indeed the present Minister, that when he is sanctioning an appointment he should strictly define the duties of the man he is going to appoint.  In that way he will get more efficiency.  I am not making any complaint but in these local bodies there is a lot of squabbling amongst junior officials, I might say amongst <Col N="1206" /> all types of officials, as to what their duties are.  Where these disputes take place, you have the place topsy-turvy. Nobody is going to accept a responsibility which he believes belongs to another official, therefore it is highly necessary that the duties of each official should be defined.</P>
    <P>The last speaker from the Fianna Fáil benches spoke about the powers of public authorities and the managers. Some Deputies, I am sure, will smile when I tell them that if the smallest clerk in the office of a public body wants to buy a bottle of ink he cannot do so unless he gets the order from the county manager.  The manager is omnipotent in every single matter; before the slightest move is made the manager must first make his order.  I would suggest to the Minister that the manager should get authority to delegate some of these powers because every Deputy knows that the manager cannot remain in one particular office in his area of administration for a whole week.  Sometimes he may be 40 or 50 miles away from an office where a decision has to be made and unless he is given authority to delegate some of his powers to some other official, business will be held up until his return.  That certainly does not tend towards better administration.</P>
    <P>I think we are entiled to know, in connection with the establishment of the two new Ministries, if it is the intention also to create three different Departments under a local authority. Will it be a case where an official will have to deal with each of the three Ministers or will he have to deal with three Departments&mdash;one for local government, one for public health, and one for social welfare?  If you have just one Department with three Ministers and that each official, say a clerk or enginner, has to deal with three Ministers, you certainly will have a certain amount of confusion.  If the Minister has an alternative proposal, I am sure it will be acceptable if it will avoid the confusion which we are inclined to anticipate on the establishment of these two new Ministries.  I should also like to ask the Minister whether it is proposed to have separate investigation officers in the Ministry of <Col N="1207" /> Social Welfare.  At present, the home assistance officer acts as investigation officer in home assistance cases, while there are different investigation officers for other social services like old age pensions and unemployment insurance. The Minister would save quite a lot and would obviate the necessity for much clerical work if he were to have the same investigation officer for each of the social services to be administered by the Minister for Social Welfare. I should also like to know if it is the Minister's intention to have old age pensions, children's allowances and other similar allowances still paid through the post office, or whether the local authorities will administer all these services which heretofore have been administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I did not expect to have to make the formal statement that I welcome this Bill and it has come as a surprise to me to learn that a number of the Deputies on the Opposition Benches are opposed to it.  If it will provide, as we believe it will, better services for the people mentioned in this White Paper, I am for it, but we will expect that there will be a speeding-up, that we will get better service from these three Departments than we get at present from the Department of Local Government and that we will not have what occurred this week&mdash;an order sent away for sanction in October which was sanctioned within a week while an identical order sent for sanction in May has not yet received sanction.  That is the type of thing we get from the Department of Local Government and it is reasonable to expect that, even if this is only a small change, it will at least be an improvement, because what we have got from the Department up to this has been the worst.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my opinion that the Department of Public Health should not concentrate to any great extent on the actual cure of disease as against the education of the people in the dangers of disease, but that it will start a nation-wide campaign, as has been advised for a long number of years, to warn people of the dangers of a disease like tuberculosis and to <Col N="1208" /> educate them in the dangers of that disease.  If we are to eradicate this white scourge, we must let the people know that it can be contracted very simply, and it is rather ridiculous to try to cure a whole family infected with this disease when the State could have pointed out to them that the disease need not have been contracted in the first place.  I hope that the new Minister for Social Welfare, rather than confining the activities of his officials to the means of the people, will modify the means test, if not abolish it altogether, and will devote himself to the task not of finding out what the people have but what the people want.  What the country wants is not a means test but a needs test.</P>

      <P>The Government have a fierce &ldquo;neck&rdquo; and it is getting harder every day&mdash;telling the people that they intend to create two new Ministries! Do they remember the great battle-cry which swept them into power in 1932&mdash;the intolerable burden on the people at the time and the existence of too many Ministers and too many costly officials?  How do they stand over these statements to-day?  I do not think the country will fall for this.  It is an outrageous proposal in view of the battle-cry which swept the country from North to South in past years.</P>
      <P>This country is handicapped by too much political play-acting by both sides of the House.  There is not a Party in the House which is really honest or a man in the House who is really honest.  There is far too much play-acting and if we were honest and sincere, as we ought to be&mdash;at least, we who brought the country to freedom&mdash;there would be very little gap between us and we should have evolved a policy which would give the people decent and honest service.  At present, however, there is nothing but political &ldquo;wrangling&rdquo; all over the country to see who will score over the other, and the result is that the unfortunate man in the country has to pay through the nose for it.  In my opinion, the country would be justified in sweeping all Parties in the House out of it and starting from scratch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for the creation of these two Ministries. All that is needed at present is a proper tightening up and plenty of leeway can be made up by doing so. We have far too much State interference which has had the effect of killing private initiative.  If private initiative had got the chance it should have got, 50 per cent. of the State officials would not be needed to-day. Private enterprise is killed by State interference and the State should get out of private business and should carry out its real function, that is, the function of guiding and leading, and let the people do their work themselves.</P>
      <P>When we started off 25 years ago, we were a valiant people.  We were a nation of free men, able to hold our heads up, but to-day we are nothing more than a nation of State serfs.  Half of the people of the country are living on the sweat and the expense of the other half and some men have to carry far too big a load for the sake of the idle gentry.  That is very unfair to the ordinary man who gave us the right to sit here.  All we want is simplified government and we can get it under the present machinery, but we will not get it so long as the play-acting goes on.  What I want to see in this country is work for every man willing to work, and if there are men in the country, as there are, who will not work, although work is offered to them, I would not give them a penny of the State money they are getting to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see every man earning his bread by the sweat of his brow, honestly and decently, and no man &ldquo;scrounging&rdquo; at the expense of another.  It is the duty of the State to do as much as is necessary for the old, the infirm and the sick, but I am satisfied that there is a vast number of people&mdash;farmers, labourers, and so on&mdash;in fairly good circumstances who should, if they have Christian charity in their hearts, be able to carry many of the old, the sick and the infirm on their shoulders.  There is too much bowing and scraping to the State for everything.  There is not a man or <Col N="1210" /> woman who ought not to be proud to carry a father or mother in their old age and to say: &ldquo;They gave me a good living, and it is my duty to provide for them in their old age, and I shall do so.&rdquo;  But the whole tendency is to get away from the responsibility and call on the State, on the taxpayer, to pay. It is very unjust.  It all springs from the political play-acting of the Parties on all sides of this House.  I want to be honest about it.  I am speaking as a countryman and not so much as a Party man.  I was never what you might call a tied man.  I was never afraid to speak my mind.  I am satisfied that this policy of spoon-feeding has gone too far and that half of it could be done away with.  Then we would not require these new Ministries.  The fact is that we have too many Ministries. The labourers in this country fell for the bait in 1922.  They were honest men and most of them earned their bread by the sweat of their brow.  Then they were offered free meat, free milk, free boots&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I believe that if we have more of a link between the Church and the State, more Christian charity, and the St. Vincent de Paul Society working in every parish, we could do away with 40 per cent. of the officials.  We could have men in this country doing work free, gratis and for nothing for which officials are now getting £8 and £10 per week.  We could wipe out half of the State charity, and have good and efficient services.  The Government are trying to steer a middle course between Moscow and Rome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Local Government is a very important one as it ministers to nearly every section of the community in one way or another.  It is a Department which <Col N="1212" /> has a heavy responsibility.  It is also a Department of which most Deputies have reason to complain.  Having reason to complain, one does not wonder at the enthusiam shown at the introduction of this Bill, because they feel that the incompetence or failure of that particular Department will be removed by the establishment of two other Departments.  I can well understand the Labour Party welcoming the setting up of these two Departments, because they have a feeling that by establishing a Department of Health and a Department of Social Welfare the social ills which exist and the maladministration and incompetence will be diminished or removed.</P>
      <P>The present Department of Local Government and Public Health has two Parliamentary Secretaries as well as a Minister.  Each of these Parliamentary Secretaries had certain responsibilities. I suppose they were responsible to the Minister, but at the same time the Minister gave them a certain latitude.  Yet we find that they were unable to cope with the situation. Now we are asked by the Government to grant permission for the establishment of two new Departments with a view to removing these ills and making administration easier and simpler.  I notice that the Minister has not outlined what the administration of these two Departments will cost.  He has not told the House what increase will be necessary so far as officialdom is concerned.  We are asked to give our consent to this Bill in the same way as you would be asked to buy a pig in a bag.  We do not know whether the administration of these two Departments will run into hundreds of thousands or into millions and whether it will entail an extra five or six or 1,000 more junior and senior civil servants.  We do not know anything about it.  What we do believe is that the establishment of these two Departments will not remedy the situation. That is our candid opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government administration is a big responsibility.  It entails a lot of work, because you have social services which would not be necessary if you had proper administration.  Because of the fact that you have a State which is not properly administered you have to <Col N="1213" /> have extra social services of various kinds which entail a heavy burden upon the Minister, extra officials and extra finance.</P>
    <P>According to the White Paper, the Minister for Health will take to himself powers for the prevention of disease, for the carrying out of treatment, the care of persons suffering from physical defects or mental illness. A short time ago the Public Health Bill was introduced in this House.  The preparation of that Bill undoubtedly occupied a number of officials and draftsmen.  A considerable amount of the time of this House was taken up in debating it.</P>
    <P>Now it has been withdrawn and we get no explanation as to why it has been withdrawn.  There is an instance which clearly shows that the Minister or his Department was merely guessing. They were not sure whether they needed a Public Health Bill or not. They allowed that Bill to go to the Committee Stage before they made up their minds to withdraw it.  Now they come to the House asking for permission to establish two Departments, one for Health and one for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of money is being spent already on the health of the nation and, from what we are told, a great deal more money will have to be spent if the health of the nation is to be built up to the standard which we would all desire.  It is a considerable time since legislation was passed providing for the erection of sanatoria and yet we have heard very little about the regional sanatoria that were to be provided.  I understand that a site was selected near Collinstown Aerodrome and that it has now been disqualified as not being suitable.  I understand that they had even prepared the sites there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out the inefficiency in planning of the Department of Local Government.  Officials of that Department were engaged in drawing up plans and selecting sites and then the site was disqualified.  It was a waste of officials, a waste of time <Col N="1214" /> and a waste of public funds and clearly indicates that the Minister or somebody in his Department is not competent or does not use foresight. That is the reason why I mentioned that.</P>

I would relate it to these two Ministers, because I maintain that if the present Department were functioning properly, if there were a clean-up in that Department and if the Minister put his own house in order, with the assistance of his two Parliamentary Secretaries, he should be quite capable of running the Department efficiently and there would be no need for the extra two Ministers, two extra Departments and extra officials, which may cost millions of pounds.  The Minister has failed to tell us what it will cost or how the money is going to be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  So far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned, I believe it is about the most efficient and the best-managed Department in the State.  It had the burden of Supplies during the war.  I would say that the Minister could learn a lesson from the administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Supplies during the war period.  If we are to have a Department of Health and a Department of Social Welfare. <Col N="1215" /> let us hope that they will produce better effect than the present Department of Local Government and Public Health has achieved.</P>
      <P>I venture to suggest that this Bill would have the support of every Party in the House if we could feel assured that in establishing these two new Departments we would have a better system of health and of welfare and that we would have better administration. That is the point.  We do not feel we will have.  We have got no guarantee or proof that we will have. We are merely living in hope, merely accepting the word of the Minister that it is going to be better.</P>
      <P>Then, as most Deputies have pointed out, there will be these three different Departments who will have daily contact with various local authorities and county managers and it is my opinion that that would entail an increase in the staffs of the various local authorities. Otherwise, they will not be able to meet the demands or be able to cooperate with the Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when replying, may remind those of us who have criticised this Bill&mdash;not from the point of view of the necessity for it, but from the point of view of the effect it will have &mdash;that from these benches constant complaints have been pouring out and that, when he is taking steps to meet them, we are objecting.  The complaints that have been made by this Party have not been made with the intention of having two Departments set up to solve the difficulties.  We expected that the cause of the complaints would be removed within the present Department by the Minister, assisted by his two Parliamentary Secretaries. We did not for a moment anticipate that it would be necessary to have two extra Ministries established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what the people will think about all this when they read in tomorrow's papers that we are to have two extra Ministers, with the consequent financial burden that it will mean by means of extra taxation. That is the proposal from a Party <Col N="1216" /> which reminded this House on many occasions that we had too many Ministers and could do with less, and also that the people were overtaxed.  The Minister may say to me that since those days social services have been provided that did not exist then.  That may be so, but as well as the social services we have also had an extra Parliamentary Secretary, extra officials in the Department and extra taxation, so that really the Minister has no explanation.</P>
    <P>In opposing this Bill we are not doing so because of any desire on our part to deprive the people of a better social system, of a better health system or a better system of local government administration, but rather because we believe that, no matter what is done in the way of adding extra Ministers, extra officials or extra Parliamentary Secretaries, the extra cost involved will not bring about the remedies which the Minister and those supporting him anticipate.  In our opinion the benefits proposed should have come automatically to the people under the present administration, and we see no reason, and have got no explanation, why the people have not got them under the present administration.  The setting up of these two new Departments is going to put an additional burden on the people with no guarantee from the Minister that we are going to have either a better system of health or welfare.  That is the reason why we are opposing the Bill.  I know, of course, that there are men on the Government Benches who would be only too glad, either inside or outside this House, to take the opportunity of conveying to the people that the Opposition Parties were opposed to a better social system and to a better health system.</P>

That is what I am opposed to.  This piece of paper is going to cost the taxpayers money.  The taxpayer will have to pay for what it contains.</P>
      <P>However, we can only express our opinions, and naturally this Bill will be passed.  That being so, it is only right and proper that we should wish the Bill good luck, and that we should wish the new Departments which will eventually be set up good luck.  Let us hope that the new Department of Health and Welfare will be a better success than the present Department of Local Government and Public Health, and that the present Minister for Local Government will eventually, perhaps, let us hope, learn something from his two new colleagues when they are appointed.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this measure is long overdue.  Its introduction is mainly due, I assume, to the coming into operation of what is known as the managerial system.  That system was brought into operation before the Department of Local Government was properly established to deal with it.  The Minister for Local Government was obliged, as a result of the coming into operation of that whole system, to assume responsibilities, and his staff were obliged to discharge duties, which should never have been imposed on a central Government Department of that kind.  Therefore, I cannot understand how any sensible Deputy, with any knowledge of the chaotic kind of administration that we have had on the income services side, can possibly stand up and make a case against the establishment of a Ministry of Social Welfare because it is certainly long overdue.  If the House and the country are fortunate enough to get a Minister as head of that new Ministry who knows his job, and has had any experience of administration, there is no doubt whatever but that he should be able to effect a reduction in the cost of administering the services that will <Col N="1218" /> come under his supervision.  Deputy Cafferky talked about the additional cost, presumably of the salary of the new Minister for Social Welfare, but if his salary can be saved ten times over by a reduction in the cost of administering the new services which will come under his control, surely that is in the interests of the taxpayers, and a sound argument why Deputies, like Deputy Cafferky, should welcome the setting up of that particular Ministry.</P>
      <P>I have listened to a number of Deputies complain, and rightly complain, about the delay on the part of the Department of Local Government in giving sanction to proposals sent up to it by local authorities.  I can subscribe to those complaints.  I know of such cases, and I have brought them to the attention of the Minister by correspondence and even in this House. I have brought to his notice old age pension claims in respect of which the papers had been sent to the inspector in the Department of Local Government. These papers were in his possession for 12 months before a decision was given, while during that time the individual concerned was waiting for the miserable pittance of 10/- a week or less provided under the Old Age Pensions Acts.  Anything that will bring about an improvement in that kind of an inefficient and unchristian system of administration will certainly be welcomed by me.</P>
      <P>We are told in the White Paper that the Department of Social Welfare will be responsible for all functions in relation to old age pensions, pensions for blind persons, widows' and orphans' pensions, national health insurance, unemployment insurance and unemployment (intermittent) insurance, unemployment assistance and children's allowances.  In view of that, it should be clear to any Deputy with any knowledge of administration or with experience of the working of local authorities, that there will be a considerable improvement on the system that we have had experience of up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>You have duplication, triplication and multiplication of investigation. Surely, all that would be cut out under a Ministry of this kind. If we are able to cut out that multiplication of services and salaries, even in the case of investigation officers, the amount saved would more than pay the salary of the Minister for Social Welfare. If I am wrong in that I shall, after I have had some experience of this new Ministry, admit my error.  He will be a dud Minister indeed if he is not able to save money, and he would deserve to be fired out.</P>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Cafferky and those other Deputies who have criticised this particular section of the Bill to examine into that aspect of the matter and to give the Minister, who ever he will be, an opportunity of doing his job.  He will be a dud if he does not do it better than it has been done up to the present time.</P>
      <P>We have been told the Public Health Bill is being withdrawn.  The Public Health Bill has been put into cold storage in the Monaghan Curing Company. When the new Minister is appointed by this House we shall have that Bill again presented to us in a new and improved form as a result of the benefits which have accrued from the discussions which have already taken place on that proposed Bill in this House.  If that is not to be the case I would ask the Minister now to tell us categorically whether the Public Health Bill in all its aspects is being withdrawn or whether another Bill is going to be put in its place?  I would ask the Minister for an answer to that question.  The Bill was presented to this House and took up a considerable amount of the time of the House. Surely, it is not now going to be withdrawn altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody in this House, especially those of us who are in contact with local authorities, are fully aware of the delaying action on the part of the <Col N="1220" /> Department of Local Government and Public Health&mdash;due mainly to the chaotic condition of the Department itself&mdash;in holding up waterworks and sewerage schemes for towns and villages throughout the country long before the emergency started.  Nobody can prophesy now as to when these schemes are likely to be put into operation because of the additional cost and the shortage of essential materials.  I know of towns and villages in my own constituency where proposed waterworks and sewerage schemes were held up by the Department of Local Government and Public Health prior to the emergency.  Could the Minister for Local Government and Public Health give us any approximate date now as to when these schemes will be put into operation?</P>
    <P>On a couple of occasions in this House in the past I have raised what may appear to be trivial matters both by means of Parliamentary Questions and otherwise.  One of those matters to which I wish to refer now is the urgent necessity to pay road workers, employed by local authorities, weekly. The Minister has admitted the cost of his Department has increased 100 per cent. as compared with 1932.  Yet he refuses to authorise local authorities to employ an additional junior clerk at £300 per year in order that the road workers can be paid their wages weekly instead of fortnightly&mdash;and in some cases every three weeks&mdash;as at the present time.  One finds it difficult to understand how a Minister can get up in this House and justify an increase of 100 per cent. in the administrative costs of his own Department and yet refuse to sanction the payment of £300 a year in a job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I wonder will the new Minister for Social Welfare be given authority by the Government to pay a more generous allowance to old age pensioners than the present niggardly allowance of 10/- per week.  As every Deputy in this House must be aware that figure was fixed by the British Government as far back as 1919.  The purchasing power of the 10/- to-day is the equivalent of 3/6.</P>

I certainly do not subscribe to the view expressed by Deputy Cafferky and some other members who spoke here to-night.  I think the members of Clann na Talmhan, or the members of any other Party, who oppose the introduction of this Bill, which makes provision for the establishment of a new Ministry of Social Welfare, have not given this matter the careful consideration which it requires.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill in relation to social welfare.  What will be done under this Bill is a matter upon which I have no information at the moment but I do not think that things can be made any worse than they are at the present time.  I do not criticise the Civil Service heads or the staff of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  They have had an exceedingly difficult job to do under the present Minister.  The fact the present Minister has had the assistance of two Parliamentary Secretaries has not improved the situation.  I sincerely hope that with the introduction of these two new Ministries, Local Government and Public Health will be reorganised and that a new outlook on social services generally will come into being in this country.</P>

      <P>I would like, if I may, to intervene at this stage, because, in doing so, it might probably save a considerable amount of time if I remove some of the misapprehensions which seem to exist.  Making a statement at this stage places me in a rather unguarded position, perhaps, and gives <Col N="1223" /> Deputies an opportunity of speaking after me.  I think, however, it is expedient that I should intervene at this stage.  The motion, as set down here, shows a considerable lack of preparation and a lack of knowledge on the whole subject.  Both the lack of preparation and the lack of knowledge could have been obviated by inquiry before the motion was put down.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that legislation should be introduced immediately which will improve the pay and prospects of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses and which will entitle them to pension rights....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Well, legislation is not required for the purpose of improving the pay of sub-postmasters and auxiliary postmen. That can be done without legislation, but legislation would be required to deal with the question of pensions.  The question of pensions, as Deputy Norton and many other Deputies must know, is one of general Government policy. It must be dealt with by Finance and not by us primarily.  That part of the motion should not have been directed to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. As it has been, I can deal with it up to a point.  It is an extraordinary thing that members of a Farmers' Party should plunge into a motion of this sort, which is really reckless from the point of view of the expenditure of money.  It means a larger amount of taxation&mdash;that is all that it does mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take the question of pensions first.  The suggestion that the position of auxiliary postman and sub-postmaster should be regarded as pensionable raises a major question of State policy, one that affects not only the Post Office but the whole State service. As Deputies are evidently aware, under existing legislation, to qualify for a pension, an officer must be in possession of a Civil Service certificate and one of the conditions attaching to the granting of this certificate is that the officer must be required by his duty to give his whole time to the service of the State.  Auxiliary postmen, who are part-time officers, are thus ruled out, <Col N="1224" /> and the same applies to sub-postmasters who, apart from not being required to devote their whole time to official work, come within the category of contractors rather than of direct employees.</P>
    <P>Whether the present legislation should be altered so as to admit of the granting of pensions to auxiliary postmen and sub-postmasters is a matter for general Government consideration and not one merely for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Obviously, any concession in this connection granted to the Post Office classes could not be withheld from corresponding classes in the State service generally.  I must confess I see very little prospect of a favourable Government attitude on the suggestion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of no administration which provides pensions for other than full-time staff, and so far as I am aware the same applies in industry and commercial life generally, both here and in other countries.  The existing State pension schemes are generous and reasonably comprehensive and, with comparatively few exceptions, the pension schemes in non-State employment are, I think I am correct in saying, by no means comparable.  If pensions for part-time State employees come in at all, they will, I imagine, come as a result of some further advance in general social policy, but so far as the present proposal is concerned, nothing that has been said convinces me that there is any case for <Col N="1225" /> treating auxiliary postmen and sub-postmasters exceptionally.  I have not the least doubt that if I were to make representations to the Government in favour of exceptional treatment, they would not have the slighest prospect of success.</P>
      <P>Coming to the question of auxiliary postmen in reference to their employment and pay, I will, with the permission of Deputy Davin, read a little more for him.  The proposers of the motion ask as a means of improving the pay of these officers that they be put on the established list; that is, appointed full-time postmen with established status.  The Department would be very glad to be in a position to abolish entirely part-time postmanships, but unfortunately it would not be practicable without serious deterioration of the existing delivery service. The great majority of part-time postmen are located in rural areas and the necessity for their employment arises from the incidence of the arrival and dispatch of mails.  At most offices it is possible to provide one or more full-time duties either on single routes of adequate length or on a combination of routes, but when these have been built up there generally remain some shorter routes on which deliveries must be made in various directions immediately after the arrival of mails. If part-time men were not employed on these short routes, the residents of one district would have to wait for their correspondence until delivery had been completed in another district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This alternative to the employment of part-time postmen could hardly be acceptable to the proposers of the motion, who represent rural constituencies, or to rural residents generally and, in any event, the Department could not contemplate such a worsening of the facilities.  As Deputy Maguire so very well put it, the public interest must come first.  The wholesale abolition of part-time positions would, moreover, result in the displacement of a large number of men, many of them with long service and family responsibilities. Opportunity is taken, on a vacancy arising, to amalgamate part-time posts with a view to forming full-time duties, but the possibilities in that direction are very limited.  In any case, <Col N="1226" /> if full-time established posts were created in lieu of part-time posts, the positions would have to be filled from competitive examinations conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  This would necessitate the displacement of the local persons at present employed as part-time postmen.  As it is, it is a considerable benefit to persons who are in a small way of business, or who have a small portion of land, that they should have these extra emoluments for doing a part-time job.</P>
    <P>The limit of a part-time job is about five and a half hours and the average mileage is somewhere between 18 and 22 miles.  The full-time postmen do on an average on any particular route not more than 28 miles.  All the talk about 30 miles is an exaggeration.  We are examining very carefully the whole system of the routes, because we propose to give a large amount of facilities over the country.  We have got, on this year's estimate, an extra £20,000 and that means a certain revision of routes and wherever it is reasonable and possible we propose&mdash;it may be the right thing to do&mdash;to amalgamate certain posts, but in very many cases it will not be the right thing to do and it may be necessary for us to appoint even more auxiliary postmen than in the past, as we will be dealing with areas in which the population is very sparse.</P>
    <P>The wages paid to auxiliary postmen for the number of hours they are employed by the Post Office are good in relation to those paid to comparable workers.  If you compare the position of a rural part-time postman with that of an agricultural labourer, you find the labourer's work is much more onerous, his skill is greater and he has to apply it with intelligence.  The part-time postmen are recruited through the employment exchange from the unskilled classes.</P>
    <P>The present statutory rate for agricultural labourers in rural areas generally is about £2 4s 0d for a 54-hour week, while the rural auxiliary postman would at present be paid from 42/4 to 51/6 for a 30-hour week.  In rural areas adjoining urban districts, a higher rate is payable, of course.  A large number of auxiliary postmen <Col N="1227" /> have some other source of income, pieces of land or other employment.</P>
    <P>The general practice at one time was to confine the selection of such officers to candidates with supplementary means of livelihood, but for a considerable time past the policy has been to give preference to men on the employment exchange register with the highest rates of assistance, namely, those whose circumstances are worst. The men are paid reasonable wages for the number of hours work available and these men are free to find outside employment to augment their earnings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to part-time men at head offices, but I would be interested to know how such men could be employed on full-time work. So far as we can see, it would be impossible, unless these men were paid for doing nothing or for giving service in excess of what is postally justifiable. It is quite wrong for Deputy Norton to say we do not care how the assistants in sub-post offices are treated.  The rule which governs that is that they are generally paid whatever is the local rate payable to assistants in the shops of the village or to persons who are paid a certain amount of money and get their food and boarding as well. We try to insist that the rate which is paid by the sub-postmasters is not less than that which is current in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of the sub-postmaster is really that of a contractor. In some cases, it is a tremendous advantage for a small shopkeeper to have the contract for the post office.  It brings business into the shop and there is, so far as I can make out, no country I know of where that system is not adopted.  It is very difficult to see how there could be any other system, unless we are to have a Government office in every village in the country&mdash;which, of course, would <Col N="1228" /> be quite extravagant and not at all a reasonable suggestion.</P>
      <P>In regard to the defalcations, there are 2,200 sub-postmasters and if you allow for an assistant in every sub-post office you add another couple of thousand.  Out of that 4,000, in the last three years there have been only 40 defalcations.  In examining the records of those, I find the reasons given, when the prosecutions took place, were, in the main, drink, betting, extravagance on clothes, even the purchase of shop goods and, in one case, curiosity.</P>

I am sure Deputy Norton was able to make a very intelligent anticipation and to chip in just at the right moment.  Although he did not put down the resolution, he was able to take full advantage of it.  He reminds me of the fable about the fly who was flying around the great wheel of the cart.

      <P>If the Deputy does not take care, I might go back on what I was going to say.  I made a promise some time ago when I met a deputation of sub-postmasters and I have had a very careful examination made over a period of time of the payments to the two classes.  The disparity between postmasters and sub-postmasters appears to be very unsatisfactory.  It took some time to deal with the weighing of the scales.  However, it was pretty apparent that nothing could be done for the two years until the emergency had passed and the Standstill Order position changed.  Now that it has disappeared and new conditions are gradually coming in, there is the necessity for giving better pay.</P>

      <P>We have got the agreement of the Department of Finance now and obtained the sanction of the Government to abolish the old disparity between the provisional inclusive paid postmasters and the other class, placing the provisional inclusive paid on basic and bonus at full 110 from the 1st November.  The changeover is due to the very unique position in which they had been put, with the reduction of 25 per cent. and so on, and it was quite clear that something would have to be done as soon as the Standstill Order would have passed away. There is to be a relation of the scales <Col N="1230" /> to all the postmasters and they will be better paid than they were in the past. These conditions will be subject to whatever rearrangement is made when the Minister for Finance brings in his new regulations for the Civil Service generally.  I felt it necessary at this stage to deal with these matters so that those who wished to speak on the motion would not be misled and that those who were reasonable would be satisfied with the proposals, as put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be in good humour to-night.  In opening his reply, he said he was rather surprised and bewildered that Deputies who represent the rural areas should ask for an increase for sub-postmasters and auxiliary postmen, indicating that we had not taken into consideration what that would cost the taxpayer, particularly the farmer.  A report was published not so long ago about the Minister going to the diplomatic service. He may be very suitable for that but he should not endeavour, in a diplomatic way, to misrepresent our motion in the eyes of the farming community, however diplomatic or slippery he thinks he is.  We represent no particular section of the community; we represent all sections within our respective constituencies&mdash;farmers, professional men, business men and postmen. We are never opposed to money being spent if it is well spent and there is a return for it, but we are opposed to money being taken out of the pockets of the taxpayer and spent on maladministration.  That is the time we grumble, because we are here as custodians of the people's purse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the auxiliary postman could not get any consideration as regards increase in his wage because, as an auxiliary postman, he had some side-line.  We admit that there are auxiliary postmen who have side-lines, but quite a good many, known to the Minister, have no side-lines and are finding it hard to exist.  The Minister went on to draw a contrast between the farm labourer and the auxiliary postman.  That was, again, because of his foolish idea that we represent the farmers and farm labourers only.  He compared the wage <Col N="1231" /> of the auxiliary postman with that of the farm labourer and he compared their types of work.  He said that the farm labourer had to be an intelligent man and had to have ability and that he had an arduous task to perform. Am I to understand that you can have an illiterate postman and that the task of the postman is not arduous?  Picture the Minister setting out on a cold wintry morning on a journey of from 18 to 22 miles&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>For several years, I had to ride a bicycle 16 miles every morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I can picture the Minister doing that now, with the rain pouring down.  The auxiliary postman had to supply his own bicycle in war time in many cases.  Owing to scarcity of tyres, he had to walk on some occasions and no clothing was supplied by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  He could not get an oilskin or overcoat.  In some cases, he developed tuberculosis and became a burden on his family instead of a help to it.  The postman who has to cover a journey of from 18 to 22 miles cannot cycle all the way.  He must walk across the fields.  Does the Minister suggest that the man is afterwards fit to go into a field to do the work necessary to supplement his wage?  Is that the type of employment the Minister sponsors?  Is that the wage the Minister thinks should be paid to a young workman, who is, in many cases, married?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that a postman has a very responsible position.  He carries private and registered letters and those who do slip up constitute but a very small proportion of the total number.  At the same time, there is a severe temptation in the way of the auxiliary postman.  When he does slip up, it is due to the fact that he is in debt or that his &ldquo;kiddies&rdquo; are looking for boots or shoes or clothing for which he has not the necessary purchasing power.  The only way he can get that is by raiding the letters in his bag. Then, he is brought before the court and publicly humiliated.  In addition, he loses his position.  Does the Minister realise the temptation which <Col N="1232" /> he is placing in the way of an auxiliary postman?  Is the only excuse the Minister has for refusing to increase the wage of the auxiliary postman the few miserable thousands of pounds which it would cost the taxpayer? Would he rather keep the auxiliary postman on a wage which gives rise to temptation and force him to do a daily journey of from 18 to 22 miles, one-third of which he must walk?</P>
    <P>In the constituency from which I come, the bit of land which these postmen have is very small.  The amount of money that can be knocked out of that little bit of land is hardly worth mentioning.  If he were a joiner or a painter or craftsman of any kind, the position might be different, but the small farmers of the type in Mayo, Sligo, Galway, West Roscommon, Leitrim and Donegal make very little out of their small holdings.</P>
    <P>If they were to depend on what they get out of their land, they would have to go naked and they would have very little to eat.  Their children would be starving.  To say that men are employed at a very poor wage because of a so-called side-line is to make a lame excuse.  The Minister should be ashamed of himself for making it.  Let the Minister not think that he is going to deter us from action by drawing a comparison between the auxiliary postman and the farm labourer or by pointing out what the increases would represent to the farmer in the form of taxation. We, as a Party, are not opposed to taxation or to the spending of money if it is well spent and if the community, as a whole, derives some benefit from its spending.  It is when the money derived from taxation is utilised for wrong purposes, for maladministration, for an incompetent Minister and an incompetent Department, that we object.</P>
    <P>I maintain that if ever there was a body of men who had a case to be considered in relation to their work and their pay, it is the auxiliary postmen. The motion calls for the establishment of these postmen on a full-time basis and for the granting of pensions to them.  We support that motion.  I admit that it might take a certain length of time to establish them on a full-time basis and I would be opposed <Col N="1233" /> to the dismissal of 20 men or even one man in order that 200 men might be established.  It is very hard to sack 20 men or even one man for the sake of 200 men because all these men are dependent on the wages they receive, small as they are, but as time goes on, and as men retire, their areas could be re-allocated so as to have two permanent postmen in a district instead of, say, two auxiliaries and one permanent man.</P>
    <P>In relation to the salaries of sub-postmistresses and sub-postmasters, the Minister said that Deputy Norton anticipated that he was about to make a move in the matter.  I have been in the House for over three years and the Minister has been moving for at least that period.  Deputy Norton has been here for a considerable time longer and I suppose the Minister has been moving during all that time also.  The Minister is like an irresistible force coming against an immovable object.  However, we shall accept his word that he is at last considering the necessity of increasing the salaries of these postal officials, I would ask the Minister to give these officials what he considers a reasonable sum out of which they will be able to pay their assistants a decent weekly wage.  Surely in this Christian country, which should be a model to the whole of Europe in so far as decent wages and conditions for the working class are concerned, the wages paid to these unfortunate assistants in this year of 1946 are a disgrace.  We decry materialism and the development of Communism but what has given rise to materialism and Communism?  The advocates of Communism and of materialism have built their propaganda and their programme on bad economic conditions.  It is on that propaganda they get recruits.  We should make every effort to remove these grievances if we want to defeat materialism and Communism which are sweeping across Europe to-day.  By permitting sweated labour in our post offices we are preparing the grounds for the &ldquo;isms&rdquo; to which we so much object.  We should be ashamed of the fact that there are women working in some post offices for less than 10/- a week, having to feed and clothe themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> The Minister may crack jokes and say that it is not his responsibility, that they are not employees of his, that the sub-postmasters and the sub-postmistresses are their employers.  Why is it that the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses cannot pay these assistants a decent wage?  Because the salaries sub-postmasters are getting from the State do not permit them to do so.  There are approximately 2,500 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses in the Twenty-Six Counties and of these 1,500 are in receipt of a salary of less than £1 a week each. They have to provide an office, heat, light, blotting paper and ink, and all the necessary paraphernalia out of that salary.  They cannot leave their districts without the permission of the local postmaster.  For instance, a sub-postmaster cannot go away for two days at a time.  He is tied down.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say to me that these men and women apply for the position knowing the circumstances. They do not know the circumstances. I know the case of one man in my own area, in regard to whose appointment I had a row with the Minister, and he regrets very much having taken up this position.  He was completely ignorant of the responsibility and the outlay which he would have to meet in taking over the position.  He finds to-day that he is practically bankrupt because of the miserable allowance which he receives.  It is not sufficient to enable him to meet all outgoings and to pay the assistants in the post office.</P>
    <P>We are putting forward this motion, not so much out of consideration for the sub-postmistresses or sub-postmasters but because we know that there are girls employed in these offices who are exploited, not because their immediate employers wish to exploit them, but because the allowances the sub-postmasters receive from the postal authorities are not sufficient to enable them to pay more to their assistants, even if they desire to do so.  The Minister may say that these people have other business as a side line.  There are some of them who may have such business but there is a very large number who are totally dependent on their salaries from the Post Office.  The result is that they are <Col N="1235" /> constantly exposed to temptation. Remember that the business in the Post Office has expanded enormously in recent years.  Take the post office in Swinford for instance. There are 11 postmen attached to that office.  It is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, sub-post offices in the Twenty-Six Counties judged by the bulk of the business transacted and the allowance is not sufficient to meet the outlay on staff.</P>
    <P>The business in many of these post offices in the west of Ireland is equivalent in volume to that done in many head post offices here in the city. The business has increased enormously in the past six or seven years owing to the introduction of children's allowances and other social services.  I say the Minister should be ashamed of the remuneration paid to these officials and if he has at last wakened up to the necessity for increasing their salaries, it is high time he did so.  It has taken him a long time to come to the conclusion that he was really the employer of these people.  It is high time that he should pay these people a proper allowance bearing some relation to the importance of the business which they have to transact for the public.  A man to become an efficient sub-postmaster requires a high standard of intelligence and unless you offer a proper salary you are not going to get the right type of man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to one argument&mdash;in fact, the main argument&mdash;put forward by the Minister against this motion, that the position of the sub-postmaster is equivalent to that of a contractor or sub-contractor to the Post Office.  If we assume for the moment that that is the case, does the Minister ask the House to agree that he is relieved of all responsibility if that contract is let on terms which are opposed to decent working conditions? I think he will find that even the members of his own Party will not agree with him.</P>
      <P>He might be surprised to know that, in adopting that line of policy, he is acting in contravention of what purports to be Government policy.  I must remind him that there is what is known as a fair wages clause in relation to contracts.  I give him the case of the Dublin Corporation.  We are in the habit of letting out very considerable contracts every week or every month, but, attached to each contract, is a covenant or clause which ensures that not alone fair wages but trade union conditions shall apply to the particular job.  If the union or unions catering for the employees on that job complain to the corporation that the clause is not being carried out, the contract is stopped.</P>
      <P>The fair wages clause may be taken, generally speaking, as Government policy because it purports to apply to all public bodies, and I suggest that, if it applies to public bodies, there is no reason why a Department of State should be excluded.  That is the kernel of the whole question.  The Minister needs no reminder from me or from any other member that these contracts we are discussing have been based on conditions which are opposed to decent standards.  I think that is generally admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister supports his case by a reference, in the case of auxiliary postmen, to agricultural labourers.  I suggest that the less we hear about the conditions attaching to agricultural labourers' or road workers' work the better but, in any case, there is this substantial difference, that the Minister is dealing with a huge business concern which is showing a substantial profit, as indicated by the Estimates <Col N="1237" /> presented to the House, which profit is mainly obtained because of the accumulation of wages based on a low standard, as in the case of sub-postmasters and auxiliary postmen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a loss on the postal service.  The profit is entirely on telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Telephones still come within the ambit of the Minister. The Department is a business concern showing a substantial profit, and might I suggest to the Minister that he has heard across the floor of this House time and time again complaints in relation to these two grades?  His own members behind him will give him the impact of public opinion on the position of the sub-postmaster.  They would not stand for it and the public will not stand for it.  I suggest that even at this very late stage&mdash;I am glad to learn that he proposes to make a revision of the scales&mdash;he should bear in mind, so far as sub-postmasters are concerned, the implications of what is known as the fair wages clause and to see to it that the revision which is to take place will permit the sub-postmaster to give decent conditions to those he employs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion in so far as it urges the Minister to make the living conditions of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses throughout the country more reasonable. I am glad to learn that he proposes to do something about the matter by way of revision, and it is to be hoped that that revision will take the form of a substantial increase.  I do not like to hear the Minister making his case on the point that the Post Office end of his big concern is run at a loss.  The fact of the matter is that the sub-postmaster or postmistress is now a State institution and has to deal with nearly every sort of thing under the sun.  The smallest post office pays old age pensions and handles considerable sums of money.  Take the case of the sub-post office, which is a money and telegraph office as well, in a village of 600 or 700 people.  The sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress in that office has a whole-time job.  The office handles children's allowances and old age pensions, issues dog licences and radio <Col N="1238" /> licences and pays unemployment assistance. Unless the total of these activities reaches a certain figure, the sub-postmaster gets no additional pay worth while&mdash;1/- or 2/- a week, if that much.</P>
      <P>All this business has been imposed on them within the last 20 years, but in a great many cases the pay they receive has remained static.  How can the Minister or anybody else expect satisfactory service from an over-worked and under-paid servant?  There are cries of holy horror and criminal proceedings are taken when one of these people, through stress of circumstances, deals loosely with State funds.  It is only a step-father would blame them because they are working under conditions where the temptation is great and responsibility for their fall is upon the Minister or upon the employer who has them working under such conditions. We have had sad cases, and I hope we will not have any more, but the only way in which they can be avoided is by paying ample wages for services rendered.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan when he says that the fair wages clause should be given effect to.</P>
      <P>The Minister also says that these people are sub-contractors to the Post Office, but we know that that is not so, in practice.  They are actually employees of the Post Office and the Minister takes very good care with regard to those who get the appointments. I admit that, when a post office in a district becomes vacant, there is great &ldquo;polling&rdquo; for it, as they say in the country, and great work to get it. Why?  Because the economic conditions of the country are such that it is something that helps.  It is the economic conditions of the people that force them to accept that pay.  If there is a vacancy for a caretaker of a golf links at £1 or 30/- a week, there are hundreds of applications for it.  The fact that there are some amenities in these places and better conditions than they are living under at present induces the people to apply for these positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want unduly to stress the situation, but for the last six or seven years many people in the country had not paraffin oil or candles.  They certainly had no electric light.  Even in <Col N="1239" /> the small post offices they had hardly any artificial light.  Finally there was some effort made to provide it.  Therefore, if a person got a post office appointment he had some chance of having light.  The whole thing is that the young people in the country are not satisfied with the conditions obtaining there.  Even when they become aware of the circumstances under which they have to work in the post office they do not want that work either.  It is one of the things that show how bad the conditions are in a great many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I consider that sub-postmasters or postmistresses generally must be of a high standard as there have been so few defalcations.  For people of such a high standard, the pay is miserable. The Minister defends it on the ground that they are sub-contractors to the Post Office.  It is essential that their conditions should be improved.  It is also essential that the Minister should make a certain minimum of furniture available in these offices.  In a great number of these offices you will find only a desk or a counter for the transaction of business.  That does not help either the post office officials or the public.  It is almost impossible to get work done properly under these conditions. Then, if anything goes wrong, the sub-postmaster or postmistress is blamed.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I support the motion and urge the Minister that, in re-adjusting the salaries and conditions of employment, he should be generous to the highest degree, because this is a very important service.  If the Minister does improve their conditions it will be accepted by the people generally as a long required improvement in the conditions of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sign of grace anyhow to see this motion put down by two Deputies of the Party opposite.  It is a sign of grace to see a departure from their general parsimonious policy with which some other Deputies have consistently disagreed since the initiation of that Party.  When I saw the motion, it occurred to me that the element of intelligent anticipation <Col N="1240" /> entered into it very largely.  As a matter of fact, I think it went a little further.  I was reminded of the type of man who retires to a room, takes down a dictionary and looks up some most extraordinary word, and then, when he is quite sure he has it right, comes down and bets another person £10 that he will not spell this very extraordinary word correctly.  I am sure that Deputies of the Party opposite know that our sympathy is with the sub-postmasters and postmistresses in this matter.  I think they also knew what the Minister's intentions would be in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I must say straight off that the first part of this motion has my full sympathy.  We must admit that the type of work done by sub-postmasters or postmistresses is a very high type of work.  There must be strict accuracy and there must be constant watchfulness. They have the responsibility for taking in and guarding a large amount of money.  It is work that is really trying on the nerves and tempers of the people that carry it out.  These people have our sympathy.  We must also admit that there have been increased duties placed upon them. Some of these are quite newly added and there has been a big extension in some of the old duties.  The work entailed by children's allowances, food vouchers, turf vouchers, wireless licences, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, army pensions and the Savings Bank is very extensive.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on the fact that he is going to deal as justly and as generously as our circumstances will permit with the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.</P>
      <P>Of course, apart from these duties, we must admit that the overhead charges have increased very much on sub-postmasters and postmistresses.  If it is a case of securing premises for the carrying on of this work, the cost is very much higher than it was previously. Rates also have been increased and the remuneration of assistants and many other factors have raised the overhead charges of these people.  We are very glad indeed that they are to benefit now by the Minister's intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" /> As regards pensions, I think that would be a very difficult problem to deal with.  A great number of these people enter the service late in life. If you bring them in at a reasonably early age and if you give them what would correspond to whole-time wages and secure them a pension, the only fair thing to do would be to have these posts filled by competitive examination. Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses throughout the country would be the last to thank the proposers of this motion for a suggestion of that sort.  The people who would pass such an examination would not be able to furnish the premises required for the conduct of the business.  The only alternative would be that the State would have to supply the premises in all cases.  The volume of business done at these offices would not, of course, warrant such action on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that there should be amalgamation of areas so as to give auxiliary postmen a larger wage.  The great majority of these men, as well as the great majority of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, take these positions as being a valuable auxiliary to their primary way of living.  If you amalgamate areas it means that you must get rid of a certain number and that is a thing we cannot contemplate with any degree of pleasure or approval.  Then, supposing you do carry through amalgamation in two or more districts, the area to be covered is so large that deliveries will be late.  If amalgamation were proposed, a great number of auxiliary postmen would not wait to be displaced.  If amalgamation were insisted upon you would see a great many resignations, and it is my opinion that hundreds of people who are employed as auxiliary postmen would simply refuse to carry on because the increased work would interfere with their main livelihood.</P>
    <P>I thought it really funny to see and to listen to Deputy Cafferky.  He made actual scenes in this House, which showed that he considered the very appointments that he is decrying here to-night to be very valuable appointments. Nothing else could explain the <Col N="1242" /> extraordinary ebullitions from that Deputy.  By the extraordinary scenes he created, he plainly indicated that he thought these were very valuable positions.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister is about to improve the circumstances of our sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses. They well deserve it.  But I cannot say that I think this motion was an honest motion.  I repeat that I believe there was a very large element of intelligent anticipation in it.  I am quite sure that the country will understand and appreciate that the Minister is doing this thing quite independently of this motion.</P>

I take this opportunity of thanking the Minister for the gentlemanly consideration he has given my various representations during the last two years with reference to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  I have always found the Minister most sympathetic and anxious to raise the status of these people.  His announcement to-night comes as no surprise to me because, long before this motion was tabled by the Clann na Talmhan Party, the Minister had been working on this question.  We welcome his statement to-night.  A number of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have represented to me that when it is possible again to have clocks installed in the post offices the Minister should favourably consider doing so. The post office clock is regarded as showing the correct time and would be a benefit to the people in the area as well as to the post office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> In every area there is a number of part-time postmen who take up those jobs as young men.  Possibly a number of them may have other occupations.  When they have served for 15 or 20 years and have given satisfactory service, if a permanent post should arise in the district, I do not see why they should not get favourable consideration.  The Minister explained to-night that they must have passed a Civil Service examination.  I would ask the Minister favourably to consider taking their long service into consideration.  If a man has given 15 or 20 years' service, he should get a permanent appointment if the opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>I want to draw your attention, Sir, to the latter part of the motion standing in my name and in that of Deputy Blowick.  The first part has been dealt with exhaustively by all the speakers.  I want to draw your attention to the fact that we want some consideration for the rural auxiliary postman.  They are a very deserving section of the community and are nobody's darling.  After years of hard work, requiring a great deal of physical effort and endurance and a high standard of honesty and efficiency, their services are dispensed with and they are thrown on the scrap-heap by the Government, at the age of 70.  Their only reward is the old age pension.  It is a very miserable and ungrateful way to treat men who have given such loyal and such long service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asking in this motion that they should be placed on the established list with a view to getting a pension and perhaps better remuneration than they have at present.  If there is some fundamental reason why that cannot be done, I would appeal to the Minister to consider the advisability and the equity of giving those men a retiring gratuity, something to cheer them up in their old age.  We find in the country that a number of them are worn out after long years of work, that they are dispirited and that many of them are in a bad way suffering from rheumatism.  They are now thrown on the scrap-heap with the old age pension of 10/- a week, and with no <Col N="1244" /> recognition from the State.  I strongly urge on the Minister that he should consider the advisability of getting a fund placed at his disposal which would enable him to give those men a retiring gratuity.  I hope that my request will be favourably considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the motion and believe that every consideration should be given to the claims made on behalf of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, especially in view of what we have heard from the Minister as regards the small income they receive for the responsible work they are doing. Great credit is due to them for the manner in which they have done that work over a long number of years. That I suggest is one of the main reasons why the Minister should do something immediately to improve their conditions.  If he does that it will enable those people to give better conditions to the assistants they employ.  In view of the small income they receive at present they are not able to pay their assistants a proper wage.  There is the danger that, if the assistant does not get a decent wage, he will not be able to resist temptation if it comes his way.  The assistant has to feed and clothe himself and must have enough money to enable him to make life worth living.  In all fairness the assistant in a sub-post office is entitled to a wage that will enable him to get some little enjoyment out of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the post office services generally, they are of the greatest importance to the people as a whole.  The messages that come to this country from all parts of the world are entrusted to the post office officials for delivery to the people.  The post men visit all areas of the country and are obliged to do so no matter what the weather conditions may be. In view of that, I think the time has come when all those people should get consideration from the Minister.  That may mean the expenditure of more money.  In my opinion these officials earn their money well, and if the proposal before us involves extra expenditure I do not believe that the people as a whole would object to it, if it means that the conditions for those under consideration <Col N="1245" /> are made more comfortable than they are to-day.  I think the people would agree that they should be paid fully for the work they do in the Post Office service.</P>
    <P>There was a great pressure of work in all these sub-post offices during the period of the emergency. There was a good deal of work in connection with the telephone service.  In addition to that, there is work in connection with the issue of dog licences, wireless licences, the issue of money orders for the Land Commission, the payment of old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and the children's allowances.  All that means that the sub-post office assistant has to work very long hours.  The working day is usually from 7.30 in the morning until 7 o'clock at night, but it very often happens in connection with the use of the public telephone that the assistant has to work until 10 o'clock at night.  For all these reasons, I support the motion and hope that the Minister will give it favourable consideration. I was glad to hear the Minister intimate that he is going to give consideration to the whole scheme of remuneration in these sub-postoffices. I believe it is his duty to do so. I would impress on him that he should take into consideration the amount of work that has to be done in them, and should be generous when he comes to make his decision.  The new rates should be such as to make those people feel that they are going to be repaid in some way for the services which they have given in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in the House for the Minister's statement on this very important motion, but I have been pleased to learn that he is prepared to reconsider the question of salary scales for the important officials referred to in the motion.  The Post Office service is really the most important that we have.  The officials in that service carry out their work with satisfaction to all the citizens.  These sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have, in my opinion, a very genuine grievance, and I welcome the opportunity which is being given to the House by Deputy Blowick's most reasonable motion to have those grievances discussed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> From my experience of the officials. I think they have a very genuine grievance, as Deputy Browne has pointed out. Most of those sub-post offices, as the Minister is aware, have to be opened in the morning at 6.30 and sometimes 6 o'clock.  The early opening is dependent upon the arrival of the mail. Where the mail arrives at 6 o'clock in the morning the post-master must be present to supervise the sorting of the mails.  That is his responsibility.  If anything goes wrong he is responsible for it.  Every sub-postmaster and sub-postmistress must be present at the sorting of the mails on the arrival of the mail bags at the post offices.  In most of the offices in my constituency the mails are sorted at 6.30 in the morning.  Throughout the day there is a continuous postal service.  At 6.30 in the evening, or sometimes 7 o'clock, when the post office officially closes down, somebody has to remain in charge of the public telephone until 10 o'clock at night.  I think that such continuous attendance is absolutely unjustifiable particularly at the very low rate at which these officials are paid. No Deputy and no taxpayer would object to an increase being given to these people.  Every year money is voted to the Minister's Department and nobody would object to an increase being given out of that fund to these people, who have a genuine grievance and who give good service even under present conditions.  In my opinion the Post Office gives better service than any other State Department.  I can say in all sincerity that the officials of that Department have at all times carried out their duties in a most efficient and capable manner.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were asked to give specific instances and figures as to the number of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses who have been dismissed from their employment during the past four years the number would be pretty high.  The main reason why these people have been dismissed is because they got into financial difficulties, and because they were in a position where they were handling public money and where they were paid at such a low rate that they were unable to resist the temptation to put public funds into their own pockets. <Col N="1247" /> The result is that they had to be dismissed, and quite rightly so.  But it must always be taken into consideration that the dismissal of these people is not entirely due to their succumbing to a temptation when they found themselve in adverse circumstances.  The blame really rests upon the Minister inasmuch as he permitted such a state of affairs to continue.  If these people were paid an adequate wage the temptation would not be there and they would not tamper with public funds.</P>
    <P>A tremendous amount of work has to be carried out by these sub-post offices. There they handle all the old age pensions on Friday.  There they have the unemployment assistance paid out over the post office counter.  There they have dog licences taken out over the counter, widows' and orphans' pensions, money orders, postal orders, wireless licences and so on.  It is absolutely essential that the work of the post offices should be carried out efficiently because of the importance and value of such work to the community as a whole; and because of the value and importance of the work done by the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses the Minister should ensure that these officials are paid adequately for their work.  He should deal with them as generously as he can.  The Post Office is the only link between the town and village throughout the country.  It is a wonderful organisation and, on the whole, the work of the Post Office is done exceedingly well by good and competent officials.</P>
    <P>With reference to the question of auxiliary postmen, I think it would be of great assistance if this whole matter were reconsidered now.  These postmen have given good and valuable service <Col N="1248" /> and they hold positions of responsibility and trust.  They are important servants of the State.  They should be recognised as State officials and they should be given adequate pension rights.  We have quite a large number of auxiliary postmen. Most of them are married men with families.  When the emergency arose and the call went forth for volunteers for the L.D.F., L.S.F., and Red Cross, there was an overwhelming response from the auxiliary postmen. They were quite prepared to give their services to the State when the country was threatened from outside.  I think they are worthy of very special consideration. The cost of living has gone up considerably and those men have a genuine grievance.  The increases given to them during the emergency were nothing like commensurate with the cost of living.  I think the Minister should give very favourable consideration now to their demands.  These postmen render service to every citizen in the State&mdash;traders, industrialists, business people, the State service itself and various others.  The industrial and commercial community is entirely dependent on the efficient service given by these men.  I think they deserve every support in their demand and they deserve all the cooperation they can get.  In a lot of the rural areas these men have not been provided with any protective clothing. I think the Minister should make an effort to provide all these postmen with uniforms and protective clothing. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> The area awaiting allotment varies from day to day and it is not practicable to supply up-to-date precise figures.  A considerable portion of the area awaiting disposal comprises residues of mountain, moor and turbary, difficult to allocate and carried forward statistically from year to year.  In every possible case the lands on hands are let for tillage and grazing pending final allocation.</P>
    <P>Part of the areas quoted in the table will be used for statutory purposes other than the relief of congestion, e.g., the provision of new holdings, sports fields, etc.  Definite segregation is not possible until allotment schemes are settled.</P>

      <P>As regards Question No. 4, I shall have to consider whether or not it would be suitable for it to be brought up on the Adjournment.  The Deputy seems to be advocating amending legislation, rather than eliciting any information.</P>
