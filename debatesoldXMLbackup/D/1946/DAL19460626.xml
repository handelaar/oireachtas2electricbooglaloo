      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether coroners are prohibited from using petrol in the discharge of their duties as coroners; if so, if he will state the reason for this prohibition; and if not, if he will state whether it is proposed to arrange a petrol allowance for coroners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no prohibition against the use of motor vehicles by coroners in the discharge of their duties and coroners who are the owners of such vehicles are in receipt of normal allowances appropriate to their vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why, when coroners have public duties to discharge, which may involve long journeys, they are asked to make use of the supply of petrol they get for private purposes to cover public duties? What is the difficulty of arranging for a special supply for coroners to cover public duties that they are called upon to perform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the circumstances require that there should be a special allocation to coroners for the purpose of carrying on their duties as coroners.  I think most coroners are either doctors or legal men, and in the enjoyment of special allowances as such.  There is no reason in my view for a special allowance for coroners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the position is <Col N="2422" /> that a doctor can get a special allowance for special work, or that a solicitor can get a special allowance for his work, surely there is a case for giving a man who is a coroner a special allowance for the particular type of travelling he has to do, arising out of the coroner's duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Doctors and solicitons have work to do every day, but fortunately coroners have not.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Coroners may have long distances to travel.  Will the Minister say why coroners should be specially picked out as a class of people with public duties to perform that is denied recognition granted to others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many classes of persons who would like special allowances but cannot get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not many classes who have to travel in connection with their public duties.  They get no recognition for such work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that coroners may have to make a journey involving a distance of 50 miles, and another 50 miles on the return, making a total of 100 miles? How could they do that on the ordinary allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why, if Deputies are, within certain limits, given more than the allowance to cover a journey to their constituencies and back, an allowance would not be extended to coroners for the performance of official duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are very few cases where coroners would require a special allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the collection of the agricultural statistics, acreage under crops and numbers of live stock, which is at the moment being made by the Garda enumerators.  The unit area of enumeration is the district electoral division of which there are 2,989, and the number of individual returns corresponds to the number of agricultural holdings which is approximately 383,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Tadhg Ó Murchadha Tadhg Ó Murchadha">
      <NameTxt>Tadhg Ó Murchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that nine men, residing in the Urban District of Midleton, County Cork, were sent, by the local Employment Exchange, on 22nd May, 1946, to work on a rural scheme, in respect of which a State grant is provided, and were offered payment at the rate of 36/- a week, which is practically 20/- a week less than the rate to which these men are normally entitled; that on refusing to accept the wages offered they were suspended from the receipt of unemployment benefit; whether the procedure was repeated in the case of nine other men on 29th May; and whether he will state if it is the policy of his Department to require unemployed men in urban areas to accept, in rural districts, rates of pay substantially less than the rates to which they are entitled in urban areas and to deprive them of unemployment benefit should they refuse to accept the lower rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question appears to refer to certain men residing in and near Midleton who <Col N="2424" /> refused to accept employment on a rural improvement scheme outside the boundary of Midleton on the 22nd April, the 29th April and the 7th May, 1946.  Eleven men refused to accept the employment and six others who started work left of their own accord after five days' work.  Of these 17 men, one was allowed unemployment assistance.  The remaining 16 were disallowed.  Five have not appealed; two were disallowed on appeal; six appeals are being reheard by the Court of Referees and three appeals are due for hearing immediately.</P>
      <P>When work is refused by unemployment assistance applicants each case is determined on its merits by the unemployment assistance officer, consideration being given to all the circumstances of the applicant, who may, if dissatisfied, require his case to be referred to the Court of Referees. Subject in certain circumstances to the further right to have the case referred to the umpire, the recommendation of the Court of Referees, if accepted by the unemployment assistance officer, determines the case.  I understand there is a possibility that the present case may be taken to the umpire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, in view of the frequent occurrence of accidents to horse-drawn traffic on tarred road margins in the county, he will direct that the county engineer for Kerry should arrange that, when the tarring of main roads is being carried out, a margin of four feet, on either side of the roads, shall be left untarred for use by horse traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>In all counties general responsibility for maintaining the roads in proper condition rests on the county council with a particular responsibility on the county engineer and his staff.  It is not my practice to interfere with these authorities in the proper discharge of their duties, unless I have reason to believe that they are in some way negligent or inefficient. I have no reason to believe <Col N="2425" /> that charges of this sort can be brought against the Kerry County Council as at present administered, or against the county engineer.  Accordingly I do not propose to interfere in regard to a matter with which they are fully competent to deal.</P>

      <P>Bread is baked in one prison only, viz., Mountjoy.  The production of a four-pound loaf is estimated to cost, for flour and other materials about 8¼d, and for fuel about 1d, making a total of about 9¼d.  The labour is mainly prison labour.  Any estimate of the cost in respect of overhead charges would be difficult to make and would be of no practical value.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £20,220 provided in this Vote represents two years' contributions to the League of Nations&mdash;£8,726 in respect of the year 1945 and £11,494 for the year 1946.  As I pointed out last year, this is the last time the Dáil will be asked to vote moneys in respect of our membership of the League of Nations.  As Deputies probably know, negotiations have been going on for some time between the League of Nations and the United Nations Organisation with a view to the transfer to the latter of the remaining assets, functions and activities of the former.  The assembly of the League of Nations was called at Geneva last April to discuss the proposals resulting from the negotiations, and, on 19th April, the League Assembly passed a resolution approving of the proposals made and bringing the existence of the league itself to an end.  The League Assembly set up a board of liquidation to carry out the transfer arrangements.  The contribution which the Dáil is now being asked to vote in respect of the year 1946 covers, therefore, the expenses of the League itself up to 19th April and the expenses of this board <Col N="2430" /> and of the remaining machinery of the league up to 1st August, 1946, or such other date as may be decided upon for the definite transfer to the United Nations Organisation.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need go into the details of the arrangements made between the League and the United Nations Organisation.  The relevant documents have been placed in the Library for the convenience of Deputies who wish to consult them.  Briefly, the position is that the assets of the League, including the buildings at Geneva, furniture, office equipment and so on, to a total value of some 45,000,000 Swiss francs, or £2,500,000, at the time of the meeting in April, will be taken over by the United Nations Organisation.  Each of the members of the League, to the number of 43 in all at the time of the meeting in April, will be credited with a share of the transfer value of the assets proportionate to the amount paid by that member in contributions to the League during the period of its membership.  In other words, we would be entitled to an amount which will bear the same relation to the sum of £2,500,000 which I have just mentioned as the amount we have paid in contributions to the League since 1923 bears to the total of the contributions paid to the League by the 43 States who still remained members of that body at the time of the meeting in April.  The amounts due to be refunded to individual members have not yet been determined by the board of liquidation and cannot be determined until all outstanding contributions and arrears due up to the end of 1946 have been paid.  In the event of the board of liquidation not having completed its work by the end of the present year, its continued existence will be provided for out of the various League funds which it has to dispose of, the credits of the surviving members of the League being abated <i>pro rata.</i></P>
    <P>The disappearance of the League of Nations brings to an end one of the or, perhaps, the greatest, experiment in international co-operation the world has ever known.  I think it may fairly be described as that.  It is rather the <Col N="2431" /> fashion nowadays to decry the League of Nations and to speak as if at no moment of its existence had it any hope of success.  I do not quite agree with that view.  I think that, up to 1931, the League might be said, on the whole, to have justified the hopes of its founders. At that time, its prestige was still intact and its influence was, I think, considerable. The League Covenant was still regarded as affording, or as capable of affording, a substantial guarantee of security to its members.</P>
    <P>The failure of the League to cope with the attack on China, however, dealt a fatal blow to the authority of the Covenant and to the general confidence of the nations in League methods and machinery.  It lessened whatever hopes of success the Disarmament Conference may otherwise have had and it encouraged other States in the belief that they could proceed without fear of having to reckon with the League as a serious factor.  The attack on Abyssinia showed that the belief was only too well-founded.  When all 50, or so, members of the League, led by three of the most powerful countries in the world, failed to protect the freedom and independence of one of the weakest of their members, it was clear that the guarantees contained in the League Covenant were a dead letter. The guarantees contained in the League Covenant and in the system of collective security, upon which the smaller States particularly had to rely, were at an end.  In this series of tragic events, which one after another followed the League, the League as such was unable to play any important part at all.  It was reduced to the role of a mere spectator of the terrible drama gradually unfolding itself around it. There would be no point in instituting an inquest on the League of Nations now that it has gone.  It would be well, however, that the lessons of the failure of the League should not be lost and the same mistakes repeated. There were great weaknesses and defects in the structure of the League and in the provisions of the League Covenant.  There were, for example, the association of the League with the 1919 Peace Treaties; the fact that membership <Col N="2432" /> of the League did not include all the great Powers; and there were significant gaps in the all-important security provisions of the Covenant.  It was not primarily by reason of these weaknesses and defects that the League of Nations failed.</P>
    <P>In spite of the unanimity rule, the non-membership of some of the great Powers and the serious defects in applying the security provisions of the Convenant it should have been quite possible, to my mind, to check the aggression in Manchuria and the later aggression in Abyssinia if only all the members of the League had a uniform resolution to put the machinery of collective security, which was available, in full operation.  It was because of that lack of resolution on the part of the individual members of the organisation and not primarily because of the weaknesses in the structure of the League itself, that the experiment made at Geneva failed. It is, perhaps, easier for small countries, especially if they are not close to the likely theatres of action, to be bold in such a case than it is for the great Powers on whom, if military action results, the brunt of the struggle will fall.  Making all due allowances for that, both as regards Manchuria and Abyssinia, it was the hesitant action of the great Powers that was directly responsible for the League's failure.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that we should realise the implications of this experience.  It would be a tragic mistake to think that, whatever was wrong with the League, could be set right merely by setting up now a new international organisation with a somewhat different drafting of the provisions of its fundamental charters.  There is something far deeper than that involved.  The League failed because the individuals and the Governments who were members of it were not prepared to fulfil the fundamental obligation, which any system of world organisation for peace and security must involve.  They were not ready to face war and to wage war in order to prevent war.  They did not accept in their own minds the essential idea that, if one of their <Col N="2433" /> members became a victim of armed aggression, then each of the others, even if their own national territory were untouched and even if the aggressive State was a friend, must be prepared to go to war in defence of the State attacked with the same energy as if they themselves were invaded.  Unless that fundamental idea is grasped and accepted as a principle by every nation, big and small, no international security organisation, whatever its structure and covenant, will succeed.  If that principle is fully grasped, however, a true foundation is laid and success is possible.  I am afraid we are still far removed from that desirable position.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in his statement suggests&mdash;and I am sure we all agree with him&mdash;that there are some things which we can learn from the history of the passing of the League of Nations.  At the same time I cannot hear his review on his Estimate, particularly upon the lines on which he has gone, without looking a bit into the future as well as to the past.  Looking to the past, in the first instance, and recalling the position which this country occupied in the League of Nations, and the weaknesses which the country showed in serving the League, induces me now to make a few comments for the purpose of referring specifically to the future.  When we look back to the position in which this State stood in the Council of the League of Nations and when we remember the men whom we sent there-Kevin O'Higgins, Deputy John A. Costello, Deputy Patrick McGilligan, Doctor John Marcus O'Sullivan and Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald&mdash;we find men who made their mark in the international councils in which it was their privilege to take part as representatives of this country.  Looking back we see the contacts that they made, particularly with the smaller nations like ourselves, and the impression that they made upon them and the position which their work there gave to this country&mdash;a position whereby the Taoiseach, when he became head of the Government here, was enabled to preside over the Council of the League of Nations in his first year of office. <Col N="2434" /> I cannot help feeling that if we had sat in the Council of the League of Nations under better home auspices, even though a small country, we might have served the world through the medium of the League of Nations in a more effective way than the way in which we did serve it.  We entered the League of Nations at a time when a very considerable section of our people, through a political voice, were calling on the League of Nations not to recognise the puppet State that was then the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>We are discussing the failure of the League of Nations and I feel at liberty to mention the facts for the purpose of discussing and reviewing the past in order that we may thereby avoid in the future the mistakes that were made.  If we are going to review the failures of other countries in the past, to try to learn something from them and thereby screw up our courage and our convictions to face the future with resolution, with confidence, and with strength I do not think we should be afraid to look at our own mistakes or examine into our own weaknesses.  I merely stated facts.  If we had had our representatives-either the men I have mentioned, or others&mdash;sitting in the League of Nations and representative of a young, unified and vigorous new State, with a fresh outlook on the world and without the weaknesses which we then had at home, our eyes would have been clearer and our voices would have been heard to better advantage; and we would have been in a much stronger position to take advantage of the contacts we made with older nations.  We might in our contacts with them, and with our own clearer eyes and our own fresh enthusiasm, speaking out into the world, have given to the people a clearer vision and a greater heart to face the difficulties of which the Taoiseach has spoken and which when they arose, were not properly dealt with.  A clear eye and a clear voice among the unified small nations in the League of Nations might have caused the League of Nations as a whole to take sharper and clearer decisions than <Col N="2435" /> were taken.  We can blame ourselves too much.  When we look around the world and see what older and bigger States have been led to by their mistakes we cannot blame ourselves for any weaknesses that might have been brought into the League of Nations through differences or disruptions at home.  When we look to countries like the United States that stood aside from the troubles of those particular times and which could have brought much more influence to bear upon the avoidance of these mistakes, I say we have nothing very much to blame ourselves about.  But I think we could prepare ourselves a bit for the future by looking back and contemplating in a very detached way how better we could be and how stronger we could be abroad and how much more useful we might have been in the counsels in the past if on external matters we had been unified and strong and frank in our discussions with one another here at home.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that one of the reasons why the League of Nations failed was that the statesmen from the various countries were not prepared to discuss openly and accept frankly the obligations that international co-operation dictated.  If we could learn from their mistakes to discuss openly and frankly the problems and the difficulties and the advantages that are involved for us in partaking in international affairs, and if we could have a single outlook on foreign policy both in relation to economics and politics, then we, at any rate, would face the future without some of the weaknesses that we had in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, or whether there are divisions here about it or not, we are going to take our place in the counsels of the nations abroad.  We are going to have our responsibilities and our opportunities. I think it would strengthen us if, presuming we do not want to look to our own mistakes and differences in the past, we would look at the weaknesses and difficulties of the other nations in the League of Nations, because they did not face things frankly and openly with a clear open discussion.  If we could learn from their mistakes without <Col N="2436" /> minding about our own, we would get an acceptance of the fact in this House that there ought to be a clear and unified outlook in foreign policy in this country both with regard to our political relations with the countries outside and our economic connections with them.  I just plead in passing this Vote for a full and frank and open discussion in this House on every matter concerned with the political and economic side of our external affairs.</P>

      <P>Then the Taoiseach might have treated this Vote in the way in which the Minister for Finance treated his Vote last night.  I thought at first he was going to do that, but I am very glad that he did not.  I do not think that it would outrage the rules of order or do this institution or country any harm if in passing the final Vote for the League of Nations we could discuss why it failed, see in what way it failed, and whether we have any lesson to learn both from the workings of the various countries which have been involved and from the institution itself and whether we can get any advantage at this late hour of the day for the money we spent on it willingly and generously and in direct faith.  We are now passing what will be the last moneys we will grant for this body. While we are saying good-bye to the League of Nations, surely we are not facing the new world with the feeling that nothing is going to take its place. Institutions are being built up with toil and tribulation at the present time; institutions to replace it are going to arise with greater courage and greater clearness of vision than was shown by the League of Nations because of its particular circumstances.  To-day we see the greatest countries in the world working very hard to reconcile their differences or to build up confidence in one another in order to face the future in some kind of organisation such as the League of Nations was, with better machinery, more hope and more courage.  We are likely to be in that organisation some day and I, for one, would like to carry to the discussion of <Col N="2437" /> our possible entry into that organisation some day some memory of what was wrong with the League of Nations and, particularly, what was wrong with us that we could not influence its proper direction in a greater measure and in a better way than we did.  We cannot say that we misled it in any way or withheld any assistance that we could have given, but there was a strength that we could have had that we had not there.  I sincerely hope that in some way or another, through discussions in this House and the atmosphere in which the discussions will take place, we will be able to bring to a new international body a strength that, because of internal differences with regard to external policy, we had not in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one comment on this Vote.  I am induced to make it by the Taoiseach's references to what he described as the failure of the League of Nations because of its inability to face up to the Japanese aggression in the East and the Italian-Fascist aggression in Abyssinia.  It is true, of course, that these two issues undermined the authority of the League of Nations and gave rise to its ineffectiveness.  But when we talk about Abyssinia and the League of Nations failure in regard to Abyssinia, we ought to talk about it in sackcloth and ashes.  We ought to talk about it with bowed heads, because there was probably no small nation in the world with a history such as ours which displayed such cowardice and such a want of courage and a want of adherence to vital principles as we displayed when that unfortunate nation went down under the military might of a Fascist Italy.  That was the time, of course, when the swashbuckling rapscallion, who made the world richer by his enforced and inglorious exit from it, was in command of the forces in Italy and when that gentleman saw fit to divert the Italian military forces into that devastating attack on a helpless and defenceless nation, fighting for its right to live its own life in its own way.  When, by the use of the Italian military machine, by bombing planes and poison gas, the dictator of Italy <Col N="2438" /> had succeeded in subjecting that small nation with which our sympathies should have abided, the best sympathy that we could display for Abyssinia after it had fought for the maintenance of its independence was to recognise the puppet-controlled King of Italy as the Emperor of Abyssinia. That conquest was made possible only by the use of limitless military power against Abyssinia.  It was achieved by the use, for the first time in many years, of poison gas against a people who were not even equipped in small arms. That was the measure of our sympathy with that small and struggling nation. However, thanks to other Powers, Abyssinia to-day enjoys that liberty the subjugation of which we apparently sympathised with when we recognised the King of Italy as Emperor of Abyssinia. Abyssinia has lived in spite of us.  Its people now enjoy a measure of liberty in the suppression of which we took an all too-hasty glory.  Those who despoiled Abyssinia then have left the world just evil memories.  I do not think our contribution to the Italian Aggression in Abyssinia is one of which we can ever be proud.  For a nation such as this, which endured such persecution at the hands of a powerful neighbour, it seems to me to have been a shameless performance that we should have recognised, with such indecent haste, the Italian suppression of that independent Ethiopian State.  If the authority of the League of Nations was undermined because of its failure to face up to its responsibility when a small and helpless nation had its liberties threatened, let us not forget that we, a small nation and at one time a helpless and defenceless nation, did not display on that occasion the courage which, with our background and traditions, we ought to have displayed when a small sister nation was in difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that these things have undermined the authority of the League of Nations and we can only hope that in the effort now being made to build a new world organisation the pitfalls into which the league fell, and which ultimately brought about its downfall, will be avoided by those who want to build for the world a comprehensive instrument for the maintenance of peace, <Col N="2439" /> free from the machinations and intrigues which unfortunately undermined the League's power and influence. I hope that in that new world organisation small countries at all events will not repeat the miserable performance which they gave in relation to Abyssinia and recognise conquest simply because it is easier to be friendly with a large Power than to be friendly with a beaten small one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at present discussing a sum of money for the League of Nations, the last that we will be called on to vote to this particular body.  Looking back over the work it has done and the ground it has covered, we must admit that it has failed as a world organisation to prevent aggression.  The reason is obvious.  Two instances have been cited by the two previous speakers-the aggression by Japan and Italy.  I cannot see that there can be any machinery in peace time, within such a body as the League of Nations, to prevent aggression when the aggressor is one of the first world Powers.  As a result of the last world conflict, the world is practically dominated by four Powers&mdash;Britain, America, Russia and China.  Other nations that were moving into a position of first class importance have vanished.  Great nations cannot make war on one another without dragging in the whole world.  In the case of Japan against China, what country was prepared to go to war?  The members of the League of Nations were prepared to stand idly by and see their authority blasted away.  Later there was another bitter test, when Italy invaded Abyssinia.  Again the League was prepared to stand idly by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, as a small nation, should endeavour to organise the small nations of the world.  In that way we would contribute much more benefit to the world.  Small nations will stand shoulder to shoulder, even if it were only in the matter of sanctions. When great and small nations are organised in one body I do not see that any useful purpose is served.  The League of Nations is being wound up. Another League is taking its place, <Col N="2440" /> the United Nations Organisation.  I would ask the Taoiseach when he is concluding to let us know is it intended that this country should become a member of that Organisation or what is to be our position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>I think it would not be out of place on this Vote because the United Nations Organisation is the successor to the League.  I could not be present when the Vote for External Affairs was being taken and the official report is not yet available.  Therefore, I think it is not out of place to ask the Taoiseach, when replying, to say whether we will become a member of it or intend to stay clear of it.  I can not see that the United Nations Organisation can succeed where the League of Nations has failed.  Nations will return to their former pitch of enthusiasm and, after they have rested, aggression will once again appear in the world.  I do not see that the new organisation, composed of the big and small nations, can do any good.  If the small nations banded themselves together they could impose their will on the world to a greater extent than they could in an organisation that is composed of nations great and small.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have any objection to find with the speech made by the Taoiseach it is that he thought it desirable to confine himself in the first place to the narrow question of the League of Nations and made no reference whatever to some of the very important subsidiary bodies of that organisation, and also, that the Taoiseach confined his remarks to the past and gave no indication whatever as to the Government's mind, if they have any mind, in relation to future international affairs or in relation to any existing international organisation or organisations that may be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One realises, of course, that at a period like this the head of a Government has to be extremely careful in any utterance he may make in relation to international affairs and one does not expect the Taoiseach at this stage to give a complete outline of what our <Col N="2441" /> position will be in the future and what decisions, if any, have been taken by the Government on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that we are passing over in this Vote a substantial credit for the setting-up of a new organisation, and may I bring myself strictly within the rules of order by asking how we propose to utilise our share of that credit, whether we propose to utilise it at all, whether we propose to do it in the immediate future, or whether it is our intention to wait and allow things to develop in the hope that the international position may become a little clearer?</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Taoiseach whether we are taking, or propose to take, any steps to continue what I think was valuable work done by a fairly important organisation associated with the League of Nations, namely, the International Labour Office.  What machinery, if any, is being set up to replace that organisation? Will we continue our association with whatever has been substituted for the International Labour Office, and will we take as keen an interest in the work of that office as we did in the past?  I have always regarded the International Labour Office as a very important organisation. I think its work in the future will be perhaps of greater importance than in the past.</P>
      <P>Am I correct in saying that I saw recently in the Press a statement made by the Chairman of the Economic and Social Committee of U.N.O. that all neutral countries had been invited to send representatives to that body?  I am sure I saw that some time ago.  However, the Taoiseach will tell us whether or not it is true.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is much use nowadays in talking about the past of the League of Nations.  I do not subscribe to the view that it was entirely valueless and that it gave no service. I believe the League of Nations, while unfortunately it failed for reasons set forth by various speakers, in its own way did a certain amount of good work. It proved valuable from our point of view in that it provided a platform upon which we were able to establish that we were a free and independent nation and that we were able to take our place on equal terms with the free nations of the earth.  If it were only for that, anything we have contributed to the League of Nations over the past 23 years was money well spent.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to say, particularly in these days when there is so much confusion, not only in the minds of the people of the country, but even in the minds of members of this House as to our international status, that from the time this House was established, from 1923 onwards, when we were first represented as a free nation at that international assembly of free nations, our status was recognised very fully, without any restriction or reservation. As Deputy Mulcahy has said, we were so effectively represented there over a period of ten years that the first year the Taoiseach attended as head of the Irish Government, there was conferred on him, as a result of the ten years' good work done by his predecessors, the distinction of being made President of the Assembly of the League of Nations.  That was something.</P>

      <P>It is like discussing &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; without the ghost to discuss the end of the League of Nations without touching somewhat on the organisation which it is hoped will take its place.  I do not regard the League of Nations as having been a failure.  I think it is a glorious idea and ideal.  It is an ideal that has existed in the minds of men for many centuries.  It cropped up from time to time during the Middle Ages.  I think Alexander of Russia had some idea about a League of Nations after the Napoleonic Wars.  It has always been a great ideal, but it failed, as many organisations will fail, because of the jealousy and greed of States.  Whilst it is useless to go into the past of Manchuria and Abyssinia, in neither case have we in this country any particular cause for self-congratulation; but still, we did not ally ourselves with any aggressor nations in any shape or form during those days.  Whilst we may have played an innocuous part, we did not do any harm, and I think, on occasions, our contribution to the League of Nations was worthy of the best ideals of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One speaker from the Farmers' Party mentioned that the organising of small nations into a band was desirable.  I agree if the small nations organised themselves on the moral and spiritual plane, but on any other plane their contribution would seem useless, and possibly harmful, because ten small nations would not equal the productive capacity of one Krupps armament factory and 50 small nations would not equal the production of one atomic bomb. These facts are at the root of small nations organising or not organising, and, in my opinion, their contribution along those lines would be very slight. Where small nations have a contribution to make&mdash;and they have proved it again and again in the past&mdash;is on the moral and spiritual plane, perhaps, for the reason that owing to the smallness of their area, they can have no territorial ambitions.  Perhaps it is <Col N="2444" /> because of that, rather than any merit, which may lie in the make-up of small nations, the fact remains that small nations are on occasion in a position to speak from their hearts on international affairs, when bigger nations, actuated by motives of self-interest or tied up in alliances are not, and thereby take up an attitude which is not straightforward or just.</P>
    <P>A small nation which is prepared fearlessly to speak out its mind can make a contribution to world affairs far in excess of its importance, judged from the material point of view.  For that reason I am very sorry that that great ideal, the League of Nations, and the very fine platform it was on occasions, from which to put forward moral ideas, have disappeared.  I hope that mankind will create out of the present difficulties in which the world finds itself a League of Nations.  It does not matter what it is called, whether it is U.N.O. or League of Nations.  It is what it does, and what it tries to do is of importance.</P>
    <P>I should like the Taoiseach to speak about the present, and also in that connection to cast his mind into the future, because the disappearance of the League of Nations has left a vacuum as far as this country is concerned. It is very difficult for an ordinary Deputy or the ordinary man-in-the-street to follow the complicated ramifications of international affairs of to-day.  They are extremely tortuous and difficult, and it is hard to know how far this country can ally itself to a world organisation.  Personally I should be very happy to see this country going forward to join brother nations, and to make its contribution to a settlement of the terrible difficulty in which the world is.  I know that from a certain point of view that may not be very wise, and that the Government has to watch very carefully before it goes into such an organisation.  Sometimes matters of national prestige are bound up in such a decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to a statement made by some member of United Nations Organisation.  I think I remember the statement referred to, and that it was made by a chairman or director of the food section of the <Col N="2445" /> United Nations Organisation.  Personally I would be very happy to see this country going forward and making its contribution in that field.  I would join with others in pressing that the Taoiseach would give us some information as to what lies ahead of this country in the realm of international affairs.  What place is it prepared to take in the successor to the League of Nations?  The League was a failure, but it was a great ideal and mankind will, in its own interest, press again for the establishment of that ideal.  I would like to see modern Ireland taking its place in that organisation, doing its part, and living its life in the full stream of world affairs.</P>

      <P>This Vote is not so much a contribution towards the League of Nations as to the funeral expenses of that body.  It is rather a melancholy task to have to inter the remains of a body that was established with such high hopes, a body in which this nation was permitted to play its part, and did play its part honourably.  I am inclined to agree with the Taoiseach that it does not serve any great purpose to-day to hold an inquest upon the late League of Nations.  But there were some considerations which were referred to by the Taoiseach which require to be commented upon.  The Taoiseach stated that the fundamental failure of the League of Nations was the fact that nations were reluctant to go to war in order to prevent war. There is nobody who will not recognise the natural reluctance of a democratically governed nation to go to war for any purpose, even to prevent war.  It was that natural reluctance of nations that are governed by democratic institutions to make the sacrifices required that led to the downfall of the League of Nations.  It is, therefore, essential that public opinion in every nation be made aware of the real cause of the downfall of the League of Nations.  If we accept the Taoiseach's view, that nations must get over this reluctance to go to war in order to prevent war, we, as a small nation, must accept a tremendous responsibility when we accept a line of policy which may compel us in the future to make terrible decisions, the terrible <Col N="2446" /> decision, perhaps, to take part in a world war in which our country is not directly interested but which is being fought by a world organisation in order to prevent aggression.  That is a very serious and terrible responsibility for any nation to have to take.  It is, perhaps, particularly serious and terrible for a small nation to have to take such a decision, particularly a small nation which has no empire and no big external interests to defend.  That remark of the Taoiseach is one upon which the House and the nation will have to reflect very seriously in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton was very strong and very emphatic in denouncing a certain swashbuckling rapscallion who is now deceased.  It is easy to be severe and to condemn a swashbuckling rapscallion when he is lying in his grave, or, rather, when he has been laid in his grave, but we must remember that there are swashbuckling rapscallions who are still alive, and very much alive, and it would be interesting to know if Deputy Norton is prepared to stand up to these people and these nations as resolutely as he would apparently have been prepared to stand up to Italy ten years ago.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick, the leader of this Party, referred to the desirability of a closer union between the small nations and to the desirability of this country promoting that closer union. There is no doubt whatever that world organisation for the preservation of peace is much more important to the small nation than to the great nation. It is the small nations which have most to suffer by aggression.  We know how many small nations were wiped out of existence, or had their independence completely destroyed, over the past ten years, and we know how many small nations not only live under the threat of aggression but languish under the jack-boot of complete subjugation, and if our nation, through any world organisation which may be set up to succeed the League of Nations, can contribute towards promoting more effective unity amongst the small nations, it will be a big contribution towards world peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2447" /> We must also bear in mind the fact that our nation occupies a unique position in the world to-day, inasmuch as we can contribute very greatly towards a better understanding between the great English-speaking nations of the earth, particularly the British Commonwealth of Nations and the United States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I was just getting back to the League of Nations. The late lamented League of Nations owes a large portion of its failure to the fact that the United States found themselves unable to take part in that world organisation, and I think that, indirectly, our little country contributed something to the position which arose at that time.  It was the failure of Great Britain to do immediate justice to our country, after the 1914-1918 war, which contributed in a large measure to the misunderstanding and disunity which arose between Great Britain and America and thus contributed to the failure of the League of Nations.  It is possible that in the future our little nation may play an important part in building up a better organisation to succeed the League of Nations which we are now laying to rest.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach was making his statement, I gathered from him that this Vote covers a period of two years and that the purpose was to bring the accounts, so far as this country is concerned, up to date, in relation to the liquidation committee in respect of the League's assets.  Do I understand that the credits which fall to the member nations are intended to be honoured in the new organisation, and, if this country does not go into the new organisation, what becomes of those credits, so far as this country is concerned? Again, are the amounts either large or small, and when will it be possible to ascertain what they may be?  Why do we at this stage feel bound to pay these contributions up to August, 1946, seeing that the League of Nations has served no purpose, so far as this country is <Col N="2448" /> concerned, for a considerable time? Is it that we feel we are bound to do so from the point of view of fulfilling an honourable obligation, or is it that we are merely proceeding on the basis of the stipulation that the assets will be divided amongst the member nations in relation to their contributions? Is the Taoiseach in a position to say if all the member nations have brought their contributions up to date in the same way as we now propose to brings ours up to date?</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy seemed to think that our influence abroad, particularly in the League of Nations, would have been enhanced if there was a greater degree of unity here.  In my experience, anyhow, that was not so.  All that was required outside was that the Government represented the country,as it did, and that it was clear that, on each question which arose, we were taking an independent attitude, that we were not, so to speak, adopting some &ldquo;block&rdquo; idea. Such respect as we were able to acquire in Geneva was largely due to the fact that on every question that arose we were able to express our own views independently, and that it was known that these were our own views. I think it is something of a dream to hope that we will ever have in international, any more than in national, affairs complete unanimity.  I do not think it is possible to achieve unanimity anywhere in the world in that way. The old proverb is &ldquo;many men, many minds&rdquo; and human beings, for a variety of reasons, do not look upon any particular question in quite the same way.  All we can hope for here is that we shall have a Government representative of the nation and that, in so far as that Government speaks, it will be regarded as representing the nation and speaking for the nation.  I will admit that it is desirable in domestic, as well as in external affairs, to have as great a degree of unanimity as is possible.  As I have pointed out, however, such unanimity is limited.  I cannot help thinking now of a criticism which was made recently when it was said that one of the complaints at the present time was that we had a one <Col N="2449" /> party Government, or something like that, because there was such a degree of unanimity in certain respects.  Now we cannot have it every way.  We are organised on a democratic basis here and we will naturally have variations of opinion.  All that we can hope for is that when the Government speaks it will speak for the nation and will be recognised as speaking for the nation. Whatever commitments are entered into by the Government as representing the nation, all we can hope for is that such commitments will be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke about our attitude towards Abyssinia.  Anybody listening here this evening would have thought that, in some way or other, we had been guilty of a very grave lapse in regard to Abyssinia.  The truth is that, whatever action was proposed by the League in the defence of Abyssinia, we were strongly in favour of it.  I remember speaking from this side of the House here and I remember warning the people that, even though we were friendly with the Italians, our commitments under the League might compel us to take very drastic measures, in so far as we were able to take such, against Italy.  The matter to which the Deputy referred was the fact that we were sending a representative to Italy at a particular time when a situation had arisen in which there was no question of giving back to Abyssinia its freedom.  It was a question of recognising a fact which every other nation recognised.  It was a question: Were we to stand out?  Were we to refuse to send a representative to Italy?  If we sent a representative to Italy we had to recognise and accept the title which had been assumed by the head of the Italian State.  Nobody listening to Deputy Norton here this evening would have thought that that was the position.  We were perhaps one of the strongest, in so far as we could do anything, to bring about combined action to defend Abyssinia; any action which we could take we did take, and anything which we could do we did.  We could not stand aside and say: &ldquo;We will have no relations whatever with a State that has done wrong.&rdquo;  That is a position which no State in the <Col N="2450" /> world can take up; <i>de facto</i> recognition of an accomplished fact is the only practical line of conduct for all States.</P>
    <P>I remember coming up against that when I was in the United States on one occasion, pleading the cause of this country.  A certain line of conduct was recognised there as being the only practical policy and that line of conduct was adopted by successive secretaries of state in the United States.  At this particular period we were sending a Minister to Italy.  The question was were we to refuse to send a Minister and were we to refuse to adopt a line of policy which was being adopted by every other State?</P>
    <P>The important thing in any international organisation is the readiness of the constituent States in that organisation to wage war in order to prevent war.  That is the fundamental principle.  I saw that in the case of Abyssinia.  I saw it happening in the case of the small States bordering on Italy at that time.  It is only when the constituent States make up their minds in advance that, come what may, if one of the members breaks the law, the remainder will combine against her.  If there is any mental reservation the principle will fail.  It must be remembered, as was pointed out by one of the Deputies here to-day, that that is an extremely difficult principle to follow-to undertake in advance that, if a decision is given by the appropriate organisation against a State, the others will combine to wage war against that State.  That is an extremely difficult decision for any nation to take in advance and it is particularly difficult in the case of small nations.  Suppose that tomorrow Great Britain was held to be an aggressor and that we, as part of a world organisation, were compelled to go to war against her we should find the fundamental application of that principle extremely difficult because of our proximity to Great Britain.  That is always the difficulty in the case of small States bordering upon larger ones.  I merely take Great Britain as an example to bring the position forcibly before our minds.  The same applies to Belgium.  At the time of the Italian aggression in Abyssinia you <Col N="2451" /> had a number of small States bordering on Italy.  Are such small States to be compelled to combine together and go to war, even though they themselves may be overwhelmed immediately and before anybody can come to their assistance?  That is the fundamental principle.  If the nations of the world really want to enter into a security organisation they must settle that question for themselves at the very outset.  Are they prepared to face that situation?  The only consideration which will make them face that possibility in the long run is the fact that, by doing so, they will prevent aggression altogether in the future and will bring about a general state of security.  Every State naturally wants to be very, very sure that such an organisation is going to work and that they will not be left in the lurch if such a situation arises. They must have full confidence that every State will do its duty in a case like that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the League of Nations, we do know that there were States which were more or less left in the lurch.  In the new world organisation which will be built up, we would naturally all like to play a part in such a system of collective security, particularly if it promises anything like success.  Small States have very much more to get through a security organisation than large ones.  The large ones are very often sufficiently strong to be able to protect themselves. It is the small States that run the big risk.  Therefore a system of law which would be obeyed is their greatest security and safeguard.  They should, therefore, naturally desire to be part of any such security system.  I think I have already indicated that that would be our desire.  At the same time, I pointed out to those who asked me questions about the matter that I did not think the time had come yet to take the very important decisions that would have to be taken if we were to enter into the new organisation. Very important decisions would have to be taken and could only be taken after a great deal of study and examination and a consideration as to <Col N="2452" /> whether in fact we could carry out all the obligations that were involved. However, as I said, we are losing nothing, at the present time anyhow, by the delay which has occurred.  This will become a ripe question for us when the peace treaties are signed and not till then.  I think that is, in the main, the attitude which has been taken by the other neutral States.  I do not think any of the neutral States has applied for membership.  As you know, you have to apply for membership, then you have to get the support of the Security Council, and then you have to get, I think it is, a two-thirds majority in the Assembly.  Therefore it is not an easy thing.  I mean that when you apply you cannot foresee whether you will be accepted or not. But, even if there were no barrier whatsoever to our getting into the organisation at the moment, I think that we ought to take out time about it.  There are very serious obligations involved.</P>
    <P>My own view is that the present organisation does not appear as satisfactory from the point of view of the small nations as the old League of Nations was.  However, we have not had the settling of that.  Inasmuch as it is the large Powers which will have, in the main, to supply the force which is necessary to support the rule of law, it is not unnatural that the large nations should claim considerable power in what they regard as certain vital matters, but I think that could be secured by an arrangement somewhat better than the present one.  However, I do not think there will be anything gained by my discussing changes and improvements in the existing organisation. I think I have made it clear that our general desire would be to form part of a security organisation and that the very serious question of whether we should or should not apply will come up for consideration probably when the peace treaties have been signed and a peace situation has been reached.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked about the I.L.O.  At the moment it is independent. It used to be attached, in a certain sense, to the League of Nations. Negotiations, however, are taking place with a view to linking it up with the United Nations Organisation.</P>

      <P>Recently the agricultural organisation has been wound up in Italy and there is a certain carry-over to the F.A.O.  We probably will apply for membership of that. We have not refused membership of any of these.  In fact, our whole disposition naturally is to enter into international combinations of that sort provided the obligations are of a kind to which we can conscientiously subscribe and which we believe we will conscientiously carry out.  The danger of all these organisations has been shown by history.  You had confederations of various States and they were generally defeated by being attacked in detail.  There is a confederation and a strong Power attacks it by getting after one of the members. Those not immediately attacked, fearing they would be attacked, will not rush to the assistance of the one attacked.  That is the danger to be apprehended in any such organisation, because human nature in similar cases always shows itself in the same light. Apparently only a fraction of human beings are able to look towards the ultimate good and say: &ldquo;The ultimate good being such, we will work for that even though there seems to be an evil at the moment which has to be encountered in order to work out to <Col N="2454" /> that ultimate good&rdquo;.  In the federations which have taken place in history what happened is that one of the group was attacked and the others did not come to its aid when their assistance would be of value, because at the moment they were better off apparently by not doing so.  There were risks and hardships which they thought they would avoid by keeping out of it.  But their turn ultimately came and the process of defeating them in detail worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked about this money which we are voting.  We have been all the time late with our subscriptions. This is for the year 1946. As long as we were members these are honourable payments due.  We kept on as a member of the League of Nations to the end.  These payments are due as part of the contribution we are obliged to make.  We are being credited, however, with a proportion of the remaining assets of £2,500,000 which will be determined by the ratio of our total subscriptions to the total subscriptions of the other 43 nations who were members of the League like ourselves.  Therefore, we will be entitled to a certain sum.  I could not say what fraction it will be.  It would be determined easily enough, I think, because it would be possible to get the total contributions of the others and to determine what fraction ours would be.  That fraction will be made available to us in cash if we want it that way or as a contribution, if it is thought desirable, to a new organisation. I cannot say whether the amount we will get will or will not be greater than any of the sums that we are paying here, the £11,000 or the other.  But we will have no choice.  If we want to pay up as a member of the League to the end we have to make this payment. I do not think there is any other question that I have not answered.  I do not want to go into the future further than I have indicated. I hope the Deputies will be satisfied with the general indication that we would like to, but there are very serious obligations to be undertaken. If we do propose it, that will be considered by the Dáil in due course.  The arguments pro and con will no doubt <Col N="2455" /> all be put forward here and the time for doing that has not just come yet.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Costello I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 41, after the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; to add the following words &ldquo;but does not include an oral direction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That would mean that the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary instrument&rdquo; would read like this&mdash;&ldquo;the expression `subsidiary instrument' means an order or regulation made (whether before or after the passing of this Act) under power conferred by a Government Order but does not include an oral direction&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Costello put his amendment down to the wrong part of the section.  I assume that what he meant to secure was that the expression &ldquo;direction&rdquo; should not be taken as including an oral direction.  I have examined the matter and agree that it will be necessary to make an amendment in Section 9 of the Bill, which provides that every Order, subsidiary instrument and direction shall be judicially noticed, to exclude oral directions which clearly could not be judicially noticed but I could not agree to exclude oral directions entirely from the definition.</P>
      <P>The best illustration I can give of the need for retaining the power of oral direction is the entry of an inspector of the Department of Industry and Commerce into the premises of a shopkeeper to check the stocks of rationed commodities and the observance of rationing regulations.  The inspector would give an oral direction to the shopkeeper to produce the records and books necessary to enable him to carry out his investigations.  We could not exclude altogether, therefore, the power of giving oral directions and on that account the amendment would have to be resisted.  If Deputy Costello's aim was to ensure that an oral direction would not have the judicial notice provided for in Section 9 of the Bill, then I agree it is necessary, because clearly oral direction could not be judicially noticed.</P>

      <P>It was found by experience that this power of giving oral direction is necessary.  It frequently is necessary for the inspector to act quickly where there is evidence of black-marketing, say the accumulation of stocks which are obviously not required in the course of the normal trade of the trader concerned.  The inspector in such circumstances would give an oral direction not to move the goods until the position could be further inquired into and if it was necessary to get a formal, signed and stamped Ministerial Order before that could be done, clearly, the goods would have disappeared long before the Order could have been delivered.</P>

      <P>I move the second amendment that has been circulated in typescript:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment mainly. The Bill provides for the continuation of compulsory tillage Orders.  A separate Order is made every year but clearly the circumstances are such that it will be necessary to make a compulsory tillage Order for next year also.  Such Order must be made under the provisions of this Bill and it is not quite clear that the wording of subparagraph (d) gives power to enter and <Col N="2459" /> take possession of unoccupied holdings. That power is exercised under the existing Order made under the Emergency Powers Act.  While it may be possible to argue that the section as worded gives that power, it is better to have the matter beyond doubt and the effect of this amendment is to make it clear that an Order made under this section in relation to compulsory tillage can give power to enter on and take possession of unoccupied buildings.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise the removal of the limitation in Section 7 (6) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (6) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, provides that it shall not be lawful to appoint more than one Parliamentary Secretary to any Minister.  That section was removed from being operative by an Emergency Order.  On 3rd April this year, speaking in the Seanad, the Taoiseach discussed the position with regard to Parliamentary Secretaries. In column 1245 he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it is right that I should point out what, perhaps, some may not realise, that there is a considerable difference between a Parliamentary Secretary and a Minister in matters of this kind.  My opinion is that generally it is not a good practice <Col N="2460" /> to delegate, as we have done in the matter of public health, to a Parliamentary Secretary powers which almost take him outside the supervision of the Minister.  When you do this the Government, as a whole, which has collective responsibility, has no way immediately of dealing with the Parliamentary Secretary. The Parliamentary Secretary is outside: he has, in a sense, a greater amount of liberty in a situation like that than the Minister.  The Minister has to share the collective responsibility and is immediately responsible to the Government.  He has to meet direct criticism which he would not probably hear if he were not coming to the Government meetings.</P>
    <P>It is not desirable that this situation should continue for any length of time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is only one Department where we have more than one Parliamentary Secretary, one dealing entirely with public health matters and the other dealing principally with matters that arose out of the emergency.  I think the second Parliamentary Secretary was appointed when the turf scheme was begun.  Now that we are getting away from the emergency circumstances but nevertheless holding in the Government's approach to very many things the spirit of the emergency I think it is undesirable that there would be any interference with provisions in the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  The experience the Dáil has had of the discussions on the Public Health Bill has been an extraordinary one. The Committee Stage was carried on for a period of 15 days and during that time on more than one occasion we had to emphasise the fact that on a very important measure, there had been no consultation of any systematic kind with functional or vocational bodies outside who really ought to be the people advising this House.  At any rate they were bodies that had the experience on which alone this House could satisfactorily make decisions with regard to certain matters proposed in relation to public health.</P>
    <P>The other night, speaking in <Col N="2461" /> public, a representative of the Irish Medical Union discussed his relations with the Department of Local Government through the Minister, and his relations with the Parliamentary Secretary attached to Local Government. He disclosed a very extraordinary state of affairs.  It was quite possible for the medical fraternity to be in daily touch with the Minister for Local Government on all kinds of matters, and to be received in the most cordial, agreeable and satisfactory way, whereas with the Parliamentary Secretary who was dealing with a very important measure in the House they found it impossible to make contact and they had to complain that they had not had discussion on any of these important matters with the Parliamentary Secretary who was the only person who came before the House to take part in the discussions here.</P>
    <P>On two occasions on the Committee Stage of the Public Health Bill it was necessary in connection with resolutions similar to the two we have passed just now before the Committee Stage of this Bill for the Minister to appear in the House but the Parliamentary Secretary not being in the grip of the Government in the way in which the Taoiseach complains seemed to be able to prevent his Minister from coming here lest the Minister might be asked to take part in the discussion and it was the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who moved the resolutions related to the Public Health Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a second Parliamentary Secretary attached to the Local Government Department dealing with roads, housing and the turf scheme.  It would be most undesirable when we consider the position of housing and the amount of work that requires to be done on roads or even in connection with the turf scheme&mdash; certain things are unsatisfactory with regard to it, particularly the cost of haulage&mdash;indeed, it would be a disastrous state of affairs if we were to get in respect of housing or roads or turf a Parliamentary Secretary to deal with these matters in the same way as we had the Parliamentary Secretary dealing <Col N="2462" /> with matters on the Public Health Bill. I suggest the time has come when no emergency condition should allow us to maintain in any Department more than the number of Parliamentary Secretaries dictated by the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need emphasise what the Taoiseach appears to appreciate but we certainly had very good reason to appreciate how undesirable it was to have a position like that here.  It is time that Emergency Order went.</P>

      <P>No.  When the Emergency Powers Act ceases and this Bill becomes the law in lieu thereof there will be no power to make under it an Order similar to Order No. 111.  There is nothing in the Bill to give power to amend any Act by Order.  If the Ministers and Secretaries Act is amended it must be by legislation.  The proposal to continue Order No. 111 is merely to hold the present position unchanged until a Bill to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Act, which the Taoiseach foreshadowed, can be submitted.  Clearly that cannot be enacted before 1st September.  The matter can be considered at that stage. We continue Order No. 111 so as to leave the situation unaltered until the amending legislation is prepared.  Let it be clear that once Order No. 111 is revoked there will be no power under this Bill to make a similar Order.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Costello I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  The High Court shall have and alone shall have jurisdiction, power and authority to hear and determine all claims for compensation and damages in respect of the acquisition, user, or damage or injury to any land or any interest in any land or other property real or personal acquired (whether temporarily or permanently) or damaged by any Minister, Department or person acting or purporting to act or to have acted under the provisions of the Act of 1939 or any Order or subsidiary instrument made or purported to have been made thereunder or under this Act or any Order or subsidiary instrument made or purported to have been made thereunder.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is no provision in ordinary law or under the Emergency Powers Act for the payment of Compensation where the State has occupied land and not acquired it.  If the land is subsequently acquired, then compensation by way of rent is paid for the period of occupation.  During the emergency certain lands were occupied by the military authorities but not acquired. The military authorities withdrew from the land when it was no longer necessary to remain in possession.  There is <Col N="2464" /> statutory provision for the payment of compensation in such cases, but the practice has been to settle compensation either by agreement with the owners or by allowing the matter to go to court and paying the sum determined by the court.  In all such cases compensation has been paid.  I take it what Deputy Costello has in mind is to provide for the giving of power to the High Court to hear claims for compensation and to assess the amount of compensation in such circumstances. I am not clear that it is urgent to make any change in the situation.  I am informed that all such cases have been settled.  In any case, the practice has been to allow people to go to court and to pay the compensation assessed by the court. The Minister for Finance, whose Department is more directly concerned, is considering whether any other change is necessary in ordinary law to provide for cases where the State takes possession of lands but does not acquire them permanently.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1), line 24, the words and figures &ldquo;provided that nothing in this section shall be construed as continuing in force, after the operative date, the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 30) Order, 1940.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the explanatory memorandum indicates, Emergency Powers (No. 30) Order, 1940 had for its object the suspension of the operation of the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929.  The reason given by the Government for the suspension of that Act was that they were going to stabilise the cost-of-living bonus at that time and prevent officers' wages and salaries being adjusted in accordance with the rise and fall in the cost-of-living index figure and, as that would mean a worsening of the conditions <Col N="2465" /> of transferred officers, they decided to suspend the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act so that they could, on the one hand, stabilise the bonus of transferred officers and, on the other hand, prevent transferred officers from having any remedy in respect of a worsening of conditions.  In the explanatory memorandum which we now have, we are told that it is the desire to continue that position as it is feared that if the Act were revived at this stage it would lead to the premature retirement of experienced staff whose retirement could not be permitted without loss of efficiency in the Civil Service.  When we discussed this matter on the Second Stage the Minister even went further than that explanation for the continued suspension of this Act by telling us that in fact he or the Government had in mind the introduction of some kind of permanent legislation, the effect of which would be to ensure that a transferred officer, even if the Act is revived, cannot retire on the grounds that his conditions of service have been worsened merely because the Government had broken their agreement with him by stabilising the cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Minister said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to prevent a continuance of the suspension of that Act, and I want to do it on very definite grounds, one, that the Act of 1929 was the result of an agreement between the Government of the day, on the one hand, and transferred officers operating through their organisation, on the other hand. If Deputy Costello, who was then Attorney-General, were present to-day, he would submit very definitely that he with several higher officers of the Department of Finance sat at one side of a table and negotiated this agreement with transferred officers.  Deputy Costello and higher officials in the Department of Finance, acting for the Government of the day, met and endeavoured to get agreement providing for the safeguarding of conditions of transferred officers, that is, those who, in the main, wanted to continue to serve the State and who were satisfied to serve the State once <Col N="2466" /> they were assured that their conditions would be immune from attack. As a result of the passage of that Act of 1929 which, I think, was an excellent Act from the point of view of stabilising the service, a very large number stayed on in the service and served the Government who would probably have retired if they had not got an assurance from an Irish Legislature that they were provided for under that Act.  There were others who could not be induced to have confidence in the Irish Parliament.  They were those who could not be induced to believe that at some future date the Government would not break its word and perhaps would not provide equitable compensation in such circumstances as was provided under the Act of 1929.  Those who doubted the Government's honesty and doubted that the Government would keep its word and retired are the winners to-day, because they were entitled to retire in 1929 under the Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act of that year on terms which the Minister says his Government is not now prepared to give to those who trusted the Legislature, trusted the Government and remained on in the Civil Service.  In other words, those who would not retire and did not retire then but relied on the assurances contained in legislation are now in the position that they cannot get the terms that those who did not trust the Government got, and the Minister threatens that if the Act is revived they will not be able to get their pre-1940 method of remuneration back and they will not be allowed to get a remedy if the Government does not give it.  I think that is an unfair method in which to treat State servants, and as the Minister knows, they have not the same kind of weapon against the Government as their employer as the ordinary worker has against an employer who would not treat him in anything like a similar fashion.  The position, therefore, is that those who stayed on in 1929 and did not retire but continued to serve the State so long as their conditions were free from attack, subsequently found themselves in this position in 1940 that the Government said to them: <Col N="2467" />&ldquo;We took you over on the understanding that we respected your previous position as regards tenure, wages and conditions and we now give you the opportunity of retiring on certain terms.  In 1940 we are going to stabilise your bonus to prevent you getting any increase for the rapid increase in the cost of living and on top of that solemnly deny a remedy that the Government contracted in this House to give you if at any time your conditions of service were worsened.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, the stabilisation of the bonus is a breach of the cost-of-living bonus agreement between the Government and the staff, and the stabilisation of bonus was a breach again of the public declarations here on the 1929 Act and the agreement arrived at between the Government of the day and Civil Service organisations in Government Buildings in 1929.  If the Government had broken these agreements in ordinary circumstances and had said: &ldquo;We intend to break them because we do not want to be bound by them now, but I will pay for breaking them&rdquo;, civil servants could then go before a compensation board and the Minister could say: &ldquo;I undertook to observe certain conditions on the understanding that, if I broke them, I would give you a remedy against me in permitting you to go before a compensation board and asking that board to assess compensation for what you lost.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Minister says no, he will not do that.  He says: &ldquo;I will worsen your conditions; I will break the agreement; I will ride roughshod over all the guarantees given you; and, when all that havoc has been done, I will give you no remedy against me, either in the courts of the country or through a compensation board&rdquo;&mdash;the compensation board which was set up under the 1929 Act as a guarantee that he could be sued and made amenable if he deliberately chose to worsen the conditions of transferred officers.  He has succeeded in doing this; he has succeeded in worsening the conditions of these officers and he prevents them going before a compensation board to get a remedy against him by utilising the Emergency Powers Act, first, and <Col N="2468" /> now this Bill, to keep the 1929 Act in a state of suspension.</P>
    <P>Now that the emergency is over, if the Minister could even produce any justification for doing what he did in 1940&mdash;and I do not believe he could ever have produced justification for his action in the matter&mdash;surely there is no justification whatever, in 1946, when the war is over and when the emergency is over, for continuing the suspension of an Act which was deliberately passed in order to ensure to people the conditions of employment on which they were transferred or, alternatively, a remedy, if those conditions of service were materially altered to the detriment of the officers concerned. The sole purpose of the amendment is to prevent the continued suspension of the Act, and, at the same time, to make a plea for the revival of the Act, so as to give the aggrieved persons an opportunity of having any claim they have against the Minister adjudicated upon by the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister's fear, as innocently expressed in this explanatory memorandum, is that, if the board is revived, it would give rise to a large number of premature retirements.  The easiest way of getting over the fear of premature retirements is for the Government to honour the promise it made in 1929. It can do that by restoring the cost-of-living bonus agreement which, as the Minister knows, the Government unilaterally repudiated in 1940, after having for a long number of years extracted every possible advantage it could get from that cost-of-living bonus agreement by reason of the downward tendency of the cost-of-living index figure.  If the Government wants to prevent officers retiring, if it wants to get back to the stability which existed in the service in 1940, the easiest, the quickest and the surest way of doing so is by revoking the Civil Service stabilisation regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, expressing the views of the Government, says that, in September, the wages standstill Order will go. There will be no further control over the wages of workers in private industry. In view of that, how can the Government <Col N="2469" /> logically pretend to have any right whatever, legal, moral, economic, or fiscal, to say to civil servants, with whom they had an agreement which the Government broke: &ldquo;Although we leave the others completely out of the grip of wage control, we are going to maintain control, so far as the Civil Service is concerned&rdquo;.  In other words, you put the civil servant into a vice, in the first instance by stabilising his wages ten months before you stabilise wages outside, and, when you release the control on outside wages, you still want to keep control over the civil servants' wages, which includes keeping control over the wages of the people who are paid as little as £2 and £3 per week and even less.</P>
    <P>How can the Government justify that?  Dick Turpin could justify that and various gentlemen who sailed the seas with the Jolly Roger as their ensign could justify conduct of that kind, but how can the Government justify such action&mdash;Government control over a body of people for no other reason than that they are near to you, that you can squeeze them, that it is convenient to squeeze them, and administratively not difficult to squeeze them and from an accountancy point of view, yields quite good returns?  It is not proposed to do that to the generality of the people.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that he knows that what the Government is doing in this matter is a bit thick and cannot be justified on any reasonable ground whatever.  What the Minister ought to do is not to take power to continue the suspension of this compensation board, but to tell the Government that, in his opinion, the time has arrived when, as the Minister charged with steering the State through the rest of the emergency, he does not believe, as I am sure in his heart he does not believe, there is any reason for continuing its suspension.  It is merely a lazy way of continuing an unjust act, but, if the revocation of the suspension of this Act were brought about, the Government could easily think of what way it ought to get out of whatever situation existed.  I am quite certain that transferred officers, recognising all the difficulties, would be only too <Col N="2470" /> pleased to deal with whatever problem had to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am concerned in this matter from the point of view of advocating the maintenance of a contract and in seeing that the rights which people had are not invaded; I am not concerned at all with the person who wants to get out while the going is good, or because of some adventitious circumstance. I want to maintain the contracts which these people had, and to ensure that they will not be torn up in the lighthearted way in which the Government has torn them up for the past six years.  The Minister ought to tell the Government that he does not feel justified in asking for a continuance of this Emergency Powers Order and the problem ought to be dealt with by a conference between the Government, on the one hand, and those who are its victims, on the other, with a view to getting over whatever difficulty may exist in the Government's mind in relation to it.</P>

      <P>The weakness in the case made by the Deputy is his assumption that the termination of the bonus stabilisation would avoid the possibility of a large number of transferred officers retiring on the special terms which they could obtain under the 1929 Act.  That is not correct.  When I referred to the possibility of special legislation in this matter, I had in mind the fact that, even if the stabilisation of the Civil Service bonus ended to-day, these transferred officers would still be entitled to avail of the provisions of the 1929 Act by reason of the fact that their bonus was stabilised during the past few years.  That has been done, and the fact that it has been would give them the right to retire on these special terms, unless the position is changed by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say how many of the 6,000 transferred officers still serving would elect to retire.  It is clear, however, that if they all did elect to retire, there would be a complete disorganisation of many Government services.  A number of these transferred officers occupy very senior posts.  They are all skilled staff, and their withdrawal in large numbers from the Government service would create a position of <Col N="2471" /> chaos for a time.  It was that fact which the Government had in mind in 1940 when it made this Order.  Whatever possibility there might be of dealing with such a situation now, the opportunity of doing so in 1940, without very serious consequences, was slight indeed.</P>
    <P>In 1940 the Government decided on a policy of bonus stabilisation.  I admit that the stabilisation of the bonus was an alteration of the conditions of service of civil servants, whether transferred officers or other classes of civil servants.  It was an alteration which was justified solely by the exceptional circumstances of the time.  Having decided upon that policy, however, the Government had, I think, no option but to prevent the possibility of 6,000 necessary officers, holding key positions and possessing knowledge and experience, which newcomers could not possibly have, retiring <i>en masse</i> from the Government service and leaving disorganisation behind them.  The Act of 1929 was the result of discussions with the Transferred Officers' Association and an agreement with the British Government.  The agreement was given effect to by the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) (Compensation) Act here and by an Act of the British Parliament called the Irish Free State (Confirmation of Agreement) Act.  When it was proposed to suspend the operation of that Act, following upon the stabilisation of the bonus, the British Government was so informed and, on the understanding that the suspension of the Act would be for the period of the emergency only, the British Government intimated that it had no observations to offer.</P>
    <P>I cannot say at what stage it will be decided to terminate the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus or on what basis it may be done.  Clearly, however, when it is done and when the stabilisation of the bonus Order is withdrawn the position of this Order, relating to the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Act, will have to be considered, because at that stage the Government will also have to decide whether it is prepared to contemplate the withdrawal of these transferred officers from the service <Col N="2472" /> under the provisions of that Act, or whether it will be necessary to enact some legislation which will merely restore their rights as from that date, without giving them the right to retire because of the past stabilisation of the bonus.  The possibility of numbers of transferred officers retiring is, of course, greater now than it was in 1940.  All these officers are six years older now and, consequently, are nearer to the date upon which they would retire from the service in any event.  Consequently, there will be a greater inducement now, than there was in 1940, to avail of the opportunity, if there were such opportunity, of retiring on Article 10 terms.  The intention, however, of including this Order amongst the continued Government Orders under this Bill is merely to ensure that the situation will remain unchanged until a decision is taken upon the question of the future of the stabilisation of the bonus.  I have explained that it would not be possible to consider the two questions separately.  The Minister for Finance will, no doubt, have that matter under examination.  But clearly the position in relation to these transferred officers must remain as it is until a decision is taken upon the question of bonus stabilisation.  When a decision is taken upon that question, then the position of these transferred officers will enter into the picture also, because at that stage we must either contemplate the retirement of a number of them or some such arrangement as will obviate that risk to the proper administration of Government services.  I could not, therefore, agree to this amendment, because it seems to me quite obvious that, whatever case the Deputy may make for permitting these officers to retire under the terms of the 1929 Act, it should not be a matter for decision until the whole question of bonus stabilisation has been decided.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at this matter from another point of view.  In actual fact there seems to be a difference of approach to matters of this particular kind by different Ministers.  At the present moment an Order has gone out <Col N="2473" /> to local authorities that everybody of 65 years of age must clear out.  I know most valuable officers of local authorities throughout the country who are 65 years of age, but who are 65 years young, and who are being cleared out at 65 because the Minister wants to make room for other people who have grown up since and who are in the service, or whom he wants to bring into the service in present circumstances. Surely, when the Minister says that he believes these 6,000 officers who came over in 1922 are going to clear out he is imagining a very, very extraordinary situation in our present economic conditions, on the one hand, and on the other hand, ignoring the tremendous advances in position, status and emoluments which a number of these have enjoyed as a result of the setting up of the State here.  We have gone through six years of emergency.  Anybody who knows anything of the inner workings of the Civil Service machine realises, what even men who enter the service as junior executives or administrative officers realise, how long they spend there before they get the feeling that they are in there with their legs tied to a table, with a very, very dull existence, with very little opportunity of developing their imaginations in a vigorous way as far as their personalities as a whole are concerned, and with very little opportunity of doing anything worth while.  The ordinary civil servant, no matter what rank he is, finds himself after a few years of service with his leg tied to a table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the emergency opened up a whole new world and the men who entered the Civil Service since 1927 had, during the last six years, an opportunity given to them of showing their worth both in an administrative capacity and in their ideas and general talents.  They got a chance of expanding their activities, expanding their personalities, and expanding their general usefulness to the State which, in the ordinary course of events, would never come to any civil servant.  The Minister finds himself&mdash;as every Minister finds himself to-day&mdash;with a very inflated machine.  He will have to get rid of a lot of people who were brought in temporarily.  He will have to demote a lot of first-class officers who <Col N="2474" /> were raised to higher rank and greater responsibility during the last six years. If there are people now who are dissatisfied because of the stabilisation of the bonus and who would leave the Civil Service rather than continue under these conditions, surely, the Minister ought to be glad to think that there are people ready to clear out at the top in order to make room for the newly trained material which has come into the service since 1922 and which has had an opportunity of proving itself during the last six years. Surely, he ought to feel that, so far from injuring the service by losing a few first-class men here and there, he would freshen up and invigorate the entire machine by allowing the young people who developed during the emergency an opportunity of moving still further to the top and getting service from those men who have developed under present-day circumstances. I think that the Minister is tackling this situation in a very limited fashion and with a very narrow viewpoint. I cannot understand the attitude of the Government in regard to the civil servants during the emergency.  Take, for instance, the additional half-hour which they were asked to serve during the emergency; they had to come in a quarter of an hour before their normal time in the morning and they had to stay on a quarter of an hour later in the evening. I think that one of the quarter hours has been taken off already and that they are promised that the other will come off some time in October.  I think it shows very little imagination with regard to what the Civil Service is as a machine and how it should be used and treated.  I think the Minister is making a very great mistake in not taking the opportunity, if there is an opportunity in present circumstances, of allowing some of the older civil servants to go and some of the younger civil servants to take their place.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister cannot argue this matter 12 months after the war is really over without mentioning how many officials he really thinks might go under the new circumstances and how many of these officials he thinks would be a loss to the Civil Service.  I do not <Col N="2475" /> know why the Minister is taking up this attitude.  If he thinks that he is holding any powers in hand to prevent a general breakout of the Civil Service in a kind of revolt against conditions I think he is making a mistake even in circumstances like that, because, if you are to have a revolt of that kind, now is the time to have it before you reduce your Civil Service machine from emergency proportions to normal peacetime proportions.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that all these fears are only invented for some peculiar purpose which I am unable to fathom.  I strongly recommend to the Government, in the circumstances in which they find themselves, where they have to scale down their inflated Civil Service machine that, in the interests of the Civil Service and of the young people growing up in it, if some of the older people want to go they should be allowed to go, whatever reasons they may advance for going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose that anything I can say in addition to what has already been said urging the Minister to reconsider the policy in this matter of the Civil Service, particularly the transferred officers, would have any effect in altering his decision. At the same time, I should like to make a plea on behalf of these men. I think I can say that I am entitled to make that plea and that it cannot be said that it is made for any political purpose, or to gain any particular political advantage for myself or any of the members of the Party to which I belong.  I had some responsibility in connection with the agreement reached in 1929 between the Irish Government, the British Government and the Civil Service, and at that time I threw whatever weight I had and whatever authority I possessed in favour of an agreement between the parties to the agreement that was ultimately reached, because I felt the justice of the claim of the Civil Service. I felt also the need for having in the Civil Service that strong body of efficient officers who had been transferred to our service and who were as Irish as any of the officers who came into the service.  I felt it was <Col N="2476" /> necessary in the interest of efficiency that there should be in that body a feeling of security and that if there was a feeling of security there would be no retirement, or very few, and that if there were retirements, in the majority of cases of those who took advantage of the Act, the Civil Service would be just as well off without them and that the result of the agreement would be to have a contented and efficient Civil Service.</P>
      <P>I believe that was the result of the Act of 1929.  It is for that reason that when I was associated with the Government any influence I had with the Government was exercised in favour of Civil Service rights.  Since I have been in Opposition I have strongly retained that attitude because it is one of my firm convictions in principle.  I gain very little if any advantage by advocating the cause of the civil servants. On the contrary if there is any political advantage, it is against me. It was used against me in the general election which followed the decision of this House on the motion with reference to Civil Service arbitration which appeared in my name and the name of Deputy McGilligan.  It was against me then and one of my principal colleagues in this House, Mr. Lavery, lost his seat in that election.  Therefore it cannot be said that we are moving in this matter for political reasons.  So far as I am concerned, I can assert that I am doing it because I believe in it and because it is in the interests of efficiency, in the interests of the Civil Service, and, ultimately, of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I do not think I can in any way influence the Minister at this stage.  Apparently, a Government decision has been made and nothing that can be said here advocating the cause of these transferred officers will, so far as I can see, affect that matter. But there are a couple of points to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention.  In connection with the operation of this Emergency Powers Order, No. 30 of 1940, the reason given in the explanatory memorandum circulated with this Bill for the making of the Order and its continuance now is that the stabilisation of the Civil <Col N="2477" /> Service bonus would give rise to claims for retirement by civil servants thereby causing an exodus from the service of these civil servants.  So far as I know no other reason has been advanced.</P>
    <P>There has been from time to time a suggestion made that the policy in this Order of 1940 was in line with Government policy in reference to the prevention of inflation.  In the explanatory memorandum it is perhaps significant that there is no reference to inflation or the necessity for continuing this Order for reasons connected with currency or inflation.  We may take it, therefore, that, so far as the Government are concerned, they base their reasons for the making of this Order and for its continuance on the possibility of retirements.  What is past is past.  But I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that this Order was made in 1940, I think 12 months at least before the first of the standstill Orders was put into operation in reference to wages throughout the country.  Therefore for a period of 12 months before the ordinary working man or clerk or the ordinary man was affected by these standstill Orders the impact of this Order was fully felt by the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The position at the moment appears to be that the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated recently that once the Industrial Relations Bill becomes law the standstill Orders will disappear.  So that again the civil servants are being left in the same position in which they have been for the last six years.  They are to be left with this stabilisation of bonus with, apparently, no prospect of any amelioration in the position as regards the bonus.  Therefore, from the point of view of the basic rate, the only reason that is now given as I understand it from the explanatory memorandum and from the remarks of the Minister to which I have listened, for the continuance of the Order is the possibility of a large number of retirements.  I personally do not believe that there would be any large number of retirements from the Civil Service if the Act of 1929 were put back into its proper <Col N="2478" /> operation.  At the present moment the position is that 99 per cent. of the civil servants who would be affected by the bringing into operation of the Act of 1929 would be unable to afford to retire. A very small number indeed would take advantage of the position.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that the Minister at least ought to take away the Orders suspending the operation of the Act of 1929.  The Minister has stated that that Order suspending the Act of 1929, and, apparently, also this Order No. 30, was made after consultation with the British Government.  There were three parties to this agreement and the Act of 1929 gives legislative effect to a tripartite agreement&mdash;an agreement between the Irish Government, the British Government and the civil servants.  But, apparently, these Orders were passed in consultation with only one other of the parties to the agreement&mdash;the British Government&mdash;and no conference or consultation took place with the civil servants or the representatives of the civil servants.  I do not know whether even now it might not be possible for the Minister to come to some arrangement in conference or consultation with the civil servants, or their staff representatives, by which an agreement would be come to in reference to this entire matter, and not to have this continued irritation caused by the continuance in operation of this Emergency Powers Order.  That would give effect to the principle of consultation with all parties to an agreement where that agreement was going to be changed.  It was altered, apparently, in 1940 by agreement with the British Government but by no agreement or conference or consultation with the other party to the agreement, namely, the civil servants.  Could the Minister not consider, even at this moment, an approach to the civil servants and their organisation with a view to seeing if some arrangement could not be come to by agreement, just as it was come to in 1929 between this Government and the British Government and the civil servants?  I do not think it is beyond the bounds of possibility.</P>
    <P>I am not in touch with any of the staff organisations or with any civil servants in this matter.  I make this <Col N="2479" /> suggestion entirely on my own responsibility, entirely from the experience I had in 1929, when I negotiated this agreement, because I think I can say that I was largely in the position at that time of a negotiator between the various parties to the agreements that were ultimately arrived at.  I found the civil servants and their representatives very amenable to compromise and very appreciative of difficulties and, while they were anxious to maintain their rights as far as possible, they were anxious to serve an Irish Government to the best of their ability and also to see if the difficulties which that Government had in relation to their claims could possibly be adjusted and met.  Could the Minister not now see if anything could be done along those lines?  I think that if an agreement could be come to it would remove the irritation that must continue to exist as long as this Order exists.</P>
    <P>I gather from what the Minister has just stated that so far from there being any amelioration of the position of civil servants or even transferred officers, the intention is that this Order is to continue until circumstances arise in which it will be possible to stabilise the bonus.  In other words, the utmost that the civil servants and transferred officers can look forward to is a position where their rights will again be taken away from them and whatever their rights may be in reference to the bonus will be whatever is the stabilised bonus created in some years to come.</P>
    <P>The other suggestion that I make to the Minister&mdash;again completely on my own responsibility&mdash;but which might tend to bring more accord between civil servants and Government policy would be for the Government on the advice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, having formally arrived at the decision&mdash;which no advocacy on our part or on the part of any Party other than the Government Party in this House can persuade them to alter or to modify&mdash;that on the bonus they are adamant, would it not be possible to give continued operation to the Act of 1929 except in reference to the bonus? That will not be any very great consolation to those people who have felt <Col N="2480" /> the impact of the cost of living in the gap that has been ever-widening and ever increasing, each day and each month, between the amount of money they get and the cost of living, the disparity between the cost-of-living and the bonus which was supposed, in accordance with legal decisions, to be something which would adjust salary to the cost of living and really equate salary to the particular conditions existing at the time.  This will not be much consolation to them but at all events there are a number of other matters arising in connection with administration in respect of which civil servants and the transferred officers in particular&mdash;only the transferred officers have any rights under the Act of 1929&mdash;might feel more easy in their minds if they had recourse to a tribunal, if the tribunal was there, in reference to all matters other than bonus.</P>
    <P>I do not see there has been any case made, certainly not in this explanatory memorandum, for the continuance in force in its entirety of the Order suspending the Act of 1929.  It is suspended, according to the Minister's statement and the statement in the explanatory memorandum, solely because if the bonus Order was taken away that would give cause for the retirement of a large number of civil servants.  Be it so, what is the case for keeping it in reference to all the other matters that are dealt with in the Act of 1929?  Can the Minister see his way to advise the Government to allow the Act of 1929 to come again into its full operation in every respect except in reference to bonus?  There has been no case made anywhere that I know of for the continued suspension of the Act of 1929 except in reference to bonus.  There are other matters, some matters of very great importance to civil servants, in the Act of 1929.  The Minister knows them, I am sure, as well as I do and I believe that there will be little or no retirement in consequence of matters other than bonus if the Act of 1929 is given its continued operation other than in reference to bonus.  At all events it will go a little way to righting the position and a little way towards regularising what is really an irregular position, namely, <Col N="2481" /> rights conferred by agreement between three parties being abrogated by agreement between two of the parties to that agreement.</P>
    <P>I do not know what interpretation is to be placed upon the assent that was given by the British Government to the making of the Emergency Powers Order.  The Minister says that the British Government agreed so long as it it only applied to the emergency. The emergency is indefinite and has no relation to the war which is now over and may continue <i>in secula seculorum.</i> It depends on the declaration of the Government.  I do not know if the interpretation is to be placed upon it that once the emergency is over the British Government anticipated that the bonus would be given its full operation or whether, notwithstanding anything in the agreement scheduled to the Act of 1929 and the decision of the tribunal set up subsequently under that Act in reference to the rights of transferred officers to bonus, the British Government have agreed that the rights of transferred officers are to be abrogated in reference to their bonus. I do not know whether that is the interpretation or not.  I would like to know whether the British Government, without consulting those officers, have gone the whole way and given a free hand to the Irish Government to deal in any way they like in reference to Civil Service bonus at any time after the emergency has passed.</P>
    <P>The last remark I have to make is to direct the Minister's attention to this fact, when he is considering the case that he has made for the continuation of this Order&mdash;that there might be a vast number of retirements.  It was suggested when the Public Economies Act, 1933, was being passed that there would be a large number of retirements from the Civil Service.  There were very few.  That is rather an analogous position to the present time.  I do think that the number of retirements that would be brought about by the restoration of the cost-of-living bonus to civil servants or by giving them the opportunity of going to the tribunal set up under the Act of 1929, if the Order is continued, would be very small indeed.  If the Minister cannot see his way to recommend the modification of <Col N="2482" /> the Government policy in this matter, perhaps he would consider the other point that I have put up in reference to the Act of 1929.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know the sole reason why the Act of 1929 was suspended was the anticipation that the stabilisation of the bonus would lead to the retirement of a number of transferred officers.  I shall certainly ask the Minister for Finance to consider whether it is possible to amend the Order so as to bring the Act back into operation except in so far as claims may be based upon the stabilisation of the bonus.  I cannot say to what extent transferred officers might retire if this Order were revoked.  It may be a shallow argument to advance that if in fact 99 percent. of the officers could not afford to retire, then the Order does no injustice to 99 per cent. of the officers.  I think, however, that there is some apprehension in the minds of the Department of Finance that in present circumstances retirements might be considerable.</P>
      <P>The passing of the Civil Service (Temporary Economies) Act of 1933 resulted in the retirement of some hundreds of transferred officers and there were also retirements on that scale when the Constitution was enacted in 1938.  It was pointed out to me that the inducement to a transferred officer to avail of an occasion to retire under the Act of 1929 increases as he approaches his retirement age and most of those officers are now getting close to the age at which they will retire in any event.</P>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy with Deputy Mulcahy's point of view, that it is a good thing for the Civil Service that senior officers should retire and that promotion should be open to lower officers and new entrants to the service.  I must say that from my experience the quality of the staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce was not at any time adversely affected by retirements under the Act of 1929.  Whatever temporary inconvenience may have been caused by such retirements was in time offset by the promotion of younger officers with energy and ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2483" /> I think that the position at present is that it is exceedingly difficult to get officers of the requisite experience for the higher posts in the Civil Service. There has been an expansion of the service and the number of civil servants is, I think, now higher than at any previous time.  That expansion of the service gave exceptional opportunities for promotion to junior officers of outstanding ability, but if a number of vacancies in the higher grades were to arise now, there would be considerable difficulty in filling them.  I know from experience in my own Department that it is not easy to get officers of the requisite experience and calibre for higher posts in the existing service. That position is likely to continue until there has been more extensive recruitment of new entrants to the service and the new recruits get an opportunity of acquiring experience, because experience as well as personal ability is essential for the proper performance of the duties of a senior officer.</P>
    <P>The explanatory note relating to this Order contained no reference to the motives of the Government in stabilising the bonus.  It is clear that this Order is linked up with the stabilisation of the bonus.  I do not suppose any Deputy would contemplate the Government restoring the full cost-of-living bonus for transferred officers only.  They will, I am sure, agree with me that it could not be done for transferred officers until it is done for the service as a whole.  At some stage the Minister for Finance will have to decide on the restoration of the cost-of-living bonus or on the arrangement he considers most suitable for the regulation of the future remuneration of the Civil Service.  What he contemplates in that regard I cannot say, but clearly the stage is approaching at which he will have to make decisions.  I think some discussions with staff associations have taken or are taking place.</P>
    <P>The purpose of continuing this Order is to maintain the present position unchanged until there is a permanent change, whatever form that permanent change may take.  The permanent change will affect both transferred <Col N="2484" /> officers and other civil servants and I feel certain the Minister for Finance would not be prepared to contemplate improving the conditions of transferred officers until a decision affecting the whole of the service can be made. When that decision is made, then a decision in relation to this Order will also have to be arrived at, because at that stage the Minister for Finance will have to decide if he is then prepared to contemplate the possibility of a number of transferred officers retiring, or the enactment of legislation to provide that while they get back their rights under the 1929 Act the fact that the bonus was stabilised in the past will not be a justification for retiring under that Act.</P>
    <P>This matter has been fully considered, and while it is not altogether correct to say the Government are not prepared to consider any arguments advanced to them, they have decided that this Order shall remain while the stabilisation of the bonus remains and a case for an early change must be related to the stabilisation of the bonus rather than to the maintenance of this Order.  I will, however, ask the Minister for Finance to consider whether this Order cannot be limited in its scope to the issue of bonus stabilisation and so amend it as to permit the Act of 1929 to come back into operation in respect of other matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to clear up.  What the Minister said conveyed to my mind that the policy was to stabilise the bonus and not have a bonus that would fluctuate with the cost of living.  I gather that no decision has been reached and it is not a definite Government policy. I suggest it is a matter that will require very careful consideration. There is one other point arising out of what the Minister said.  He spoke of whatever policy must be arrived at in reference both to the transferred officers and the civil servants who are not transferred officers.  The transferred officers would not require themselves to be put into a special category.  The fundamental basis of the whole matter is that the civil servants shall be properly paid and that their payment should have some relation to existing circumstances and to realities.  Although I speak on behalf of transferred officers, I really speak on behalf of all civil servants.  They have suffered, whether they are transferred officers or not, far more severely than any other section of the community&mdash;all civil servants have&mdash;and I say that the impact of high taxation and increased cost of living and other matters during the emergency has fallen heavier upon the salaried classes in this country than upon any other classes.  What I am making an appeal for, although I am speaking on the subject of transferred officers, is for a proper scale of salaries <Col N="2486" /> for civil servants, related to facts and, in particular, to the cost of living.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he found it difficult in his Department to get people of experience and calibre to replace higher civil servants who go out.  I have on more than one occasion in this House declared my view, that the underpayment of civil servants is bad public policy.  I would prefer to see a smaller number of civil servants very well paid, rather than a vast number of underpaid civil servants in the State. I think it is bad policy.  That is what I want to advocate here when speaking on the subject of transferred officers. Have decent salaries for civil servants and, in return, efficient service to the State would be given the more readily if they had not the worry and trouble caused by the anxiety which they experienced in the last few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is asked to do now is what he would have done in 1939 if there had been no war and no emergency.  If it had not been for the outbreak of war in 1939 the Government would not have contemplated interfering with the Act of 1929 or altering the bonus arrangement. Now that the war and the emergency is over, and that thanks to Almighty God we escaped its horrors, we are getting back to normal conditions.  What is the difficulty of going back to the normal position that we had up to September, 1939?  What is the difficulty in going back to the functioning of the 1929 Act and revoking the stabilisation of bonus regulation?  The Minister has already decided to go back in respect of every type of worker in private industry.  He says that the target is that there will be no more stabilisation for them after 1st September.  As far as the Government is concerned it is finished with the policy of interfering with wages, which will then be controlled by collective bargaining between workers and employers in the field of industry and commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister could announce that decision as far as employers and workers are concerned in May, 1939, apparently he cannot do so in June, 1946, as far as civil servants are concerned. <Col N="2487" /> What insuperable difficulty is there in getting from the Government a decision such as that which has such a far reaching effect on workers in private employment?  What is the difficulty about the Government making up its mind if it is going to effect stabilisation of wages?  When the House is in session what is the difficulty of saying: &ldquo;We have gone into this matter.  Our point of view is so-and-so and the opposite point of view is so-and-so, and between the two we have taken a decision.  Here is the decision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why should the House be asked to pass a Bill, to continue until September, 1947, an Emergency Powers Order, the effect of which is to suspend the Act of 1929 until September, 1947?  The Government should now, seeing that it has taken a decision in regard to wages in private industry, be able to make up its mind as to what it is going to do in regard to stabilisation of the bonus.  If it is going to lift control in one case how can it maintain control in the Civil Service?  The Government to-day controls the wages of unfortunate postmen who are paid less wages than industrial workers.  How can they justify the lifting of control in respect of outside employment, when they are not lifting control off the lowly paid employees in the public service? I think the Minister ought to go to the Government and say to them that as apparently they had made up their mind in respect of the standstill Order, as far as private workers are concerned, it was time that a similar decision was arrived at in respect of stabilisation of the bonus regulation. If the Government decided &mdash; and I think it ought to decide&mdash;that the bonus stabilisation regulation must go, an announcement to that effect would have a more steadying effect in keeping trained and experienced people in the Civil Service than methods calculated to embitter them and induce them to get out of the service, without having regard to what the cost was going to be.</P>
    <P>I think that people close to the retiring age may want to retire if this Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Act is revised.  There is some value in <Col N="2488" /> stabilising the bonus.  Everybody who retires, retires on half salary and no more.  If you take the ordinary civil servant, one in the lower employment branches, you will find that in the main the lump sum received is required to pay debts which have accumulated over a number of years.  A good many are waiting for the lump sum in order to have things squared up.  As far as ordinary retirement is concerned at the maximum a civil servant gets half salary.  It is not too easy to-day to live on a whole salary.  Many people will not like the experiment, when retiring, of living on half salary if there is a chance of getting the whole salary without stabilisation of the bonus.  I think if the Government took its courage in its hands and revoked the stabilisation regulation, simultaneously with a revocation of the suspension of the Act, they might very well be surprised at the extent to which people would be anxious to serve the State, notwithstanding the fact that they got a pretty raw deal during the last six years.  I think the Minister cannot make any case for the Government delaying a decision on the stabilisation of bonus regulation.  If it is decided to revoke it the time is ripe for decision.  There is no point in continuing the position until 1947.</P>
    <P>I suggest that between now and the Report Stage the Minister ought to bring to the notice of the Government the views expressed here, in the hope that next week or the week after he will get a decision on these two matters. Every factor likely to guide that decision is present now.  If the Minister will do that I am willing to withdraw the amendment, so as to facilitate him or the Government.  We will then know where we stand.  Large numbers of civil servants will know where they stand.  I think the Government and the Minister owe it to them that they ought not to be kept in doubt.  Between now and this day fortnight the Minister ought to sound the Government and get a decision.</P>

      <P>I think it does. The explanatory memorandum states that Emergency Powers Order (No. 260) provides for the control of remuneration to employees generally.  It states: &ldquo;It would be necessary to retain these Orders pending the enactment and coming into operation of the Industrial Relations Bill, 1946.&rdquo;  I understand that the Order will be revoked when the Industrial Relations Bill comes into force.</P>
      <P>A further point is that he says nothing about Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order which is, in part, another wages Order.  The explanatory memorandum says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These Orders impose restrictions on the distribution of profits of companies and on directors' fees and remuneration of employees and it is necessary that they should be continued for the present.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton put certain questions to the Minister which he has not been able to answer yet.  I wonder would he correct me if I am wrong in giving these as the reasons. The question as posed by Deputy Norton is: what is the distinction made between the Civil Service as a whole and the transferred officers as a special group and the workers in ordinary private industry?  Deputy Norton makes the point that workers in industry are now to be left to the sway of ordinary industrial action and surely it is time to repeal the stabilisation Order and let ordinary conditions operate with regard to the Civil Service.  The difference is that the private worker has no contract, whereas the civil servant has.  The civil servant has such a contract, a contract which entitles him to a bonus and the transferred officer has a double contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2490" /> I understand that the question was put already and not answered, but it appears as if the Minister has gone into a huddle with his dearest enemies, the British Government, and has arranged to beat the legal right of these transferred officers.  The case made for it is, if you please, that these men are so valuable&mdash;one would have thought that the conclusion to be drawn from declaring that men are so valuable is that we ought to pay them up, to the extent of their services&mdash; that we must keep them, whether or not we break a contract with them.  I have several times in this House raised the morality of this action, and I have been informed that more than one clergyman has written to the Government protesting against this whole matter of the stabilisation of the bonus as definitely immoral.</P>
    <P>It is clear that these people were induced to take up service.  Many men entered the service on the condition that they were getting not merely a particular salary but were to be prevented from suffering the impact of a slump.  They accepted that particular contract, but, as that contract has gone on through the years, what has happened is that the Civil Service in the main has lost.  When the cost of living went down, they made what the secretary of the Department of Finance called a generous contribution to the State, amounting, according to the figures which have been given, to £2,000,000 in a certain number of years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach at a meeting in Ennis told civil servants to hang on to their cost-of-living bonus.  He forecast a general increase in prices throughout the world and his glorious statement was that they would have the bonus to safeguard them against the impact of any rise in costs.  When the rise did come, when the rise was permitted to come, the Minister steps in and tells them: &ldquo;We are not going to carry out our contractual relations with you.&rdquo; He did that earlier than with regard to the ordinary worker, but now he proposes to do it later with regard to them than anybody else.  He started in 1940, whereas the ordinary worker was dealt with about 1941, by means of a standstill Order.  Now he says that the ordinary worker is to be left to the <Col N="2491" /> impact of ordinary industrial conditions somewhere between September and whatever is to be the appointed day under the Bill which we discussed last night.  But we are going to keep this immoral situation operative with regard to the Civil Service generally, and transferred officers particularly, until some date which may be as late as this day in 1947.</P>
    <P>I say again that the only justification made for it is that these men are so valuable that we must keep them&mdash;the most amazing excuse ever put up for a breach of contract: the people whose contract is being broken are of such value that you dare not let them take their rights under the contracts, one of the rights being that they could go, if they were able to prove before a court that what was being done was a worsening of their conditions.  That is the bargain we solemnly made as a State.  The Government carried it forward, as following the people who made that bargain, and encouraged people to hope that the contract would be kept, but when, for the first time in the history of the Civil Service, the contract was any good, they stopped it being of such substantial benefit to them and now when it is understood that the conditions which made them break that contract, even immorally, have disappeared, it is proposed to carry this arrangement further.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the idea of inflation as an excuse has gone.  It has not been mentioned so far, and I do not suppose it will be mentioned now, but up to date the only reason given for depriving these people of the right to get the money due to them&mdash;and they have been deprived of £1,000,000 per year&mdash;was that it was considered that one million pounds per year handed to the Civil Service, to whom we had contractually bound ourselves, would have an inflationary impact.  Having said that, they allowed in £13,000,000 sent in here by the people who had to flee across the seas.  In the end, the only answer made is: &ldquo;We can let the ordinary industrial worker go free to get whatever conditions he can through industrial activity, because he cannot go into court, plead a contract and get <Col N="2492" /> enforcement of it, but these men can. Therefore, we have to treat them in this shocking fashion.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the question put to me by Deputy Norton, I could not hold out any hope that an announcement on the question of the future of bonus stabilisation would be made within a fortnight or before this Bill is enacted. There would be no point in postponing a decision on this amendment in anticipation of such an announcement.  An announcement will be made at some stage, but I could not at present attempt to forecast when it will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has heard the arguments and I cannot imagine that he is still without a considerable measure of sympathy with them, inwardly, no matter what he says outwardly. He must recognise that there is something incongruous in a situation in which he releases 500,000 people from the control imposed by the wages standstill Order, while he says to about 25,000 people: &ldquo;You have still to remain within the net.&rdquo;  That cannot be justified to any logical mind. The Minister must realise that it is time we got a decision on the stabilisation of bonus regulations in the same way in which we have got a decision in respect of outside workers.  I am willing to withdraw this amendment to give the Minister an opportunity of reporting the discussion to the Government, with the right to re-enter it on Report Stage, but in the hope that by the time we reach Report Stage we will have had some definite decision from the Government or some definite date on which we will get a decision.</P>

The Taoiseach there complains that a Parliamentary <Col N="2494" /> Secretary is a person who, when he gets the bit between his teeth, passes outside the control of the Government. We have had experience of that here. We have had the experience of a Parliamentary Secretary dealing with public health matters, not only keeping the Minister out of the debate but keeping out of the debate a Minister who, judging by the speeches made the other night at a dinner given by the medical fraternity, was in close touch with that profession and who proved most satisfactory in his manner of receiving them.  Yet, we have the situation where that Minister was kept completely out from any discussion on the Public Health Bill here while, at the same time, the representatives of the medical fraternity were kept completely away from any discussion in the matter.  I have been given this opportunity now of asking the House to take a decision on that.  I ask the House to take a decision now so that in any other matters appertaining to local government, whether it be housing, or roads, or anything else, we will have here in the House a Minister who will be responsible and who will help to guide the discussion in the House.</P>

    <P>Tá dhá aidhm leis an tairgsint seo. Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá sé dá beartú chun an Ghaeilge a neartú agus a choinneáil beo bríomhar san nGaeltacht. Dúradh roimhe seo gurb ait an rud é bheith ag íoc airgid le muintir na Gaeltachta chun an teanga atá ar a mbéal ó dhúchas do labhairt.  An té adéarfadh a leithéid ní thuigeann sé ceist na Gaeilge beag ná mór. Táimid ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur dá labhairt ar fud na tíre uilig. Táimid ar nós fir a bheadh ag iarraidh <Col N="2498" /> réimse mór talún do shruthlú agus gan aige ach sruthán beag uisce.  An fear a bheadh sa chás sin nach ndéanfadh sé gach dícheall chun an sruthán beag sin a mhéadú agus a neartú san tslí go n-éireodh leis an t-uisce a spréidheadh amach ar an réimse uilig agus barr fónta a chur ag fás ar a chuid talún. Is í an Ghaeltacht sruthán beag na Gaeilge.  Má théigheann an sruthán sin i ndísg ní fhásfaidh aon bharr ar an gcuid eile den tír agus caithfimid an sruthán a choinneáil ag rith agus caithfimid tuile agus rabharta a chur ann le go mbeidh dóthain uisce ann chun an Ghalltacht mhór fhairsing do shruthlú agus a bhláthú.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí a rá ar bhealach eile gurb í an Ghaeltacht dún deiridh na Gaeilge.  Tá muintir na Gaeltachta istigh sa dún sin ag cosaint na teangan; agus nach bhfuil sé de dhualgas orainne ar mian linn an teanga a shábháil gach cabhair agus cúnamh a thabhairt dóibh agus iad a ghríosadh agus misneach a chur iontu.  Aon duine atá dáirírí faoin teangaidh ní abróidh sé go mba cheart dúinn an troid uilig a fhágáil faoi mhuintir na Gaeltachta, go mba cheart dúinn a rá leo&mdash;&ldquo;Tá an Ghaeilge agaibhse agus tig libh í choinneáil nó í ligean le sruth do réir mar thograíos sibh féin é ach ní bhfuighidh sibh aon chabhair uainne&rdquo;.  Níl sé ró-fhada ó shoin ó bhí droch-mheas ar an nGaeilge agus gan ach fíor-chorr-dhuine ann a thuig an tábhacht a bhaineas léi agus an iarracht mhór a bheadh ag teastáil chun í a thabhairt slán.  Tá cuimhne ag muintir na Gaeltachta ar an am sin nuair a bhí gach bearna dúnta ar an nGaeilgeoir agus nach raibh sa nGaeilge ach &ldquo;the badge of the beaten race.&rdquo;  Tá cuimhne chomh cruinn sin acu ar an am sin gurb ar éigin a chreideas siad go bhfuil athrú tagaithe agus go bhfuil meas anois ar an nGaeilge thar mar bhí.  Caithfimidhne a chruthú dóibh go bhfuil an t-athrú tagaithe.  Bhíodar ar feadh na mblianta ag cailliúint i ngeall ar an nGaeilge a bheith ina teangain dúchais acu&mdash;caithfimid a thaispeáint dóibh go soiléir go bhfuil ré na cailliúna thart agus gur ag buachaint ar an nGaeilge a bheas siad feasta.</P>
    <P>Is móide de dhualgas orainn cabhrú <Col N="2499" />  eo a líonmhaire agus a threise atá na fórsaí ina gcoinne.  Ar an saol atá ann faoi láthair is deacair cur ina luí ar Ghaeilgeoir gurb é a leas claí leis an nGaeilge.  Tá míle rud dá tharraingt sa treo eile agus ghá mhealladh chun an Ghaeilge do thréigean.  Caithfimid a dhéanamh soiléir dó go mb'fhiú dhó greim a choinneáil ar a theangaidh féin agus nach mbeidh thiar air pioc ar bith má dhéanann sé sin.  Tá sé éasca go leor ag daoine a bhfuil Béarla agus Gaeilge acu agus gach bearna oscailte dhóibh dá réir sin a bheith ag clamhsán má tugtar lámh chúnta don Ghaeilgeoir ach an té a thuigeas an cheist i gceart agus ar mian leis an teanga a shábháil déanfaidh sé tuairim nach bhféadhfaí dul ró-fhada le cabhair a thabhairt do na daoine atá ag troid san dún agus a bhfuil an sruthán beag ina seilbh as a dtiocfaidh sruthlú na tíre uilig ar ball.</P>
    <P>Tá sé d'aidhm, freisin, neartú leis an nGaeilge sa mBreac-Ghaeltacht.  Tá fréamhacha na teangan san úir fós sna límistéir sin agus is fusa fás a chur fúithi iontu ná sa nGalltacht.  Tá ceist na Breac-Ghaeltachta ó thaobh an deontais seo de dá hiniúchadh againn agus tá coinne againn le socrú a dhéanamh a chuirfeas borradh san teangain sna ceanntracha sin thar mar atá iontu faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go mba chóir dom tagairt a dhéanamh do na rialacha atá ann i dtaobh Scéim an Dá Phunt.  Cuireadh ar bun é san mbliain 1934.  Is do pháistí san nGaeltacht agus sa mBreac-Ghaeltacht é.  Caithfidh na páistí a bheith idir 6 agus 14 bliain d'aois. Caithfidh an Ghaeilge bheith ina teangain teaghlaigh acu.  Caithfidh siad tinnreamh rialta a dhéanamh ar an scoil agus caithfidh siad dul chun cinn sásúil a dhéanamh ar scoil.  I dteannta na gcoinníollacha eile sin, caithfidh na daltaí féin a bheith ina gcainteoirí líofa Gaeilge.  Go dtí seo gheibheadh tuismitheoirí nó caomhnóirí na bpáistí £2 in aghaidh gach páiste a mbeadh na coinníollacha sin comhlíonta aige.  Tá sin dá árdú anois go dtí £5.  Sar ar cuireadh an scéim ar bun bhí 154 scoltacha cláraithe le bheith sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht&mdash;anois (1946) tá 181 cláraithe mar sin.</P>

      <P>Scoileanna.  Tosnaitear ar an bhfiosrú faoin deontas i leith scoil-bhliana áirithe ar an gcéad lá d'Iúil den scoil-bhliain dár gcionnsan agus leantar de go mbí an obair déanta, ach de ghnáth ní bhíonn críoch leis roimh dheireadh Mhí Meithimh, sin bliain i ndiaidh an deontais a bheith indíolta.  Díoltar na deontais do réir mar thagas tuairisc an fhiosruithe isteach ó na cigirí, sé sin, díoltar na deontais i leith 1944-45 ón gcéad lá de Lúnasa 1945 go dtí 30/6/'46.  Tá beartaithe deontas £5 a dhíol i leith na scoil-bhliana 1945-46 agus freisin é a dhíol i leith gach páiste a bhfuil na gnáth-choinníollacha comhlíonta aige ach an uas-teor aoise a árdú go dtí 16 bliana, sé sin, go ndéanfar an chéad íocaíocht i leith na scoil-bhliana a sroischeann an dalta 7 mbliain d'aois agus an íocaíocht deiridh i leith na scoil-bhliana a sroischeann an dalta 16 bliain d'aois.

      <P>Tá ceisteanna eile le réiteach fós faoin tinnreamh ar mean-scoltacha agus scoileanna gairm-oideachais ach níl na ceisteanna socraithe ar fad.

Go dtí seo, bhí freastal scoile riachtanach, freastal sásúil, agus an Ghaeilge a bheith á labhairt sa mbaile. tá sé deacair ag na cigirí labhairt na Gaeilge sa mbaile a fhiosrú agus is dócha go mbeidh orainn cigirí faoi leith a chur i mbun na hoibre chun dul isteach sa scéal go cruinn, féachaint a bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt acu i ndáríribh agus más gá, dul níos fuide ná scrúdú béil a dhéanamh sna scoiltanach <Col N="2501" /> eanna.

      <P>Ní mar a chéile an tuairim a bhí ag an Aire i dtaobh na Gaeltachta agus na Galltachta i gcomhnaí.  Nuair bhíomar ag cur síos ar an gceist seo i Mí Feabhra dúirt sé:</P>
      <P>Ní dóigh liom go mbraitheann ath-bheochaint na Gaeilge ar an nGæltacht ar fad, agus nílím ar aon intinn leo siúd a abrann go bhfuil an Ghaeilge caillte don naisiún nó gur cúis éadóchais dúinn an teanga do bheith ag trádh sa nGaeltacht.</P>

Cheapas go mbeadh toradh éigin ar an gcaint a rinneamar anso i dtosach na bliana ach is dóigh liom anois ná beidh.  Ní dúirt an tAire go raibh aon mhaitheas in aon chor dá déanamh ag an scéim seo an airgid.  Táim deimhnitheach ná héireoidh linn aon fheabhas do chur ar an nGaeltacht go dtí go gcuirtear suas coiste fé leith den Oireachtas chun cúrsaí na Gaeltachta do scrúdú chun aon rud atá á dhéanamh ann do thabhairt fé ndeara agus an fás nó an meathlú atá ar labhairt na teangan do thuigsint.  Dá bhrí sin, níl mé sásta leis an scéim seo in aon chor.  Níl aon mhachnamh déanta ag an Aire mar gheall air.  Níl a fhios aige cad ba ceart dó a dhéanamh agus deineann sé mar sin roinnt airgid do scaipeadh. Déanfadsa tathaint feasta ar an Dáil coiste ón Oireachtas do chur suas chun gach aon rud a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht do thabhairt faoi ndeara ó bhliain go bliain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing an important question and we ought to be clear about it.  I am taking up the attitude, on this Supplementary Estimate, that I disagree with it, because no thought <Col N="2502" /> has been given to the proposal, good, bad or indifferent, and no information has been given to the House as to what the result has been for the last six, seven or eight years, of the £2 scheme.  The fact is that the number of children in the Irish-speaking districts who are getting the benefits of this grant is reducing every year, and the number of families sending children with pre-school Irish to the schools is reducing every year.  There has not been a word of comment on that in any Departmental report for the past six or seven years.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister, without any suggestion to the House as to what the result of the £2 scheme has been, proposes to increase the age at which children shall get this grant from 14 to 16 years and to increase the grant from £2 to £5.  The idea came originally from pre-1921 days, when Irish people who were interested in the proper running of this country and in the Irish language had no power to do anything beyond taking a direct interest in the Gaeltacht and helping in a monetary way.  Now we have the Fianna Fáil idea&mdash;suim mhór airgid, a big sum of money, which will be spent in order to help the Irish-speaking districts, without any thought of the situation there that requires to be helped or at what particular point the money should be applied, so that the people might live energetic, vigorous and progressive lives and keep their minds alive and the language&mdash;the instrument for expressing their thoughts&mdash;the shapely, refined thing it was.  The old idea, born in the minds of people who had no power to do anything beyond offering money, was not enough.  We now have the typical Fianna Fáil idea of a big sum of money to be spent, but no intelligent indication as to how it should be spent.</P>
    <P>We have already discussed how we could help, through our Government machinery, to get a picture of the Irish-speaking districts and the problem that exists there, economically and educationally, in relation to the preservation of the language as the living language of the people.  We discussed it in February last and I thought, in the end of the Taoiseach's statement, that there was <Col N="2503" /> something that could be done in order to get that picture painted.  We discussed the situation again on the Gaeltacht Services Estimate in April or May.  Now we get this proposal from the Minister to do a thing which, if it was of any use at all, should have been done originally.  For 12 years the Government have applied a scheme by which children from six to 14 years, who attend school and who come from the Irish-speaking homes with Irish, get a £2 grant every year.  If that was any good it should have been continued for the last 12 years, up to 16 years of age, and there ought not to be any inducement or suggestion to parents in the Irish-speaking districts that they could keep their children at home after they reach 14 years.</P>
    <P>If the £2 has done nothing that can be pictured here in the House or in the Reports of the Department of Education, we ought to be given some indication why £5 will do what £2 would not do.  The fact is, however, that the Government have no idea at all of what is happening in the Irish-speaking districts, or what ought to happen there.  The Minister stated on February 22nd that there was a Cabinet sub-committee which kept the position in the Gaeltacht under review from every aspect.  I asked him the following question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Has that committee considered the fact that the areas are declining and that the language is weakening. Has it discussed that aspect of the situation at all?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Well, it has not specifically discussed that aspect, but it has been dealing all the time with the question of advancing Irish in the public administration and co-ordinating and making more useful the various Government activities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an urgent necessity to set up immediately a Committee of the Oireachtas that will be responsible for reviewing what the position in the Gaeltacht areas is, from the point of view of the strength of the Irish language and preserving it as the domestic and home language of the people, and also, the language of their <Col N="2504" /> public life.  The Gaeltacht Commission recommended that that type of commission should be set up.  What is necessary now is that an Oireachtas Committee should be set up for reviewing that position.  They ought to have power to review every aspect of the Gaeltacht and suggest how money might be used to continue a vigorous Irish-speaking people there.  That is a thing that ought to be done.  It is because I think so, from my experience up to now, that I am going to continue to press the Minister on it.  When we look back through the old files of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, which in the dark days of landlordism paid a considerable amount of attention to Ireland, they provided from week to week no pictures of Irish conditions under the pressure of landlordism so sombre or so depressing as a series that appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> dealing with the Blasket Islands.  I ask Deputies to look at them.  There is a picture of the Blaskets schoolhouse, but there are no children and the dog has no playmate.  There is a currach that goes to sea no more because it is used as a roof for a henhouse. There is a picture of the Blaskets last spinning-wheel, and then one of a very old man who, hankering for the sea, is patching a rotten currach just for remembrance, so that it is not completely forgotten.  There is a picture of the Blaskets Post Office, into which a radio was installed some months ago.  Even that was out of order for three or four days recently. That is a picture of the Blasket Islands as they are.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the Gaeltacht Services Estimate I put to the Minister the position in regard to the Blasket Islands on the one hand and the parish of Dunquin that faces it on the other hand.  I said that there was not a cow that had not be brought to the mainland to be served from time to time because there was no bull on the island.  There was a quay at Dunquin which was put up by the Board of Works and access to that quay was by a road going down the side of the cliff, almost similar to running a road from the top of the ceiling to the floor of this House.  I stated that a storm injured the quay a couple of years ago <Col N="2505" /> and swept away a part behind which the currachs lay protected when they came in from the sea.  I said that the cliff had fallen down on the road, and that a cow that went over from the islands had to be helped up the side of the cliff, but that on going back had to wait for a particular state of the tide. The cow had to be got over rocks in particular places and got into the currach to be brought back to the Blaskets.  I asked that the quay which was put up by the Board of Works should be repaired and the road cleared.  The place was bad enough before the cliff fell in.  The answer I got was that it was a matter for Kerry County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to discuss the question of keeping the Irish language as the living language in the Gaeltacht.  I say that it is absurd, simply because you can put your hands into the pockets of the taxpayers, to throw money to people, as you know of no better way of doing something for them, when, with a certain amount of discussion, things that would help could be found.  There was a refusal by the Minister to do anything to follow up the work of the Board of Works that would help the Blasket Islands by giving the people a foothold on which they could land currachs in safety whether for fishing, for sending animals ashore or for their own use. I ask the Minister to realise that in the parish of Dunquin you had some of the finest land in Kerry and some of the best-worked land in Ireland where there was a vigorous, cheerful, hardworking and courageous people who could only get a living from the land and the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as having the quay and access to it attended to I asked for a travelling creamery which would <Col N="2506" /> connect the milk supplies for Ventry and enable the people to develop production of milk and considerably help their agriculture.  That cannot be done and will not be done and the Government's hands go into the pockets of the taxpayers and they throw to the children of Dunquin a few more shillings.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very careful not to say that this scheme had done anything in the past and he was very careful not to say that his present scheme was going to do anything in the future, but it is up to us to repair in some way the Minister's omissions and to see what the Minister is dealing with here.  I have pressed on the educational side for many years for a separate inspectorate for the Gaeltacht.  The Minister introduces a proposal here to assist children going to primary schools and we get thrown in, as if it was a very difficult and very technical business, the idea that he may not confine the giving of this grant to children going to primary schools, but may extend it to secondary schools and to people going to technical or continuation schools. Why can the whole of the educational services of the Gaeltacht not be put under an inspectorate which will be unified and which will cover the whole of the primary and technical schools and any secondary schools which can be linked up with the scheme?</P>
    <P>There is an educational problem here and a psychological problem here, and what could guide the Minister more in seeing what the problem is, from the educational or psychological side, than an inspectorate whose sole job and whose permanent job was to stand over the machinery of education in the districts which are Irish-speaking, or can be made Irish-speaking, and to steep themselves in the language and in educational work for the language, to be a true guide and true help to the educational machine in the district and a true guide and a true help to the Minister in ascertaining what should or could be done and what was succeeding or failing in bringing our people in the Irish-speaking districts the thing they want most, the thing for which they thirst most and the <Col N="2507" /> thing they are most prepared to receive, that is, the highest possible education that men and women can get?</P>
    <P>It is, I suppose, because they have no education but primary education up to the present that the Minister has not thought of mentioning anything but primary education in relation to them until to-night, but when we look at the world outside we realise that even the machine tenders, the manual workers of Great Britain, are expected by statesmen, by trade unionists, by industrialists and by educationists, in their new outlook on these things, to have better than a primary education, to have a secondary and technical education, if they are to be made fit to be manual workers, machine workers or skilled workers of any kind in the new world that is coming. Here, in the Irish-speaking districts, we have merely primary education, with no supervision, except patchwork supervision by inspectors with one leg in English-speaking districts and the other in Irish-speaking districts.  No wonder the Minister cannot guide us in any way as to what he is doing, or cannot be clear in his own mind about what he wants to do for these districts.</P>
    <P>Since 1934, a grant of £2 has been given to the parents of children who, going to school with a knowledge of Irish and coming from an Irish-speaking home, gave satisfactory school attendance and were satisfactory in their school work.  What we have to look at is what has come as a result of that. The matter was first touched upon in the Report of the Department of Education for 1932-33, page 36.  The report says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the Breac-Ghaeltacht only the older people speak Irish, and as these die out the language as a living speech is disappearing with them. In the Gaeltacht the language is still used as the home speech in a very restricted number of areas, but in over two-thirds of the Gaeltacht Irish is dying as the home language, owing to the fact that though the older people know Irish they cannot see any economic value in speaking <Col N="2508" /> it to the children, whereas the economic value of English is selfevident.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Something seemed, therefore, to be needed that would bring home to every household in the Gaeltacht that there is a money value in talking Irish to the children, and after full consideration of all the circumstances, it was felt that there was no way in which this could be done except by the payment of a small annual bonus to the parent (or guardian) for each school-going child in the Gaeltacht or Breac-Ghaeltacht who clearly came to school from an Irish-speaking home, and who as a result was able to speak Irish fluently and naturally. In order to carry this into effect a scheme was formulated by the Minister for Education and particulars of the scheme are outlined in a circular issued early in 1934 to the schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the initiation of the scheme. A year or so passed and in the report for the year 1934-35, page 30, in a reference to the position of Irish as the spoken language in the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht, we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do braitheadh go raibh géar-gádh le chóras d'en t-saghas san mar ba léir go raibh an Ghaedhilg ag meathlughadh i ndiaidh a chéile ina lán áiteanna 'na raibh sí 'na h-aon-teanga nó 'na príomh-theanga go dtí fiche éigin bliadhan ó shoin, agus go raibh an Béarla ag teacht i n-uachtar 'na h-áit...</P>
    <P>Ar a shon nach bhfuil ach breis bheag ar dhá bhliadhain ó deineadh an Scéim do chur ós chomhair an phobail, ní misde a rádh go bhfuil athrughadh tuisciona maidir le labhairt na teangan tagaithe dá barr chun an phobail ins na ceanntracha Gaedhealacha, agus go bhfuil toradh foghanta cheana féin le feidhm na Scéime sin (dá ghiorracht é ó tosnuigheadh léi), chun an Ghaedhilg do chur fé mheas agus í choimeád mar bheo-theangain ins na h-áiteanna fíorGhaedhealacha agus í chur dá labhairt ath-uair i n-áiteanna 'na raibh an Bhéarla ag gabháil nó gabhtha lastuas di go dtí so, tá áiteanna 'na <Col N="2509" /> raibh an Bhéarla le cloisint chomh coitchiannta leis an Gaedhilg dhá bhliadhain ó shoin, go bhfuil an Béarla curtha ar ceal anois ionnta agus áiteanna eile gur fánach an uair go dtí le goirid a cloistí an teanga Gaedhilge ach ó bhéalaibh na seandaoine, agus anois tá an Ghaedhilg á h-úsáid go coitchiannta mar ghnáth-urlabhra 'na lán tighthe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report refers in those words to the fact that this scheme was introduced because English was getting the upper hand in many Irish-speaking districts and that, although it was only a little while since the new scheme was introduced, an appreciable change had been brought about in the speaking of the language, that there was a great result already in bringing back respect for the language and in keeping it alive and that whereas, before that, in a number of places one heard Irish only from the mouths of the old people, it was now the general language of conversation in these places.</P>
    <P>In the report for 1935-36, at page 31, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bíodh go bhfuil ceist aithbheochana na Gaedhilge ós cómhair an Phobail le breis is dachad bliadhan agus iarracht mhór déanta chun an teanga do chur san áit is dual di sa tír mar theanga labhartha na ndaoine, caithfear a admháil nár chuaidh brigh an scéil sin i bhfeidhm puinn le linn na h-aimsire sin ar mhuinntir na Gaedhealtachta.  Is amhlaidh a bhí an teanga ag dul cun deiridh i ndiaidh a chéile mar ghnáth-urlabhra ins na liomatáistí sin agus an Béarla ag teacht na h-áit.</P>
    <P>Ba léir, dá leanfadh an scéil amhlaidh sa nGaedhealtacht, go mbeadh tobar na fíor-Ghaedhilge imthighthe i ndísc i gcionn aimsire, agus do braitheadh nár bh'fholáir córas do cheapadh chun an dísc sin do chosc, agus ar an adhbhar san, do cheap an t-Aire Oideachais an Scéim seo, an Deontas £2...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An scoil-bhliadhain 1933-34 an chéad bhliadhain gur cuireadh an scéim i bhfeidhm, agus is áthas leis an Roinn gur féidir a rádh go bhfuil an Scéim seo ag déanamh a <Col N="2510" /> chion le h-éifeacht chun an chuspóir gur ceapadh chuige í do thabhairt chun críche, sé sin, an Ghaedhilg do choimeád mar ghnáth-theanga an phobail ins na liomatáistí 'na bhfuil sí acu go fóill, agus í d'aithbheochaint agus í neartughadh mar theanga i saoghal na ndaoine ins na h-áiteanna 'na raibh an Ghaedhilg ag dul ar ceal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It can be said that the year 1935-36 was the highest year for the number of children coming under the scheme.  In that year, there were 11,061 children benefiting under the scheme.  In the report for the year 1936-37, at page 23, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sar ar cuireadh an scéim ar bun bhí an Béarla ag brughadh isteach ar an nGaedhealtacht diaidh ar ndiaidh i n-aimhdheóin gach a ndearnadh go dtí san ins na scoileanna agus tré scéimeanna eile a cuireadh ar bun ar mhaithe leis an dteanga náisiúnta.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, we find:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tá neartuighthe go mór ar an nGaedhilg mar ghnáth-urlabhra ins na ceanntracha Gaedhealacha de thoradh an chórais seo agus tá a lán tighthe 'na bhfuil an teanga Gaedhilge mar aon-teanga teaghlaigh anois dá dheasca, rud nach mbeadh amhlaidh mar a mbeadh an deontas £2.  Sul ar cuireadh an córas so ar bun 151 scoileanna a bhí cláruighthe fé riaghail 121 (1) mar scoileanna sa bhFhíor Ghaedhealtacht, mar leanas, 64 i dTír Chonaill, 15 i gCondae Mhuigheó, 50 i gCondae na Gaillimhe, 15 i gCondae Chiarraighe, 6 i gCondae Chorcaighe agus 1 i gCondae Phortlairge.  Ó cuireadh an córas so an Deontais i bhfeidhm tá méaduighthe go 171 ar an uimhir scoileanna san atá cláruighthe anois mar scoileanna sa bhFhíor-Ghaedhealtacht. Ní mór a rádh nach gcláruighthear Scoil mar Scoil sa bhFhíor Ghaedhealtacht go dtí gur dearbh do'n Roinn gur ceanntar 'na labhartar an Ghaedhilg mar gnáththeanga teaghlaigh go coitcheannta ceanntar na scoile sin, agus gurb í an Gaedhilg amháin, nó go háirithe gur fearr Gaedhilg ná Béarla, a bhíonn ag na páistí óga ag dul ar scoil dóibh an chéad lá.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2511" /> In the report for 1937-38, at page 25, we find:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tá de thoradh na scéime seo go bhfuil an meath a bhí ag teacht ar an Ghaedhilg sa bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht coiscithe agus go bhfuil an Ghaedhilg á labhairt anois mar ghnáth-theanga 'na lán tighthe sa Ghaedhealtacht agus sa mBreac-Ghaedhealtacht nach raibh á labhairt ionnta ach an Béarla sar a cuireadh scéim an Deontais £2 ar bun.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the blinds were pulled down for two years on nearly everything in the Department of Education except statistics, but the statistics did not apply to the position of Irish in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>We come then to the year 1940-41 and at page 19 of the report, under the heading, &ldquo;Staid na Gaeilge&rdquo;, we find:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Scéim iseadh é seo a chuir an tAire Oideachais ar bun sa scoil-bhliadhain 1933-34 d'fhon cosc do chur le meathlú na Gaedhilge ins na ceanntracha Gaedhealacha, agus labhairt na teangan do leathanú ionnta le muinntir na gceanntracha san do ghríosadh chun gan ach an Gaedhilg amháin do labhairt le na gcloinn.</P>
    <P>'Siad so na coingheallacha atá riachtanach chun an Deontas do thuilleamh:&mdash;</P>

In the first place, in a district, a broad, scattered district, where normally the families were large, the average number of children per family benefiting under this scheme is less than two.  The Minister for Finance went down to Meath the other day and spoke of what the Gaeltacht in Meath and in the other districts throughout the country mean.  He said, as reported in English in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;the Irish version is there, too&mdash;that there has been a great change in the country within the last 30 years and that he was sure the majority of the Irish people would be speaking the language within the next 20 years.  He spoke enthusiastically about the position in regard to Meath.  The position with regard to Meath is that whereas in the <Col N="2513" /> year 1936-37 there were 124 children from 53 families benefiting under this scheme, and in the year 1937-38 there were 132 children out of 58 families benefiting under the scheme, in the year 1943-44, the last year that we have been able to quote figures for here, there are only 90 children from 43 families.  That is Meath.</P>

      <P>Is fuiriste é sin a thuigsint ach ní neartú na Gaeilge ansan é.  We will next deal with Kerry.  Deputies will find the information in table 8 of volume 8 on the Irish language&mdash;where it gives information as to the number of Irish speakers in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and in the Breac-Ghaeltacht in certain counties.  In Kerry, the 1936 census showed that in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht there were 35,024 Irish speakers.  Normally from a population of that particular kind one would expect to find one-sixth of the population of the school-going age, 6 to 14, that is, about 6,000 persons. What has been happening in Kerry is that in the year 1935/36, which were the two years after the scheme had been started for which there was generally the highest figure, the figures for children and families in Kerry were 1,266 children coming in under the scheme, from 560 families.  In 1941 there were only 879 children out of 409 families and in 1944 there were only 677 children out of 335 families.  That was against a background claimed by the 1936 census of 35,024 Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht of Kerry.</P>
      <P>In regard to Donegal, the census of 1936 disclosed that there were 43,946 persons, Irish speakers, in the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht of Donegal in the year 1935/36.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1935-6 4,007 children benefited under the Minister's scheme from 1,942 families.  In the year 1941 it was 3,725 children out of 1,855 families.  In the year 1944 it was 3,447 children out of 1,794 families.  That is, on those figures that for every 100 children receiving benefit under the scheme in the year 1936 only 86 were receiving it in Donegal in the year 1944.  As I say, <Col N="2514" /> the background was that there was recorded in Donegal 43,900 persons and there ought to have been about 7,000 children in the Donegal Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht receiving these benefits.  In Mayo, the census of 1936 reported that there were 43,287 Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht of that county.  In Mayo in the year 1944 there were only 77 per cent. of the children getting the benefit as compared with 1936.  In 1936 1,835 children from 760 families were getting benefit.  In 1941 you had 1,411 children from 1,423 families.  In 1944 it was 1,184 children from 645 families, a reduction to 77 per cent. of the children and 84 per cent. of the families.  In Galway the census of 1936 showed that there were 67,276 Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht of Galway which would lead one to expect that there ought to have been about 11,000 children between the ages of 6 and 14 getting the benefit of this scheme.  In the year 1936 there were only 3,659 children from 1,690 families.  In the year 1941 there were 3,856 children from 1,692 families.  In the year 1944 there were 3,540 children from 1,544 families, being 97 per cent. of the children and 91 per cent. of the families of 1936; but with a Gaeltacht background behind them which would lead one to expect at least 11,000 children there.  In Cork, the 1936 census discloses that Cork had 20,570 speakers in the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht.  In the year 1936 there were 348 children from 167 families coming under the Minister's scheme.  In 1941 there were 378 out of 200 families; and in 1944 there were 344 out of 196 families.</P>
    <P>In Waterford, the census showed that the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht had 1,100 speakers.  In 1936 only 180 children from 93 families were under the scheme.  In 1941 there were 181 children from 90 families; and in 1944 there were 144 children from 79 families.  You had only 77 per cent. of the children of 1936 and 87 per cent. of the families.  In Clare where the census showed that there were 17,124 Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht you had in 1936 four children from 72 families; in 1941 you had 12 children from five families; <Col N="2515" /> and in 1944 you had five children from four families.  If these figures are looked at, it will be understood why there is nothing to report in the way of progress in the recent reports of the Department of Education.  But surely there is enough to demand some report, some account, some explanation and some suggestion in the Report of the Department of Education!  When you talk about figures for the schools, even if these figures had been maintaining themselves under the influence of the scheme, and you relate them to the background of Irish speakers said by the census report to be in the Irish-speaking districts of these counties, then there is more than a school problem there.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why a grant of £2 or £5 should be given, say, to school children in Dunquin or anywhere else and not to the Tomás Ó Criomhthain's and Peig Sayer's who are the real monuments not only of the Irish language but of the Irish mind and the Irish character, speaking in the traditions of the past, carrying back the mind of the race through the language, unbroken in its use as a vernacular and as a literary medium in these districts for over 2,000 years.  We want to help the people in the Irish-speaking districts to have a vigorous and healthy life.  We want to see that in modern days they will be able to preserve some of the character, some of the maturity of mind, some of the delicacy of mind of those who are conversant with the Irish-speaking districts which the older people appreciate so much and long so much to spread back over this country, as the Minister would like to spread the waters from the Irish-speaking stream over the rest of the country.  Surely that is a problem.  I find it a ghastly business to look at the pictures in the <i>Irish Press</i> to-day, to see the proposal before us to-day, and to see the Minister's approach to it.  I say that this is leading us nowhere.</P>
    <P>Speaking in February here, the Taoiseach thanked God that there was no aspect of the Irish question a Party question.  It is not a Party question in this House.  But this kind of blind procedure, <Col N="2516" /> without rhyme or reason, without looking at achievement, without looking at failure, but simply dipping the Government's hand into the people's pockets and throwing out some kind of largesse to unfortunate people who cannot make up their minds what else they ought to do is bringing the Irish language into disrepute and into a Party political position.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance speaking in County Meath the other day said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is maith an rud go bhfuil Gaeltachta againn san iarthar agus i gCondae na Midhe.  Tá siad mar `hedgehog position'.  Coimeádfaidh siad an caighdeán ceart le go dtiocfaidh fórsaí na Gaeilge ón nGalltacht.  Acht ní cheart dúinn fanamhaint ró-fhada leis an ionnsuidhe mhór leathan a dhéanamh ar an mBéarla nó béidh muintir na Gaeltachta báite.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister gives a grant to Irish-speaking children in Meath and to Irish-speaking children in the Gaeltacht and he thinks he will continue it to Irish-speaking children who go from non-Irish speaking districts to the Gaeltacht in order to go to school there.  But, if there is this idea in so many people's minds that the Gaeltacht position is only holding out until somebody from the rising Irish forces in the Galltacht comes to their assistance, what is being done for the people in the Galltacht who are rearing Irish-speaking families in Irish homes, or as near Irish-speaking homes as we can get?  My early struggle with the Department of Education was to get it to recognise that there were people in the City of Dublin maintaining Irish-speaking homes and bringing up children in Dublin with Irish as their first vernacular.  We wanted schools in which these children would be accepted as coming from Irish-speaking homes.  We wanted schools where Irish would be completely the language of the school, and Irish completely the home language of the children going to the schools.  The Department at the time, the officials and the teachers, did us out of that position.</P>
    <P>It is not a fact that an Irish-speaking parent in the City of Dublin, bringing up children in an Irish-speaking home can find a school to which he can send <Col N="2517" /> his children and be certain that the other children with whom they associate in the school are children coming from Irish-speaking homes. Although £5 per head can be given to children in the Gaeltacht in order to maintain the language in the homes, no recognition will be given here in Dublin to that fact, even to the extent of providing these people with a school of that kind; no recognition will be given to the people who are mobilising the forces from the Galltacht who are to march to the hedgehog Gaeltacht position some day or another.  I suggest to Deputy Ó Briain that the schools he talks about are actually being destroyed and neglected by the Department of Education.  If he is speaking of the girls' school, Sgoil Mhuire, or the boys' school, Sgoil Colmcille, the latter is nearly dead and the former is neglected.  Why are we so concerned to-day about giving money as a kind of bribe to people in certain districts to speak Irish, while we will not give educational facilities of a proper kind to Irish-speaking children in other districts?</P>
    <P>There are all kinds of things that require to be attended to.  In my opinion, it would be much more important that the people in Dunquin, Gweedore or Lettermore would realise that there was a Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas reviewing the whole Gaeltacht position from month to month and prepared to do it from year to year, with power to get information from the various Departments, to supervise the various Departments, and, with their information and an intelligent outlook, to visit the various districts and see that the economy of the district was looked after.  It seems to me to be an insult to our intelligence to have to look at the pictures of the Blasket Islands to-day in the <i>Irish Press</i> and to have echoing in our ears the answers of the Minister for Gaeltacht services, however well meaning he may be, when they want the pier or the roads at Dunquin repaired or a few pounds to provide a travelling creamery from Ventry to serve the Dunquin area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not seem to know, and if I am to get that answer I would like to get it from a Minister who has some responsibility for Gaeltacht services generally and not from the Deputy, however accurate his information may be.  I think I am as close to the Dunquin situation as Deputy Ó Briain.  I think it is insulting our intelligence to suggest that you can throw £5 now instead of £2 into a scheme under which numbers of families and numbers of children will be part of the living machinery, maintaining as a home language, the Irish language; it is insulting to our intelligence to suggest that you can throw money into such a scheme and neglect the economic situation.  It would be well if perhaps even a fraction of the money could be spent for economic purposes.  It would also be well to know that there was some kind of machinery here, with full Parliamentary prestige and authority and non-Party&mdash;that a committee like that was reviewing the situation and seeing that proper things were done.  I think that is an essential thing before we run into further wasteful years, throwing money on schemes which, however good and charitable, are doing nothing to save the situation.</P>

    <P>I will refer Deputies to the report of the Gaeltacht Commission, where there were recommendations that a special commission should be set up. I will refer them to paragraph 82 of the statement of Government policy on recommendations of the commission. Dealing with the recommendation that a special commission be set up charged with duty of seeing that all Departments carry out in detail the Government's policy with <Col N="2519" /> regard to the language in the Gaeltacht, paragraph 82 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With the objects underlying all these recommendations&mdash;namely that the Gaeltacht requires special attention from the point of view of its economic and industrial development, and that there should be a competent authority to co-ordinate the special activities of the various Departments in the Gaeltacht area&mdash; the Government are in complete accord.  They have given very earnest consideration to the three methods outlined and they have come to the conclusion that the objects in view could be more effectively and efficiently secured by assembling, under the control of a Minister of State, the principal services, e.g., land purchase and division, fisheries and rural industries, which cater specially for the economic needs of the congested districts in which the Gaeltacht areas are to be found.  An arrangement of this nature supplemented by a scheme of close co-operation with the various Departments responsible for education, agricultural instruction, housing, health, etc., will provide the special attention and coordination which is necessary, and will at the same time be free from certain disabilities which would unavoidably be associated with the setting up of a special commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Fisheries have been divided from land purchase; rural industries are still connected with land purchase, but we are in the position that when we discuss Gaeltacht services here the Minister can repudiate that he is particularly responsible for fisheries or agriculture in the area.  Whatever may be the kind of Cabinet Committee dealing with the matter, and whatever may be the special attention given by the various Departments to the Gaeltacht, it is perfectly clear that if the situation is to be properly reviewed and discussed in a constructive way you need to have now set up a special permanent committee of both Houses that will be given power to review and get information with regard to what has been done in the Irish-speaking districts <Col N="2520" /> from the various aspects of economics and education.</P>
    <P>To come to the House with no proposal to review the educational machinery in the Gaeltacht, no proposal to connect up in any way primary and technical education and technical and secondary education, or review the educational position generally, and particularly with no proposal to join all together under a unified inspectorial system is not satisfactory.  To come without any proposal of that kind and merely to propose an increase from £2 to £5, at a very late hour in the day, cannot be regarded as sufficient.  The scheme to raise the school-leaving age from 14 to 16 and to ignore any position with regard to the child below six years of age, is treating a very vital and important subject in a most perturbed and almost in a degrading way. We simply have, in relation to a question of vital importance that has many difficult stages, a Government unable to make up its mind what to do, dipping its hands into the public purse, and throwing a few more shillings into the Irish-speaking districts. The Irish-speaking districts do not want that.</P>

      <P>Ní raibh súil agam go mbeadh gach gné de shaol na Gaeltachta faoi dhíospóireacht ar an Bhóta breise seo.  Thagair an Teachta Ó Maolchatha do na Blascaodaí, a raibh scéal ar an bpáipéar fúthu inniu.  Is sean-scéal é na daoine a bheith ag tréigean na n-oileán beag atá gar don chósta.  Ní féidir saol iomlán compóir-deach a bheith ag na daoine ar oileán chumhang agus imíonn siad as nuair a fhoghann siad seans cur fúthu ar an mór-thír.  Agus féach sompla Inis Gé ar chósta Mhuigheo Thuaidh tar éis an timpiste mhóir i 1927.  D'aistrigh an Rialtas go dtí an mór-thír uilig iad.  Dá mbeadh an chumhacht agamsa, d'aistreoinn muintir na Gaeltachta ar fad go dtí na tailte bána, áit a dhféadfaidís saothrú ceart a bheith acu as an talmhaíocht i leaba a bheith ag stracadh le mangarae de slite maireachtála: obair chladaigh, iascaireacht, bóithre, saothar na bportach is na leacracha agus pé ar bith cabhair atá le fáil ó na hÚdaráis Poiblí.  Ach ní fheicim go <Col N="2521" /> dtiocfaidh sé sin.  Admhaím go ndearna an Rialtas roinnt sa treo sin &mdash;chuireadar cóilínteachta ar bun ar an talamh maith.  Is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil ag éirí leo go breá agus go bhfuil saol níos deisiúla acu agus níos mó de mhaoin an tsaoil ná mar a bhí acu ar an leic nó ar an gcriathrach thiar.</P>
      <P>Muran féidir iad a aistriú go dtí feilmeacha maithe agus muran féidir lán-fhostaíocht a sholáthar dóibh san áit a bhfuil siad, caithfidh an Rialtas teacht i gcabhair orthu ar bhealaigh eile.  Agus ceann acu é seo.  Is mór an cúnamh é an dá phunt a mhéadú go cúig.  Ach an taobh is ionmholta dhe an scéim a leathnú amach go dtí an Bhreac-Ghaeltacht.  Mholas an leathnú seo don Aire go minic sa Dáil agus go príobháideach, mar b'fhacthas dom go raibh an Gaeilge sábháilte go maith sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht agus gur mhór an claidhe cosanta uirthi an fód a sheasamh sna ceanntracha máguairt. Mar sin, molaim an taobh nua seo den Scéim go hárd.</P>
      <P>Bhíos ag cruinniú sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht le gairid agus d'fhiafraíos díobh an raibh a bhfuil ráite fíor, go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul síar ina mease. D'fhreagradar is dúirt go mbeadh dóthan Gaeilge le fáil sa nGaeltacht go deo ag an dream a mbeadh suim acu inti, ach go mba mhór an t-ábhar misnigh dóibh agus go laghdódh sé a dtóir ar an mBéarla dá bhfeicidis níos mó dúthrachta is dílseachta don Ghaeilge taobh amuigh.  Chuireadar i gcás dá mbeadh scannán cainte dhá léiriú i mbaile mór éigin agus na daoine ag plúchadh isteach lena fheiceáil.  Is fánach a bheith ag spreacadh muintir na Gaeltachta ón taobh amuigh, ach molfaidh siad an dea-shompla.</P>

      <P>Ach is é mo bharúil nach ndéanfa sé seo an mhaith atámuid a iarraidh a dhéanamh don Ghaeltacht&mdash;leis na daoine a choinneáil sa mbaile ann mura ndéantar tuille ina theannta, ar nós muilte a chur ar bun, agus go leor oibreacha eile.  Is féidir go leor a dhéanamh má chuireann daoine a gcroí leis.  Sin é an spirid mar thuig mise ón gcaint a rinne an Teachta Ó Maolchatha. Ná ceapadh duine ar bith gur grá Dia ná rud ar bith mar é an deontas seo.  Ní hea, ach beagán beag bídeach den cheart a dhlíos muid a fháil.  Tá a fhios ag gach duine sin: nach mbeadh an Teach seo faoin stiúradh a bhfuil sé inniu marach an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht agus an spirid ghríosuithe sin arb í an Ghaeltacht an loch as a dtagann sí; mar nuair a chuaigh an dream óg úd fadó go dtí an Ghaeltacht neartaigh sí ar an spirid a bhí iontu roimhe.</P>
      <P>Níl aimhreas ar bith nó tá páistí na Gaeltachta níos aibí agus níos scafánta maidir le rud a fhoghlaim ná na páistí as aon chuid eile den tír; agus aon scoláireachtaí agus aon deis scolaíochta is féidir ba cheart sin a thabhairt dóibh.

      <P>Rud eile, gach uile dhuine a bhfuil an Ghaeilge aige ba cheart dó í labhairt. Go leor daoine a ndearna an Ghaeilge fír dhíobh ní ligeap an uaibhre dhó í labhairt anois.  Sin cathú mór ar an nGaeilge agus is mór an malldeireadh é ar an nGaeilge nuair ba cheart do na daoine seo bród a bheith orthu í labhairt.  Tá faitíos orm, agus tá aiféala orm é bheith le rá agam, gur olc an sompla atá tugtha maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge le trí bliana fichead anuas sa Teach seo.  Ar aon chor, má imíonn sí as an nGaeltacht níl aon ghnotha a bheith ag súil go mairfe sí ná go ngabhfa sí ar aghaidh in áit ar bith den tír.

Ní móide go mbeadh neart ag an athair nó ag an máthair air agus dá mbeadh an Ghaeilge go maith ag an bpáiste ba mhór an t-abhar misnigh don pháiste an deontas a thabhairt dó agus, aríst ar ais, ba mhór an chúis mí-mhisnigh dhó an deontas a choinneáil uaidh agus gan é féin ina chiontsiocair leis. Anois ó támid as an gcoill agus sinn ar an réiteach maidir leis an nGaeilge, ba cheart dúinn go léir teacht le chéile ó gach taobh den Teach seo, lámh a chraitheadh le chéile agus oibriú i gcomhar lena tabhairt slán agus lena cur in áirde mar is dual di.</P>

Táimid ag caint anseo faoin scéim seo a bhí ar siúl againn agus tuigim go maith an díomá atá ar an Teachta Ua Maolchatha agus a thaispeán sé nuair a bhí an cheist faoi dhíospóireacht againn cheana féin sa Dháil, faoin laghdú atá tagaithe ar an líon Gaeilgeóirí sa tír.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, caithfidh mé a rá nach féidir, nuair a bhreathnaíos tú an scéal go cúramach, lán-muinín a bheith agat as na figiúirí a bailítear ó am go ham.  Tá <Col N="2524" /> na figiúirí a bhailigh Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ann agus na figiúirí ón Daonáireamh ina dhiaidh sin agus beidh figiúirí eile ar fáil de thoradh an chéad Daonáirimh eile, is dócha.  Ní féidir linn a bheith cinnte gur fíor iad agus go dtugann siad peictúir ceart dúinn.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Ua Maolchatha tagairt don cheist agus é ag caint ar an scéal cheana féin&mdash;go bhfuil tim-peall le 14,000 daoine sa Ghaeltacht. Sílim gurb é sin an figiúir a bhí ann, ach do réir na figiúirí atá againn maidir leis an scéim seo, níl leath an méid sin ann.  Tá an triobláid sin ann freisin dá ndearnas tagairt, sé sin, go bhfuil na ceantracha a bhíodh aontheangach, dá-theangach.  Nuair is maith leo í do labhairt, labhrann na daoine an Ghaeilge agus cleachtann siad an Ghaeilge, ach mar sin féin iompaíonn siad ar an mBéarla anois agus arís.  Do réir na bhfigiúirí atá agam anois, bhí tuitim sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht maidir leis an líon páistí a bhí ag freastal scoile i mblian 1943-44 i gcomparád le 1933-34 de 16.9 faoin gcéad.  Sin 17 faoin gcéad, beagnach, de thuitim, i rith na ndeich mblian ach má thógann tú na páistí a fuair an deontas £2 níl an tuitim chomh mhór agus atá sé ar an tinnrimh.  Tá laghdú 11.5 faoin gcéad ann agus gidh go bhfuil an laghdú dona go leor, nuair a chuimhníos tú ar an tuitim sa tír ar fad, níl sé go ró-dhona.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should refer to this briefly in English.  A good example has been given in dealing with this matter in Irish, and I am <Col N="2525" /> glad we have shown that at some time, the national Assembly can also give an example, and that there is a sufficient number of Deputies interested in the Irish language who, acquainted with the Gaeltacht and its problems, are in a position to discuss it in our national language.  I think that nothing could reflect more discredit on us an as Assembly, or lower our prestige more than to reach a position where we would only hear Irish on infrequent occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could only say sensible things in it too, it would be a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the kind of remark that does not get us anywhere. We can say precisely the same thing sensibly in Irish as in English.  I want to refer briefly to the position about the decline in the numbers of Irish speakers.  Taking the number of children attending schools in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, that is, the Irish-speaking areas proper, I find that between the years 1933-34 to 1943-44 there was a fall in the attendance figure of 16.9 per cent.  During the corresponding years the figures for the country as a whole were 11.5 of a decrease, but if we take out the City of Dublin, and regard the remainder of the country as being more comparable, being in the main rural, we find there is a fall of 15.1 per cent. If we compare 15.1 per cent., representing the fall in the country outside Dublin, and the 16.9 per cent. in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, considering that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht are the most isolated, most congested and poorest areas, the wonder is that the decrease has not been greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently Deputy Mulcahy has it in mind that I should be able to justify this scheme by pointing to the fact, let us say, that there has been an increase, or that I should be able to give a picture&mdash;which I am not able to give &mdash;of increases in some measure in the number of Irish-speaking persons in Irish-speaking areas.  I cannot give that.  As I pointed out, the rural population, unfortunately, is declining. The numbers attending our schools are falling all over the country.  Schools <Col N="2526" /> that had four teachers in prosperous areas&mdash;30 years ago or less than 30 years ago&mdash;have now only two teachers. That has to be taken into consideration. In almost any rural area that would apply.  I think it would be wiser to assume that if we had not this scheme in operation the decline would be much greater.  There have been no references, perhaps, to the scheme, or not ones that would satisfy Deputies, in recent years because of emergency conditions, but those who have visited the Gaeltacht areas, for example, one of my colleagues who spent a holiday in Aran was able to tell me that from his personal experience, and from what he learned there, Irish was being spoken again by young people going into local shops, where that had ceased before the scheme came into operation. I have heard also from the clergy, from inspectors and other persons, in whose knowledge I could have confidence, that an amount of good has been done in that way, and that where the Irish language might have perished it has been maintained.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately in some areas like West Cork the position is very, very serious indeed.  If we were to regard the figures given in the Gaeltacht Commission's report, as representing the real position in West Cork area at that time, and take the figures in the £2 scheme, and the returns made by the schools, we would conclude that Irish had practically disappeared in that part.  I think the position has been that it was not so strong as we thought at that time&mdash;more than 20 years ago &mdash;and during that interval, of course, the daily newspapers, the radio, visitors, motor cars, and the amount of travelling has greatly extended.  Even during the emergency, obviously, the very large numbers of people who left these areas to seek employment outside the country, must have reduced the numbers, and altered what must have been the normal trend in peacetime. With the ending of the emergency, the fact is that we are going to have normal travel conditions again, and a large number of visitors coming here whose main anxiety will be to get food.  They will not mind even if they have to go to very isolated areas <Col N="2527" /> if they can get health and rest.  There is a greater danger there, I fear, than there was from emigration during the emergency period.</P>
    <P>I am hoping that the extension of this scheme, and the increased grant, will show the people of the Gaeltacht that the Government are most anxious to encourage the speaking of Irish in every way they possibly can.  I hope we shall have the co-operation of all Parties and all Deputies.  It is not a Government matter or a Fianna Fáil matter.  It is a great national question, in which we can all do our part, and I am sure all Deputies would like to assist in the revival of the Irish language.  But if we do not go to the people who know Irish, or who are in a position to know it, and to give it to their children in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht, if we do not preach to them the gospel that they should be proud of their native language, that they should cherish it, that they will not lose anything by making the acquisition of Irish, and the improvement of Irish by their children, a special qualification; that if they would concentrate on keeping the Irish language, at least, in the position it occupies in these areas, far from losing economically or materially, they will gain materially, not alone through their families, but in opportunities of employment that the young people will have later on.</P>
    <P>The whole area will, probably, gain if, as we hope, scholarship schemes like those of Coiste na Páisde, and other schemes which, I hope, will come along, are set on foot to enable our young people, who have left school to go back to refresh themselves in the Gaeltacht areas.  Undoubtedly, from the strictly financial point of view, there will be a very material advantage in the Irish language.  It is unfortunate that we have to concentrate so much on that aspect of the matter&mdash;showing the people in the Gaeltacht areas that they will not be at a loss; quite the contrary.  It would be much better if we could appeal and if we were likely to succeed in appealing to their sense of pride in their country and to their sense of what is right and <Col N="2528" /> proper.  But there, as Deputy Mac Phartoláin has pointed out, our example is likely to gain more than our precept.  If we ourselves give them a good example they are more likely to follow it and be guided by us than if we preach some doctrine which we do not follow out ourselves, particularly if we are people in responsible positions and people of influence in the community. I hope that we shall have the co-operation of all Parties and of all sections in this matter and that we shall not have&mdash;as the Taoiseach requested we should not have when we had this question of the Gaeltacht before us some months ago&mdash;any pulling in opposite directions.  I think we cannot afford to dissipate our energies. We may feel that there are better ways of approaching the matter and better schemes that might be adopted; but, at any rate, this scheme has been there for some time.  It is now being extended and improved.  A greater effort will be made to extend it into the partly Irish-speaking, or Breac-Ghaeltacht, areas.  I think that if the Deputies representing those areas would co-operate with us we would be more likely to get better results.  I think that, as I said in the opening statement, we shall probably have to appoint special inspectors to deal with this scheme.  There is the difficulty of having different branches of the service. I do not know whether Deputy Mulcahy has adverted to the fact that we have technical, secondary and primary inspectors and it would not be an easy matter to combine inspection under the different branches of the service under a small number of inspectors. But we have not lost sight of the fact and we have not come to any conclusion against it.</P>

      <P>But, surely, education&mdash;primary, secondary and technical &mdash;in the Irish-speaking districts should blend into one.  Is not education up to, say, 18 years of age in nearly every country in the world blending into the one scheme?  Could not we, particularly in the Irish-speaking districts, blend our educational scheme into one whole?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take some time. At the moment the position is as I have stated.  But we have not lost sight of the fact that the present scheme may give us an opportunity of developing along that line.  The Deputy urged that we should set up a Committee of the Oireachtas to examine this whole question.  I have explained already that a Committee of the Government has been examining into this matter from time to time and is examining it closely at the present moment.  We are not examining it from the point of view of finding statistics in which, perhaps, we could not place very great faith&mdash;no matter how they were procured. We are examining it rather from the point of view of seeing what can be done, not alone in regard to the educational side, but also in regard to the economic side in which the Deputy is also interested.  Deputy Mac Phartoláin referred to the question of the Breac-Ghaeltacht and suggested that there is a difficulty in parents availing of this scheme because they may not be able to speak Irish.  As far as I know, the position is that if one parent speaks Irish to the children, and if the children have a sufficient knowledge of Irish to satisfy the inspector that Irish is their ordinary natural language and that they can speak it fairly fluently, they are eligible to receive the grant.  I think that has always been the position.  I do not know that we can go further than that.  Obviously, one of the parents, or one of the guardians, of the children must be able to speak Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be impossible, I fear, to have an oral examination in Irish for the thousands of pupils who would be taking the primary certificate examination. We can only rely on the inspectors to check the standard of oral Irish in the schools in the same way as they <Col N="2530" /> do in the secondary schools.  It would be quite impossible to have an oral examination in the primary schools. The practice there is that the inspector examines the pupils to the extent that time permits.  Whenever he is examining the teachers' work and inspecting the school generally, he takes the opportunity then of testing the oral knowledge of the pupils.  I do not know whether the Deputy was serious in pressing the point about the Blasket Islands.  Deputy Bartley referred to the fact that people on one of the islands left the island some years ago when there was a very big fishing disaster.  During the initial period of my term in office there was one teacher endeavouring to carry on in the Blasket Islands school.  The number of pupils was very small&mdash;certainly less than ten&mdash;and we did everything possible to maintain the teacher while there was any school population there.  It was quite clear, however, since there had been no marriage on the island for a very long time, that the population was eventually going to disappear. At best, the population was a small one, but it was very, very important from the language point of view. So many other circumstances were operating against its maintaining itself that I do not see how the position that has now arisen could have been avoided; and it is not to-day, or yesterday, that the <i>Irish Press</i> might have discovered the real position about the Blasket Islands.  I think they might have discovered it ten or 15 years ago.</P>

      <P>Nothing in this section shall be deemed as continuing in force after the operative date the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 169) Order, 1942.</P>
      <P>The reference in the White Paper that was issued runs like this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;These Orders prohibit the cutting down or uprooting or lopping of trees standing within 30 feet of the centre of any road.  The powers were taken in order to maintain cover and facilities for road blocking provided by roadside trees.  It is considered <Col N="2533" /> that in any future conflict trees along the principal roads will be an even greater factor in defence than they were in the past and that the preservation of trees bordering those roads is a vital military necessity. Proposals for permanent legislation and for State schemes of roadside planting are at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to retain these Orders with the exception of Article 4 of the principal Order which empowers commanding officers of the Defence Forces to prohibit the felling or boughing or lopping of trees more than 30 feet from the road centre.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from page 16 of the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.  Can we not have a little bit of commonsense or even a little sense of humour?  Under another Estimate we are to have a substantially larger Army than we had in the past.  Now we have developed some military theories during the war, and one is that the trees along the principal roads are to be a greater factor in defence in the future than they were in the past.  What are we going to do with the country if we are to put up monuments along our principal roads for some future conflict?  The life will be scared out of the people going along the country roads when they pass under the leafy shades and think that these would not be there but for the fact that some future conflict is expected when all the new weapons that are to be let loose will be coming down on the tops of these trees.  The Department of Local Government was always insistent in the past that roadside trees damaged roads and added very considerably to the cost of maintenance. Now, in order to protect ourselves against some future conflict, we propose to establish a regular system of tree plantation along the principal roads that will be injurious to the roads which are to be used for ordinary traffic and for the necessary transport. We are going to seize private property <Col N="2534" /> in the shape of trees and to invade private property for further tree planting in the future.  I do not know whether the Minister for Defence has persuaded the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this is a vitally necessary proposal, but I think it is one of the most ridiculous proposals we could possibly have and I think that we should dispense with these powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to enter into an argument with the Deputy on the soundness of the military theory concerning the value of roadside trees in defence.  The Army authorities regard them as important.  Trees have this peculiarity, that they take from 20 to 40 years to grow and, if cut down now, could not be replaced in any foreseeable time.  If the Order prohibiting the cutting of roadside trees were to be repealed now, I think it is very likely that in the present fuel situation a very large number of them would be cut down, and that reason alone justifies the retention of this Order for the present.  Whether the permanent legislation foreshadowed in the memorandum will be produced is, I think, dependent upon the outcome of discussions which are proceeding between the Department of Defence and the Department of Local Government.  It is quite true that the engineers of the Department of Local Government have been in the past perturbed at the effect upon road maintenance of trees overhanging a road.  But I think that agreement has been reached between the military experts of the Department of Defence and the road experts of the Department of Local Government on a programme which will serve both their purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme contemplates a State grant or other form of State aid to encourage the planting of trees in the vicinity of roads.  I gather from inquiries I have made that the Defence authorities do not consider it necessary that the trees should overhang the road, but that there should be plenty of cover in the vicinity of the road from the point of view of concealing the <Col N="2535" /> movement on the road of military forces.  The sole purpose of maintaining the Order, however, is to keep the present position unchanged pending the restoration of more normal conditions as regards fuel, the removal of the exceptional inducement now existing to cut down trees, and the making of a decision on the question of permanent legislation in regard to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I want to ask the Minister about the difference between Order No. 260 and Order No. 83 in the White Paper. Under Order No. 260 it is quite definitely stated: &ldquo;These Orders provide for the control of remuneration of employees generally.  It will be necessary to retain these Orders pending the enactment and coming into operation of the Industrial Relations Bill.&rdquo;  I think the Minister said previously that he intends to repeal Order No. 260 the day the Industrial Relations Bill comes into force.  Is his intention the same with regard to Order No. 83?  Under that Order there is this note: &ldquo;These Orders impose restrictions on the distribution of profits of companies and directors' fees and remuneration of employees and it is necessary that they should be continued for the present&rdquo;. What will be the position in the period intervening when Order No. 82 is repealed and Order No. 260 is repealed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Order No. 83 imposes restrictions on the distribution of profits of companies, on directors fees, and on the remuneration of employees <Col N="2537" /> in certain designated essential industries.  That Order, in so far as it related to the control of wages, was superseded by Order No. 166, which extended the standstill on wages to wages in all occupations.  In turn, Order No. 166 was superseded by Order No. 260, which provided for the making of standard rate and bonus Orders.  The repeal of Order No. 260 will carry with it the repeal of all emergency restrictions on wages and salaries.  I cannot say at what stage the Government will decide to remove the restrictions upon the distribution of profits and on directors' fees and the remuneration of employees.  It should be clear, however, that if this Bill be passed, then, from the 1st September next, Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order can be only maintained or revoked; it cannot be amended and, if it should impede the operation of the Government's policy concerning wages, it would have to be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can remember when these Emergency Orders were first introduced.  It was then represented that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander; that the employees' wages would have to be controlled and, therefore, there could not be a free market for directors' fees, dividends, etc.  Now, apparently, the Minister has admitted that Order No. 260, which controls employees' wages, is going when the Industrial Relations Bill comes into force, but that Order No. 283 may or may not be repealed as from the 1st September. That is certainly a breach of the statement that was made when Order No. 83 was brought in.  We were told that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander but now, apparently, one will be revoked and the Minister has suggested that the other might perhaps be revoked.  Apparently, no decision has been arrived at on that point.  I think that is a most serious step and, if he can, the Minister should give us an idea when the restrictions on dividends and directors' remuneration will be revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out some of the anomalies that have grown up under Order No. 83.  I suppose we <Col N="2538" /> could not blame the Government for falling into the idea that, under modern methods, war could not be waged for more than a year or two years at the outside.  Now, there are junior directors whose remuneration is held down to what they received when they started.  There has been a considerable alteration in directors' status within the past six years.  The Minister might point out to me that there is a very elaborate formula by going before a tribunal which may alter that, under certain circumstances, but a whole lot of companies have not done that.  I suggest that it is most unfair to divorce these two Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter will have to come up for consideration when the whole position is being reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>But the whole position is, apparently, being reviewed. The Government have decided that the situation will be brought gradually to an end.  The bonus Orders are a sort of cushion for wages and provision has been made for industrial courts.  But the Government, apparently, have not come to a decision about dividends and directors' remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I would suggest that this is putting the cart before the horse.  If this whole Industrial Relations Bill were just, it ought to regulate the position of employers and workers.  Apparently the Government have made up their mind about the workers and they have shelved the position in regard to the employers. I suggest that this is not just and that the sooner the Government come to a decision on that point the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was just going to say to the Minister.  He spoke about a drafting device.  I am not a draftsman, thank goodness, but I think I have sufficient experience of drafting to say that I would have thought that the most appropriate drafting device, certainly from the point of view of giving information to the public, would be to put into a schedule those Orders which it was intended should be retained in effect. That would have the effect of giving information to the public.  At the present moment there is the greatest possible difficulty in anybody, even those of us whose job it is, to find out what Orders are in force from day to day.  The ordinary member of the public has no means of finding out.  In fact one man I know seized on this memorandum as the first place where he could get information as to what Orders were in force.  I think he was suffering from the delusion that all the Orders that were in force at the moment were in this memorandum.  In fact, I gather from the Minister&mdash;and of course I realise&mdash;that that is not so.  But I think it would be certainly for the benefit of the public, apart from anything else, that the Minister should at some stage of this Bill, when the Government have made up their mind what Orders they are going to keep in force, put that into a schedule so that all anyone would have to do would be to get a copy of the Act.  Whereas, if that schedule is not put in, nobody will really know what Orders are being <Col N="2541" /> continued but will have to look around for some announcement in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or otherwise find out what Orders are in force.</P>

      <P>The Minister says it would be very long but the Minister and the Government should consider the plight of the unfortunate public. The Minister thinks the list is too long to put into a schedule to the Act but what about the public who are affected by these Orders and cannot find them anywhere, certainly not without the employment of expert legal assistance and legal assistance of a kind that is going to spend a considerable amount of time and industry searching them out and even when they have searched <Col N="2542" /> them out nobody can say whether they are still in force or not.  I do respectfully suggest to the Minister that some device ought to be adopted of giving notice to the public in some shape or another, if not in the schedule, in some way, of the Orders, Government or otherwise, that will remain in force after this Statute is enacted, because otherwise the position will be one of complete confusion.</P>

      <P>Ministerial Orders will only be tabled where made under this Bill.  If these Orders are continued, Ministerial Orders may be made <i>ad lib.</i> and nobody will know anything about them, or need necessarily know anything about them.  They need not be referred to in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or published anywhere.  In fact, they could be made orally.  I think it is possible to make a Ministerial Order orally.  I think the Minister will agree with that.  I have been told by a businessman that orders or directions are, in fact, given orally which have the effect as if they were given under Government Order.  I do not know where the ordinary public, in the present state of so-called emergency, are going to find themselves at all.  We have at least reached some point where emergency conditions have been minimised, if they have not ceased, and I do think that the Minister ought to consult public interest in this respect.  The position as regards these Orders under the Emergency Powers Act has become extremely chaotic.  It is almost impossible to know where you stand.  Speaking from the point of view of those professionally engaged in advising people, there is the utmost difficulty and, where called to do that, we are not quite sure that we have the last Order, or no matter what industry is displayed, can we be sure that a particular Order is the Order in force at the moment, or whether or not one has been made five minutes before our opinion is given.</P>

      <P>At page 26 there is an Order dealing with the acquisition of land by a State authority and the payment of compensation.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not proposed to use this Order for the purpose of the acquisition of land in future and accordingly the only articles being retained are those dealing with the payment of compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister consider that Order in reference to an amendment in my name, and in that of Deputy Mulcahy, which he moved but withdrew in order that the Minister might look into the matter?  The position, as I understand it, is that the court have declined to assess compensation in the case of land taken under the Emergency <Col N="2546" /> Powers Act, on the ground that there is no jurisdiction and no machinery provided.  In other words, persons whose land was taken under the Emergency Powers Act have no right to compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I argued a case in court up to that point.  Fortunately, it was settled before the matter had to be determined.  The point raised was that the court had no jurisdiction, where a man's land was taken permanently, to assess compensation. I was relating it to the old decision in an hotel case in the English Courts under the Defence of the Realm Act, where the House of Lords decided that even though there was no provision in the Defence of the Realm Act, the Crown had to pay compensation. The same principle would apply here, but I was told subsequently by a colleague that there was no jurisdiction here.</P>

There is also an Order which imposes upon people the duty of paying for exports in the currency of the country.  Why that should be I do not know.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (9), line 48, to delete the word &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment that I have down purports in effect to nullify sub-section (9) of Section 6.  Sub-section (9) as drafted does away with the section of the <Col N="2553" /> Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, which provides a limitation of six months on the bringing of summary proceedings and lays it down that it shall not have effect in relation to offences under this Act.  In the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill it is proposed to continue Emergency Powers No. 178 Order, 1942, which removed the six months' time limit in respect of prosecutions under the emergency powers code. The reason given in the explanatory memorandum for the continuance of that Order is that it was found desirable to make the Order and to continue it because of the impossibility, or the impracticability, of bringing proceedings for breaches of the tillage regulations within a period of six months.  If that is so and if there is some peculiar difficulty in connection with the tillage Orders, why not confine the Order which is being continued, and this particular provision in the Act, to tillage Orders?  Sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Act of 1851 has been in operation for nearly a century. It provides a limitation on the time limit within which proceedings may be brought before courts of summary jurisdiction; and the reason is, as I apprehended it, that the whole basis of summary jurisdiction is that cases should be tried summarily&mdash;in other words, quickly, expeditiously.  If expeditious proceedings are not brought in a court, which is supposed to be a summary court and court in which summary justice is expeditiously dealt out, this would be an end of the proceedings. I think that principle should not be eaten into by our code of criminal law, even at the expense of administrative inconvenience.  If there is a case to be made during the emergency because of breaches of the tillage regulations, I think that ought to be sufficient and the other matters could readily be brought within the six months and, in my view, ought to be brought within the six months if they are going to be brought at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support Deputy Costello in this.  I do not see why the tillage prosecution should be allowed to hang over into the following autumn or winter.  The probability is <Col N="2554" /> that this was done in the past owing to the lack of justification or proof of violation of the tillage Orders.  Surely, it should be known by the 1st June in any single year whether a man has complied or not; and it ought to be possible after that date to serve notice upon him and to take proceedings against him as quickly as possible.  I have known cases where they ran over a year before the prosecution came into court.  The war is over now and the machinery has been sufficiently long in operation to work in a more satisfactory manner.  The officers have gained in experience and there is no reason now why they could not specify on any day after 1st June in any year whether a man has complied or not.  It should be possible then to take out a summons immediately and not have a man in the position of waiting and wondering whether or not he is going to be summoned.  Now in the month of November, or December, he gets his summons.  He immediately approaches his local T.D. to see if he can do anything about this prosecution.  The right step would be to give them up to 1st June to comply with the tillage Order. These inspectors are now adepts in their job; they know the country and they know the farmers.  I can see no reason myself why these matters should be held over.  I think this section should be dropped and the old law should remain in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The critical date under the tillage Orders is not the 1st June but 15th July.  Irrespective, however, of whatever date is taken, it is quite clear that inspection of holdings for the purpose of instituting proceedings for non-compliance with the Orders cannot begin until after the final date.  It is only on the final date that the offence is committed if the required percentage of tillage has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The final date is 1st July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the 15th July, but it does not matter for the purpose of this argument what the critical date is. Inspection of the holdings to ascertain whether the tillage Order has been <Col N="2555" /> complied with begins upon the final date for doing the tillage.  It cannot begin earlier because the defence could always be advanced that the work was done subsequently or might have been done subsequently.  It takes four to five months to complete the process of inspection in view of the large number of holdings involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The enforcement of the compulsory tillage Orders would be much more difficult if this time limit operated in respect of a summons.  The fact that the war is over does not mean that the food emergency is over.  In many respects the food emergency is greater now than it was at any stage during the war and the need for compliance with the compulsory tillage Orders is greater to-day than it ever was in the past five or six years.  However, as I understand Deputy Costello, while conceding the possibility that this Emergency Powers Order is necessary in relation to compulsory tillage requirements, he thinks it should be confined in its effect to the compulsory tillage Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason <Col N="2556" /> given in the memorandum.  There is, I am informed, a general feeling that the period should be extended in any event and that the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act should be amended in that respect.  I understand there is an intention to take an opportunity to submit proposals for the amendment of that Act to the Dáil.  I gather that representations have been made to the Department of Justice by interested parties with a view to the amendment of that Act and that the Department of Justice have these under consideration.  It is, therefore, desired to maintain the position until the Department of Justice has come to a conclusion on these representations. That is why, although the Order is primarily required for the purpose of enforcing the compulsory tillage Order, it may lead to a permanent change in the legislation and it is desired to keep the situation unaltered until that permanent change can be decided upon.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>10.  No court, tribunal or authority other than the High Court, Circuit Court or District Court shall have by virtue of any Act passed before the passing of this Act or by virtue of any Order made by or under the authority of this Act or the Act of 1939 any jurisdiction to hear or determine any offence under this section.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to ensure that the Special Criminal Court will have no jurisdiction in reference to offences under this Act.  I put down this amendment largely because I was somewhat shocked at the view stated by the Minister during the Second Reading of this Bill on the manner in which offences ought to be brought before this Special Criminal Court, popularly known as the Military Tribunal. If I may say so without any disrespect, the Minister has completely misunderstood the whole purpose and scope of the Offences Against the State Acts. As reported in column 2089 of the Official Report of the 18th June, the Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is, I understand, the function of the Attorney-General to decide whether cases should go to that court or be considered in the ordinary courts.  I came to an understanding with the Attorney-General at an early stage in the war that there should be referred to the Special Court cases of offences against rationing and similar Orders where the evidence was such as to suggest that there was a conspiracy&mdash;an or ganisation on a large scale&mdash;for the <Col N="2559" /> black-marketing of goods over a substantial area.  Generally speaking, charges against individual traders of selling goods at excessive prices, or contrary to the rationing regulations, were not proceeded with in that court, but where there was evidence of&mdash;shall I say&mdash;black-marketing on a wholesale scale, involving more than one trader and more than one locality in the country, then it was considered that the District Court would be inappropriate for dealing with the charges and the Special Court was used. Deputies who wish to raise questions concerning the utilisation of that court should do so with the Minister for Justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I say in reference to that last sentence that when we tried to raise it with the Minister for Justice, he said: &ldquo;Raise it with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;  I put that to him during the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  The ball is passed from one Minister to the other.  In my view, neither Minister has anything to do with it.  I think the whole position has been misconceived. It is not the Attorney-General's function to decide whether a particular case is to go to that court or not.  Before any case can go to this Military Tribunal, as it is called, the Government must make the offence a scheduled offence.  It is a Government matter and the Government have to carry out the law in the way that this Oireachtas intended them to carry it out and only do it in the circumstances specified in the Act of 1939, as amended, and these circumstances are set out in Section 36 of that Act. Speaking generally, the provisions of Section 36 are as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of the public peace and order in relation to offences of a particular class or kind or under any particular enactment, the Government may by Order declare these offences to be scheduled offences.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government may do it, but before <Col N="2560" /> they can do it they must be satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of peace. I am sure the Minister will not take offence at what I am saying as I do not intend it in any disrespectful way.  It appears to me, however, that when the Minister stated he had an understanding with the Attorney-General, both himself and the Attorney-General of the time were acting quite contrary to the law and spirit of the Act, because it is not a question of selecting a particular type of offence and saying: &ldquo;That is a black-marketing offence of a particularly heinous character and it must go to the terror court in order to be dealt with.&rdquo;  That is not what the Act says. That is not what the Parliament of this country intended when special tribunals were authorised to be set up. Before these courts were to be given jurisdiction, it was the intention and it is the letter of the law that the ordinary courts should be ineffective to secure the administration of justice and the preservation of the public peace. How can it be alleged that, even in reference to black-marketing offences, the ordinary courts are ineffective to secure the impartial administration of justice?  I think that underlying the Minister's statement on the Second Reading of the Bill there was the suggestion that because certain types of black-marketing offences were of such a gross character that they ought to be dealt with by this particular terror tribunal and not by the ordinary courts they were sent to that tribunal.  That concept of the Minister has nothing to do with the basis on which the jurisdiction of these special criminal courts is established, namely, the fact that the ordinary courts are ineffective to secure the proper administration of justice and the preservation of the public peace.</P>
    <P>We have Circuit Courts and District Courts staffed and manned by judicial personages of standing and, it must be presumed, of ability.  In reference to the particular individuals who occupy these positions at the moment, a very large percentage of the personnel of these courts has been actually appointed by the present <Col N="2561" /> Government, and by their action in sending these cases to the Military Tribunal, the Government have passed a vote of censure on themselves and on their own judicial appointments because the Special Criminal Court can have no jurisdiction, in justice at all events, apart from the letter of the law, unless the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice.  Send a black market case to the Military Court and that suggests that the District Court, the Circuit Court, or even the High Court, which has jurisdiction, is inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice in relation to black market cases.  I do not subscribe to that opinion, even though the people appointed have been appointed by the present Government.  Every case sent to the Military Tribunal, as it is popularly called, is a vote of censure on our own judicial system at a time when that system is working satisfactorily and in accordance with the way most people want it to act.</P>
    <P>I think the whole concept is wrong. It is not for the Minister and the Attorney-General to say: &ldquo;We will send black market cases to the Military Tribunal.&rdquo;  There must be a determination by the Government that the ordinary courts are ineffective to deal with these cases, that the preservation of public peace and order cannot be secured by the ordinary courts or the effective administration of justice assured by the ordinary courts.  There is no foundation for the suggestion that the ordinary courts are inadequate to deal with black market cases, of however heinous a character.  It must be assumed that the district justices will do their duty.</P>
    <P>I want to make a public profession of faith.  I have no sympathy with black market offences.  I wish to see the offenders prosecuted with the utmost vigour and I wish to see them getting the utmost penalties the law provides. But I want our judicial system maintained, and it is a blot on the administration of justice that extraordinary courts, which were intended to deal only with a particular type of case, a case where ordinary courts or juries would be ineffective&mdash;a case of armed <Col N="2562" /> insurrection or illegal organisation, for example&mdash;should be utilised to deal with such things as black market offences.  I think it is lessening the prestige and blackening the character of the administration of justice when we have to resort to that kind of tribunal.</P>
    <P>There are certain types of cases which can be tried summarily by the ordinary district justices; there are other cases that can be tried on indictment.  The same facts may give rise to a summary offence or an indictable offence.  The indictable offence may be tried by a jury.  I would prefer to have a jur convicting a black marketeer in one case out of ten than to have the whole ten black marketeers convicted by the Military Tribunal, because I think it would be a far greater manifestation of public spirit, acting through the jury system to deal with black marketeers, than have them dealt with by the gentlemen who preside at these military tribunals.</P>
    <P>You would get far more respect for the law if you reach the position where juries convict black marketeers in indictable offences&mdash;and I believe juries would convict in black market cases. You would have far more respect for the administration of the law and more respect from the black marketeers if their own fellow countrymen were on juries convicting them.  I believe they would convict them.  I believe that with the ordinary consuming public on a jury&mdash;and a jury is a cross section of the public&mdash;you would get far more respect for the administration of justice in that way and far more public support in relation to the hunting down of black marketeers than in any sentence of the Military Tribunal.  I believe these sentences rather gain public sympathy for the black marketeers than otherwise.</P>
    <P>They may strike terror into the hearts of some who get exemplary sentences, but if these exemplary sentences were given by a district justice or a Circuit Court judge after conviction by a jury, it would be far more effective than any number of sentences by a military tribunal.  I say quite sincerely that the only effect of convictions by military tribunals is to gain a sort of sneaking sympathy <Col N="2563" /> for black marketeers, who do not deserve any sympathy whatever.  I suggest to the Minister that these offences ought not to be tried by the military courts, that the approach is wrong as he stated it.  He has, I am sure, quite inadvertently taken the wrong approach to this matter.  There is considerable excuse for the Minister in taking that approach when apparently the Attorney-General assisted him.  The spectacle of the Minister and the Attorney-General deciding in advance that certain cases should go to the tribunal is in complete conflict with the provisions of the statute and contrary to the whole spirit of it.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1939, when the Attorney-General sends cases from the ordinary courts to the Military Tribunal, he is supposed to act judicially in each case.  He is supposed to bring to bear on the facts of each case a judicial determination and he can only bring that judicial determination to bear on the facts of each case when the Government has done its job; that is to say, has determined that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the determination of justice.  A Government Order may be legal when it puts offences of this kind as scheduled offences, but it is contrary to the spirit of the Act and essential justice in the circumstances existing in this country, where the ordinary courts are functioning satisfactorily in reference to practically every offence, with the exception of offences against the State, armed insurrection, or something in the nature of preparation for armed insurrection or illegal association.</P>
    <P>Where the ordinary courts are functioning perfectly, it is contrary to the spirit of the Act and to morality and justice to send these cases to the Military Tribunal.  It is contrary to the public interest, apart from morality and justice, because the use of these courts destroys the whole effect intended and produces public sympathy rather than public opprobrium.  You will get far more sympathy from the public if you bring the black marketeers to the ordinary tribunals <Col N="2564" /> with vigour and determination rather than if you bring them to the Military Courts.</P>
    <P>I make these observations in all sincerity. I believe it is wrong on principle to use that tribunal for these purposes.  That tribunal has a value in the circumstances in which it was created, a value to deter people who may be engaged in unlawful associations, who may be thinking of engaging in illegal conspiracies of an armed character against the State.  That value will be destroyed if ordinary cases which should be tried before the ordinary courts are brought before that special tribunal.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully that the Act to which the Deputy refers requires that offences should be scheduled by the Government before they can be brought before the Military Court. What I meant to convey by my statement on the Second Reading was that I urged on the Government that offences against price control arrangements and rationing regulations should be so scheduled.  I urged that on the ground that the ordinary courts had proved to be ineffective in dealing with those offences.  I urged it on the ground that an offence against rationing regulations and price control regulations was as serious a crime against the public interest here as the other type of offences with which the court was set up to deal.  The Government would not agree that all such offences should be referred to the Military Court.  They would not agree, both because of the comparatively trivial nature of some of the cases and the fact that the number of the cases was so great that the Military Court could not possibly deal with them all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then urged that, where there was evidence of conspiracy, evidence of black-marketing activities extending outside the ambit of an individual firm, evidence that an attempt was being made to set up a wholesale business in black-market goods, the Special Court should be used&mdash;and for such cases the Special Court was used.  I do not agree at all with Deputy Costello <Col N="2565" /> that the ordinary courts proved adequate to deal with those offences. They did not.  I have already said here in the Dáil that I will leave it in a prominent place in my legacy to whomsoever has the misfortune to be Minister for Supplies in another war, to set up forthwith some special form of tribunal to handle offences against rationing and similar regulations.</P>
    <P>The District Courts here proved unsuitable for handling those cases.  I am not going to express an opinion as to why that was so; I am not going to say it need necessarily have been so; I am pointing to the historical fact that it was so.  Many district justices never imposed for rationing offences or price control offences a penalty in excess of 2/6.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily in the city.  In the areas of those District Courts, it became impossible to preserve the rationing schemes in effective operation.  Let me make it quite clear that rationing schemes can break down.  In many countries in Europe the rationing and price-control arrangements have broken down, and by this stage the Governments concerned have abandoned even the effort to make them effective.</P>
      <P>We did not reach that situation here and I think that was very largely because these major offences against rationing and price control regulations were dealt with by the Special Court and not by the District Court.  I feel certain that, if we had relied entirely on the District Court, we would have got eventually into the situation where these various regulations would be treated with contempt.  There was no use in prosecuting a man who had gained a profit of £500 or £1,000 on some black market deal and fining him</P>

      <P>In many instances, particularly in relation to tea during the earlier stages of the tea rationing, there were traders charged with black-marketing tea who were regarded as local benefactors.  Whether they got the tea by chiselling the less wealthy of their customers of their legitimate supplies, whether they got the tea by buying stolen property, whether they got the tea by one discreditable device or another, they always represented to their customers that they had succeeded in getting it across the Border and, therefore, they were adding to the national supplies and serving the public interest.  Of course, those who got the tea did not question those statements and, when the individual was charged with the illegal selling of tea in excess of the ration, there was always a great deal of local sympathy. It took a long time to educate the people into the realisation that rationing regulations were in their interest and were designed to ensure a fair and equal distribution of supplies and to prevent certain cute individuals from getting rich quickly by pandering to the cupidity of individuals who like to feel that they can do better than their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care what the theory is: I say that, in practice, the maintenance of rationing and price control regulations during the whole of the emergency would not have been possible if reliance were placed on the ordinary courts.  Whether in another emergency this special military court exists or not, I urge now&mdash;and put it on record now that I am urging&mdash;that <Col N="2567" /> the Government then in office should set up special courts for such offences. I tell them they will not succeed in making rationing regulations and price control arrangements effective unless they do so.  That is my conviction.  I have noted that, in most countries where effective rationing was maintained, there were such special tribunals of one form or another established to enforce the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of the amendment is that the Government should be deprived of the power of scheduling offences under this Bill so as to enable them to be tried by the Special Court. Irrespective of what the Government may decide to do in that regard, I am urging that it should not be deprived of the power because uncertainties as to the future supply situation may still make it necessary to use that power to secure effective compliance with existing rationing regulations or new regulations that may have to be made for additional commodities.  I accept Deputy Costello's assurance that he is not anxious to facilitate persons who want to engage in black-marketing activities but I urge him to consider that such persons will in fact be facilitated if this amendment is carried and the power of scheduling offences to be tried by the Special Court is taken from the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may accept my assurance, in all sincerity, that I have no desire to facilitate black marketing activities.  Quite the contrary.  But I do make this point: the Minister has stated that it took some <Col N="2570" /> time to educate public opinion in this country with regard to the necessity for rationing and with regard to the desirability of the rationing schemes being adhered to.  I think that process of educating and creating a proper public opinion in this matter will only be brought to its final conclusion and the position in which everybody wants it if the ordinary courts are being used. I think that the Minister's efforts and the efforts of anybody else to educate public opinion in the way that is desired will be very seriously jeopardised if the Special Courts are extensively used.  The Minister said that were it not for these Special Criminal Courts the rationing system would be a failure.  I would venture this opinion&mdash;and it is only an opinion &mdash;that not 1 per cent. of all the offences against the Emergency Powers Orders were brought before the Military Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Not 1 per cent.  That 1 per cent. had the effect, as I say, in some of the cases at all events, of producing in the public mind a sneaking sympathy with the people brought there but it is the 99 per cent. that were brought before the ordinary courts that gave the sanction for the enforcement of the law&mdash;not the tribunal.  It was the fact that the ordinary courts convicted people of offences in cases where they were properly convictable that brought respect for the law and it is not the 1 per cent. of the cases that were tried by the Military Tribunals that brought respect for the rationing schemes or that brought respect for the enforcement of the rationing schemes or the administration of the law in reference to them. It was the 99 per cent. that came before district justices that brought it about. If the Minister was afraid, in reference to these tea cases that he referred to, that local influence might pull local juries in reference to a local merchant, the Attorney-General had it in his power to take that particular case to Dublin before a High Court judge with a Dublin jury consisting of 12 men drafted from the City and County of Dublin.  I can say from some experience <Col N="2571" /> of Dublin jurymen that never have they failed to do their duty in reference to matters of this kind and never would they fail to do it.  I would prefer one verdict from a Dublin jury than 40,000 convictions from Military Tribunals.  One verdict from a Dublin jury would have far greater effect upon public opinion and on stopping black-marketing offences and offences against rationing schemes than any number of convictions by the tribunal.</P>

      <P>How many times? Certainly, one of the cases that stand out in public memory with regard to rationing schemes was the tea case heard in the last couple of years, about which there was great public perturbation. The individual charged seemed to most people to be a person who should have been sent to jail, and he got off with a fine and that, I think, was partly remitted when he went to one of the ordinary courts.  If it is District Courts, not in Dublin, which failed to impose sufficiently large penalties, why did not the Minister take the first step of transferring them to District Courts elsewhere in the country?  They could have been brought elsewhere.  They could have been brought here to town.  That never was tried.  Under the Constitution and under the Offences Against the State <Col N="2572" /> Act, 1939, which was passed to comply with the Constitution, there had to be a solemn proclamation by the Government that in the mind of the Government the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice.  I stop there.  It goes on to &ldquo;the preservation of public peace and order&rdquo;.  What was the point at which the decision was taken in relation to&mdash;as it now turns out&mdash; 1 per cent. of rationing cases to bring them before the Special Courts? Where the Minister may have thought there were not effective penalties imposed, he never took the intermediate step of seeing what a Dublin district justice would deal with these people.</P>
      <P>My own experience in the courts here was that a considerable number of the penalties imposed by the District Court were remitted when these cases came on appeal before the circuit judge.  Of course, the Minister knows full well that one of the great disadvantages of the use of the Special Criminal Court or Military Tribunal was that almost universally there was appeal taken to the ordinary courts and in a great many cases the ordinary courts thought that the Special Military Court had gone wrong on some point or other.  But is it possible that what are solemnly called the fundamental rights of the citizens in this glorious document of 1937 are just to be dealt with in the way which shocked the public when the Minister told them that he came to an arrangement with the Attorney-General?  It was not a question of the Government.  The Minister facing me said that he came to an arrangement with the Attorney-General that certain cases would be sent before the Special Military Court. There was certainly no indication that there had ever been a question raised by the Government as to the general principles whether the courts were adequate or not to secure effective administration of justice.</P>

    <P>The old rule with regard to these things was that there had to be proof that, say, the ordinary courts were being coerced, that there had been some system of intimidation practised against the ordinary courts.  I never understood that that phrase in the <Col N="2573" /> Offences Against the State Act was going to be used in this way, that some man would set himself up subjectively as the test whether or not sufficient penalties were being imposed and that he would then decide that, because in his mind the offenders were not being sufficiently harshly treated, he would declare that the system of justice had broken down.  I think it is astounding to have it stated here, at this stage of our history, that the 1937 document and all the fundamental rights that are framed in it&mdash;and trial by jury one of the great rights&mdash;could be taken <Col N="2574" /> away by an unnamed Attorney-General&mdash;he may be pleased to have himself brought into this picture&mdash; who, behind backs, agreed with one Minister that certain cases would be sent to the Special Criminal Courts and no reason given for that decision.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
