      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 4 and 5 on the Order Paper. Private Deputies' Business will be taken at 12 o'clock.  It is further proposed to take motion No. 3 in List No. 8 Motion No 2 which relates to ground rents, it is desired to postpone, because the Minister for Justice who will be dealing with the question, has been engaged in the Seanad all the week and is anxious to have discussion of the motion postponed.</P>

      <P>The point I want to submit is that the subject matter of this motion has no relation whatever to the matters joined in issue before the courts in the case referred to and inasmuch as it appears that this matter has been on appeal for several months, and looks like being on appeal for several more months, am I to understand that this House will not be afforded an opportunity of considering so important a matter of privilege until the parties to this suit choose to bring the appeal to a conclusion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to subscribe to the debate to supplement what I said on this Bill last night.  I honestly believe that it is a Bill which should be considered very carefully by every Deputy before he goes to the Division Lobby.  I am going to oppose the Bill and my reason for doing so is that I am of opinion that the real title which the Minister should have given to the Bill is the Vote Controlling Land Bill, 1945, because I believe the Bill is brought in for the purpose of dealing with ungrateful and disloyal Fianna Fáil supporters who secured land through the influence of the Fianna Fáil organisation and who, for reasons of their own and probably because they have since gained intelligence, now see fit to support another political Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am honestly of opinion that if this Bill is passed it will be used at every election by the Fianna Fáil Party as a threat over those holding land.  They will be told that, unless they support the Government, this Bill will be implemented against them.  The unfortunate people are going to be compelled to vote in certain directions through fear that they may lose their land under the powers which the <Col N="356" /> Government are assuming under this Bill.  I think it most unfair that Section 4 should be passed in its present shape and I strongly urge the Parties in this House, who have the advantage of better advice than I have, to see that suitable amendments will be introduced under which an allottee will have some tribunal to appeal to.  According to the Bill, Land Commission officials, civil servants, will be the divine architects of proper methods of husbandry.  What does a civil servant know of good methods of husbandry?  I think that is a most unfair proposal and that there should be some provision made for an appeal to a proper tribunal so that the unfortunate allottee will have an opportunity of having his case dealt with by some independent people.</P>
    <P>For example, I think it is not right to provide that the appeal should be to the land court or to the Land Commission, simply because it is exactly the same as appealing to the people who want to take the land.  In my opinion, that is the very same as having the devil as a justice and holding the court in hell.  I think there should be some independent person appointed to deal with such appeals, such as an ordinary High Court judge or the Chief Justice, so that there would be an impartial decision.  I think it most unfair that legislation of this kind, which has a very serious effect on the rights of the citizens, should be introduced.  I am sorry to see legislation introduced for the purpose of evicting people from land to which they are justly entitled.  I, at least, as one Deputy am going to oppose it because I am not going to be a bailiff for any Minister for Lands. I ask the Minister to state when he is replying what benefits will follow from this Bill or what good results he has in view.  Assuming that the Bill will be passed, what hope has he that it is going to bring good results?  We should like to know what were his reasons for introducing legislation of this kind.  I think it is a Bill that will meet with very serious opposition from the country people in general.</P>
    <P>I thought, when I heard that a Land <Col N="357" /> Bill was going to be introduced, that it would be a constructive Bill, not a destructive one.  I thought the Government was going to seek powers whereby it would be possible to deal more speedily with lands held up in the Bankruptcy Court or to acquire more speedily the large ranches which for many years have been on the list for the attention of the Land Commission. I thought that the Minister would apply for powers to the House to acquire these large ranches, many of which are situated in my own constituency, and in the vicinity of which there are large numbers of small holders who are well prepared and equipped to work the land.</P>
    <P>As I said in the House last night, I am sorry that the Government saw fit to bring in a Bill as a result of which they will throw unfortunate victims on the roadside.  I asked the Minister last night what provision it is proposed to make for the unfortunate people who are going to be the victims of this legislation.  Where are they going to go?  Will they have to migrate or go into the local poorhouse, or what is going to happen them in these circumstances? I think it is most regrettable that any Minister should have sponsored a Bill of this kind.  I would not be at all surprised to read that Joe Stalin had introduced legislation of this type, but when we see an Irish Minister for Lands seeking these powers, I think it is most unchristian and undemocratic.  I would not be at all surprised if Stalin were seeking these powers, but we have come to the stage now when the Communistic powers of Stalin are being adopted by the present Government.  As I pointed out last night, I think that we&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We should get some information when the Minister is replying as to what he proposes to do in order to provide for these people who <Col N="358" /> will be victimised by this legislation. Instead of the Government introducing a Bill of this character, I think it would be of far greater advantage to the people if a Bill were introduced to encourage people to live on the land, to help them in every way to do so, and not to drive them off it.  Listening to speeches at Fianna Fáil meetings at elections throughout my constituency, I always understood it to be the policy of the Government to keep the people on the land.  This is a Bill to drive the people off the land.  I cannot see how the Government are able to sit on two stools.  Between the two stools, they are bound to come to the ground.  In my opinion this is a Bill that gives very dictatorial powers to civil servants.  I shall oppose it, and I hope it will receive very severe criticism and opposition from all sides of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering a Bill of this kind, Deputies have, first of all, to make up their minds whether the fundamental principle of the Bill is sound or otherwise.  If we are satisfied that the fundamental principle of the Bill is sound, we may support it, even though we may differ with some sections of the Bill.  What is the main principle of this Bill?  The main principle, as I see it, is to give the Minister power to restrict the work of courts in protecting the ordinary citizens.  We have in this country a Constitution of which I think we should be proud.  I say that realising that the Constitution under which we live was drafted by the Government, possibly by the Taoiseach himself. In applauding the Constitution, I would be paying tribute to the Government Party to which I am opposed, but I want to approach every question of national importance fairly.  I want to add, honestly and fairly, that I think our Constitution compares very favourably with the constitutions of other democratic countries. One of the principles of our Constitution is that justice shall be administered in the courts established by law, by judges appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution. Now, what are we seeking to do in this Bill?  We are seeking to prevent justice from being administered in the courts established by law, by judges <Col N="359" /> appointed under this Constitution.  We are seeking to place the Minister and his Department above the courts of justice in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a plausible case in introducing this Bill.  He told us that there were a good many unsatisfactory features which had become noticeable in the administration of the distribution of land, and in the manner in which land which had been allocated to allottees was being worked.  He suggested that he was merely coming to this House to ask that the law be tightened up.  If that were what he was asking from this House, I think he would get it from all Parties.  I think all Parties would be agreeable to a tightening up of the law so as to prevent abuses, but I do not think any Party in this House should be agreeable to a tightening up of the courts, to a restriction of the powers of our judiciary to decide as between man and man in this State, because it must be remembered that the Minister is only a man just the same as the humblest citizen in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Constitution also provides in Article 40 that all citizens as human beings be held equal before the law. The issue which has arisen, and which has been brought to the notice of the Minister by the inspectors of his Department, is that, in the opinion of the Minister's Department, citizens who were allotted land have violated the terms of the contract under which they obtained their holdings.  A contract is a very solemn thing, whether it be entered into between one citizen and another, or between one citizen and the State.  If one party to a contract holds that that contract has been violated by the other party, he is entitled to go into court and state his case.  But in this Bill it is sought that one party to the contract shall have the right, by a certificate, to declare that the other party has violated the contract, and that there shall be no appeal whatever to any court over the decision of that party.  That does not appear to me to be law or justice.  It violates and outrages our traditional Irish sense of justice and fair play.  As has been pointed out, in a court of justice even the most incompetent, the most useless <Col N="360" /> allottee, can go before an independent judge and make some case at least.  He may make the case that through illness in his family, or through some misfortune, he has been unable to work his land properly.  He may make the case that the misfortune which has prevented him from carrying out the terms of his agreement is of a purely temporary nature, and that, if given a chance, in a year or so he may be able to recover his position and carry out fully the terms of his agreement. In a case like that, an independent tribunal would view the matter from the standpoint of equity, justice and fair play.  But the unfortunate thing is that we have a Minister in a hurry, and we have a Department in a hurry. They want to get something done quickly, and in order to get it done quickly they are prepared to crush and override the rights of ordinary individuals. I know that the Minister and a good many of us in this House have been brought up in a tradition in which the laws, the courts, have not been held in the highest possible esteem, but, if this country is to remain free, if our people are to remain free, and if we are not to be relegated to a condition in which we will all be slaves, it is essential that the authority and dignity of the courts should be upheld, and that they should have the right to decide at all times between the Executive and the citizen.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, may seek to establish a case for the Bill on the ground that he has no alternative to this measure; that there is no other way of overcoming the abuses which have arisen except by this drastic piece of legislation.  I do not believe that at all.  I believe that it is not outside the bounds of human intelligence and ingenuity to devise ways and means by which the law can be tightened up so that it will not be so easy to evade in the future.  For example, when an ordinary property owner sets a house to a neighbour, we all know how difficult it is to get that neighbour out of the house, but we know too that an intelligent person who is setting property to another will get over the difficulty by a caretaker's agreement or something of that kind.  There are always <Col N="361" /> ways and means of overcoming the difficulties which arise, without restricting the courts.</P>
    <P>I want to know, first of all, why the Minister is in such a hurry now to rectify all those mistakes.  The conditions of which he complains have prevailed over a long term of years.  A certain number of people have not been living in the houses allotted to them. Over a long term of years people have been subletting portions of the land allotted to them, and it seems to me that the fact that they were doing so was due to lax administration; due to the fact that it was not brought to the notice of those people by the officials of the Minister's Department that they were violating the agreement under which they accepted those holdings. Now, to remedy that lax administration which has gone on over a long term of years, the Minister seeks to take away from citizens their ordinary rights.  That is what I object to.  I think that by tightening up the administration of his own Department, by ensuring efficiency in his own Department, the Minister could see that the land which is allocated is worked in a proper way.</P>
    <P>No indication has been given by the Minister as to what he intends to do in regard to people who will lose their holdings now through the administration of this Act.  We shall have in this country a problem somewhat similar to that which prevails in Eastern Europe&mdash;a large number of displaced persons who, with their wives and families, have to seek accommodation somewhere.  Those people are human beings, men, women and children. They are going to be thrown out of the homes which have been given to them, and which, by reason of the fact that they have had them for a number of years, they have come to regard as their own.  Those people will be thrown out.  No provision is made for them, except under the degrading poor law system.  They can go to the workhouse, to the county home, or to some other institution of that kind.  Now, I think that those people are the victims of inefficiency, as the Minister will admit, in his <Col N="362" /> Department, either with regard to the manner in which they framed the law or the manner in which the agreements were entered into.  When it comes to a matter of examination and supervision, those people should not be harshly or unfairly treated, and I hold that if they are thrown out of their homes, they are being treated unfairly and harshly.  I do not think that the Minister means to be unfair or unjust in this manner&mdash;in fact, I am sure that he does not&mdash;but would it not be better if, instead of violating all the principles of law and justice, his Department should turn over a new leaf, and see that in the allocation of land in future there would be more care taken in the selection of allottees and that there would be no political pull or influence of that kind?  I would ask him to see that, in connection with the administration of his Department, there should be nothing of that kind to interfere with the efficient administration of his Department.  It is unfortunate for the Minister and for the Fianna Fáil Party that a great many supporters of that Party are now drifting out of it in a steady stream. People, who are actively associated with the Fianna Fáil organisation, and who know the tricks which were carried on by that organisation, are now drifting out of it because they know that, in general, in the matter of the allocation of land, political influence was allowed to interfere with the discretion and the efficiency of the permanently established officers of the Land Commission.  That exposure has now appeared.  I know that the Minister may be trying to do things better in the future, and I am sure that he is endeavouring to do so, but in trying to rectify one mistake, or a series of mistakes, it seems to me that he is proceeding in the opposite direction, and that he will make another series of mistakes.  It seems that he is seeking to make himself or the officials of his Department supreme in this matter, and to override the decisions of the ordinary courts.  It would seem that the Minister wants to make himself the Supreme Court in this matter, in order to decide whether people have violated agreements or not, and I hold that that is a thing that the Minister <Col N="363" /> or the officials of his Department should not be allowed to do.</P>

      <P>I deplore the fact that the tone of this debate should have run on this low level.  It seems to me to be a pity, not merely in this instance, but in every other instance in which legislation is introduced by the Government, that the members of the Opposition Parties should take it for granted and immediately decide that whatever the aim and object of the legislation may be, and however it may be calculated to improve the welfare and the happiness of our people, since it was introduced by the Government, it must have been planned in Hell and presided over by Satan.  Do the Deputies who speak in that way think that they are doing their duty to the people of this country, or upholding the dignity of this House, or even enhancing the dignity of their own Party?</P>

      <P>I do not propose to descend to the very low level which Deputy Dillon set in the course of his remarks on this Bill last night.  Lots of charges have been levelled about political corruption and influence, but I think that the public can come to a conclusion as to the value that may be <Col N="364" /> placed on these various allegations, by examining the statements made by Deputy Dillon last night. He challenged me to come to this House to defend my actions during the time that.  I was Minister for Lands. Now, in refuting Deputy Dillon's charges, I may point out in a sentence that, as every Deputy in the House, other than Deputy Dillon, I suppose, is aware, I was never Minister for Lands.  Furthermore, for the information of some of the newer Deputies here, who have recently come into the House and who seem to be inclined to follow along the lines laid down by Deputy Dillon, I may say that although I have had the honour of serving under various Ministers as Parliamentary Secretary, I was never charged with the responsibility for the administration of the Land Commission&mdash;never, for a moment.  I do not make that statement with a view to evading any blame in connection with the administration of that Department, if blame there be, but I was never a man to run away from my responsibilities.  Can Deputy Dillon say as much?  I always stand by my convictions.  Can Deputy Dillon assert that he will do the same? I hope he can.</P>
      <P>Now, let us examine the various charges that have been bandied around the House in connection with the various Ministers charged with the administration of this Department.  I am not endeavouring to anticipate the reply of the present Minister, or of other Ministers who have been in charge of that Department.  I know these men.  I have had the honour of working with them.  They are men who have rendered good service to this country.  They are men who have served this country in times of danger and of risk.  They are men of the highest personal honour and integrity, and it is against these men that Deputy Dillon would seek to fling these baseless charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been the record of Fianna Fáil in connection with land division, and their attempts to see that those best entitled to the division of land would get it?  Shortly after the Fianna Fáil Government came into power, Senator Connolly, who was then Minister <Col N="365" /> for Lands; introduced the Land Act of 1933.  I ask Deputy Dillon if he knows anything about Section 6 of that Land Act and its meaning.  The Deputy is supposed to be a lawyer.  He ought to know something of the meaning of a section of an Act of Parliament.  In that section of the Act of 1933 there are certain reserved matters, which are taken out of the hands of the Minister, and reserved to the Land Commissioners, who were given the status of High Court judges, in order that they would be above Party, and not be mere pawns of any political Party while it was in power.  That was the first step taken by Fianna Fáil to clean up the mess created by our predecessors in office.  In the past, many people&mdash;and the old prejudice has continued&mdash; thought for instance, as Deputy Dillon thought, that because my predecessor in office, Deputy Roddy, was in charge of the Land Commission, hey presto, I had exactly similar functions.  Similarly, up and down the country I have from time to time taken considerable pains to disillusion people on various aspects of the question of land division. I have been receiving letters from various parts of the country from people who are as ill-informed as Deputy Dillon, and I took the extraordinary step&mdash;I think it was an unprecedented step&mdash;of drafting a circular letter for the information of those whom it might concern.  I sent that letter, not merely to the secretary of every Fianna Fáil cumann in Clare, but I sent it for publication in the local paper, the <i>Clare Champion.</i>  I crave the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to quote this letter, in refutation of the many allegations levelled against various Ministers who had charge of the Land Commission, as well as against Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil Deputies.  I ask Deputy Dillon to listen with both his ears.  The letter is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The illusion that the division of land rests in the hands of Deputies seems to be widespread judging by the number of letters I receive from people who seem to be under that impression.</P>
    <P>The division of land is a matter confined exclusively to the staff of <Col N="366" /> the Land Commission subject to approval by the Commissioners. Under Section VI of the Land Act of 1933 even the Minister is prohibited from interference in such matters as the selection of allottees or of the parcels of land to be given to allottees, and when the Minister is prohibited by law from interference in such matters people should understand that a Deputy is also bound by the same law.  Deputies can, of course, recommend suitable persons as allottees, and such recommendations must be considered by the staff dealing with an estate, but the final decision in all such matters rests with the commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputy Dillon and to others who followed in the same despicable campaign of mud-slinging, to listen to this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Again, some people imagine that membership of some political Party or organisation entitles them to consideration by the commissioners. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Land must be divided amongst those most entitled to it according to economic necessity, and politics as such can have no bearing whatever on the matter.  This must not be confused in any way with the special preference to be given to ex-I.R.A. men having proved national services in each category of persons entitled to land.</P>
    <P>Trusting that the above may help to remove at least some of the many misconceptions regarding land division so widely held by people generally up and down the country.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>About ten years ago. I have repeated it time and time again. That has been my standard.  I wonder would Deputy Dillon, if placed in a similar position to mine, have had the moral courage, or the physical courage to write such a letter and have it published in the local papers.  I have done it.  It has not done any damage.  I have been honest with my people and, as a result, they have grown from strength to strength and, in that constituency <Col N="367" /> to-day, thank God, not a single representative of Fine Gael is left.  That is why these baseless allegations were levelled against me last night.  At a later stage when you returned to the House, a Chinn Comhairle, you ruled that a Minister who had been in charge of a Department at one time but had left it, should not be charged with anything done in that Department for the time being, as the Minister at present in charge is the only one responsible for its policy. Deputy Dillon took advantage of your absence, sir, to level a charge against a man who never had anything to do with administration.</P>
      <P>This Bill is rendered necessary because a number of people chosen in the first instance by inspectors were given divisions of land, houses and out-offices approximately value for £1,000, as a free gift from the community. Does Deputy Dillon, Deputy Flanagan, or any Deputy on the Opposition Benches, think that men who were given divisions of land, houses and out-offices to the value, approximately, of £1,000 by their neighbours, and by the community, and who for years have left the houses unoccupied and permitted them to go to rack and ruin, should be left there while other people, perhaps, much more deserving, are left without houses and land?   Are the others not entitled to consideration?  I grant that mistakes will be made.  I do not want to blame the officials of the Land Commission.  I know how the machinery works and while human nature is human nature there will be errors of judgment, and men will make mistakes by sometimes choosing the wrong persons.  No man who has any concern for the taxpayers of this country can stand idly by and look on houses lying derelict and the land growing weeds.  The houses are going to rack and ruin.  That is the necessity for the introduction of this Bill and, for that reason, I support it and commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary has helped the Minister to prepare this Bill. Except for the last two sentences of his speech, the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="368" /> refrained from making any useful comment on the Bill that has been presented to the House.  He rather lapsed into a type of debate which I, for one, resent.  The Parliamentary Secretary accused this Party of using the privileges of this House for a political campaign, or for political debate, but he immediately started to give an example of one of the most political speeches ever made in this House.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary waxed furious because Deputy Dillon and some other Deputies made speeches which, he thought, reflected on his administration.  I have never used debates in this House to serve my political ends.  No member of any Party can allege that against me.  I listened to several speeches in the debate last night.  One of those speeches was made by Deputy Flanagan, a one-time member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He made accusations, which if correct&mdash;I presume the Deputy was speaking with knowledge&mdash;are astounding.  I could hardly believe then, and I can hardly believe now, that such things took place.</P>

      <P>If it is correct, it is lamentable.  I shall say nothing further on that point.  The Parliamentary Secretary accused Fine Gael, in tremendously extravagant terms, of opposing every measure that the Government bring in as if it were planned in Hell. That is hardly a proper parliamentary reference by a semi-Minister of State. I shall commence my speech in a different tone.  I congratulate the Minister on having the courage to come to the House with a Bill to remedy a state of affairs which he found existing in his Department when he took office.  Members of the House should have the <Col N="369" /> courage of their convictions and should appreciate their responsibilities as Deputies.   Members of every Party should recognise that, even if it is only by chance, there is some good in the Party opposed to his.  I am willing to admit, straightway, that, for once, I see some good in this endeavour by the Government to rectify an existing evil. Everybody with eyes to look and ears to hear knows the position in regard to land distribution.  All of us know that houses, built at considerable expense to the taxpayers, are in many cases uninhabited and that the lands attached are being neglected.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the cost to the Government in some of those cases was about £1,000. Does any Deputy, as an honest, conscientious representative, believe that the taxpayers' money should be wasted in such a manner?  I, for one, shall not subscribe to conduct of that sort.</P>
      <P>We heard speeches from Deputy Dillon and others, in glorious terms, pointing out that, under this Bill, there will be another period of evictions and that families will be thrown out of their homes.  I do not believe that anything of the kind will take place and I shall endeavour to secure that it will not take place.  The number of families; if any, to be affected by this Bill will be very small.  Even if there is to be a single case of hardship, are we to refuse to pass this Bill because of that single case?  What about the hardships which were imposed when the land was being distributed?  Did not the people from whom the land was taken undergo hardships?  Was not the land taken from them&mdash;at confiscation prices, in some cases&mdash;so that those allottees would be given an opportunity of living and working in their own country?  They were presented with houses and land up to a value, as the Parliamentary Secretary stated, of £1,000 in some cases.  It was hoped that they would made good on those lands.  To their credit, many thousands of decent, honest persons did make good and have become useful citizens.  Are the men who lagged behind, the men who refused to work or to reside on their holdings, to receive special privileges and to be allowed to continue to do as they are doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> I accept the principle of this Bill.  I think that the Minister is perfectly right in trying to remedy the state of affairs he found in his Department when he took office&mdash;to remedy the scandals which, he knows, exist.  I believe that all of us should accept the principle of this Bill.  The Bill needs amendment and we propose to put in amendments.  Two or three sections of the Bill should not, in my opinion, be passed by this House in the precise form in which they appear at present.  However, that will come up on Committee Stage.  We hope to put in amendments to those sections so as to prevent extreme hardship. The allottee should have an opportunity of making representations to some body other than the Land Commission. Deputy Dillon referred to fixity of tenure and said that we were undoing all that had been done to fix the people in the land.  If there is any Deputy in this House who has fought for fixity of tenure for farmers, it is I. On Land Bill after Land Bill for the past 19 or 20 years, I have been fighting for fixity of tenure for the farmers &mdash;even for the people from whom the land was taken.  It was taken from them by both Governments, I hope, for good reasons.  It was expected that the people to whom the land was given would make proper use of it.  It was felt that they should be compelled, if necessary, to make good use of it.  I have no doubt that grave mistakes have been made in the allotment of land.  I shall go no further than that.</P>
    <P>Enough heat has been engendered in this debate.  The Minister is right in trying to correct the mistakes which were made.  I should have liked to see land administered in a manner different from that in which it has been administered here.  When land was being given to allottees, I should have liked to see some definite conditions imposed.  I should have liked to see something similar to the system in operation in Canada and other countries introduced.  I realise more than any other Deputy the difficulties of the ordinary allottee.  Probably that is because I was an allottee myself, under conditions that no allottee of land in this country ever endured, and I believe it was the proper system. <Col N="371" /> Years ago, when I was in Canada, we were given 160 acres of land, on certain conditions.  We were not given a parcel of good, useful, cultivated land, already fenced, and presented with a house, and told to go ahead and farm the land and live on it.  We were given acres of waste, mostly scrub land, and told: &ldquo;If you do the following things within a number of years, if you clear so much of it, if you cultivate so much of it, if you build a house and a barn on it, and live on it for six months of each year for so many years, we will give you a title and it is yours.&rdquo;  It was to the credit of a great number of pioneers in Canada that they did so and it was the pioneers who made that country great.  It was their sweat and their work which earned them the title to their holdings.</P>
    <P>In this country, no allottee of land was given it on extremely hard conditions of that kind.  There should be some similar conditions here, some defined conditions under which the allottee would take the land, that he was to do certain things on it and improve it, if possible, from the state in which he got it.  That was the real intention of the Land Acts.  Land was supposed to be taken from those people who were using it badly.  In regard to every estate I saw divided, one of the cases made was that the late owner was not making efficient use of it.  It was hoped that the new owner would improve on that and would use the land more for the benefit of the nation generally than did the man who had held it.  When we see land taken from one holder and handed over to a new holder, we expect that the new man will make better use of it, since it is land given to him at the expense of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan waxed eloquent on the liberty of the subject.  There is no attempt whatsoever in this Bill to interfere with that.  Deputy Dillon spoke in the same terms last night, saying that there was interference with the liberty of the subject.  If there were ever any logical attempt to do so, in regard to land division, or to interfere with the real rights in the ownership of land it was done in the case of the <Col N="372" /> people from whom the land was taken. When new men were put on to the land, they were put on in the expectation that they would become eventually the vested owners, with the same rights and privileges as we hope the ordinary small farmer has at present. However, they have got to earn their title to that, by making some demonstration that they have used the land, rightly for a number of years before they become vested.  There should be some definite conditions and it should be made certain that they fulfil them. When that has been done, the land should be vested quickly.</P>
    <P>I do not care a snap of my fingers if a decent allottee, having got land and having worked hard and decently for four or five years on it, and having become vested in it, sells it then to someone else.  I do not see that any great harm has been done to the State or to the people in general, if an allottee, having got a small parcel of land and having worked it for four or five years, decides, for some reason or another, to sell it.  Why should he not do so?  What would it mean but the passing over of the land from one small allottee to another?  The change will not do any harm.  One of the things which may have led up to the difficulty is the delay in vesting.  There should be a quickening up of the system.  Those allottees who are there at present should have their holdings vested.  There are many decent men who have been working their holdings for ten or 15 years but still are not the owners.  I know of estates in my own county which were well divided by the Land Commission, where there are very few delinquents, where the land is worked well and is manned by men who are a credit to the country, and whose farms are a credit to them; but they are not yet vested and they do not own the land.  That is a lamentable state of affairs and should be corrected.</P>
    <P>In accepting the principles of this Bill I repeat that an attempt must be made, and that the Minister was right in making it, to undo the mischief which had been created, to set right the conditions he found in his Department when he came into it.  I am familiar with particular cases in my own <Col N="373" /> county, where people got farms worth up to £1,000 many years ago, who have made no endeavour whatsoever either to work the land or to live in the houses, which are now falling down.  I know that the Department made efforts to warn those people year after year that if they continued in that way the land would be taken from them.  They went so far as to ask them to give up possessions, but it seems that the Minister found that, for some reason, he was not able to go further.  He brings in this Bill now on that account.  Should we refuse to give him the power to deal with such people?  These are the people with whom the Minister primarily wishes to deal.</P>
    <P>We have the extravagant case made by Deputy Dillon and others, that this Bill is levelled directly at the allottee with ten or 15 children, who miraculously grew up since he was given the farm.  It is to be hoped that some of the farmers were not such a long term there, that is, for some 15 or more years.  As to the figures mentioned by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Giles, regarding the unfortunate families of 15 or 16 children, planted there and now to be evicted, when did they get their land?  They must have got it before this State existed, as they could not have raised 15 or 16 children in the last few years.</P>

These are the cases that anyone can bring ín, if he wants to make an extravagant opposition to this Bill.  I do not believe there will be two families such as described by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Giles and other speakers, evicted under this Bill, when it becomes an Act.  If there are one or two sections which do not appeal to any Deputy, let him put down amendments.  I intend to propose some amendments myself.  I believe that any honest Deputy, who has any regard for his responsibilities to the people who put him in and to the taxpayers in general must support the principle of this Bill.  Anybody who has any regard <Col N="374" /> for decent allottees, for the great majority of people who have worked the land well, will not rise here and and make a case for the deliquent, who is useless in this country, as he is useless in any other country.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate Deputy Bennett on the speech he has made now and the explanation he gave about this particular measure.  Indeed, I do not think he need have troubled to go into such detail, since I hope that he did not presume for a moment that anyone paid much attention either to Deputy Giles or Deputy Dillon&mdash;or to a few others who spoke in the same strain. It is a sort of calamity that these extravagances are used here.  I would not mind so much about these extravagances being used so far as the intentions of the Bill before the House are concerned&mdash;perhaps there is a licence to exaggerate.  But when you come to attacking bodies of very decent people here, attacking their characters, it is a very different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References were made to the migrants who have come into County Meath.  They did not come in with my approval&mdash;I would prefer to see the members of the community in County Meath getting those lands&mdash; but it was a national policy and under that policy those migrants came into holdings in the County Meath.  They are doing well there.  They were welcomed into County Meath.  They are looked upon by the majority of the people of County Meath as decent, respectable, honest persons and I think it is a calamity to malign them in the way Deputy Giles attempted to malign them.  I know that what he said has not any weight; possibly they know him as well as we do, or as well as anybody else does, but at the same time, in case there are people here who may not know it, I want to say as regards these people who were maligned that there is nothing wrong with them.  They are quite good citizens and excellent neighbours. What has been said about them might, perhaps, create animosity and bitterness. It is a pity that such a thing as this should arise and I simply make <Col N="375" /> this statement in order to be satisfied and to assure myself that nobody here believes a single word that was said about these people.</P>

      <P>It is almost as amusing to hear Deputy O'Reilly reproving people for extravagance of speech as it was to hear Parliamentary Secretary O'Grady chastising people on this side of the House because they had not more regard for truth, honour, justice and fair play&mdash;of all things, in connection with the distribution and division of land.  We have had that coming from Deputy O'Grady, who is, perhaps, more responsible than any other member of this House for the fact that this Bill has been introduced. I doubt if any man used more effort with such success in getting people placed on the land, given allotments, not on merit, but merely, from Deputy O'Grady's point of view, because they were digging, and were prepared to continue to dig, with the right foot. However, that is that.</P>
      <P>It will not serve any useful purpose to go back in detail on what has happened over the last 12 or 13 years in connection with the division of land. I can only speak from my own personal experience and I say that, so far as the division of land in my county is concerned, generally speaking it was done in a fair and straight way and the land was given to allottees on merit.  No matter how conscientious the inspector may be, or how conscientious the Department may be, and no matter how efficient, it is quite possible that a person may get land and will not use it subsequently to the best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two principles in connection with land that we ought to get into the backs of our minds. One is that the State did not set up machinery, at tremendous cost, in order to give land to individuals merely for the sake of the individual.  It was and is done for the welfare of the nation, not for the welfare of the individual, because if that were done, then of course you might as well leave the land to one individual as to another.  It ought to be understood that the main purpose of this Bill&mdash;I <Col N="376" /> hope this is the purpose; I think it is &mdash;is not to put people out of their homes; but to see that they will live in the homes that the State has provided for them.  That is the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>Those who opposed the Bill are justified to this extent.  There are, undoubtedly, one or two objectionable sections in the Bill.  Unfortunately, that is one of the weaknesses, one of the failings, of the present Government, and we see it repeated in Bill after Bill&mdash;in the Public Health Bill, in this and in many other Bills.  Parts of the legislation are excellent, but then it is spoiled by bringing in one or two sections that it is impossible to justify.  I do not know what the reason for that may be, but I suggest that no question of expediency and no question of saving trouble or labour or expense can justify the section in this Bill relating to certificates and proposing that, without the right of going into court, a man can be dealt with in the manner in which the Bill seeks power to deal with him.  So far as some of us here are concerned we will, as Deputy Bennett said, do our part on the Committee Stage to see that that section is remedied.</P>
    <P>We must remember that as regards all land that was allocated in the last ten, 20 or 25 years, no matter what is paid by way of annuity by the person to whom the land was given, that land is still subsidised by the general taxpayer, and the general taxpayer has some right in the matter.  Land is divided, not for the sake of the individual, but because it is considered in this Legislature that it is in the national interest to divide it.  If a person gets land, he gets it in the hope that he will produce food from that land for his family, with the surplus going to the nation.  If he fails to do that, he fails in his contract and it is not the Land Commission that fails.</P>
    <P>With regard to the case made about the eviction of people with six, seven, eight, ten or 12 children, I cannot see that arising because you can take it from me as a married man, unlike Deputy Bennett who is a bachelor, that if you have an allotment and you have a wife and six, seven, eight or ten <Col N="377" /> children to provide for, even though you may be inclined to be lazy you will, because of your wife and family, have to work.</P>

      <P>I have listened to a lot of the speeches made on this Bill and to the Minister's opening address and I take this opportunity to refer to certain remarks made by Deputy Dillon last night.  Deputy Dillon is a man who claimed the privilege of this House on one occasion when he was attacked.  He said that from the point of view of decorum and decency this House should not descend to personalities and then that very honourable Deputy last night refused to practice what he preached and he descended to the very level he was arguing against and for which, on another occasion, he wanted the protection of the House.</P>
      <P>Listening to the various Opposition speakers, I am inclined to think that their remarks are typical of those that have been used here from time to time. Looking at this from a logical point of view, are we to allow the rural part of our country to be made up of ruins and to allow people who have been allotted holdings to live elsewhere? Are we to allow a wholesale movement to the towns and cities?  This Bill has been brought in by the Government to deal with the existing state of affairs, and I must compliment the Minister on the very serious and sincere attitude he has taken up with regard to land since he was appointed Minister.  He is not another Stalin; he is a decent charitable man who will not evict anybody without very good reason for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know cases in my own constituency of people who have refused to live on holdings allotted to them.  They are not Fianna Fáil supporters and were not recommended by a Fianna Fáil club.  If I had power in the morning to recommend a particular man for a holding, I would refuse to do so.  I prefer to leave it to the Land Commission. The opposition have criticised this proposal when they know that, while the Minister has power in relation <Col N="378" /> to his Department, the decision as to who should get land and what land should be acquired is a matter for the Land Commissioners duly set up under the 1933 Act.  There is no Deputy who, when he gets a letter from a constituent about land, will not forward that letter to the Land Commission, and if any Deputy denies that I suggest that his denial is a terminological inexactitude.</P>
    <P>If we are to advance as a nation we should at least try to be honest and should not allow a man with a holding of land to refuse to live on it.  We should not allow him to live elsewhere and to get work on the roads which the man who has no land should get.  Not alone is he a burden on the State but he is depriving the unemployed man who has no other means of livelihood of work on the roads.  A man who has a holding and who is making a decent effort to work it, should get every encouragement from the Government. I know also that, in County Dublin especially, many men who are making an honest effort to work their land are anxious to get their holdings vested, but we have been promised by the Minister that that will be done in due course, and I know well that the Minister will not take undue advantage of any allottee who is inclined to work his land.</P>
    <P>While dealing with this question, I should like to give my views on certain land division in County Dublin which has come to my notice.  While the Land Commission inspectors whom I know are decent, honourable men who do their jobs in a conscientious manner, it must be admitted that anything human cannot be perfect and we cannot expect that every inspector will do the right thing all the time.  We could make mistakes from time to time in regard to the allotting of lands and the one thing which I definitely disagree with, and have disagreed with so long as I have been in public life, is the allotting of small holdings.  My idea of an economic holding is a holding on which a man can keep two horses, that is, 30 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Burke Mr. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>30 acres.  My point is that if you give 30 acres between three men, they are neither farmers not labourers, but if you give one man 30 acres, he will employ another man and two people will get a livelihood out of the holding.  If, however, we are to protect the land in this country and to ensure that we will not have a country consisting of derelict farms, something must be done.  I see no suggestion of a Stalin attitude in this Bill.  It is a Bill designed for the general good of the majority of the people.  I should like to see it go even further than it goes.  I should like to see provision made by which a man who has land will be compelled to live on it, because we have too many people with land who live elsewhere. If that state of affairs continues, I do not know where this country will go.</P>
      <P>The Clann na Talmhan Party are the people who should at least give a headline in this matter.  They have criticised the Minister for introducing a Bill which is for the benefit of the people, but what good to this nation, to themselves or their families, are the men who have land and who make no effort to do anything with it?  No country in the world, no matter how democratic, would allow such a state of affairs to continue.  I may be speaking against my own interests and may be told later on that I adopted a rather high-handed attitude on this matter, but I believe in what I am saying. I come from a family which was associated with the Land League since its inception and I am deeply interested in these matters.  I think the Minister is taking a very honourable attitude and that the Bill will be for the benefit of everybody.  In conclusion, I ask the Minister to see to it that, when the occasion does arise to dispossess anybody, due consideration will be given to each case and that no undue hardship will be inflicted on the persons concerned.  I also urge him to insist on people who have large holdings living on them.</P>

      <P>I had no desire to take part in this debate, but this House seems to have got hot and bothered in 1946, after having sat dormant for ten or 12 years and having permitted to <Col N="380" /> develop the state of affairs which has brought about the necessity for this Bill.  Some years ago, I ceased to put forward the matters with which I then dealt with which have, in my opinion, brought about that necessity.  These allottees are attacked from two angles: first, that they are lazy and wasters; and, secondly, that many have been placed on land through political influence who did not want land at all. That may or may not be true.  It is quite easy to make allegations against poor people and I do not say that these allegations are true or untrue, but the case I put forward to this House 12, 13 and 14 years ago, when this legislation was first introduced, was that the whole approach to land division was wrong.  This Bill confirms me in that view.  My contention was that 20 acres of land of any kind&mdash;and the better it was, the worse it was for the allottee to live on&mdash;was not sufficient. Deputies yesterday and to-day spoke about what is to be done with the fathers and mothers who have ten, 12 and 13 children who will be evicted under the Bill.  These are the people who should have been considered at the time this policy was being adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That rule was not adhered to in the case of the last motion before the House.  I move my motion which reads:-</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that in order to secure a more equitable distribution of the burden of local rates, and to promote increased employment on the land, legislation should be introduced providing for complete derating of the first £20 of the Poor Law Valuation of each farm and the further total derating of each additional £15 of the Poor Law Valuation in respect of each adult worker employed on the holding; and that the deficit be made good from the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion means, in effect, that agricultural holdings, which provide a fair proportion of employment shall enjoy complete derating.  It is in effect complete derating, subject to certain conditions being complied with.  Heretofore, the demand for complete derating has frequently been met with the answer that the large farmer, employing no labour whatever, would derive too great an advantage from this reform.  In the scheme which we are outlining the benefits conferred will be in proportion to the number of people living and working on the land.  We have heard it said frequently that the small farmer is entitled to derating, but that the large farmer is not. I do not agree with that view. I hold that the large farmer who gives employment to a number of workers, whether they be members of his own family or workers employed by him, is at least as much entitled to relief from rates as the smallholder.  In our scheme we provide that the first £20 of the poor law valuation of each holding shall be exempt from rates, thereby ensuring that the landholder will get relief in respect of his own labour on the land.  We further provide that, in respect of each adult worker, whether that worker be a member of the farmer's family or an employee, a further £15 shall be relieved from rates.  Thus a farm with a valuation of £40, worked by a farmer and his wife, would be exempt from rates.  A farm with a valuation of £60, on which you had a farmer, his wife and one <Col N="382" /> adult working, would be exempt from rates, and for every other worker there would be a further £15 by way of complete derating.  We also provide in the motion that, whatever money is required to meet the cost of this charge, shall be provided out of the Exchequer.  That is to say, it shall not be passed on to the portion of the holding which is not derated or passed on to other rateable property in the county.  It shall be complete relief both as far as the farmers is concerned and as far as the county is concerned.</P>
    <P>Derating has now become a fairly ancient subject.  It was, I think, in 1928 that the British Government introduced legislation for the complete derating of agricultural land and buildings as well as a substantial measure of derating for industrial property. The provisions of this legislation also applied to our own citizens, our own fellow-countrymen of the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.  When we talk about national unity and the ending of Partition, we ought to bear in mind that a very large section of the population of Northern Ireland is composed of farmers, many of them small farmers.  At the present time they enjoy complete immunity from rates, and I think it would be unreasonable to expect that they would be enthusiastic about coming into our State to put their legs under the heel of the rate collector again after enjoying exemption from the payment of rates for a period of 16 or 17 years. Viewing it from that angle, I think we must admit that there is, on national grounds, a strong case for taking up this question of derating seriously.</P>
    <P>It may be asked why did the British Government decide to relieve agricultural land from rates.  There is, of course, first of all the reason that the agricultural producer in Great Britain as in this country has to complete with the agricultural producers of the world. For that reason he ought to be placed in as advantageous a position as possible. Rates on agricultural land are a form of inverted protection, protection for the imported produce as against the home producer; rates on agricultural land are a tax on the home producer, which fact was recognised <Col N="383" /> by the British Government and by the Northern Ireland Government as far back as 1928.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration in regard to this matter, that the present system of rating is inequitable.  If the Minister happened to be a man enjoying a big income from foreign investments or some other source and if he were sensible enough to live in a small private semi-detached or detached residence, with a small valuation, he would be called upon to pay only a very small contribution towards local services but, if he happened to be a farmer with a fairly extensive holding, perhaps of interior land, he would be subject to a much higher valuation than he would be if he had not rateable property.  Why should we have this discrimination between these two sections of the community, between the man who enjoys a large income and who owns very little rateable property and the man who, perhaps, has no income at all, who is working his property at a loss but who owns a certain amount of land that is subject to a poor law valuation?  That is an inequality and an injustice which, as far back as 1928, it was felt in Great Britain could not be tolerated.  If citizens are to contribute to the upkeep of national and social services, as I think they should, and if a substantial portion of that contribution should be made by way of direct taxation, it is imperative that such direct taxation should be equitably distributed over all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>It might be argued, of course, that the man with a large income derived from a source other than land is caught by the income-tax collector.  That also applies to the farmer, although the farmer, as a rule, is not caught by the income-tax collector because he has no income.  If he had land or property of such income-producing capacity as to give him an income, he would come under the heel of the income-tax collector, just like other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>We find, therefore, two strong reasons why agricultural land should be derated&mdash;first, to give the home producer a chance to compete on equal terms with producers of North America, <Col N="384" /> South America, and so on, where land is lowly taxed; and, second, to provide a more equitable distribution of the burden of direct taxation.</P>
    <P>This question has been before the public for a long time.  It was a big issue in the election of 1932.  It was solemnly promised by the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition that if they were returned to power in 1932 they would completely abolish rates.  That promise, like many other promises, was never fulfilled.  The question is more urgent now than it was in 1932.  In 1932 the total rates paid in this State was £4,200,000.  That was the total amount levied and collected from the ratepayers for the year ended March, 1933. For 1943, which is the last year for which I have figures available, the total amount of rates levied in the TwentySix Counties was £7,500,000.  There you have an increase from £4,200,000 to £7,500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the volume with me at the moment but I will refer the Deputy to the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i> He will find that the total amount of rates levied and collected for 1943 was £7,500,000, the total amount levied and collected for 1933 was £4,200,000.  Of course, that is only a portion of the total expenditure of the local authorities&mdash;there are substantial grants also from the Central Exchequer at the moment&mdash;but that is the amount levied and collected by the local authorities. The total amount levied and collected from rural districts for the year 1933 <Col N="385" /> was approximately £2,000,000.  The total amount levied and collected from rural districts in 1943 was £4,132,000. As far as rural areas are concerned, there has been 100 per cent. increase in rates during the ten years 1933 to 1943.</P>
      <P>Thus we have the position that when the Fianna Fáil Party solemnly promised to abolish rates on agricultural land the rates were only half what they are to-day.  Instead of derating agricultural land, the Fianna Fáil Party, during their tenure of office, have doubled the rates on agricultural land.  That is not all.  We have the position at present that additional burdens are being placed on the local authorities.  Big rural development schemes are contemplated, new public health services are being provided by legislation, new housing schemes are being initiated, all of which impose additional burdens on the local rates. There is a growing feeling amongst the rural population that they can look forward to nothing except an ever-increasing burden of taxation.  Therefore, I think it is right and proper that the question ought to be examined.</P>
      <P>The small property owner in this country is the backbone of the State. It is upon his industry, his initiative, and his enterprise that we can build our hopes of progress.  But the position at the present time is that that man is being discouraged and is disheartened by reason of the fact that each year the demand made upon him by the rate collector steadily increases. By his industry and his enterprise he may increase the value of his output from the land.  By industry and hard work he may increase his income, but, invariably, he finds that every year the rate collector comes to him for a bigger rate-off in the way of rates and, therefore, he finds that, to a great extent, his labour and his enterprise are in vain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1929 a derating commission was set up to examine this question of the incidence of rates on agricultural land and to recommend whether or not it should be completely derated.  The commission was composed almost entirely of officials and professional <Col N="386" /> people and, needless to say, the majority decided against the derating of agricultural land.  But it is worth while to consider some of the reasons which they advanced at that time against the derating of agricultural land.  One of the reasons they gave was that it would be impracticable to attach conditions to the granting of relief from rates.  Now, in our scheme, we do propose to attach conditions, and I can see nothing impracticable about it.  It is very easy to ascertain how many people are employed on each holding and how many adult members of the farmer's family are working on the holding.  As a matter of fact, it has been ascertained under the present rating system.  There is nothing impracticable in that proposition.  The passage of time has proved that it is a practicable proposition.</P>
    <P>Again they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The remission of agricultural and industrial rates would have far-reaching effects on the structure of local government in the counties and would involve the virtual termination of local responsibility for and control of local services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here, again, the passage of time has completely demolished that argument against derating.  By a series of Local Government Acts and by the County Management Act the local representatives have been deprived of most of their rights of control over local affairs. To a very large extent, the State has entered into complete control of the management of our local services.  Thus we have the position that the commission advised against derating on the ground that it would be necessary to deprive the local representatives of their rights and they used this argument against derating; that it would mean a further encroachment by the State on the affairs of the local authorities.  But that encroachment has taken place, it has been achieved under a series of Acts.  Not only have we not got derating of agricultural land, but we have a doubling of the rates on agricultural land as compared with 1931 when this commission reported.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> Again the commission state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any reconstruction of the system of local government should take precedence of, and not be undertaken merely as a necessary consequence of, the granting of relief from rates on agricultural and industrial hereditaments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That condition has also been complied with.  There has been a reconstruction of the system of local government, and a very drastic and far-reaching reconstruction of the system, and it has taken precedence over the derating of agricultural land.  Now that we have reconstructed our system of local government and given the central Government more far-reaching power and authority over the administration of local services, surely the time has come when we ought to call upon the central Exchequer to make the necessary contribution to the relief of rates by the derating of agricultural land, as we advocate.</P>
    <P>The commission also say:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No increase in production or employment could be hoped for as a result of a revision of the existing basis of distribution of Exchequer grants to local authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that connection, no proposition of a similar nature to the one we are submitting to the House was put before the Derating Commission.  They were no asked to consider a proposition by which derating would be conditional upon employment being given.  If they had been, I do not think they would have made that statement.  They would have been forced to admit that an increase in production could be brought about by giving an incentive and encouragement to increased employment on the land.  They also say:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The transfer to the central authority of services administered by local authorities for the purpose of securing a remission of rates on productive hereditaments cannot be recommended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I contend that that has taken place to a very large extent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the considered recommendations which were made by the Derating Commission in 1931 are completely <Col N="388" /> out-of-date.  Circumstances have changed.  The whole system of local government has changed.  The entire contribution demanded from the local ratepayers has increased out of all proportion to what it was at that time. The services which the local authorities are called upon to perform have completely altered and, therefore, there is adequate reason why we should reconsider this whole question.</P>
    <P>The Derating Commission, sitting in 1931 and considering this question, said &mdash;and I think it was a very foolish observation for wise men to make:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The case for the relief of agricultural rates cannot be substantiated on the grounds of the remission of agricultural rates in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Derating in the latter areas has not had any noticeable beneficial effect on agricultural production in those areas, or any adverse effect on the position of agriculture in Saorstát Éireann.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>as it was at that time.  That commission was sitting a little more than a year after derating had been introduced in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and it would be impossible to notice any change in that time.  But looking at the question now, I think we can notice very considerable changes.  We can notice that there has been a very marked increase in the volume of agricultural output, and there has been no improvement whatever as far as this State is concerned. As a matter of fact&mdash;and here I defy the Minister to contradict me&mdash;there has been a reduction in the volume of agricultural output here during the last six or seven years.</P>
    <P>When discussing this matter, we should take into consideration not only statistics and figures, which are cold and abstract things; we ought to consider too the ordinary human aspects of the case.  We ought to consider the small man on the small holding, and we ought to consider the position of the farmer, large or small, who is struggling to make a living out of agricultural land.  Agricultural land differs very considerably from other property.  It differs from industrial property and it differs from commercial <Col N="389" /> property.  There is only a very narrow margin of profit even for the best farmer.  Even during the best years, the margin of profit is very narrow.  The direct contribution which the landowner, large or small, is called upon to make annually or half-yearly to the rate collector is a severe burden upon him.  It has a disheartening effect, and it is something which it should be possible for the smallholder and the large holder, who gives employment, to avoid, provided he complies with certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The conditions which are set out in this motion are conditions in regard to which it might be said at the first glance that it would be very easy for the large farmer to comply with them. I do not agree with that.  I hold that the large farmer who employes a man&mdash; whether a member of his own family or an employee&mdash;for every £15 of his poor law valuation is working his land very intensively.  He must be working it very intensively in order to be able to afford that amount of employment. Take the farm of £100 or £200 valuation, and consider one employee for every £15 valuation; you will find that that is a very large staff on that farm, and that the farm must be very well managed and worked in order to give that amount of employment.  We are not giving anything generous to the large landholder in this motion.  As far as the small landowner is concerned, the man under £20 valuation, we all know that his struggle for existence is a very keen and a very hard one, particularly if he has a young family to support.  As far as he is concerned, I think the concession for which we are asking in this motion cannot be considered extremely generous.</P>
    <P>This motion is a little bit vague as far as poor law valuation is concerned. We did not state exactly whether we were including the dwelling-house under this heading of poor law valuation. That is a question on which I should like to hear the views of other Deputies.  Certainly, I think no case can be made for exempting farm buildings from derating.  Farm buildings are a portion of the farmer's working capital.  They are in just the same <Col N="390" /> position as farm equipment, ploughs, harrows, mowers and so on.  They certainly should not be taxed.  As a matter of fact, I think all our efforts should be directed towards encouraging the farmer to increase the amount of capital which he puts into buildings of all kinds for his stock and implements and for the storage of his grain. The system at the present time, under which the farmer who adds to his buildings is immediately presented with an increased demand for rates, is a bad one, and ought to be brought to an end.  The farmer who wishes to increase his buildings for the housing of his stock and implements should not be discouraged.  That is part of the equipment which is desirable in intensifying farming in this country. We know that the amount of capital which the Danish farmers have invested in farm buildings and equipment is immeasurably higher than the amount so invested here.  Our farms are completely under-equipped.  There is no more reason to increase the valuation of a farmer who erects a new byre, or a new piggery, than there is to increase it if he buys a new reaper and binder. They are all part of his equipment, and as such should be exempt from rates. I recommend this motion to the serious consideration of the House.  I think it is one which will make for what we all desire, more intensive farming, more employment on the land, and increased production in agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan has stated that in some respects the motion is vague.  To my mind, it is not half as vague as the speech he has made in explanation of it.  To my mind he has mixed up his figures most appallingly, and he has not given any explanation whatever as to how the social services are going to be promoted if this state of rating is approved.  I think furthermore that he has not given to this Government the credit that is due to it for implementing or seeking to implement what he calls the promises that were made many years ago.  If the Deputy is aware of the facts he should know that up to the present there is a <Col N="391" /> primary rating of land up to £20; that there is a special concession of £12 10s. for every member of the family over 17 years of age working on the land, £12 10s. for every working employee on the land, and that those concessions were brought in by the present Government. Of course he made no reference at all to the fact that in the meantime the annuities have been reduced to half.  He has stated that the rates have mounted from £4,000,000 to £7,000,000.  Unfortunately, he has brought into that amount of £7,000,000 the urban district levies, the poor rate levy, and the levy by the town commissioners of £89,000, as well as the municipal and other rates, amounting to £2,500,000, in order to make up that £7,000,000.  He has not made any reference to the fact that, as a result of the various housing schemes, whether municipal or otherwise, which have been adopted, the rates have gone up in consequence.  He has not given us a clear picture as to how the rates have affected the land, of which he has spoken so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of many of the non-municipal houses in the cities where the area of land available did not permit of new buildings, and where they had to go out into the county areas to acquire land for building purposes. The consequence was that the people in the cities have to pay rates to the county councils on these properties. If these rates have seemed static during the years from 1933 to 1943, then, in a great measure, many of the houses built by the present Government, and on which these rates are charged, are included in the Deputy's figures.  Accordingly, I think that, before the House agrees to this, there should be something very much more definite before us.  There should be something more definite as to how the £1,500,000 for roads will be provided, as to how the money for the provision of hospitals will be provided, and as to how the cost of extra social services will be provided.  Surely, the poorer classes of our population, who already have a hard enough struggle in order to live on a weekly wage or, perhaps, on unemployment assistance or relief, <Col N="392" /> are not going to have these charges thrown upon them?  We all admit that agriculture or the land of this country is the most important asset that we have here, and if reasonable assistance is given by the Government to agriculture, that should be acknowledged. However, it seems to me to be clear that all these implications that are concerned here should be put before the House in a clear and concise manner, so that the ordinary members of the community would be able to know how they stand.  We all know that farmers are doing fairly well at the moment, and that is only right. Deputy Cogan says that there is no income from the land.  Well, observe for a moment the prices that are being paid for farms that go into the market. Now, nobody&mdash;and especially the farmers&mdash;will be so foolish as to buy property from which there is no income, and yet we see the prices that are being offered for farms at the moment.  For that reason, I suggest that this whole matter has not been properly explained or has received serious consideration from this House at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which concerns the constituency which I represent&mdash;a constituency which happens to be one of the poorest in this country, from the point of view of agricultural land.  I have no doubt that people who are nimble in the handling of statistics can make a very specious case for this motion.  I have not studied statistics very deeply in connection with this matter, but I should like the Minister, and all concerned with the matter, to bear one or two fundamental principles in mind in relation to it.  The main one is that those who are fortunate enough to have property ought to take on some obligations in regard to that property.  Over the greater part of the West Galway constituency, we have people who are not able to produce butter and milk in sufficient quantities for their own needs.  Now, we know that both butter and sugar are two items which are very heavily subsidised by the taxpayers. The people in the constituency I represent, I suppose, would consume as much of these commodities as families <Col N="393" /> in other parts of the country, but they do not gain anything as a result of the subsidies which are given to these industries.  Now, I suggest that if agricultural land were to be any further derated&mdash;and I do not think that anybody can claim that it has not been derated fairly substantially as a result of the various reliefs that have been granted, as the mover of the motion pointed out himself&mdash;it would mean a diminution of local representation.  I think that in present circumstances the reliefs that have been given have divided the burden fairly equitably as between the landholders in the country and other ratepayers.  Now, even in the good portions of my constituency, east of the Corrib, I have never heard any demand at all for the derating of land.  It is not a problem of any size there, and the farmers there have never, at any time, questioned the justice of being called upon to pay a contribution in respect of the value of the property they hold for the provision of local services which are maintained.</P>
      <P>We have heard, in recent times, a great deal of talk about bureaucracy in this country.  Well, I believe that if one step could be taken really to establish bureaucracy here in this country very definitely, it would be by means of the complete derating of agricultural land or other kinds of property.  I believe that the report of the committee was accurate, when it pointed out that derating, if adopted, would leave no case for the retention of local representation.  I believe that a necessary consequence of complete derating would be that local representation would have to disappear.  Now, I am not one of those who are enthusiastic about the Managerial Act.  As I see it, so far as my own constituency is concerned&mdash;and that is the only place of which I have had experience &mdash;I would not like to see any further development of that experiment, but I can visualise the complete abolition of local administration following the implementation of a proposal of this kind. So far as my own area is concerned, which, as I have said, is a very poor one, the people do not regard the rates generally as a very heavy burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I am sorry to see that some of the migrants from my <Col N="394" /> part of the country to the County Meath wanted to have derating there, and I was very hurt and grieved to read some of the remarks published about some of the people from my constituency who went there, but that would be only in the case of a few people, and I am grateful to my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, for defending these people.  The remarks of Deputy Giles were entirely unjustified. Whatever happened there, in my opinion, was occasioned by a small element, and, of course, you will always have an element like that everywhere.  However, Sir, I admit that that is not relevant, and I shall leave it at that, but I do not think that there should be any attempt to throw cold water on the migratory scheme because such things may happen now and again.  I believe, also, that one of the results of the passing of this motion, in addition to the abolition of local representation, would be an attack on fixity of tenure. A great many people have been castigating the Government from time to time for what they consider to be a tendency towards bureaucracy.  I believe that derating would tend more strongly in that direction than anything done by this Parliament in recent years.  I believe that property has its obligations.  Those who have property, no matter in what form, should regard themselves as being very fortunate, and should realise their obligation to pay quite cheerfully and willingly the charges which arise from such responsibility.  I think this motion should not be accepted.</P>

      <P>I expected that a motion of this kind, coming from Deputy Cogan, would be one in favour of small farmers, but on reading it I notice that it refers to the derating of the first £20 of the poor law valuation of each farm, and the further total derating of each additional £15 of the poor law valuation.  Obviously the intention is to help the large farmers. Farmers with valuations over £35 would always be regarded as large farmers.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I understood that the Party Deputy Cogan represents was out to help the small struggling farmer, and I was wondering what was behind this motion, or what it was designed for.  My mind goes back a few years when the Government had to make an arrangement for the payment of minimum rates to agricultural workers.  It is a well-known fact that Irish farmers pay their workers such a miserable wage that the Government had to fix the rates.  The object of this motion seems to be that, as farmers realise they must pay minimum rates of wages, they want the rest of the community to pay by relieving them from payment of such rates.</P>
      <P>This proposal has no bearing on the position of small farmers who work their own holdings.  It is designed primarily to help farmers who can employ other people to work for them, and they expect that the rest of the community should share the burden of having to pay minimum rates.  City workers have minimum rates and they are very small, but apparently farmers do not take that view.  The large farmers are to benefit if this motion passes, but they want to get help from the rates to enable them to pay the miserable wage which they are forced by law to give to agricultural workers. Deputy Cogan stated that farmers did not pay income-tax and he very innocently gave the reason why they do not.  I agree that farmers do not pay income-tax, and I suggest the reason is that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have never been able to tackle that problem properly.  They have never been able to devise a system under which they would get proper accounts from farmers on which to make proper assessments for income-tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not because farmers do not make the income, but because the income-tax officials cannot get at them when they do not keep books.  In that respect they are very fortunate.  The majority of them do not pay anything like the amount of income-tax that <Col N="396" /> they should pay.  Compare the position of the average farmer with city dwellers.  Take the case of a man with an income of £500 who lives in a house, the valuation of which is £30.  That would be quite a modest building of seven or eight rooms.  The occupier of that house would pay in rates £31 and as income-tax £14, or a total of £45 yearly.  Even if he were fortunate enough to own the house, he would have to pay for rates and income-tax £45 a year.  Subject to an allowance for children that person might have to pay income-tax at the rate of 7/6 in the £.  A city dweller or an official with a fixed salary very often has to pay away half his income between income-tax and rates.  Deputy Cogan was careful enough not to give any figures to work on.  He did not give an estimate of the income of a farmer with, say, 200 acres.  That is the class of farmer this motion is intended to help.  The Deputy did not give any idea of the profit that such a man would make in a year.  I am sure the Deputy knows the figure, but he was careful not to mention it.  Perhaps he was afraid that might attract more attention from the income-tax authorities towards larger farmers.  I give Deputy Cogan credit that, in this motion, compared with similar motions, he did not ask to have the charges for rates reduced and those for the social services increased.  That is the attitude commonly adopted, to reduce rates but to increase the social services, in other words, to reduce the amount collected from the people but all the time to spend more.  Deputy Cogan did not do that and I give him credit for it.  He did not say how he would make up the deficiency caused by derating.  He did not say what social services would suffer, or what social services were to be reduced.  The position in regard to rates in the City of Dublin is rather bad.  The rates are at present 21/- in the £ and within a very few years I anticipate that the figure must go to 30/- if the social services contemplated by the Government are to be maintained.  It is well known that Dublin City maintains hospitals and educational services which are available to the entire country.  I think that efforts might he <Col N="397" /> made to collect some contributions from different parts of the country to relieve the burden of rates in the city. Deputy Cogan went the other way.  He wishes relief of rates to be given to farmers who have not to pay anything like the rates levied on city and town dwellings.</P>
    <P>This motion would place a much greater burden on the people in the villages, towns and cities who have to pay rates on the dwellings in which they live.  It would be very little consolation to such people to tell them that, if farmers' rates are reduced, they will employ more workers at the minimum wages fixed by the Government. The people of the city have to pay fixed prices for butter, turf and other commodities that come from the agricultural districts.  These prices have been fixed by the Government.  Long before the war, when regulations were brought in to fix the price of milk, it was made a criminal offence for a man in the city to buy milk from a producer at less than the fixed price.  The price was fixed by the Government at the request of the producers but many producers were willing to sell at less than the fixed price.  At the same time, I read complaints from other producers that the fixed price was not sufficiently high.  I am afraid that we shall reach a position in which the large farmer will be exempted from all rates and taxes and land annuities and the Government will pay the men to work their farms for them.  It is well known that our banks are bursting with deposits.  There is more money on deposit than there ever was.  The great bulk of that money represents deposits by farmers, so that, at the present time, a motion of this type is wholly out of place.  Too great a burden would be placed on the small farmers, the small traders and workers if further relief were given to the large farmers whom this motion is intended to benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy O'Connor.  I ask him to read the report of the committee set up by his own Government to formulate agricultural policy for post-emergency conditions.  That committee consisted almost entirely of economists.  There <Col N="398" /> was only one farmer on it.  Since the Deputy is interested in statistics, he should refer to the figures given by the committee as to the national income and the contribution made by agriculture to that income.  Those who make the greatest contribution to that income receive least.  The greater portion goes to the parasites in Dublin.  They get their rake-off owing to the sweated conditions in the agricultural areas.  I resent the Deputy's remarks.  They are a poor return for what was done by the agriculturists during the emergency.  The Deputy said that farmers paid their workers a miserable wage and that, in order to compel them to pay a fair wage, the Government had to set up a wages board.  A great many disabilities attach to our main industry.  The Deputy should realise that, on the capacity of the primary industry, depends the maintenance of the population. In the last resort, the existence of this nation depends on our primary industry.  I bitterly resent the attitude of a Dublin Deputy who gets up here and speaks as Deputy O'Connor has done.  I always thought, that the Deputy was a very decent man and, when he reads over what he said, I am sure he will regret it.  There was no justification for it.  The report of the Post-Emergency Agricultural Committee was signed by Messrs. Smiddy, Barton, Boyle, Drew, and Johnston. There was only one farmer on the committee and he was, perhaps, more of an economist.  I should like to quote a couple of paragraphs from the report, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The underlying causes of the relative prosperity at present experienced by the agricultural industry are artificial and may shortly cease to be effective.  Efforts should, therefore, be made to avoid any financial commitments that are of non-productive character imposing additional taxation on farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike industrialists, farmers cannot compensate themselves for extra cost by increasing prices, because in normal times the prices they obtain for produce are in most cases determined by export prices and these cannot be controlled.  Hence, farmers <Col N="399" /> cannot shift on to others even a part of any extra costs imposed on them.</P>
    <P>The burden of rates on farmers has substantially increased since 1935. The poor rates collected in county health districts have increased from £2,728,988 in 1935 to £4,132,106 in 1943.  Of this increase, approximately £1,000,000 was collected from farmers; the tendency is towards a still further increase in the burden.  During the war period farmers have been able to carry this added burden because the values of agricultural products have increased, but they will find it intolerable should prices fall substantially, even if the volume of their output were to increase with a consequent reduction in cost per unit produced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on this matter.  Our agriculturists are quite willing to subscribe their fair share to the social services.  They do not want to shirk their responsibilities.  But they do not want to have to bear a disability which has been removed in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  I suppose the Deputy has read what the Minister for Agriculture said at a food production meeting yesterday and what he has been saying in different areas in recent weeks.  He is anxious as to the future prosperity of the country and as to how agricultural production is to be maintained and expanded.  Emphasis is laid in the report from which I have quoted on the extraordinary stagnation which is characteristic of agricultural production here.  At the same time, reference is made to the &ldquo;potential&rdquo; there is for substantial production and it is pointed out that something must be done to bring about expansion.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of rates on houses in the city.  We, of this Party, are not opposed to rates on hereditaments.  We are opposed to taxes on raw material. The soil is the most important raw material we have and we are putting taxation on that raw material.  I challenge any Deputy to point out any raw material, except the soil, which is taxed.  We are prepared to tax the most important fundamental raw material we have, namely, the soil.  In any other industry, we do not do that, <Col N="400" /> but sometimes give a subsidy to help it.  That is what is wrong, that is what is at issue here, and which should not be at issue at all.  We should take a broad outlook on the problems that have to be faced and for which solutions are essential, so that we may launch out on an expansionist policy. There is no use in giving lip-service here to better social conditions, higher incomes for all and better amenities. We can do that only by expanding production and increasing the national income.  That must be done before we can hope for better conditions all round.  If that expansion occurs, the improvements resulting from that will flow to the community generally.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talked about low wages. Are we not helping to depress agricultural wages, through overhead charges and overhead burdens pressing on the agricultural community?  It is unfortunate that we are discussing this motion at the present time, as conditions are good.  I wish to be honest about that, but that conditions are good is not due to Fianna Fáil policy, but due to the times in which we live, with the fact that we are a food-producing country in a war period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The wages of agricultural workers in Great Britain have gone up substantially, while our agricultural wages have made no attempt at any <i>pro rata</i> increase.  The farmer in Great Britain is completely derated on his raw material, while we have to carry heavy burdens still on that raw material.  I believe the Minister, as a farmer, has a good deal of sympathy with what has been said.  I appreciate the difficulties the Government have to face and the huge financial commitments they have at present, with the demand from many other sources for financial assistance of one sort or another.  I know that the revenue must be made up to meet those demands.  However, it is a shortsighted policy to allow a heavy disability to bear on our primary industry, by a tax on its raw materials, merely on the excuse of the difficulty <Col N="401" /> of making up the difference.  The difference is not so much.</P>
      <P>I think the motion is asking for very little, as it asks for complete derating on the first £20.  It is not the first time we heard of that.  We talked a lot a few years ago about complete derating for the first £20.  That notion originally came from this Party.  There is a primary abatement already allowed on the first £20, approximating to 50 per cent. of the rate on that £20 valuation. In my own county, in Carlow, for the year ending 31st March, 1945, the rate was 12/8 and the primary abatement allowed on the first £20 was 5/9½d.  That left the net rate on the first £20 valuation at 6/10½d.  Then there was the employment rate, which was 5/9½d. and the supplementary rate, which was 3/1¼d.  We have to understand that that has to be paid out of the agricultural grant which, I think, was £1,870,000 for last year for the whole country.  That is apportioned in the following way: there is a primary abatement first of nearly 50 per cent. of the rate, then an employment abatement of £12 10s. 0d. on every male relative and every man employed on the holding.  The motion asks that that £12 10s. 0d. be raised to £15.  I think it does not go far enough.  I believe in complete derating of the raw materials of agriculture.  Put it on the hereditament, if you like.  Why should you tax the raw materials of the most important industry we have, the industry which is carrying the whole community?  The final abatement, which amounts to something over 3/- generally, in all the counties, is the residue of the agricultural grant, spread over the remainder of the land over and above £20 valuation.  Deputy O'Connor said that this motion was aimed at helping the big farmer.  It is not.  Surely it is aimed at helping the small farmer, when £20 is going to be completely derated?</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann is of opinion <Col N="402" /> that, in order to secure a more equitable distribution of the burden of local rates, and to promote increased employment on the land, legislation should be introduced providing for complete derating of the first £20 of the poor law valuation of each farm and the further total derating of each additional £15 of the poor law valuation in respect of each adult worker employed on the holding; and that the deficit be made good from the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It means that any man with a valuation of under £20 is completely derated, any man with a valuation of £20 is completely derated and any man with a valuation of over £20 is completely derated for the first £20. After that, I think the motion aims at encouraging employment on the land by allowing an abatement of £15 for every man employed.  There is £12 10s. 0d. there already, so the increase is very small, only £2 10s. 0d. of an abatement for every man.</P>

      <P>One of the newest entrants to the House, Deputy O'Connor, has made a great impression on everybody.  He is a man we all like. I was struck by his remarks about the banks bursting with money.  Where did the money come from but through the sweat and blood, night and day, of the farmers, their sons, their wives and daughters?  There is an eight-hour day in the city and it is practically a crime to work longer, but farmers and their households have to work 12 to 14 hours a day&mdash;and unless they did that some people would be in the soup.  Asking farmers to pay rates is really not honest and amounts to &ldquo;taking the breeches off a Highlander&rdquo;. Yet when we ask for any release from those conditions, Fianna Fáil Deputies sit complacently and do not even smile, but walk into the lobbies against us.  I have a very unique experience, in that I paid rates in this city on a house valued £95 in a principal business street and am paying rates on a farm valued about £130; so I have a leg on both sides of the fence.  I paid rates here for a dozen years.  I am possibly one of the very few persons in the House who has that to say.  I lived here for 25 years.  I came as an apprentice boy and wound up as a shopkeeper.  I returned to the old place again, leaving the city with some regret.  Perhaps my regret may not be so deep now.</P>
      <P>Looking at this matter from both sides of the picture, as it were, if you pay a wage to your sons and daughters there will not be one bob left in the bank.  I would like the Deputy to understand that.  I do not know if he is country reared.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy is right.  I should like to point out that, when the members of my Party made attempts on a few occasions to help in that direction&mdash;improving farms <Col N="404" /> and helping the agricultural community generally&mdash;almost all the members of the Dáil walked into the lobby and voted against our proposals.  Yesterday, we had the Minister for Agriculture talking about beet.  It would be no harm if the sugar supply could be improved.  In the hotels we get a spoonful of sugar to sweeten two cups of tea.  It would look as if ours was a land flowing with milk and honey, and with sugar as well, but the fact is that the milk and sugar are scarce.  If we make any attempt to improve returns, Deputies will go into the lobby, as they did on one occasion when the voting was 88 to 12.  All the Parties walked into the lobby against us when we tried to improve agricultural conditions.</P>
      <P>It reminds me of the two cities of infamous notoriety.  If there were only ten or 12 just men to be found in them, the cities would be saved.  That is where Lot's wife looked back and became a pillar of salt.  On the occasion of the division to which I have referred, I was one of the ten or 12 just men.  Any attempts that we have made to relieve the situation in the country have been opposed by other Parties here, We are taunted that our banks are bursting with money.  Why are our sons on the land?  They remain there because they have no sense.  They remain until they are 25 or 26 years of age, and then they look out for themselves.</P>

He said he hoped that the land would not be completely derated, and that his sons, when they came of age, would not think that they had no financial responsibility to the nation or its social services and that they would not take an easy view of their responsibilities, and not work the land in a reasonable way.</P>

In the country there are organised bodies working only eight hours a day, and it is practically illegal for them to work more than eight hours.  The farmers are asked from the pulpit and platform, and through the Press, to get on with the work. They are told they are great fellows and they have saved the nation in a critical period.  We are asking you now to give them some consideration for what they have done and what they are doing.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes made a statement which proves to a large extent that these questions of derating and passing on charges are not so successful, and they seldom or ever achieve the object they are intended to achieve.  Deputy Hughes admitted that the agricultural industry puts up the wealth for the whole community.  I have been always under the impression, and I think it is quite correct, that the cities and towns, <Col N="406" /> which give services and a certain amount of goods to the agricultural community, are in the happy position, no matter what charge is imposed upon them, of being able to pass on either the whole or a great portion of that charge to the producing community, that is, the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>It might not be that way in England, because of the fact that the cities there are larger, and the population is much greater, and perhaps there is a good deal more competition in that country. Consequently, there they may have had some success with derating; there may have been partial relief for the agricultural community.  I doubt very much whether in this country, situated as we are, it would be a success or would bring benefits to the agricultural community.  I believe that those who give us services, and sell us goods, would be able to pass on almost all those charges and, therefore, there would not seem to be very much to be done in that way.</P>
    <P>I think relief of agriculture must come, as Deputy Hughes said, and as was mentioned on many occasions, from increased production.  I think many of these things that we have been proposing and discussing will give agriculture very little relief. Some relief has been given, such as the £12 10s. 0d. in respect of those employed on the land, and partial derating, but it does not seem to have had very much effect.  We are now in a position in which things are, perhaps, a little brighter, but that is unquestionably due to war conditions.  It does not seem to be due to any of the things which have been attempted or done.  If Clann na Talmhan took a fresher, a never, view and proposed a motion which would increase production, which would help the farmers to increase their production by providing, better transport and perhaps better sale facilities, it would be something which would be a help and an encouragement to the farmers.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if farmers here were totally derated, as in England, almost all the charge would be passed back again on to them in goods and services. It would not make any difference whatever.  If we had a better method <Col N="407" /> of transport, a better method of selling and if we could more or less equalise the balance between the goods we give to the cities and the services they give us, we would be doing far better.  For instance, many of us who examine the price that farmers are paid for potatoes and the price which the workers in the City of Dublin pay for these potatoes, must admit that there is room for vast improvement, both from the point of view of the worker and of the producer.  The worker in the City of Dublin produces dear goods because his wages must be high, because, if they are not high, he could not meet the cost of these commodities. The cost of these commodities is due to the fact that distribution here has got too strong a grip.  It is too highly developed, or, if that is not the case, it must be highly inefficient.  In the margin between what the producer gets and what the consumer pays, there is quite a lot of money which could be distributed amongst both, and if Clann na Talmhan worked along some such lines as those they would bring very definite advantage to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The weakness of the agricultural community is that most of these charges of which they are relieved&mdash;naturally somebody else must pay them&mdash;can always be passed back again on to the producer in a very short time, and he is left in just the same position.  The agricultural worker cannot get better wages and the difficulties under which the farmer works now are, I think, due entirely to this question of distribution and transport.  If Fine Gael or any other Party&mdash;the Government, I know, has been considering the point &mdash;could solve those difficulties, they would bring great relief to all sides.  It is undoubtedly a fact that until the agricultural community are in a position to increase production, the finances of the State, and eventually the prosperity of the State, must remain static.  If the agricultural industry is not reasonably prosperous, the prosperity of the other industries in the cities and towns must be limited also, and it is up to everybody to assist in encouraging agriculture.  So far as the <Col N="408" /> Government Party are concerned, they have done everything possible to stimulate production amongst the agricultural community.  If the Dáil succeeds in solving this question of distribution, I believe infinite good will be done for the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Most of us know very well how distribution is conducted in this old City of Dublin.  Many of the distributors have a very tight grip on the community. That grip was secured over a great number of years.  They have been here for a very long time and they have organised themselves.  I appreciate their activities, but the time has now come when something should be done to break that very powerful grip which they have, and to allow the farmer to get a little more for his produce and enable the workers to pay a little less for what they require.  If we worked along those lines, we would solve the difficulty in which the farmer at present finds himself with greater case and perhaps in a better way than by this method of derating.  It has been tried and tested here on quite a number of occasions.  The British are different entirely from us in that they have very large cities and towns and very big populations.  Derating might to a degree be successful in Britain, but I do not at all see that it would be successful here, because the competition is not keen enough and our towns and cities are so situated that they would be able to pass all these charges back again to the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>I am in thorough agreement with the motion if it will have the effect of benefiting the small farmer.  It has been stated by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members that the farmers are very well off and we have had statements about the amount of money in the banks.  Some years ago, the newspapers had big headlines about the farmers being in the front-line trenches.  During the emergency, it was the ploughman and the agricultural labourer who were in the front-line trenches, as they are to-day, suffering under a high cost of living with a wage of £2 per week, that is, a wage of 25/-, plus a bonus of 15/- per week.  The agricultural worker's wages to-day are <Col N="409" /> 25/- per week&mdash;the remaining 15/- is the bonus which all workers have received.</P>
      <P>I come from County Wexford, where we have small farmers as well as very large farmers, and I am of the opinion that the small farmer is struggling.  He has no money in the bank, and is unable to pay a man for a full week.  He may take on a man for a day, or for two days at most, and I do not see why any of the big ranchers, the big gentlemen farmers, who can follow the hunt and who go to Baldoyle and to the greyhound tracks, should be in any way relieved by the rates.  They have money to burn, and I believe that this motion does not apply to these people but to the man on the small holding. There was a case brought to my notice of two old people, a father and a mother, with an only son, living on a holding of 29 acres.  The father and mother would not get the old age pension because of the valuation of their holding, although they had not one penny to enable them to carry on.  Take the position of the farm labourer to-day.  A pair of boots, which it is impossible to get, will cost him £2 so that he has to work a whole week before he can afford to buy a pair.  My friend Deputy O'Donnell spoke about sugar. I wonder do farmer-Deputies feel ashamed when they come into the Restaurant in Leinster House and get only two spoons of sugar in an egg cup, and when we cannot see the butter on the bread.  That happens in a Restaurant which is subsidised by the State.</P>

      <P>I want to say to the Minister that if there is any money available to give the help sought through this motion, something should be done for the farm labourer as well as for the small farmer, because if we are to keep men on the land we must pay them.  I say that £2 a week to-day is not a living wage for any man. When the Agricultural Wages Board was set up there was one thing it should have done, and that was to classify workers on the land as skilled and unskilled.  The man who can plough and reap and do all classes of genuine agricultural work is to-day only getting £2 a week.  He is surely a skilled man.  In all grades of industry you have skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers.  If what I suggest had been done by the board, you would have men to-day learning how to plough, how to work a binder and other classes of agricultural machinery. I know farmers in my constituency who are finding it as hard to carry on and to keep their families as the ordinary individual.  If anything can be done for them it should be done.  I am certainly in thorough agreement with this motion in so far as it sets out to help the small farmers.</P>

      <P>During the first three-quarters of an hour of the debate that Party was represented here by two members.  That shows the interest and the belief that the members of that Party have in this motion.  The Deputies may have good reasons for not being here, but the Deputy whose name is appended to it with Deputy Cogan's is not in the House to support it.  I am not surprised that there should be mixed feelings, to say the least of it, amongst the members of the Clann na Talmhan Party on this particular motion, because of the fact that the Deputies of that Party represent constituencies of varying interest.  The <Col N="411" /> interests of Deputy Cogan and Deputy Halliden are not, in my opinion, the interests of Deputy Blowick or Deputy Commons in this particular respect.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to this motion because I come from a constituency and a county where 75 per cent. of the agricultural holdings are under £5 valuation. Naturally, we in Donegal ask ourselves: what have we to gain by derating on the basis proposed in the motion, or by complete derating?  We realise that the money at present provided by the payment of rates must, if there is partial, or whole, derating, be found by some other means.  Consequently, the small holder, the man with the £5 valuation, would have to contribute, either through direct or indirect taxation on the same basis as the larger, more prosperous and more wealthy farmers in the Midlands and rancher counties.  Speaking of Donegal in that respect, I do not see that there is very much difference between the constituency and County of Donegal and that, for instance, of South Mayo. There are no very large farmers there. Their holdings are somewhat on a par with ours, and, therefore, I cannot for the life of me see what could induce Deputies from a constituency like Mayo to support a motion of this nature and defend it in their constituencies.  If, as I have said, we grant this partial derating, then the sum so provided for that purpose must be found by some other means, and there is no other means of providing the money, that I am aware of, except through direct or indirect taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmers of Donegal, in fact, I might say the farmers as a whole in Donegal, see that they are already contributing to the agricultural community in other parts of the country.  Donegal, for instance, has not been able to take very much advantage of the wheat scheme.  The farmers there have to pay portion of the subsidy in connection with that scheme.  Donegal is not in close proximity to any of the beet factories, so that the farmers in that county have to contribute their share under the State subsidy to the beet industry.  We <Col N="412" /> could not hope to gain very much, even by a total remission of rates, on our £5 valuations.  Therefore, if that suggestion were adopted we would be again subsidising the non-payment of rates by farmers with valuations ranging from £25 to £35 whom we do not regard as small farmers.  Apparently, some Deputies regard them as small farmers, but we do not.  I can assure the House that a farmer in Donegal with a £35 valuation would be considered very well off indeed. Consequently, I feel that the House should reject the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the motion, I want to say that I think it is one that should appeal to every reasonable Deputy.  The motion has done one thing anyway, and it is this that the farmers of the country definitely know where they stand as far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, and the way that Fianna Fáil regards them.  Deputy O'Connor made several remarks.  Some of them I will not bother to reply to because they were inaccurate, and clearly they were made by a man who did not know what he was speaking about.  Deputy O'Connor and his Party were some of the crowd, some of the people, who at the beginning of the emergency went through the country asking one class of the people to save our neutrality. There was one class of our people in whose power it was to save our people during the emergency, and that class was composed of the food and fuel producers.  Now, when the emergency is over the Deputy who is a city dweller rises up and tries to incite people who may not be conversant with farming conditions to perpeturate class distinction and class warfare between the city or town dweller and the rural dweller.  I think that from a man holding the position in life that he does, it was the most despicable attempt to create class distinction in the country that I have ever heard in the House, and I hope it will be a long time before I hear anything like it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the deposits in the banks.  If my memory serves me correctly, the large deposits in <Col N="413" /> the banks were made by people who, owing to the shortage of the materials during the emergency, had to cash in on their pre-emergency stocks.  During the emergency they were not able to replace stocks.  My experience during the war has been that many farmers were not able to have much money, over and above what they could save during normal times.  Farmers have not very much money.  Any that they have is the result of cashing in on the fertility of their soil, which means changing the money from one pocket to another. That is no indication of prosperity.  We know quite well that the whole question of derating is a huge one.  We know on fairly good authority that the poor law valuation carried out under Griffith in 1852 was grossly inaccurate. According to the evidence of Sir Richard Griffith and many valuers serving under him in many cases, instead of valuing the land on the land, according to instructions laid down by an Act of the British Government, they actually valued the land in County Clare and Donegal from the steps of a sidecar from the main road, merely by looking at it That is their own account at a sworn inquiry held by the Devon Commission.</P>
    <P>A revaluation of the land of this country would probably involve a sum of £2,000,000 and would result in an increase of the valuation of the country by £1,000,000.  I think that is fairly accurate.  We do not propose to go into that, but we do know that the rates are increasing year by year and that even to the small farmer the rates are becoming something to be reckoned with.  Up to the last few years the rates were not a very serious item, at least, they were not an item that the farmer was afraid of in his annual outlay. Now that the rates are increasing year by year, while there is no hope whatever that the ceiling has been reached, he is beginning to be seriously alarmed.  The smaller the farmer the more anxious he is to meet his commitments and to be able to go out and meet his friends and neighbours and say he has paid his way. In many cases it is only God that knows how he has paid his way or by <Col N="414" /> what sacrifices he has paid his way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady mentioned the fact that there was a lot in common between the farmers of South Mayo and the farmers in his constituency in Donegal.  I believe there is a good deal in common.  He mentioned that the farmer of £5 valuation would not be very much interested in derating. I should like to take this opportunity to say that if this Government and the previous Government had done their duty, or if the Land Commission were allowed a free hand and had done their duty as they should have done it, there should not be any farmers of £5 valuation.  I do not lay the blame more heavily on one Government than the other.  It is terrible to think that a farmer would be asked to live on a farm of £5 valuation, as we know them, and to bring up a family on that farm, perhaps miles from a town or any place where there might be employment for the members of his family as they grew up, and where there would be little or no employment for himself.  If the rates on a £5 valuation farm are small, they are just as large an item for the farmer concerned as the rates on a £200 valuation farm are for the farmer concerned.</P>
    <P>No matter what Government speakers may say, the day is coming, and coming soon, when something will have to be done in regard to the question of derating.  It may not take the lines suggested in the motion before the House, although, as far as we can see, the suggestions in the motion would give initial relief to a large number of farmers and to the particular type of farmer who is feeling the pinch most. We all know that the big farmer is not so much in need of relief as the small farmer, because he has more scope in his land, but the day has definitely come when something will have to be done to derate, and something along the lines of the motion.  That is why I recommend it to the Minister, even if only for an experimental period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan quoted from a committee of 1931.  Conditions have changed completely since then because rates have been climbing year after year.  I wonder what the rate bill will <Col N="415" /> be like, say, in 1956.  Are we going to wait for a crash to occur before we start to take steps to see that no ill effects will follow from the present system?  We know that social services must be maintained.  We know also that if this motion is adopted by the House the Minister for Finance will be asked for a sum of money, not a very alarming sum considering the vast number that would benefit by it and the urgency of the matter.  We know that sum will have to be met.  Government speakers and members of the Government are too inclined at present to pooh-pooh any idea such as this or any motion such as this that is for the benefit of the vast masses of the people.  If there is any saving to be carried out, they want to save at the expense of the poor, the small landholders and so on.  That cannot go on because such a policy will definitely end in disaster, sooner or later.</P>
    <P>The latter portion of the motion is designed to give a fillip to employment of agricultural workers and to try to stem at least some of the tide of emigration. The rates are very unequally distributed.  In my county I know that some land is valued out of all proportion to its real value.  The reason for that is that in days gone by small landowners and others deliberately interfered with the valuers of the land and influenced them to increase the valuation so that they would qualify for membership of the grand jury and other benefits.  We do not propose to go into that.  The revaluation of the land is a vast question, involving a sum of, I believe, £2,000,000.  Many smallholders cannot meet their rates liabilities now and it is certain that the rates will go up from year to year <Col N="416" /> because, naturally, there will be increases of various kinds, in wages, social services and county services. One thing that is making it most difficult to meet the rates is that while these costs are increasing, the profit from the land is not increasing proportionately. Deputies mentioned deposits in banks.  I move the adjournment.</P>
