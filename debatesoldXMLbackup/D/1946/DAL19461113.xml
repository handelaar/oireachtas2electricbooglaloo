      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether any discussions have taken place between any Department of State here and the corresponding Department in Northern Ireland for the purpose of promoting inter-governmental agreements in relation to economic development in which both parties have a common concern, e.g., drainage, hydro-electrification, etc.; whether, if such discussions have taken place, he will indicate their extent and purport; and if they have not taken place, if he will indicate his readiness to participate in such discussion.</P>

      <P>The Electricity Supply Board and the Department of Finance have had discussions of the kind referred to by the Deputy with regard to the drainage works required in connection with the hydro-electric development of the River Erne.  There have been no other discussions on matters of economic development, but we are always ready to participate in such discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion the Taoiseach mentioned the objection that arose to publishing Letters of Credence addressed to us by foreign Governments without prior permission from such foreign Governments.  Are we to understand now that Letters of Credence addressed in the name of this State to other Governments are not to be revealed to the citizens of this State itself?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of clothing is determined to a great extent by the cost of the materials which have to be imported.  There is no evidence yet of any downward trend in the cost of such materials.  As the other factors affecting prices, including wages, are not likely to fall in the near future, it would in my opinion be unduly optimistic to except a substantial reduction in clothing prices at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that many farmers and co-operative societies in County Tipperary are seriously affected by the fact that tin plates and bottoms for the repair of dairy utensils are not available, and that several hundreds of creamery churns are out of use as a result; and if he will state what steps he has taken or proposes to take to get the necessary export licence from Great Britain, the United States or elsewhere for the materials required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that tinplate and bottoms for the repair of dairy utensils have not been available for some time, and that the repair of creamery churns has in consequence been seriously affected.  I caused representations to be made recently to the British authorities for the release of tinplate for this and other purposes, but was informed that, owing to the severe shortage of this material, the use of tinplate is not allowed in that country for any purpose other than the packing of foodstuffs and that exports are allowed only for the purpose of packing foodstuffs intended for consumption in Great Britain.  There is, therefore, no hope that supplies for the repair of dairy utensils can be obtained from that source for the present.</P>
      <P>My information is that tinplate is also particularly scarce in the United States, but recently I had representations made to the United States authorities for permission to obtain supplies from that source and I await the outcome of those representations. Inquiries are also being made as to the possibility of procuring supplies from continental countries.  If supplies are imported for general use here, the requirements of the creamery industry will be borne in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

A circular letter will be issued to local authorities in due course.</P>
      <P>All county councils have been asked to indicate the additional amount, if any, in excess of the original estimate which will be required in the current financial year for the provision of chippings for work in the next financial year and have been informed that the provision of supplemental grants in accordance with the existing basis of allocation will be considered.</P>
      <P>County managers have been informed that it will be necessary to concentrate on the purchase of tar and bitumen and on production of stone chippings during the winter so as to ensure that an adequate supply will be available for next year's surface-dressing programme.</P>
      <P>In addition, in order to afford encouragement to the preparation of stone chippings for use in road restoration, it has been arranged that work of this kind may be undertaken as employment schemes during the winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the 1943 agreement as modified for 1945 and 1946 were those common to contracts for purchase and sale, but they provided, in addition, a sliding scale by which the price to be paid was related to the quantity of eggs exported.  The lowest price was 24/9 per gt. hhd. for specials and standards (2/6 per gt. hhd. less for other grades) if export did not exceed 1,687,500 gt. hhd.  Prices increased by successive steps to 29/- and 26/6 per gt. hhd., respectively, for an export of not less that 2,062,500 gt. hhds.</P>
      <P>The terms of the contract proposed for 1947 and subsequent years comprise:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the purchase by the Ministry of Food in 1947 of the exportable surplus on the terms and prices applying to 1946;</P>
      <P>(b)  subject to the exportable surplus in 1947 reaching 2,062,500 gt. hhds., the purchase by the Ministry, as a minimum in 1948, of the quantity exported in 1947 on the terms and prices applying to 1946;</P>

    <P>(c)  the purchase, as a minimum, in 1949 of a quantity equal to the average of exports in 1947 and 1948 at a price not less than 20/- per gt. hhd. for specials and standards (2/6 per gt. hhd. less for lower grades); the price for 1949 to be open to discussion at the request of my Department at any time between September, <Col N="718" /> 1947, and September, 1948; failing agreement on price, my Department to have the option of accepting the price mentioned or of refraining from any commitments as to supplies in 1949;</P>

    <P>In an Order made by the British Minister of Food increased prices were prescribed for turkeys as from 1st September, 1946.

      <P>In reply to a question asked by the Deputy on the 23rd October last, I stated that one of the persons recently appointed to be Justices of the District Court was at the time of his appointment a county registrar.  I presume that the Deputy in his present question is referring to that appointment.  If so, the Deputy is correct in assuming that that appointment could not have been made were it not for the provisions of Section 14 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946.</P>
      <P>The provisions in question were enacted by the Oireachtas as an improvement on the then existing law and, in so far as they have had the result of making county registrars (amongst others) eligible for appointment as District Justices, I may point out that the qualification which was already required by law for appointment to the office of county registrar was higher than that required for appointment as District Justice.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the reasons why the Irish Land Commission took proceedings, at Wexford District Court, on September 18th, 1946, against Thomas Coleman, Prospect House, Clonard, Wexford, for possession of nine acres of land at Cotts (Map No. 6), Tacumshane, County Wexford; if he is aware that the letting in this case appears to have been created in June, 1937, and that other lettings of a permanent nature were made on the same occasion on the same estate; if, in view of the fact that the district justice, in giving his decision, commented unfavourably on the nature of the letting, <Col N="732" /> and that a stay of execution until 1st January next was put on the decree for possession to enable the Department to review the matter, he will now reconsider the propriety of proceeding any further with the claim for possession; and if he will arrange to have this nine years old temporary letting put on a permanent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Coleman, a railway employee, was given a temporary letting of some accommodation land at Cotts in June, 1937.  Other allottees on the same estate were given their parcels on a permanent basis.  It is the ordinary Land Commission practice to differentiate in this manner in allotting land and the wisdom of the commissioners' procedure is exemplified by this particular case.  Mr. Coleman retired from the railway service left the board of health cottage near which the accommodation plot was given him and went to reside on a farm he bought nine miles away.  From his own evidence he was unable to work the plot at Cotts and attempted to sublet it.</P>
      <P>On discovering this state of affairs, the Land Commission terminated Mr. Coleman's letting on 1st May, 1946, but he declined to give possession. Legal proceedings thus became necessary and the Land Commission have been given a decree for possession with a stay of execution until 1st January next.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission fully considered this case before deciding to terminate the letting and see no reason for altering their decision.  This House has enacted legislation prescribing, in certain circumstances, the recovery of allotments even when held on a permanent basis, and Deputies are well aware of the need for close supervision of the use being made of lands distributed by the Land Commission.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1946&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday last I was pointing out that notwithstanding what might appear to be a very favourable provision, so far as the relief of rates is concerned, in view of the very steep rise in the incidence of rates, the position is much worse than it was in 1932. As a matter of fact, in 1932 the rates on agricultural lands amounted to £1,260,000 and the agricultural grant then was £2,194,000.  The rates on agricultural land in the meantime have increased to £3,207,000, while the grant has fallen from £2,194,000 to £1,168,000. The grant has continued at that level since 1935.  Now the aggregate general assessment on agricultural land has gone up from £2,403,000 to £5,200,000, so that as far as the raw material for agriculture is concerned, that is, land&mdash; it is the only raw material in any industry that is taxed&mdash;it is carrying a very heavy burden.  That has helped, with other conditions, to depress production from the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister I am sure appreciates the necessity of having maximum production in the land and this provision is made with a view to helping to stimulate production.  I pointed out <Col N="740" /> that if we are concerned about raising our surplus production for the purposes of exchange, in selling in the British market against competitors who are placed in an advantageous position because of the derating of agricultural land that matter should not be overlooked.  We ought to examine the evils that have resulted from the continued operation of a tax on land in this country.  Take for instance the question of wages which we have discussed many times here and compare agricultural wages in this country with the agricultural wages in Great Britain.  Wages paid in Great Britain average £4 per worker while the average here is £2 4s. 0d.  Were it not for the fact that there is a travel ban in existence to prevent workers leaving rural Ireland we would soon be stripped of man-power in Ireland.  The one thing that assists the farmer in Northern Ireland and Great Britain to pay higher wages is the fact that he has not to meet this demand for rates on his raw material that has to be met in this country. The present wage of £2 4s. 0d. has roughly a purchasing power of about 50 per cent of its pre-war value, so that the rural worker is in reality in receipt of only £1 2s. 0d. on pre-war standards.  We can therefore appreciate why our man-power is leaving the land.</P>
    <P>It has been denied by Ministers on occasion here that there has been any reduction of man-power on the land. Actually in reply to a Parliamentary question by General Mulcahy on Wednesday last it was stated that the employment allowance had fallen from £315,288 some years ago to approximately £35,000 for the latest year for which there have been returns, which indicates that there has been a substantial reduction in the claim for employment allowances for primary workers on the land.  There again I want to draw the Minister's attention to that aspect of a very important question. The Minister may feel as I said before that he is going a long way towards giving assistance to the main industry but he is only restoring what was taken from the industry in 1933-34. The Government has made no attempt to put agriculture on the same basis as it occupies in countries which compete <Col N="741" /> with us in the British market.  I submit that if we are to hope to get some results from agriculture here&mdash;the Minister knows that we have not succeeded in stepping up production during the emergency to the extent that Britain has&mdash;we must keep in step so far as the conditions under which food is produced in this country are concerned. We must keep in step with the conditions that obtain in Britain and Northern Ireland if we hope to compete. If our policy is not to compete and to eliminate the surplus, that is of course an impossibility.  Our capacity to produce is far beyond our requirements here at home and so we must have a surplus.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that agriculture is better off than it has been in former years.  I think that can be questioned but I shall refer to that question later. So far as the provision for the employment allowance has been increased under this Bill by approximately 100 per cent., I want to congratulate the Minister.  I think the policy should be to encourage by methods of this sort, permanent employment on the land.  I addressed a question to the Minister for Agriculture last week for the purpose of obtaining an estimate of the increased cost of production which resulted from the increase in wages in consequence of the last decision of the Agricultural Wages Board, and I asked how far it was offset by this provision here of £1,000,000 to relieve rates, taking into account the increase in rates. The answer briefly was that the increase in wages was approximately £1,000,000, not taking into account the increase that was allowed relative to sons and daughters of farmers who did not fall into the category of wageearners. The relief that was provided to offset that £1,000,000 was approximately £600,000, so that there has to be bridged still so far as the agricultural community is concerned, a difference of £400,000.  The last decision of the Wages Board means, in effect, that there is an imposition on agriculture of £400,000 which has not been bridged by this proposal.  The Minister for Finance, when discussing this matter in his Budget speech, tried to indicate <Col N="742" /> that whatever increases in wages were envisaged at the time for the agricultural worker would be provided by this increased grant.  I am pointing out that that is not so, that this grant falls short of the actual increase, according to the Minister for Agriculture, by £400,000, not taking into account increases provided by way of allowances to sons and daughters of farmers.</P>
    <P>The paper on National Income and Expenditure published a few months ago showed how the national pool of production was contributed to by the various industries and a diagram in that paper showed that agriculture contributed by far the greatest share of the national wealth.  A very big segment of the circle was attributable to wealth produced by agriculture. Turning to another page showing how the national pool was distributed, we saw that the agricultural industry got a much smaller share.  The segment of the circle representing the agricultural share of that pool of wealth was very much smaller than that which represented the contribution of agriculture, so that there is not a fair or equitable distribution of the national wealth here as compared with the actual production in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when Leader of the Opposition here, speaking on the Budget on April 24th, 1929, said at column 786 of volume 29 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister has closed his ears to those who pointed out that a large sum which would far more than cover the cost of derating is unwarrantably exported every year.  We believe that the sum paid to England is not due and that if the greater portion of it were retained here in the Exchequer, there would be no need to put an extra taxation to relieve the present burden on agriculture. We know, of course, that agriculture is our principal industry and that seven out of every nine engaged on productive industries are engaged on the land; also that two-thirds of the wealth of the country is produced from agriculture, and, moreover, that the greater part of the remaining one-third is produced from industries <Col N="743" /> ancillary to farming, such as baconcuring, butter-making, brewing, distilling and so forth.</P>
    <P>The pressure of rates is particularly severe on our farming community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the curve in that respect has been progressively upward; the burden is heavier than ever it was.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we take into account the fact that they have to compete with rivals in Great Britain itself and in Northern Ireland, who are relieved of that burden of rates, we realise what a severe handicap there exists and will remain on the farming community. As we say, we agree with the Minister that it is very difficult to say how that can be done by the imposing alternative forms of taxation, but we say that there is a way which was open to a determined Minister.  If the present Ministry is not prepared to take it, then we say it is the duty of members of the House who see expenditure steadily fixed at the figure given in the Estimates, about £24,000,000&mdash; members who are interested in finding some relief where taxation is too burdensome and in providing means of employment for those who are unemployed&mdash;to get a Ministry who will see that that money is not exported.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The country took the advice of the Taoiseach at that time and changed the Government.  He was then charged with the responsibility of Government. Whether the Taoiseach has forgotten it or has changed his mind about it, I do not know, but the fact remains that, at that time, he was stressing the very points I am stressing to-day&mdash;that if we believe in the value of the British market to this country, we can hope to compete in that market only if our people are producing under similar conditions, that a tax on the land is a burden and acts as a deterrent so far as production is concerned and that the maximum relief ought to be provided. He indicated at the time that there was a way of doing it, that we were paying annuities to Great Britain which were not due.  He has dealt with that matter, but the relief has not come to the farmer.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the <Col N="744" /> Taoiseach, would tell the House why the Government changed their mind.</P>

      <P>I am speaking now of the present.  I want to ask why the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party have changed their minds about it.  I am not arguing that derating is the ideal way of assisting agriculture&mdash;I do not suppose there is any ideal way &mdash;but I am arguing that the provision of temporary relief for two years of this sort is not enough.  It is not an &ldquo;artificial subvention of this kind&rdquo;, to use the Minister's own words, because this is a tax which should never have been imposed, a tax on the raw material of a primary industry.  It is the imposition itself which is artificial, and not the relief.  The impost ought to be raised.</P>
      <P>I think the method the Minister is adopting is the ideal method, the method of employment allowances and supplementary allowances, because it is one which will induce farmers to give employment, and our aim should be to induce the farmers to maintain the maximum number of permanent workers on the land.  Pursuing a policy of that sort will help to bring the maximum amount of land into profitable and sustained production, and I say, on behalf of this Party, that we welcome the provision made for this year and next year.  I want to stress again, however, that, with the anticipated rise in taxation and the necessity for expanding agricultural production, it would be a wise policy not merely to continue but to increase this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can discuss the details of the Bill more properly on Committee Stage, but I think the Minister has acted wisely in accepting the suggestion from Deputy Sheldon, as he told us, allowing claims to be made up to 1st February next.  I do not know what responsibility there is on secretaries of county councils to ensure that every <Col N="745" /> farmer is provided with a form of application, but I have heard a number of farmers say that they have not received these forms.  It may be that they have overlooked them or have lost them through carelessness, but a number of such farmers do create some trouble by saying that they have not received the forms, and secretaries of county councils cannot help them, because the statutory period within which claims must be made has expired.  The Minister has extended the period, and I suggest that not merely should the forms be sent out but a notice should be inserted prominently in the local papers setting out the last date for receiving claims. It has been suggested to me that the Minister might consider providing relief for farmers who can show that they employed a number of people at the peak periods in the working year, and that if these amounted to a complete year they should be given relief.  I think the intention of the Minister, however, is to encourage permanent employment.  Personally, I cannot say that I disagree with the Minister on that.  I do not see how the Minister, under the policy we are to operate under this measure, will control the actual amount provided.  It will be a flexible sum, to some extent at all events.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure, I think, will receive a fairly general welcome. It is an improvement on its predecessors. First of all, it is much easier to understand than the 1939 Act.  The whole procedure is simplified.  In any measure which applies to the farming community it is just as well to keep the terms as simple as possible, so that no one will be done out of his just <Col N="746" /> rights through inability to understand the niceties of legal expression.  There is a marked improvement from that point of view.  There is also the improvement that Deputy Hughes referred to in the way in which various allowances were given.  I think it is a very good departure from the established practice to give the primary and supplementary allowance in such a way that the employment allowance has no relation to them, except that the employment allowance can be given only where the valuation exceeds £20. As the Minister said in his opening statement, under the old system the employment allowance was not a real incentive to employment.  The incentive actually was the difference between the employment allowance and the supplementary allowance.  But, under this, the employment allowance is quite a separate sum given irrespective of the other two.  I think that is a very marked improvement.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the concession he makes in Section 7 (3), giving anyone who overlooked claiming an abatement for the employment allowance until 18th February next.  At first sight, it might appear that if a farmer neglected to look for his employment allowance the loss should be his.  But this year the employment allowance is very much more substantial than it was previously. As Deputy Hughes said, the difficulty about this employment allowance is that it is fatally easy to fail to send in the form even after filling it in.  I have had personal experience of that.  Having filled up my own form a couple of years ago, I put it in my pocket in order to get it witnessed by some reputable member of the community, such as a bank manager.  My mind being relieved by having filled up the details, the whole thing passed out of my recollection.  On the last possible day for sending it in, I accidentally found it in my pocket, and got it in just on time.  That sort of thing can happen very easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one or two criticisms. First of all, I think it is a pity that we still do not seem to be able to give any long-term expression to what our intentions are with regard to agriculture. <Col N="747" /> This measure relates only to the present financial year and the next one. On the other hand, I cannot criticise that, because I do not agree with the basic principle of this Bill, and, therefore, its short life gives me hope that perhaps its successor will be very much better.</P>
    <P>Another point of criticism is the matter of the employment allowance.  I had hoped that the Minister could have devised some means of amending the method of determining the number of adult workmen who qualified.  It is laid down in Section 8 (3) of the 1939 Act. I can quite appreciate, as Deputy Hughes mentioned, the difficulty: that what the Government is seeking to do is to increase whole-time employment. But, so to speak, by accident, hardships creep in.  The position at present is that a farmer may employ six men for 51 weeks and, for some unforeseen and, probably, unavoidable reason, employ only one man for 52 weeks. That farmer can only claim an allowance in respect of one man.  Cases like that have been brought to my notice. For instance, in one case a man had three workmen employed for 11 months of the year.  In the month of October, through no fault of his own, two men left him, and for three or four weeks he was unable to replace them.  The result was that when he came to make his claim he was only allowed for one man.  I admit that the case I am trying to make is considerably weakened by the fact that I cannot suggest a remedy which would be fair all round. I think, however, that some attempt should be made to get over these difficulties where very great hardship occurs.  That man lost a rebate of £13 in his rates owing to something over which he had no control.  It happened that there was a shortage of available men in that particular month and he was left short of men.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that the proper method would be to arrive at the number of men-weeks worked, so to speak, divide that by 52, and give an allowance based on the result.  I can see grave administrative difficulties there, as it would be almost impossible to check up whether a man had or had <Col N="748" /> not 15 men engaged in the month of September for harvest work.  But, before this Bill ceases to have effect, I think the Department should see if some more favourable method of determining the number of adult workmen engaged could not be found.</P>
    <P>Personally, my welcome for the Bill is limited by the fact that I think the whole matter has been approached from a wrong angle.  About a year ago I put down an amendment to the Local Government Bill which was debated in the spring, but it got no support from any quarter of the House.  I sought to approach this matter from a different point of view.  To my mind, the system in the previous Acts, and the system now being tried in this Bill, of giving relief by means of some subvention of the rates is bad.  I think we ought to approach the basic problem more directly.  The basic problem is that the relationship between the valuation on agricultural land and the valuation of other property has got completely out of joint, and there is no longer any proper relationship.  In some counties, I doubt if it ever had a proper relationship. I was reliably informed that the way the valuation survey was carried out in my own county left a very great deal to be desired.  Some of it, I believe, was carried out in the seat of a jaunting car, as the ground was too wet to walk over.  In some cases a small landlord might be seeking to get qualified for the grand jury.  I think everyone will agree that at the present time it is impossible to see the relationship between the valuation of agricultural land and the valuation of, say, business premises in a country town or village.</P>
    <P>There are only two ways out of this that I can see, one is revaluation. Revaluation, of course, is a lengthy and expensive process.  It is also, I gather, a two-edge sword and a great many people are reluctant to advocate it.  The other method that I suggest is arbitrary revaluation of agricultural land, the scaling down of the valuation in an arbitrary fashion.  What I suggested on the amendment, which failed, to the Local Government Bill was that a specified valuation, taking the term as applied in this Bill, should be reduced <Col N="749" /> by three-fifths, that is, its valuation under the Valuation Act should be reduced to two-fifths and the remainder should be reduced by two-fifths. I do not know whether it is a coincidence or not that the figure of three-fifths in regard to the specified valuation crops up in this Bill but I think this would be a fairer method of approaching it.  It would avoid a great many difficulties and a great deal of administrative difficulty in local authority offices.  The amount of work to be done each spring in county council offices in determining the reliefs is very great and, although it will not be quite so bad under this Bill as it was under the previous Act, it would still be considerable.  A further advantage that would derive is that every farmer could see on the face of it what his position was and would not be wondering whether his agricultural relief was properly calculated or not.</P>
    <P>I know there would be difficulties in drafting.  You would have to provide for the transfer of small properties from someone whose valuation exceeded a specified valuation to someone whose valuation did not exceed it but that should not present any insuperable difficulty.  The advantages would far outweigh any preliminary difficulties. A particular advantage about it is that the initial work to be done in the council offices in finding a new measure of valuation would be all the work that would be necessary.  After that it would be merely a matter of applying the rate to the new valuations.  To make up to the local authority for the loss in revenue, all the agricultural grant would accrue, as heretofore.  That could be easily done by payment to the county funds of the agricultural grant.  Any difficulties that may have been experienced previously in that respect have disappeared under the Local Government Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>There is a further difficulty in this Bill, in respect to which I freely admit I am not perfectly certain of the ground on which I stand.  I am not a lawyer and if I am about to step into a morass instead of on to firm ground, I have only myself to blame.  I want the House to appreciate that this is a layman's point of view of something <Col N="750" /> that seems rather technical.  I refer now to sub-section (2) of Section 3, the clause by which the money to finance this is to be found.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance shall make, in respect of each financial year to which this Act applies, an additional grant to the council of each county, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, of an amount equal to the sum by which the allocation to the council under Section 4 of the Act of 1939 (or under that section as modified by Section 5 of the said Act or any other enactment) falls short of the total deficiency in the revenue of the council which, but for the grant, would result from the operation of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Referring to this, in his introductory statement, the Minister said&mdash;column 658 Parliamentary Debates, 8th November, 1946:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The amount of the grant will be what is needed to give the increased reliefs under these heads whatever that sum may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The part I want to draw attention to is the final phrase, &ldquo;whatever that sum may be.&rdquo;  At column 662, in reference to the fact that this Bill was carrying out the promises given by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the Government would be as interested as the farmers in keeping local rates within reasonable bounds, seeing that it will have to provide by general taxation each year for three-fifths of the rates on the first £20 valuation of agricultural land and one-fifth of the rates on land valuations above £20.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, &ldquo;the Government will have to&rdquo;.  I want to suggest that this is a departure from established practice. The House is asked to hand over to the various county councils unlimited control of the public purse, a right which, I believe, this House has always very jealously retained.</P>
    <P>I want to make a very clear distinction in this.  I know that in every Act which requires money there is a provision that the sum or sums necessary <Col N="751" /> to cover the expenses of the Act shall be provided out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  At first glance we do not appear to be doing anything very different but there is the point that this is not permissive in any way; it is mandatory.  It is mandatory on the Minister for Finance to pay to the county councils whatever money they may require to make good this deficiency.  It does not affect the present financial year because, happily, the rates are struck but, so far as next year is concerned, we appear to be heading for the position wherein if the local authority suddenly decides that this is a good thing, that they are going to get a whack out of public funds if they watch themselves, we may be called upon to meet an extraordinary subvention.  Whether that happens or not, the remarkable position is that no one knows just what we will be called upon to vote and what is more remarkable still, whatever we are called on to vote, I fail to see how we will have a word to say in it.  We will have entered into a contract under this measure to meet whatever sums may be arrived at.</P>

      <P>This House is being asked to say that it will meet a deficiency that arises in county council funds and the odd position is that we are going to hand out a blank cheque. The Minister will probably say the county councils are not going to run mad and spend public money, that they have the ratepayers to consider.  Would not the very same argument be put up by a Minister coming to this House with a Supplementary Estimate of £<i>x</i> millions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose, for example, the Minister for Defence were to come into this House and say: &ldquo;I want to do something with the Army; I do not know how much this is going to cost but I want you to vote me an unspecified sum; I cannot tell you what the exact <Col N="752" /> amount will be but I can assure you that I am not going to spend the money foolishly&rdquo;, I do not believe for a moment that the House would listen to the Minister in such an eventuality. I suggest that this is precisely what we are being asked to do here.  This is quite different from the usual procedure. All moneys voted by this House are for specified sums definitely laid down, either for a Department or for some outside body.  An outside body is not, I admit, immediately answerable to this House but, in the case of such a body, money is voted by way of a Grant-in-Aid for a definite fixed sum.  Can the Minister quote any parallel case where the House has voted a completely unspecified amount? I would be very glad to hear of any such case.  I am not trying to make difficulties.  I merely want to point out a difficulty which I see and which I hope may be avoided.  As it stands at present the difficulty is there.  We cannot get out of the difficulty merely by saying that it does not exist.  The usual procedure, when this House agrees to the expenditure of money, is that the House writes a cheque for a specified amount or it crosses the cheque and states that it is not to exceed so many thousands or so many millions.  In this case we are being asked to sign a blank cheque where no upper limit is fixed.  The position would be bad enough if we were asked to give this money to the Minister.  In that case the Minister would be answerable to the House and his accounts would be subject to the control of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The bodies who will receive this money are not directly answerable to this House; neither will their accounts be subject to the Comptroller and Auditor-General or to the Public Accounts Committee.  I do not for a moment suggest that anything very serious could happen to public funds but I am suggesting that we are now creating a serious precedent.  I am, however, open to conviction if I am making a mistake in this respect and if I can be persuaded that it does not bear this interpretation.  The only answer that I can see likely to be made to me is that, first of all, my fears are groundless since the local authorities will not <Col N="753" /> spend money <i>ad libitum;</i> that, of course, does not cover the case at all. Secondly, I may be told that it is the usual practice in a slightly different form.  I maintain that it is not the usual practice.  Most Bills contain an enabling section which makes it possible for the Oireachtas to vote the money.</P>
    <P>I have taken some advice in relation to this.  I was given the rather peculiar advice that it does not matter; that the money is not passing out of the control of the Oireachtas because it states &ldquo;out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  That raises the rather odd position that in this Bill we are giving a definite promise to pay whatever sum the county councils may need. Later on the Minister concerned will come to the House and present an estimate for a certain figure.  The House may then take fright and say: &ldquo;My goodness, we had no idea it was going to be as much as this.  We could not possibly pay this.&rdquo;  It is somewhat similar to the position in which the Pied Piper of Hamelin found himself&mdash;&ldquo;A thousand guilders&mdash;come, take fifty.&rdquo; The House would then be in the position that it would either have to pay willy-nilly or go back on what it has said.  Neither solution is a very good one.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this difficulty could be avoided.  Instead of messing about with the amount of rates to be paid we should amend the valuations on which the rates are paid.  The agricultural grant could then, as formerly, be for a specified amount.  This is the first occasion on which no specified amount has been laid down.  If necessary, we could increase the amount of the agricultural grant.  I think, as a matter of fact, that that is both necessary and desirable.  Further, I suggest that the brief outline I have given of the more proper approach to this matter would avoid any difficulty in the future.  It would at the same time avoid a great deal of administrative work in the county council offices; it would avoid confusion in the minds of the unfortunate farmers; it would save them having to fill up a lot of forms.  It would, in fact, be a much more desirable approach from every point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> I bring it to the notice of the House and to the notice of the Minister in the hope that as this Bill, when it becomes law, will have a very short life the Minister will, when he comes to amend it, follow more closely the lines I have suggested than he has done hitherto. I raise this matter and I am very anxious to hear not only the Minister but any member of the legal profession in this House as to whether we are now being asked to create a precedent and, if so, whether that precedent is a wise one or not.</P>

      <P>Last February this Party tabled a motion asking to have a scheme introduced for the complete derating of the first £20 in the valuation of every holding and a further complete derating of £15 in respect of each adult worker on each holding. The Minister for Finance replied that the scheme would cost approximately £2,000,000.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not think it would be fair to ask the taxpayer to bear this additional burden.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He further said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If I had £2,000,000 and I wanted to use it for the benefit of agriculture I would not give it for the relief of rates and I certainly would not give it for the relief of rates on land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement was made on the 6th February, 1946, in column 549, volume 99.  Two months later the Minister for Finance came into this House to make his Budget speech.  In the course of that speech he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I propose to use £1,000,000 to enable farmers over £20 valuation to give increased wages, and to give a complementary relief to holders under £20.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a complete somersault on the part of the Government in regard to the policy of relieving rates on agricultural land.  Never in the history of this House has a Government or a Minister so completely devoured his own words as the Minister for Finance did on that particular occasion.  I detest this loathsome policy of the Government trimming its sails to meet every wind in an effort to catch every available vote.  I detest the way in which their policy changes from day to day <Col N="755" /> and I think the most undesirable feature of this policy is its reaction upon local government and its reaction upon agriculture generally.  I have been told that when the Minister decided to give way in this matter of the relief of rates on agricultural land he was preparing the ground for a general election during the summer. He was going to go out and say to farmers: &ldquo;Now, we have made a substantial relief in rates.&rdquo;  He could say to the labourers: &ldquo;We have given you a substantial increase in wages and financed that by this Bill.&rdquo;  That would be an attractive programme&mdash; or the Minister might have thought that it would be&mdash;but the atmosphere was later contaminated by the foul odour of stale bacon and the general election was postponed.</P>
    <P>Farmers and the public should know that this type of legislation has bedevilled the country for the past 25 years.  We have no guiding principle governing the financing of local administration, and no guiding principle governing agricultural policy.  We have agricultural policy, wages, and the upkeep of local services all bundled together, in a kind of hotch-potch, to be served up to the electorate from time to time.  That is not the way local affairs should be run.  It is not the way they should be financed. People in charge of local government should be able to plan on a long-term basis; they should know what grants were forthcoming from the Central Exchequer over a period of years, and what principle governed the provision of such grants.  Apparently, as long as the Fianna Fáil Party remain a Government there will be no guiding principle whatever, and opportunism will be the main factor all along the line.</P>
    <P>In his Budget statement the Minister for Finance stated that this grant was intended to last for two years only and at the end of that period he hoped agricultural conditions would prove it to be unnecessary.  He did not use these exact words but rather hoped that prices of agricultural requirements, such as fertilisers, farm implements and so on, would be so reduced that farmers would not require this relief <Col N="756" /> in respect to employment.  A few considerations arise out of that statement. In the first place, it is quite likely that prices of agricultural requirements, such as fertilisers, machinery and so on, will be reduced over the next few years.  Is it not equally possible, unless something is done, that agricultural prices will fall considerably, and, in that event, how can the suggestion of the Minister for Finance be implemented?</P>
    <P>Another consideration is this, that in the event of the wage subsidy proposals in this Bill being withdrawn after two years, there will then be a very lopsided system of relief of rates on agricultural land.  You will have three-fifths of the rates wiped out on the first £20 valuation on each agricultural holding and one-fifth on the remainder, so that in the case of a large farmer, who has given considerable employment, there will be considerable deterioration in his position compared to what it is at present.</P>
    <P>A farmer, whose valuation is over £20, and gives a substantial amount of employment at present obtains approximately the same measure of relief as the farmer whose valuation is under £20.  Under the new scheme a farmer whose valuation is over £20, and who gives considerable employment will get only one-third of the relief which a small farmer would obtain.  I fail to see why there should be a difference in that proposal.  Take the position of a farmer whose valuation is £100, and employs four men in addition to his own help.  Is not that man as great an asset to the community, and supporting as big a proportion of the population as the man whose valuation is under £20, who employs nobody but members of his own family?  Why should a farmer whose valuation is over £20 be condemned to obtain relief only to the extent of one-fifth of his valuation, regardless of the amount of employment he gives, while the small farmer is rightly given relief on his valuation? That seems to be a question which the Minister should weigh carefully.</P>
    <P>In our proposal we sought to be fair and just to the large and to the small farmer.  We provided for the complete derating of land under £20 valuation, and we provided similar relief in <Col N="757" /> respect to each man employed.  That was meeting the case fairly.  It was an attempt to put our farmers on an equal footing with those in Great Britain and Northern Ireland with whom they have to compete.  The Minister has, however, followed the usual course of introducing a complicated hotch-potch, and given it a short lease of life, so that we must have the question of justice under consideration again in a short time.  That line of procedure ought to be abandoned.  We should realise that local services are very important to the community, and cannot be dealt with by doling out various types of grants, fluctuating according to the fortunes of the Party in power, and according to the district which it is needed to bolster up.  That is the usual line of approach.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this Bill is that it has been represented as one that provides tremendous relief for farmers.  As a matter of fact I was astonished to find that practically all county managers and county secretaries vied with each other in sending out propaganda in the early part of the year pointing out what an immense relief it would be to farmers; that it almost amounted to complete derating, which it does not.  I was just wondering whether these officials were inspired to do that from the Custom House or were acting spontaneously.  It seems rather strange that, in bolstering up this piece of legislation, they failed to make any comment upon other aspects of the question, namely, that farmers on account of the relief they were getting, were also called upon to pay very substantial increases in wages.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, the increase in wages far more than counterbalances the amount of relief given.  The maximum relief which a farmer can obtain under this Bill, for the two years in which it operates, is £6 10s. 0d. in respect of each man employed.  The minimum increase which farmers are called upon to pay under the recent increases in wages is over £10 per man per year.  As Deputy Hughes pointed out, in the figures given to him in reply to a question asked last week, it was admitted that the total increase in wages for all farmers in this country amounts to over £1,000,000 while the amount of relief which wage-paying <Col N="758" /> farmers&mdash;that is, farmers who are employing men, farmers over £20 valuation for the most part&mdash;would receive would be considerably less than £1,000,000.  In addition to that, it must be remembered that this relief is also counterbalanced by a very substantial increase in rates.  If I remember rightly, the Minister stated last week that the increase in rates amounted to £600,000.  Thus you find that the farmer employing labour on the land is getting very slight relief under this Bill.  As a matter of fact, the weather conditions and other difficulties which he experienced last year, have completely wiped out that relief.  Farmers are really worse off than they were before this provision was made, so let us not have our paid officials under local authorities throwing their hats into the air and applauding the generosity of the Government to the farmers.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is only one way to meet this problem and that is by getting down to what is fair and equitable. There would be no need for any relief of rates on agricultural land if our system of valuations in this country was fair or, rather, I should say, if the system under which local authorities are financed was fair, because I doubt if you can ever establish a fair system of financing local government based on property valuation.  There will always be a very considerable number of people in this country who own little or no property but who, nevertheless, are people of means enjoying substantial incomes.  They escape under the present system the duty of assisting in financing local government.  Because that system was found to be unfair, we have had the agricultural grant for a number of years.  It was an attempt to meet the equity of the case, an attempt which did not go far enough by any means to meet the demands of justice, and it has been, in Government documents over a long period, persistently represented as a gift by the general taxpayers to the farmer. Whenever the farmer puts up a demand for justice in any field, whether in regard to prices or anything else, he is met with the answer that so many millions of pounds are devoted to the relief of rates, that so many million <Col N="759" /> pounds are each year given as relief to the farmers, that assertion being based on the falsehood that the valuations under which local authorities are financed are fair and just.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I was not present when the Minister was introducing this Bill, because the Minister's eloquence loses something of its force by being translated into cold print and I am sure his statement would have been more impressive if I had the pleasure of hearing it.  He stated that there were many anomalies in the past system which would be wiped out under this Bill.  I would put it to him that there are a great many anomalies in the present Bill.  One anomaly is that while relief is provided for two years in respect of each adult male worker, no relief is provided in respect of the female worker on the land. Surely the Minister must admit that the woman who works on the land contributes her fair share towards production in agriculture.  Surely it will be acknowledged that female labour on the land is necessary and even desirable. There are many branches of agricultural work in which women are more expert and better qualified to carry out than men.  I can say without fear of contradiction that, if it were not for the unpaid labour of so many women on the land for the past 25 years, agriculture would not have survived the many blizzards through which it has passed.  There is no provision in this Bill in regard to female labour on the land.  The whole Bill is a kind of stop-gap arrangement, a hurriedly concocted scheme between the month of February last and the date on which the Minister for Finance introduced his Budget.  It may present legal difficulties as Deputy Sheldon pointed out.  It may bring the Minister into conflict with the Constitution. I am not sufficiently legal-minded to go into those questions.</P>
    <P>There is one other anomaly which occurs to me and which I think should be met.  That is the fact that no provision has yet been made&mdash;either in this Bill or in any of the other legislation in regard to rates on agricultural land&mdash;in respect to agricultural buildings. <Col N="760" /> We know that in derating agricultural land in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, it was decided to derate not only land but also farm buildings, that is buildings used for the housing of live stock and in connection with farm work&mdash;all buildings other than dwellinghouses.  That anomaly is continued in this Bill as far as I can understand and I think it is time to end it.  Our Party have a motion before the House to seek to end that condition of affairs.  I do not think that anybody can justify in any circumstances the taxing of buildings which the farmer so urgently needs for the purpose of carrying on his farming operations. It would be as just and equitable to tax a binder, a plough, a mowing-machine or any other farm implement as it is to levy a yearly rate on a hay-barn, a cow-shed or a piggery.  As my leader, Deputy Blowick, pointed out, it would be just as equitable to levy a rate on the hay and corn in the haggard. If the Minister continues to follow the line he has followed to a certain extent, in regard to this Bill, that is, to be guided to some extent at any rate, by the advice of this Party, not only in connection with the relief of rates on land but in connection with the relief of rates on buildings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to this debate and the different opinions expressed, it struck me that there is one way out of the whole difficulty, a way which would ease the pressure on the Department, on the Minister for Finance and on Deputies: bring in a measure of complete derating.  It would be the most equitable way of dealing with the matter.  Deputy Cogan spoke of the anomalies in this Bill and I think the Minister himself referred to some of them.  I intend to refer to a good many of them because it teems with anomalies. I have always held, in speaking of rating here, that the methods adopted by the present Government in apportioning <Col N="761" /> the relief which this House gives to agriculture are inequitable, unjust and unfair.  In the first place, it is unfair to discriminate between farmer and farmer.  If the House thinks it right to vote sums of money for the relief of farmers, these moneys ought to be equitably distributed as between farmer and farmer, and, above all, they should be equitably distributed as between county and county.</P>
      <P>That is the point I want particularly to make, because there are certain sections of farmers who, when one urges that money ought to be equitably distributed as between farmer and farmer, immediately regard one as making a case for the big farmer as against the small farmer.  That is not so.  We are all glad that the small farmer should get relief, but we equally expect that the large farmer will get similar relief, and that is not the principle adopted in relation to the distribution of relief by this Government. The system of basing relief on a specified valuation of £20 is unfair in principle and in practice.  It is unfair as between farmer and farmer, but it is equally unfair as between the farmer in one county and the farmer in another county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As between farmer and farmer, I quite believe that the man of £20 valuation is deserving of relief.  He is generally a very small farmer who finds it hard to live just as other farmers find it hard to live, and very difficult to pay the annually mounting rates. The House felt it desirable, and feels now that it is desirable, to come to his relief, and relief was granted to him. The old principle, before this Government came in, was to apportion whatever relief was given equally between all farmers, and I believe it was the most equitable system.  Probably faults could be found in it.  It could be argued that the man of £100 valuation was better able to stand taxation than the man with £20 valuation, but that argument could be met, because the man under £20 valuation in some places was a very insignificant farmer, so small that he was enjoying much of the reliefs provided by the rates.  It was quite common in various counties under the local government system that a man with a very small valuation partook <Col N="762" /> of benefits which the rates provided, of which the man of greater valuation than £20 provided the greater portion.  That is a system which prevails to a certain extent still, and it is very unfair.</P>
    <P>With regard to the apportioning of reliefs as between county and county, the man of £20 valuation in Mayo is a fairly comfortable farmer&mdash;comfortable from the point of view of the size of his farm&mdash;but the man of £20 valuation in Limerick or Tipperary would be styled an uneconomic holder in respect of the size of his farm.  The man of £70 valuation in Mayo would be one of those farmers for the division of whose lands we hear so many people calling.  He would be a farmer for the division of whose lands we would have men like Deputy Cafferky, Deputy Commons and Deputy Donnellan appealing. The man of £70 valuation in Limerick and Tipperary would be a very average size farmer, with a farm of 30 or 40 acres of land.  In the district I come from, the man of £70 valuation would have about 30 acres. I do not know how much land such a farmer in Mayo would have, but Deputy Cafferky and other Clann na Talmhan Deputies would be appealing for the distribution of his land amongst uneconomic holders.  Can it be argued that a system which provides for the £20 valuation man in Mayo and the £20 valuation man in Limerick getting the same treatment is fair?  It is completely inequitable.</P>
    <P>There is another argument which can be applied with regard to the man of moderate valuation and another.  The Minister on one occasion said to me, when I was speaking about moderate-sized farmers paying income-tax, that there were no farmers paying income-tax. He was Minister for Finance at that period, and he modified his statement somewhat and said that there were practically no farmers paying income-tax, that their valuations would have to be inconceivably high before they paid income-tax.  I assured the Minister then, and I assure him now, that farmers with moderate-sized farms in County Limerick, and, I think, in Tipperary, are paying income-tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry might be able to pursue methods of defying the income-tax collector which some of us in Limerick are unable to pursue, but the fact remains that the man with 60 acres of land in County Limerick is subject to income-tax.  I do not suppose that any Minister would have the temerity to ask the man with 60 acres in Mayo to pay income-tax.  These are some of the anomalies in the Bill, some of the anomalies to which the Minister referred generally but not specifically.</P>
      <P>There is only one real method by which to apply a fair and equitable relief to all farmers, that is, the system in Northern Ireland and in England: derating of all farmers, large and small.  Give them all a fair crack of the whip and proceed, as we are rapidly proceeding in this House, to run local government from the Custom House.  We are doing it anyhow.  The trend of legislation for the past five or six years has brought about a position in which local bodies have no say in local government.  It is anomalous to say that there is such a thing as local government, because there is not. There is no such thing as local government, as I told the Minister when discussing another Bill.  There is only central government, and if it is an anomaly to speak of local government, why not do away with the farce of having local rates?  Let it all be central taxation to provide whatever is needed. It will be the fairest method, and it will provide for the man who is inequitably valued and for the man who is equitably valued.  It will provide equal justice for the small and for the large farmer, and it is the only method you can devise by which to ensure an absolutely equitable distribution of whatever moneys are voted for the relief of agriculture.</P>
      <P>I have said that the trend of legislation here was to pass on to local government gradually each year more and more services, services which should really be provided out of central taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every single Act passed in the way of social legislation for the last eight or ten years has made provision for a contribution from the local rates. <Col N="764" /> Local rates have jumped up year after year.  I think the Minister said they had jumped up this year by something like £600,000.  Next year, or the year after, when some of the Bills going through this House have been passed, one does not know what the rates will be, but they will be very high.  Speaking on a certain Bill which has yet to be passed, one Minister said that he could not give the House any idea of what certain services provided for in that Bill would cost, but that the cost would be very considerable.  All these costs will have to be provided for in the years to come, and these costs relate to measures which are really national rather than local ones.</P>
    <P>Within the next few months, we will be discussing the Public Health Bill, and I expect the present Minister will be in charge of it.  He will have to make the best case he can for a great expenditure of money.  I hope he will admit that it should be really national expenditure rather than local expenditure. But, when we come to consider the measure, we will find that a great deal of expenditure will fall on the local rates, even though, in theory, it is a national Bill for the good of the people in general.  Long ago they dealt with that matter in Great Britain and introduced derating of agricultural land and that was extended to Northern Ireland.  We are behind the times here.  Every day we hear arguments advanced against Partition.  The question of Partition is not in order in this debate.  But, if I were a farmer in Northern Ireland with my land derated, and somebody came up there talking about Partition and asked, &ldquo;Will you come down to the Twenty-Six Counties?&rdquo; I would say: &ldquo;Not until you derate agricultural land&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Not all of it, I hope. We do not know that.  There is a fear that a certain portion of it may be extinguished in two years.  As to the major portion of it, I hope it will be continued for a longer period than two years.  Before the two years are up, I hope the Minister will consider that the best way out of the whole business is to adopt the principle of total derating.  Until we come to that, we have only to meet things as best we can.</P>
      <P>The fixation of the specified valuation at £20 is unfair, and it ought to be at least doubled for some reasons which I have given and other reasons which I could give if I did not want to delay the House.  As to the employment relief, I was glad to see that at long last, after constant preaching, the Clann na Talmhan Party have listened to some of the things which were said by other Parties.  Before this Government came in and since they came in I have been advocating every year the principles I have mentioned. In particular, I have been advocating the inclusion of women workers in connection with this employment relief.  I cannot see why women were excluded from this and previous Bills.  No Minister has been able to give me a reason why they should be.  The former Minister for Finance, who at one time was Minister for Local Government and who fills a more exalted position now, did attempt on one occasion to argue with me why women should not be included. He failed to impress me and, I think, to impress the House.  I think the present Minister is more sympathetically inclined; that he will be more inclined to see reason.  If the Minister can make a fair case why women, working under the same conditions as men and receiving the same pay and privileges, should not be treated as workers for the purposes of this employment relief, I shall never again mention the subject.</P>

      <P>In the county which I represent there are thousands of women employed for whom farmers get <Col N="766" /> no employment allowance.  These women are getting the same wages as men and work under the same conditions.  If one farmer employs two women and another farmer employs two men, the latter gets £13 employment allowance, while the other man gets nothing.  Is that fair or just?  it took ten years to get into the heads of the chief Farmers' Party that that was unfair.  It will probably take me longer to get it into the heads of the Government Party. But I will get it into their heads some day, somehow, if I live long enough and have the privilege of being a member of this House.  However, it may not be necessary, because I believe the present Minister will consider the matter, and when we come to the next stage of this Bill we will probably find that he has included women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot move an amendment to that effect because it would not be accepted by the Chair. I can only ask the Minister to bring in an amendment to include women workers.  I do not believe that the burden of rates can be relieved to any great extent except by derating.  The Minister said that it would be in the interests of the Minister, whoever he may be, to keep rates down.  As he is contributing so much to the rates, it would be necessary to see that rates are kept down.  One does not see any trend in that direction in the legislation which is being introduced.  In fact his predecessor in the two offices of Minister for Finance and Minister for Local Government on one occasion in Limerick said that the rates were not high enough and that, if he had his way, they would be much higher.  He had his way.  He saw that they were increased, and they have been increased annually ever since and are still increasing.  So far as we can look into the future, as a result of coming legislation they will be immeasurably higher in the future.  One Minister said in his Budget statement that he feared they were going to such a height that the ordinary agriculturist would be unable to bear them.  I believe that is going to happen.  I believe the continuation <Col N="767" /> of relief of some form will be necessary and also that it must be increased annually in this House.  The fairest method of applying relief generally to farmers is that adopted in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, complete derating, and let whatever is the expenditure be borne out of central funds.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a rather welcome relief to the agricultural community. I do not take the same interest in it now as I did a week ago. I am now in the happy position that I do not care how high the rates go. I remember being a young fellow in this House many years ago and having the neck to stand up, where my friend Deputy Fagan is now, to propose a motion for £1,000,000 relief of rates on agricultural land.  I have a distinct recollection of Deputy Bennett's abhorrence of it and his trotting into the Lobby to vote against it.  Farmers wanted no relief then.  That is one of my earliest recollections of Deputy Bennett.  Derating at that time was all a cod with Deputy Bennett.  It is rather amusing now to hear the claims he makes.</P>

      <P>It is rather amusing to hear the new swallows, those who come in the summer and go in the winter.  I think this is the sixth Farmers' Party, of different moods and tenses, that I have seen since I came to this House, and I suppose I will see five or six more before I go. It is rather amusing to hear their claims.  When we first came in here as a Government we decided that whatever relief would be given in <Col N="768" /> rates would be in a specified form, namely, that the first £20 valuation would be the first relief, then, that the man who tilled his land and employed labour in the tilling of it and kept his family working on the land would get relief for each individual working on the land.  These were the cardinal principles on which we worked and on these cardinal principles I hope we will continue to work so far as annual relief and derating are concerned.</P>
      <P>I say that this Bill is a relief.  I was rather amused to hear Deputy Sheldon's argument a while ago.  What is being done in this Bill is not a precedent. It was done by the Minister for Local Government two or three years ago when a further social service was introduced, namely the granting of an extra 2/6 to old age pensioners. When the Minister put portion of that burden on the ratepayer he gave a guarantee that the Central Fund would bear a larger proportion of the taxation. When the matter cropped up in Cork I discovered that old age pensioners who were entitled to the 2/6 were not getting it because the Minister for Local Government and Public Health took upon himself an interpretation of the Act that was not intended, namely, that they would pay so much and no more.  I put forward the case that Deputy Sheldon is making here, that it is the local authorities who had the determination of how many old and blind persons were entitled to the 2/6 and that it was the Minister's job to pay up.  I think I proved that to the satisfaction of this House and the Minister paid up.  Therefore, this move is not a precedent, at any rate in connection with local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so much interested in relief of rates now.  We were informed by the Minister for Agriculture in this House last week that within the next few months a Bill will be introduced which will be the Magna Carta of the Irish farmers and I am glad the new Farmers' Party helped me in getting it.  It cost me something like four years of hard work here and I made converts of the Farmers' Party about six months ago and they came along to my assistance.  For any assistance they gave, I am duly grateful.  That is <Col N="769" /> why I say I have very little interest in this Bill and very little interest in any other relief that is brought along for the farmers because when this House has passed the Tribunal of Prices Bill and has moulded that Bill as it should be moulded, we do not care how high they put the rates, we will pass them along to someone else, just as they passed them on to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is our job, to pass them along.  The industrialists passed the baby to us for the past 20 years.  Everyone passed the baby to us.  We hear complaints here periodically from Deputy Bennett about increases in rates.  That is where I lock horns with Deputy Sheldon. Deputy Sheldon complained that local authorities might pass on the baby to us.  He passed the very same baby to the local authorities, under the Vocational Education Bill, putting another couple of pence in the £ on the ratepayers' back on the very day that this Relief of Rates Bill was introduced, last Friday.  However, there is no doubt that social services were neglected when Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael, or whatever they called themselves, were in office.  They were sadly neglected.  Proof as to the necessity for these social services is rendered here when every Party in this House welcomes every Bill for the improvement of social services.  Nobody says anything against it.  The only complaint we hear is that we are not going far enough.  I agree with Deputy Bennett that the decision as to whether the burdens created by social services are to be borne by the agricultural community and by nobody else&mdash;as they have been&mdash;or whether they are to be borne by the general taxpayer is a very important matter. But the baby was passed on to the local authority and every time they passed on the &ldquo;blooming baby&rdquo; they tacked on a couple of pounds more. So the burden is passed on to the local authority and through the local authority to the agricultural community who have at their disposal neither any remedy nor anybody upon whom to pass on the burden.  That is the position of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> Every burden cast upon any other section of the community can be passed on.  When the industrial employees were given holidays, through the medium of legislation under the auspices of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, every industrialist in this country immediately approached the Department of Industry and Commerce claiming authority to pass on the baby in the shape of increased prices for the loaf of bread and for every other commodity that they either produced or manufactured.  They got their authority and passed the burden on.  The cost of social services is cast upon a section of the community which has no means at its disposal of passing on the burden.  They have to bear every additional burden placed upon them.  An outcry is made here about his £6 10s. 0d. which is being given now for agricultural labour.  Last week the Minister for Agriculture, in answer to a question in this House, said that extra wages this year would amount to £1,000,000.  Now, the Minister for Local Government, if he makes a contract with a contractor, and an increase in wages takes place, the contractor is immediately allowed the difference.  The agricultural community signed their contracts in relation to the production of wheat, beet and everything else.  If they claim the difference of this extra burden put upon them through this extra £1,000,000, they will be told that they will not get it.  That is that.  That is why I say that I have very little interest in this Bill.  I do not care how high they drive the rate.  I do not care if the rate is £2 in the £; we will pass it along the same as it has been passed along for 20 years or more.</P>

      <P>In so far as this Bill seeks to keep men in employment on the land, I think it is a good measure. But I am not at all satisfied that the relief given in this measure is calculated to keep our workers on the land. It is quite clear from our population figures that the tendency is for the number of actual workers on the land to decrease annually.  I have no doubt that if agricultural workers were free to emigrate at the moment and free to take advantage of the high scale of <Col N="771" /> wages prevailing on the other side of the water there would be a still further decrease in our agricultural workers' population.  Not only that, but it is clear from the figures of the employment fund set up under the parent measure and continued to date that there has been a definite decrease in the demands made upon that fund. Viewed in either light, therefore&mdash; either on the basis of the allowances demanded by the farmers in respect of workers or on the basis of our population figures&mdash;it is clear that the remedies at present being tried have not succeeded and are unlikely to succeed in keeping our people on the land.</P>
      <P>It is most refreshing, and I am sure it will be most refreshing to the farmers of Cork and Ireland, to hear Deputy Corry say that he does not care how high the rates soar&mdash;he does not care if the sky is the limit.  Nevertheless, we do know that since this Government came into office there has been an increase in the agricultural rate of £2,000,000, and at the present time this Bill proposes to hand back £1,000,000 of that to the relief of agriculturists. There is a definite limit of time, however, put to this relief&mdash;two years.  It is not at all clear what the Government's intention is at the end of this two-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that it is very undersirable to give a relief of this kind if the intention is to remove it in two years' time.  It is likely to have a very serious effect on agriculture.  The case made here by the Minister is that agriculture is likely to be in such a prosperous condition at the end of the two-year period that it will not need this continued relief.  That I consider, in the light of present-day development, as pure speculation.  The great defect of this measure at the moment is the defect adverted to by Deputy Bennett&mdash;the lack of uniformity in our valuation system, the inequality of relief as between farmer and farmer and as between county and county. Whilst this Bill seeks to a certain extent to bring about uniformity, in that it aims at making a uniform rate of relief all round, by reason of the <Col N="772" /> fact that you have not a uniform basis of valuation you will not achieve an equal relief as between farmer and farmer and county and county.  I can produce instances to the House&mdash;I do not want to go into details&mdash;where, say, in the case of a father dividing a farm between sons two portions of the land in the same area have been valued differently.  You may have one valued at £50 and the other valued at £65 or £80.  This measure will not bring any equality of relief in cases of that kind.  Neither will it give equality of relief as between county and county. For that reason I think there is a case for reviewing our whole valuation system and bringing into operation some new system whereby that inequality will not be continued.  To my mind, this measure smacks somewhat of the cheap sales policy adopted by certain business establishments; you pile on the profits over a given period of trading and, having soaked your customers through good fat prices, you then proceed to have a cheap sale and give them the impression that they are going to get something for nothing. The housewives rush to the sale and buy ravenously.  Here you have a case where taxation has been piled on to the tune of £2,000,000 since 1932.  We now proceed to hand a little back after the manner of the good salesman.</P>
    <P>I would support Deputy Cogan in making an appeal that the relief should be extended to farm buildings excluding, if you like, the dwelling-house.  It should be passed on to the buildings which are part of the farmer's working capital or, in other words, the productive part of his business enterprise. Again, may I say on this point that I disagree entirely with the system of relief to agriculture?  I look upon all these reliefs as having a negative effect.  In the ultimate they contribute nothing positively to promoting the productive prosperity of agriculture.</P>
    <P>If it is intended by measures of this kind to increase the productivity of the farmer, you have only to look at your figures of production, and compare them with production over a number of years, to find in actual fact that we are not producing from the land very much more than we produced 50 or 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> Therefore, I say that relief of this kind is largely negative, and does not in any sense make up for a positive policy to promote the prosperity of farmers.  The farmer needs a long-term policy; he needs guaranteed markets and guaranteed prices.  He needs all these over a long period.  He needs security of market, and continued security of that market, whether a home market or a foreign market.</P>
    <P>The only way to solve our problems is to sit down and to balance our economic budget as it were, as otherwise we are going to get nowhere, either in industry or agriculture. Sooner or later, with the present trend of things, both here and throughout the world, we will have to face up to this situation, whereby the demands of agriculture will have to be balanced as against the demands of industry, and both balanced against the demands of consumer at home and abroad.  In other words, we will have to make out something like a national economic budget, by which the agriculturist demands can be put on one side as against his expenses on the other side.  We will have to do the same with industry and check its demands with consumers' demands on the other side.  Some council or some Ministry will have to reconcile all these conflicting demands, so that we can evolve a new national economic system.  Until we do that I feel that we are merely tinkering with our economic problems.</P>
    <P>I should like to have seen this measure of relief going a little further and taking within its range farmers who are suffering to-day by reason of flooding.  There are many areas where farmers are put to the pin of their collar to carry on because of inundations. In the Dunmore area of my constituency and in other areas a shocking state of affairs prevails.  In some places farmers are faced with this problem: whether to go out of business or whether it is worth while carrying on.  Many of these men suffered extraordinary losses during the floods of this year.  Many of them are suffering annually by reason of continual inundations.  I should like to see the Minister try to extend some measure of relief to people so circumstanced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> I am sure that what obtains in my constituency is nothing to the conditions that prevail elsewhere.  I was down in my constituency recently and saw the extraordinary conditions under which these people are trying to comply with compulsory tillage Orders and to carry on ordinary farming.  It is a terrible hardship on them.  Many of them have lost a big percentage of their crops, floods having taken them away and destroying hay and corn. We are faced with this position, that under the Arterial Drainage Act it is unlikely that in my constituency any survey will be made for five years.  It is also unlikely having regard to the priority which arterial drainage will be given in certain areas that my constituency will be reached within the next 50 years. Are our farmers to continue to suffer these continual inundations and, at the same time, be compelled to comply with tillage regulations?  I hold that there is a severe case of hardship existing in the case of these men, and that some relief under a measure of this kind should be extended to them.</P>
    <P>On the general problem of relief, I should like to put this picture before the Minister.  On the one hand he is attempting to give relief in rates to farmers and, on the other hand, his Department has very grandiose schemes for new roads, new arterial highways, new public health services and new social services of all kinds. Most of the charges for these services are going to be thrown on the local rates.  As far as I know the charges for public services will have to be largely met from local rates.  Forty to sixty per cent., if not more, of the charges for new roads and for their maintenance will have to be met from local rates.  Charges for increased vocational education will also have to be met from local rates.  Already certain increased charges in respect of old age pensions have to be met.  There are also charges for public assistance which, to my mind, should be a national charge.  In addition, there is what is certainly to any unbiased mind a State charge, that for unemployment assistance.  In other words, the State is relieving national taxation, if you like, at the expense of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> Statutory demands now made on local authorities are reaching a very high proportion of their expenditure.</P>
    <P>If, at a glance, we see a measure of relief introduced, on the other side it will be found that the agricultural community are going to face increasing statutory demands under all headings. From that angle I cannot see any relief whatever to agriculturists. I suggest to the Minister that certain classes of roads&mdash;national roads, class I&mdash;should come under the heading of relief, and that some relief should be given local ratepayers.  If I am asked where the relief should come from, and where the money is to be found, I have not gone into that aspect, but I am sure the Road Fund and the petrol tax could be worked in such a way as to provide the necessary relief.  I stress again that nothing by way of palliative or temporary relief is going to make up for a positive agricultural policy such as I have indicated.</P>
    <P>I should not like to subscribe to Deputy Bennett's views of a single tax system.  A gentleman known as Henry George became known in economic history as Single Tax George.  I do not think our friend Deputy George Bennett has fully studied the implications of Henry George.  The Minister did envisage the developments not long ago in a speech at the Mansion House, that the whole system of rating would have to be reviewed, and that it was on the cards that we would have to formulate some regional system to make up for the inequalities of the present rating system between county and county.  Undoubtedly there is a case for that.  There is a case for certain charges which are local charges being imposed on a larger area.  This country is so small that I personally do not subscribe to the principle of a regional system of rating.  If you are going to advance on those lines, I would prefer to see the Minister making a whole hog advance, an advance to the position where many of the charges would be met from national taxation.</P>
    <P>Again I would ask the Minister to consider the question&mdash;because I think it is a crying necessity at the moment &mdash;of giving some measure of relief to <Col N="776" /> those people who are carrying on under the conditions of flooding which I have mentioned.  Many other Deputies have similar problems and we are in the position that neither under the Arterial Drainage Act nor, as far as I can see, under the recent Local Government Bill can any substantial measure of relief be given to those who have suffered.  This may not be the appropriate place to raise the matter but I would ask the Minister to bear it in mind when any further measures in regard to rates are under consideration by the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is no Deputy who will say that this Bill should not be passed.  In so far as it is a measure which provides relief for a certain important part of the community, it is a very welcome measure. It is an equitable one also, as it provides that relief will be uniformly given in respect of the various types of agricultural land.  It provides that the farmer with the lowest valuation will get a certain credit and then it projects the remainder of the relief right up to the highest valuation.  That is all very desirable and laudable, but I am sorry that I find it incumbent to draw attention to another side of the story&mdash;that by pursuing a policy of this nature some of us are apt to see perhaps the benefit accruing to the class which we want to benefit, while we do not see so readily the concurrent disadvantage to somebody else.  I suggest that this is one of the Bills which have a concomitant disadvantage to this extent&mdash; that the relief which is being afforded under the Bill has to be met by contributions from the general fund, the Central Fund.  The last speaker seems to think that that is a very proper thing, that these rateable charges should be paid from the Central Fund. The question is: who is going to defray these charges if they are to be met out of the Central Fund?  The Central Fund is not an inexhaustible theoretical fund which can be drawn upon <i>ad lib.</i> as some people seem to imagine.  The money drawn from that fund comes in the main as much from the citizen who is paying towards the maintenance of the State as it comes from the citizen who is a ratepayer.  In other words, <Col N="777" /> somebody has to pay and it is not very much help to anybody to change over the charge which he has to meet from account A, as a general taxpayer, to account B, as a ratepayer.  He pays and it is immaterial to him really under what heading you charge it.  I cannot understand the arguments, therefore, that all these charges should be met out of general taxation.  It is the same people who have to pay and it is immaterial whether they pay under one heading or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more serious objection I see, whether it is the ratepayer or whether it is the general taxpayer that is involved, is that it is now becoming largely a question of charging one group or one set of individuals for the benefit of others.  If you derate the farmer, you can only make up for that either by charging him under another name or else charging another section of the community for his benefit.  Then, of course, the question arises whether we are maintaining a fair balance between the various parts that go to make up the community.  This is perhaps not the proper time to go at length into that subject.  We have warnings, though, of the additional burdens to come in our expanding social services, in our Public Health Bill, for instance.  I confine myself on this occasion to raising the question of whether we have not now reached the stage with all this type of legislation when we should consider what is the most equitable way of distributing the burden of these increased services for the community.  At the present moment our whole tendency is to try to relieve the farmer as much as possible. This measure is to benefit the farmer, but what benefit is it to the poorer people of Dublin or the lower middle classes in Dublin?  As far as I can see, they are not getting any <i>quid pro quo</i> in the line of cheaper foodstuffs or anything like that. Under every social service certain classes benefit but here there is no concomitant benefit to the people who are paying the rates and taxes to maintain these services.  Again, it is too far outside the scope of this Bill to go into this matter, but it does raise the question of whether, at some stage, some contributory scheme or <Col N="778" /> some scheme equally balanced over the whole community, will not have to be thought out and applied.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of derating, you are now proposing to derate agricultural land and I should like to point out that in all probability there is one class of person who will have to bear perhaps an unfair burden for this relief&mdash;that is certain classes in towns and cities.  We all know what is happening in the City of Dublin and I think we should advert to it.  We have imporved our services to the very poor. In Dublin also services available for the country are maintained.  Dublin supports a large number of services which really benefit the country at large.  I need not detail the long list of improved social services that have been put into operation in Dublin, but who is paying for them?  The tenant of practically every house in Dublin is paying in the rates which are passed on to him.  Whether an unfair or an undue burden is being cast upon him, as far as I can see, the lower-scale white-collared worker is now becoming the victim.  He will have to pay income-tax and, whether he owns his house or not, he will have to pay rates, in effect. He will be paying a large amount for services which benefit other members of the community and what advantage is he getting in return?  This may seem somewhat remote from the question of agricultural derating but in giving relief to the farmer in this way&mdash;which is a very proper relief and a very fine relief&mdash;I should like to see relief given in such a way that it will not tend towards increasing the burden on the classes of persons in the city whom I have mentioned.  I should like further to see that if reliefs are given to one class, the interests of such a deserving class as I have mentioned, what I would call the lower white-collared worker, will not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>We have in the city large numbers of junior civil servants, workers in city firms and in offices, people on salaries under £400 per year, who are paying both income-tax and increasing rates. There is no relief for them, and if the principle contained, I am afraid, too often, in some of the Bills coming here, that is, if you are relieving the rate, <Col N="779" /> relieve it from the Central Fund, is to be followed, that principle will only operate against the class I have mentioned. Taking that in conjunction with the fact that provisions are envisaged which will tend to put up the rates in towns particularly&mdash;for instance, the new public health schemes under which Dublin will be maintaining hospitals and such institutions which are really for the benefit of the country but which will be maintained largely on the local rate&mdash;and the fact that Dublin is maintaining part of the population which should be maintained by the country, as a result of the big drift into Dublin, and the increase and expansion of Dublin which is a further burden on the city, I think we have reached the limit of applying relief legislation in this particular way and will ultimately have to face up to the problem of considering all classes of the community and of seeing in what way the burden of all these services, which everybody desires and which everybody is glad to have, can be evenly distributed over the paying members of the community.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point which, I think, has been mentioned already&mdash;the discrepancies in individual valuations and the lack of uniformity in valuations throughout the country.  A complete revaluation would be a very big job, but, based on existing valuations, there are bound to be discrepancies which will favour some people unduly and impose hardship on others.  If we are going to face up to this question of valuations, I should like to mention these towns and cities in that regard, because it is almost inevitable, as we are tending to think in this House at the moment, that if there was an attempted revaluation scheme&mdash;I believe that one is, or was, in contemplation&mdash;the owner of agricultural land will fare very well, but the unfortunate town and city dweller is likely to come off rather badly.  Admittedly, the agricultural community is the basis of this country, and, admittedly, the agricultural community is a very important part of the country; but I think we tend to forget the importance of the populations in our towns, and particularly the importance <Col N="780" /> of the population in Dublin and all too easily pass burdens on to them.</P>
    <P>These are the only observations I can make on the Bill.  They are more observations of warning and general comment than a reasoned address to the subject of the Bill.  Everybody agrees with the Bill and everybody is satisfied that this relief should be given, but the Bill, in itself, is a warning that the time has come for us to consider, broadly and largely, how the expenses of these social services and all these charges are best borne by the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera seems to forget that this Bill does not give relief to the agricultural community. The Minister brags about the great relief he is giving, but everybody seems to forget that we were paying our agricultural labourers £2 per week, and were told that, when this relief was being given, we would have to give an increase&mdash;an increase to which they are undoubtedly entitled&mdash;to our workers. Their wages were increased by 4/- per week, an increase which the Minister for Agriculture admitted last week amounts to something like £1,000,000 per year on the agricultural community. If a farmer employs ten men, it represents £2 per week, or more than £104 per year.  The Minister for Agriculture admits that agriculture is getting only £6,000,000, whereas it is saddled with £1,000,000, with the result that the agricultural community are at the loss of £400,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera seems to think that all that is put on the dwellers in the towns and cities, but if the farmers were to be recompensed for this loss, the price of the produce they produced should have been increased, but it has not been increased.  The people in the towns and cities get this relief at the expense of the farmers.  Deputy Corry has admitted that everything is being passed on to the local bodies, such as unemployment assistance, the supplementary old age pension and so on.  The farmers' relief this year from this supposedly great benefit amounts to nothing at all.  It is, in fact, a loss. My rates are not much less this year <Col N="781" /> than they were last year, but I am at a loss in that I have to pay so much extra to my men.</P>

      <P>That does not balance our economy.  Deputy Corry also admitted that everything the farmer produces for the country as a whole is sold under cost price.  It has been stated several times that the farmers are getting subsidies for flour, bacon, butter and everything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not all going into the farmer's pocket.  Could butter be produced at 2/4 per lb.?  Is the subsidy not designed to keep the price of butter down?  The subsidies are going into the pockets of those in the towns and cities, and not to the farmers.  It is natural for the Government to give them, so that the general public can get these commodities at the cheap price, but it makes me sick to hear all these statements about farmers getting millions in respect of this subsidy and that subsidy.  They are not getting the subsidies.  They are given in order to reduce the price of the commodities the farmer produces so that the ordinary citizen can buy them.  If these subsidies were not given, could a farmer buy butter at 2/4 per lb.?  If these subsidies were not given to him, could he buy his flour at so much per stone? The people in the towns and cities would have to pay so much more, and what the farmer is getting for what he produces is not nearly the cost of production, even with the subsidies.  To say that we are getting great relief is entirely inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, to a farmer with ten men, the 4/- increase in wages represents over £104 per year and the reduction in my rates this year was £40.  I had to pay over £100 to my ten men and I get relief of £40.  Where is the <Col N="782" /> great relief there, seeing that I got the same for my produce as I got last year? The whole thing is a blind.  Deputy Corry enlightened me very much when he spoke of some great thing which is coming to the farmers.  It must be something great when it cooled Deputy Corry, in view of the spirit he was in. He admitted that the farmers were losing £400,000.</P>
    <P>This is no relief whatever.  It is a loss to the farmers and the Minister need not be bragging that it is a relief. You are given so much, but you have to pay twice as much.  You are only trying to blind the public by saying that they are getting so much.  Every Local Government Bill that is passed is just another baby passed on to the farmers.  Deputy de Valera talked about the valuations.  The valuations at present are unfair.  Farmers have to pay for the upkeep of the roads for the townsman, who only pays a few pounds in rates, to drive over.  A big business man in any local town may be making thousands of pounds a year, but his rates only amount to £10 or £15, his valuation being from £12 to £14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L. Walsh Mr. L. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not demand a revaluation Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our land is valued at £2 an acre and I think, if it were revalued, the valuation would be lower. There should be an increase in the valuations in the towns where there are shops making thousands of pounds a year, out of which only £15 is being paid in rates.  That is not fair.  A farmer has not got free medical attention. He has to pay for everything.  He cannot drive his horse and cart on the roads owing to the dangerous surface. He has to make a ten-mile round, otherwise his horse and cart would be broken up.  He contributes to the whole upkeep of the county and he is not given any services.  He cannot drive to Mass on Sunday because his pony would be injured and his trap broken up on the roads.  We on the county council tried to find a remedy for that but the law would not allow us.  The whole thing is unfair.  We are paying the rates and we are not getting any services.  A doctor living in the city may not be paying £10 in rates, <Col N="783" /> but he can drive his motor-car wherever he likes.  He is paying nothing towards the upkeep of the roads.  The whole system is wrong.</P>
      <P>There is some hope in what Deputy Corry says, that something new is coming.  I hope it will come.  Everything is being put on the rates.  Last year we were told that we would get a certain grant if we increased the estimate for the roads.  But, because we are in a turf-producing area, we are not able to spend the money estimated for the roads.  From 1st March to the 1st of September the roadmen were not available for work on the roads.  From 1st September they were engaged in harvesting operations.  The result is that turf-producing counties, so far as I can see, have no chance of spending the estimated amount on the roads. The non-turf producing counties can improve the roads with this grant they are getting, whereas the people who are producing the turf for the City of Dublin have no chance of doing that, because the roadmen were taken up with other things.  The Fianna Fáil Party brag about their social services. At present an old age pensioner has to live on 10/- a week.</P>

It grieves people to see some persons well off under the Fianna Fáil Government, while other people who are trying to live on 10/- a week are practically starving.  Some farmers in my district lost all their crops in the floods, yet the Government would not come to their help. They came to the help of the people in France and other countries, while some people in this country have not a potato to eat.  It is a shame and a disgrace to the Government that they did not come to the relief of those people who lost all they had in the floods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one general fallacy running through most of the speeches I heard, and that was that this Bill will provide for the derating, in some measure, of agricultural land.  That is what the Bill does not do.  Every acre of agricultural land will be fully rated.  But the Government, <Col N="784" /> or as Deputy de Valera in his forcible speech pointed out, the general taxpayer is going to pay the rates. Therefore, this Bill is not a concession to the point of view advocated in this House by Deputy Cogan and the members of the Clann na Talmhan Party.  It represents the considered policy of the Government that all property which is in the useful occupation of an owner should bear its fair proportion of the local charges.  It does happen that, by reason of circumstances, the Government feels that it must step in on behalf of the agricultural community and ask the general taxpayer to bear some part of these charges.  But the charges themselves are imposed and levied on the property, whether that property be land or buildings.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the suggestion which was made by Deputy Sheldon, who considered that, instead of approaching the problem in that straightforward way and upon the uniform basis that all property should bear its fair charge, we should have an arbitrary reduction in the valuation of agricultural land; whether that was land undervalued or overvalued, that we should have an arbitrary reduction in its value.  What would be the consequence of that?  Unless we had other ameliorative measures introduced, it would not mean that the present position would obtain whereby farmers get a definite and fixed relief.  But the immediate effect of Deputy Sheldon's suggestion would be merely to shift the rates from the land to the farmers' dwelling-houses, or, if not to the farmers' dwelling-houses solely, then to the dwelling-houses of everybody in the particular rating area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and also to all those buildings in the useful occupation of any person.  That is one of the great objections to derating agricultural land or derating property of any sort, that, when you derate it, you shift the burden to another type of property which it might be of a much greater social value to rate lightly rather than to rate more heavily.  The first consequence of <Col N="785" /> giving effect to the proposals of the Clann na Talmhan Party and of the Fine Gael Party, despite their past record in this matter, completely to derate agricultural land, or partially to derate it, as Deputy Sheldon has suggested, would be to discourage the provision by the farmers and those who could afford them of better houses for themselves and their families, and better buildings, even where the provision of these would be necessary and ancillary to their industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know it. At least, I am not aware that what I am saying is fallacious.  I believe it to be true.  Not only do I believe it to be true, but the Committee on Derating, which was set up by our predecessors when they were in office, came to the same conclusion.  I think their conclusions were sound and therefore, so far as we are concerned, in this measure, there is no concession whatever given to this mistaken demand for derating or partial derating of property of any sort in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheldon also made the suggestion that perhaps we could give some consideration to the position of the farmer who gives greater employment at one period of the year than he does at another.  I can say at once that that would be quite contrary to the purpose of the Bill or quite contrary to the purpose of the employment allowance.  The employment allowance is designed, so far as it can, to assist the farmer to give constant employment, where possible. If the exigencies of his industry require him, as they require persons engaged in other industries, to give a certain amount of seasonal employment, there is no cure for that and I am afraid that it would not be possible for me to concede anything to Deputy Sheldon's point of view in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes was mild in his criticism of the Bill.  Beyond reiterating the demand for derating of agricultural land, the only quarrel he seemed to have about the Bill was that under it we could not provide that Irish turkeys would be regarded as British turkeys <Col N="786" /> when they went to Great Britain.  In fact, he seemed rather to have a grievance that the Almighty had not decked out our birds in plumage of red, white and blue.  But, beyond that rather irrelevant criticism, he did not seem to have very much to say about the Bill.</P>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Cogan.  He seemed to be disappointed with the Bill because he had failed to persuade the Minister for Finance to accept the policy of the Farmers' Party in regard to the derating of agricultural land.  He did try to confuse the issue by saying that this Bill was a concession to that point of view.  I have already pointed out how fallacious that argument is, that, as I have said, under this Bill the land will carry its full rates but the payment of these rates will be allocated as between the general taxpayer on the one hand and the occupier of the land on the other.  But, even if Deputy Cogan's suggestion were correct, why should he blame me because he failed to be sufficiently persuasive when he was putting his case to the Minister?</P>
    <P>In Deputy Cogan's speech there was a very interesting and I think somewhat amusing revelation of the two faces which Clann na Talmhan wears. In criticising this Bill Deputy Cogan was rather ungenerous to the small farmer.  He decried the fact that under the Bill greater relief would be given to the man who had a small holding than would be given to the man who had a larger holding.  But while he is envious about the lot of the small farmer in this regard, he ought to remember that two of his colleagues, Deputy Cafferky and Deputy Commons, elsewhere have tried to make themselves out as the champions of the small farmer.  Surely, in equity, there is a case for giving greater relief to the small man.  It is a principle which is generally accepted by economists that the burden of taxation, whether national or local, should be proportioned to the taxpayer's capacity to bear it.  Surely it is undeniable that a farmer who has a holding of £20 valuation or under is in general less able to bear a cash impost, whether it is in the form of rates or taxes, than a man who has a more substantial property. We all know that taxation in <Col N="787" /> general tends to become regressive, that is to say, the burden tends to become proportionally heavier the less the capacity of the taxpayer is to bear it.  In most tax systems care is taken to ensure that those taxes which are definitely regressive, as most of the indirect taxes upon articles of food and clothing are, shall not constitute and shall not be made to produce an undue proportion of the revenue, whether it be the revenue of the State or of the local authority.  Furthermore, where the taxation is of that nature that it is imposed directly upon an individual, as say, the income-tax is, particular care is taken to exempt altogether from it those whose incomes are low and who, therefore, when the tax had been collected would not have sufficient left to provide for themselves or their families.  That is the principle to which we are giving effect, to a limited extent I grant you, here in this Bill, when we give an increased relief to the man whose land holding is of low valuation, and that is the principle to which Deputy Cogan objects.</P>
    <P>Clann na Talmhan has now taken up the stand that the poor man is to be taxed as heavily as the rich man, that the smallholder must pay as heavily in proportion as the large holder, and yet those are the people who down in Mayo&mdash;Deputies Cafferky, Commons and Blowick&mdash;are posing as the champions of the small landholder and the small farmer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, in his speech, also proceeded to say that in his view the tax upon property is an unsatisfactory method of providing for local revenues. I do not propose to go into that question at length, because this evening there are other very important measures to come before the House, in this debate.  We may have an opportunity on another occasion of dealing with that proposition.  But the general statements is so shallow that I cannot refrain from making one or two comments in regard to it.  We are told that a tax upon property is an unsatisfactory method of raising revenue because many rich people own little property and are not, therefore, called upon to bear heavy rates.  Income-tax is paid by comparatively few people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> It undoubtedly has many disadvantages, but I think it is generally agreed that it is one of the best ways in which revenue can be raised, provided, of course, that the taxation is fairly and equitably imposed and that by its magnitude it does not constitute an undue burden upon enterprise, does not tend to curb enterprise and to kill initiative.  Similarly, not everybody smokes; but I have not heard any person yet criticise a tax upon tobacco as a revenue-raising expedient merely on the ground that there are many rich people, and many recipients of large incomes, and owners of large fortunes, who do not smoke.  Neither have I heard it suggested that an entertainments tax&mdash;a tax on the cinema, for instance&mdash;is a bad tax merely because many people do not go to the cinema; nor have I heard it said that a tax upon beer and spirits is a bad tax because many people happen to be tee-totallers and, therefore, do not have to pay it.  The position in regard to rates is completely analogous to the position in regard to taxation generally.  It is quite true that there are many people who do not pay high rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that there is almost a complete analogy between the argument that rates are an unfair method of raising local revenue and the argument that income-tax should be dropped because not everybody pays income-tax; or that the tax on beer and spirits should be dropped because not everybody drinks, or that the tax on tobacco should be dropped because not everybody smokes.</P>
      <P>There was one point made by Deputy Coogan that this Bill gave no real relief to the farmer and that what the farmer really wants is a guaranteed price and a secure market.  The industrialist can equally say that he, too, wants a guaranteed price and a secure market.  It may be that a person, who is neither the owner of land nor the proprietor of an industry, will come along and say that what he wants is a guaranteed wage and a secure job. Everybody wants a guarantee in this world at the moment and everybody wants security.  What we are all railing against is that the Almighty, in His wisdom, did not see fit to provide us with any of these things, that He puts us here in a world where we are surrounded by vicissitudes and where we have to take the rough with the smooth and to depend upon our own judgment and initiative and our own hard work to give us that security which we are all demanding at the expense of somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only playing upon the gullibility of people to make a speech such as Deputy Coogan made here to-day.  This Bill does represent a general relief to the farming community.  As Deputy de Valera has pointed out, it is a relief which has to be provided in large measure by other members of the community. He did point out that the money which we are providing will be provided by the general taxpayer&mdash; that is to say, by the urban taxpayer as well as by the rural taxpayer.  I am not going to say to what extent the urban taxpayer will be able to shift part of his burden back again to the farmer, just as I am not going to say to what extent the farmer, as a producer, may be able to shift part of his burden as a general taxpayer back to <Col N="790" /> the consumer in the shape of the prices which the consumer must pay for his wheat, beet, butter, bacon and those other commodities which the farmer produces.  But it does appear to me, at any rate, that the land holder or land occupier will get a substantial relief which will be provided in the greater measure&mdash;I am putting it no further than that&mdash;by the urban population; and it would be much better for all of us as members of the community as a whole&mdash;even those that profess to speak for the agricultural community&mdash;to face up to that fact.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the agriculturists are not entitled to get that relief. We have done a great deal to develop industry here and to stimulate industrial enterprise.  As Deputy Corry pointed out, the farmer has paid for that in exactly the same way as we are asking those who have enjoyed in some measure the advantages of that protective industrial policy to give some relief now to the agriculturists.  It is a very moot question, and one which I think it would be difficult to determine, as to who pays for it in the end.  I take it that was the purpose of Deputy de Valera's speech.  In fact there are many people who believe it would be better for all of us if we could abolish this whole system of reliefs and subventions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In any event, there are a number who do believe that if we could abolish this system of reliefs and subventions and all the paraphernalia of administrative machinery and personnel, which inevitably goes with them, and try to simplify the whole structure, it would be much better.  Unfortunately that is not the trend of public opinion at the moment.  It may require a great deal of education before the wheel comes full circle and we get back to the stage at which it will be realised that the less governmental regulation we have, the less taxation and the less distribution from central resources, the better it will be for all of us.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1947, for certain Miscellaneous Expenses, including certain Grants-in-Aid and payments of Compensation for Death or Personal Injuries.</P>
      <P>The object of this Supplementary Estimate&mdash;as indicated in Part III&mdash;is to enable the cost of certain temporary professorships in the Irish Academy to be defrayed out of public funds.  The academy is already in receipt of an annual grant of £3,200 for general purposes and a special and terminable grant&mdash;amounting this year to £750&mdash; in connection with their publication of a dictionary of early Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new professorships in the academy are intended for certain distinguished foreign scholars who, for reasons arising out of the altered conditions on the Continent of Europe, are unable for the time being to resume their careers in their home countries. The professorships will, of course, be temporary and limited in number and the persons appointed will, where possible, be expected to give lectures which members of the public may attend.  I am satisfied that the arrangements will benefit the country both culturally and from the point <Col N="793" /> of view of international prestige and that the money which I am asking the Dáil to vote will be well spent.</P>
    <P>So far only one professorship&mdash;a professorship of mathematical logic&mdash;has been created, but other appointments may be made before the end of the financial year.  It is not possible to give a firm estimate of the total expenditure to be incurred by the end of March next, but the provision of £1,000 should be enough to cover any commitments falling to be met.  It would not be possible for the academy to meet the cost out of its existing resources.</P>

      <P>As a general principle I should imagine that there will not be many objections in this House to the passing of money for the purpose of securing the services of distinguished continental scholars, whatever the reasons may be that brought them here.  But the trouble in voting a Supplementary Estimate of this character is that we are not told that this money is designed to meet the expenses of the academy in providing for the scholarly work of Professor So-and-so.  We are told, generally, that distinguished scholars may turn up, that one is already here, the Rector of the University in Warsaw, and that another is under consideration.  I am not influenced, <Col N="794" /> I must say, in giving a blank cheque to the Government to provide public money for the employment of whomever they may, in their discretion, determine is a desirable person to employ, either through the medium of the academy or other learned institutions in this country, because their record in this matter has not been satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I remember when the legislation in connection with the establishment of the Institute of Higher Studies was before the House, we were assured (1) that it was not anticipated that the activities of that body would interfere with the activities of the university, (2) that the quality of work that the Institute of Higher Studies was expected to do was of such a character as to make it almost unreasonable to expect the university to undertake it as part of its normal work, and (3) that the personnel of the staff of that institute was going to consist exclusively of scholars of such rarefied distinction that there could be no doubt or question in the minds of any reasonable person as to the propriety of employing them.</P>
      <P>We began with a small group of very distinguished men as professors of that body.  We were not, however, very long under way until two of the most distinguished withdrew leaving after them two or three men of the highest distinction in their particular lines of study.  Then we were calmly informed, by an announcement which appeared in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or some such publication, that a whole miscellaneous collection of &ldquo;duds&rdquo; had been unloaded on the institute&mdash;I forget in what exact capacity.</P>

If this was a new departure, I would be inclined to say: &ldquo;All right.  We must depend on your prudence in choosing these scholars to choose the right men.&rdquo;  But my experience is that, in giving this discretion in the past to the Government, they have chosen recklessly and, I am sorry to say, have planted in this institute a number of men who have no more claim to scholarship than I have&mdash;in fact, far less, and I count myself as a very pedestrain country publican.  Beside some of the tulips who are now quartered on the institute, I am a scintillating star in the firmament of scholarship. I think some of the recent products, some of the recent publications, of the institute bear lamentable evidence of the decline of scholarship.</P>
      <P>Is this to be the standard by which foreign scholars are to be judged?  The Minister says of course that he knows of one person and that he is aware of only one other who is under consideration.

      <P>Will the Minister give us a guarantee that Dr. Mahr who is at present holding office, on leave of absence without pay, as Director of our Museum, is not coming back under this scheme?  Is he or any of his ilk going to come here under this scheme?  I should like a guarantee from the Minister on that point.  I suggest that, if he does get the money, he should at least give us the assurance that before any appointment is made to the academy or to any other like body, which is to be financed out of moneys of this character, the approval of this House will be sought for the foreign professor whom it is proposed to appoint.  Let me add this. Ordinarily I think nothing is more undesirable than that Dáil Éireann should interfere in the internal administration of a university, an academy or an institute in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that such learned bodies should be absolutely autonomous but when we are asked to furnish money to employ a miscellaneous collection of foreigners, we should be guaranteed against the possibility of giving, in advance, approval to the employment of individuals of whom we do not approve at all and an assurance that these moneys will be used only for the employment of such persons as the Polish scholar to whom the Minister has referred and to others who may <Col N="797" /> present themselves and who will be accepted on merit alone.  Given that assurance I have no objection to the Estimate though I view it with considerable misgivings for the very reason which the observations of the Ceann Comhairle have induced me to refer to it specifically.</P>

      <P>I have not asked the Dáil for a blank cheque.  I have proposed that the Dáil should vote a Supplementary Estimate of £1,000, a strictly limited sum, to add to the sum of about £3,200 which the academy, this learned institution, is already getting as a State grant for this purpose.  I have no right to interfere with the academy in the spending of this fund.  If I proposed to interfere with the academy in the spending of this fund, the person who would be the most loud-mouthed in denouncing me here would be Deputy Dillon.  I take it that if the gentleman who was in charge of the National Museum were to come back to Ireland to work, it would be in the Museum, and not in the academy, that he would work.  I have no brief for him.  I do not know whether he will ever come back to this country or not.  Deputy Dillon wants to take advantage of this Dáil to abuse everybody, right left and centre, to kick people who are down, but I say this for that gentleman, that he went towards the fighting, unlike Deputy Dillon.</P>

They may employ one other&mdash;I do not know&mdash;and they have the right, if they get this sum from the Dáil, to employ distinguished professors who drift in here from Europe and the circumstances in whose countries are such that they cannot reside there at present.

My amendments were designed in no way to impede the grant of these facilities to the bog workers, but to provide an alternative machinery by which these facilities would be made available.  I seek to preserve the balance, as it were, between the Ministry and private trade, and to give an opportunity to private trade to take up this business, if they see fit.  I am not endeavouring to exclude the Minister in any way.  I just want to give priority, if you like, to local traders, in the first instance, to apply, the trade generally after that, and then Bord na Móna, if the trade do not avail of the facilities.

These amendments obviously are Committee amendments.  They were not submitted on Committee.  The point in them was decided and they cannot now be moved on Report.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not met us to some extent in this Bill.  It may affect only a small section of the community or only a small section of the liquor trade.  Nevertheless, it introduces a principle and a precedent which, to my mind, are undesirable and in fact reprehensible. Under this Bill, the entire jurisdiction of the court is set aside and the Minister becomes the licensing authority.  He not only grants the licence, but he will renew the licence, and, in the case of death or removal of the licensee for any other cause, he will transfer the licence.  He will do all this without being obliged to consult anybody outside his own Department.  As I have said, he will do all this without being obliged to take the views of the police or the views of people who have objections to the licensing of canteens in remote areas.  He can transfer the licence to any named individual through his instrument, Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna is a statutory body set up under another measure passed by this House and it is a semi-State Department.  We get this position under this measure: that the State is now engaging indirectly in the liquor trade through Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that, when the Minister contemplated granting facilities of this kind to workers in bogs, he would have considered the legitimate claims of the local traders. I could instance cases where, as the result of the operations of workers on the bogs, in County Kildare for example, a considerable boom has taken place in local villages.  Take Rathangan or Robertstown, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incursion of bog workers has undoubtedly brought a boom to these villages, <Col N="802" /> a boom which these villages have not seen for 100 years.  Having regard to the experiences in Rathangan, Robertstown, and other centres, I thought the Minister would have allowed the local towns and villages and the traders in them to get the benefit of whatever local boom was going to take place.  But, instead of doing that, the Minister sets aside the local trade and he proposes to give the business either to Bord na Móna to do the job itself, or to Bord na Móna to sublet by contract to outsiders.  On either consideration, I have very strong objections to his doing so.  I think it is wrong, in particular, that a State enterprise, either directly or indirectly, should engage in a trade of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to put before the Minister is this.  You have in those local areas which I have mentioned quite a considerable boom.  As a result of that boom, local traders have not only been able to cater for the trade but they have been able, as the result of the prosperity now flowing from that trade, to improve their premises beyond all recognition from what they were before the bog workers came into the localities.  I have no doubt that, if the Minister approaches this problem in the same way in regard to the areas now about to be developed, a similar boom would have taken place and local traders would have been sufficiently enterprising to avail of that trade and to cater for it <Col N="803" /> fully and efficiently.  It seems to me that the Minister's Department made up their mind well in advance that private enterprise was to be excluded.</P>
      <P>I should like to put this viewpoint to the House.  As I said on the Second Reading, the only reason for this measure was that, because of the existing legislation, because of the statutory impediment imposed by the 1902 Act, it was not possible to go to the court to get a new licence.  A new licence can only be granted, ordinarily, where an increase in population of at least 25 per cent. has taken place in the locality.  There are other statutory conditions, such as the surrender of an existing licence, the character of the applicant, etc.  But the main consideration is this impediment of population.</P>
      <P>As I said, it would have been quite an easy matter to draft a short Bill empowering the local trader, or any trader for that matter, to apply to the court, despite all the impediments under the 1902 Act, for a new licence. In other words, all that the Minister and the draftsman had to do was to remove that impediment and enable the local trader to go to the court and get his certificate for the grant of a new licence.  But not only did the Minister not choose to do that but he went even further.</P>
      <P>Under our existing law, it is quite an easy matter for the bog workers to get the facilities they require on the bog. They may set up a club; they may apply for a club licence.  Under the existing law, men assembled in conditions of that kind would be entitled to get that licence.  Even though it may be a club licence, it would be of some benefit to the locality and to the local traders.  On these two grounds, it is clear to me that the Minister's Department made up their minds: &ldquo;We are going to cut out private trade altogether. We have no regard for private enterprise.  We will control these things ourselves.  We will go into the liquor trade.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if Bord na Móna employees are at all fitted for this trade; if they have any past experience of this trade; if they are the right type <Col N="804" /> of person to supervise licensed premises; if they can conduct licensed premises when the crowd gets disorderly. I know nothing of the type of person who will be appointed.  But, from the Minister's remarks, I know it will be either some wholesaler, the big fellow, or a camp manager who will be the licensee.  The camp manager may be a good man to control bog workers; he may be the wrong man to conduct licensed premises.  This measure is indicative of a further step towards State control of everything in this country and even though, as I have said, there is not a big trade interest involved, nevertheless, it is symptomatic of the present-day tendencies of the State and particularly of the bureaucrats who are running the State, to disregard all private interests and convert all business into State business.</P>
    <P>On this matter of State control and State interference, it has been said that State control grows large upon what it feeds, that its stature is that of stilts and its girth that of a bladder. Whether or not it is small or big business that is involved, I appeal to all Deputies to take a stand once and for all against this further encroachment by the State upon private enterprise.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that the Minister and his Party are committed to State enterprise, which may eventually lead to a form of nationalisation here.  If we set up a precedent and give our support to a principle of this kind, I have no doubt that the Minister and his colleagues will come along at a later stage, on some similar measure, and tell us that we have already subscribed to this principle.  We will be reminded that we have already established a precedent.  What is a fact to-day is going to be the doctrine of the Government Party to-morrow: &ldquo;Brush aside all obstacles and let nothing stand in our way.&rdquo;  It is quite clear that that is the viewpoint of the Minister's officials.  It is quite clear to my mind that they have decided that they would have too much trouble in going to the courts, that there would be delays, that they would have to make applications for renewals, that they would have to apply for interim transfers and to do a thousand and one things, and that they decided to sweep <Col N="805" /> it all aside and let the bureaucrat, behind his desk, grant the licence.</P>
    <P>The courts are excluded.  The Minister sets himself up now as an arbitrary licensing authority in respect of a number of these bogs and if we once accept that principle, there is no reason why his collegue, the Minister for Justice, should not come into the House and remind us that we have established a precedent and that, as Deputy Davin has already reminded us, we established a precedent in the case of the airports.  Again, these things, if they do not suit the particular circumstance of the occasion, will be treated as analogies and you eventually get to the position where private enterprise is put on one side and State enterprise encroaches all around.</P>
    <P>This tendency to centralise all control in the State means in effect control of everything from the centre and that the bureaucrat in Dublin will supervise the bog canteen in County Mayo or County Kerry.  If we do that in a simple matter of bogs, there is no reason why we cannot introduce the same principle into every Department of our social and economic life.  While that may be very desirable from the point of view of the bureaucrat, the gentleman who wants no trouble, the gentleman in Dublin who can scribble out a licence, a grant, a renewal or transfer, as the case may be, what of the people on the circumference of the circle?  What of the people who should be considered in relation to the expenditure of public moneys?  What of the people who, like our friends in Kildare, would like to get something of the local boom that is bound to ensue? The Minister might have considered these things and have given us a different measure.</P>
    <P>I doubt very much that Bord na Móna asked for these powers.  I doubt very much that, when this matter was first under consideration, Bord na Móna contemplated excluding the jurisdiction of the courts.  All I sought in my amendments was simply that the local trader, in the first instance, the trade generally, in the second instance, would have the opportunity of putting in for this business.  If the local trader <Col N="806" /> or the trade generally&mdash;and by that I mean the retail rather than the whole sale trade&mdash;did not avail of the opportunity, then I was leaving the door open for the Minister, through Bord na Móna to come in.  That is all I sought, that these people would have priority and, if they failed to take advantage of the opportunity, Bord na Móna could step in.  My amendments were designed on those lines.</P>
    <P>The argument the Minister put up is that by doing anything of that kind you would be likely to create a property in your licence which might pass on to your children or to your family, that you might create a property which might be saleable in the open market. I endeavoured to stop that by a further amendment and to give the Minister the right to nominate a person to carry on the business when a licence would lapse by reason of death or for any other cause.  I gave the Minister the right to nominate a person to conduct that business until, again, the local trader could come in and apply for the grant of a new licence.  That is all I sought to do in the amendment and I consider that I was perfectly reasonable in seeking to give the benefit of whatever business is going to the local traders.  I was not seeking to do any more than the Minister is seeking to do for himself and for Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I do want to emphasise that, even excluding the trade, the Minister could have done this in another way.  He could have provided the premises and have given an opportunity to the bog workers to register a club and seek the facilities for themselves and let the bog workers then have the benefit of that trade and let the profits of that trade go to a benevolent fund or any other fund to which the bog workers might wish to contribute the profits.  But that was swept aside.  It is quite legal under existing legislation without any new measure.  All the Minister had to do was to give the building.  Under this measure the Minister or Bord na Móna go into the liquor business and, as far as I know, they mean to make a profit but they will not say where the profits will go.  The Minister said, I think, that he would be prepared to consider devoting the profits to the benevolent fund but he did not tie himself down. <Col N="807" /> He did not give a definite assurance to the House that the profits would go to the benefit of the workers.  In the Army or the police, the profits of the canteens are devoted entirely to benevolent purposes, and if the Minister is going into the business, through Bord na Móna, I ask him to give the profits of that catering and licensed business to a benevolent fund or any other fund the workers may indicate. I do not think there is much more I have to say upon this matter except to say that I would again emphasise that this is yet another attempt by the bureaucratic State mentality to impose State control over everything.  I do not know where the Minister is going to get his supplies.  The extraordinary thing is that if an ordinary citizen&mdash; say, for instance, an Army man demobbed after his service during the emergency wants to go into this particular business he cannot get supplies unless the premises which he buys has already had a quota and a quota as at a certain date.  Here, you have the Minister going into a business apparently assured of supplies.  In the case of hotels, under another measure, the new proprietor is assured of supplies; but no man discharged from the Army, who wants to set up in any kind of business in this country, can get a quota unless a quota was in existence hitherto.  I would ask the House to endorse what I say.  When a State business of this kind comes into a locality, by reason of State enterprise, then the private trader and the private individual should have priority in whatever business will flow from such enterprise rather than that it should be grabbed by the State.</P>

      <P>I think they are entitled to facilities within a reasonable distance of wherever they are carrying out their work, especially when they are obliged to live under camp conditions. Is Deputy Coogan aware that some of the turf workers' camps are four or five miles from the nearest town?  From my limited knowledge of what goes on I think it is most desirable that the turf workers should be supplied with refreshments on the spot. Milk and ginger beer are at present provided; so is food.</P>

      <P>I know that.  I think the manager of the canteen should be in a position to supply refreshments.  But there should be some obligation placed upon him to ensure that the workers would not have unlimited refreshments because that would interfere with their production.  No licensed trader lives in the vicinity of Clonsast Camp.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I see nothing wrong in giving a licence to the canteen manager. If a profit is to be made by the canteen manager I think that any such profit should be set aside for a benevolent fund in the same way as you have an Army benevolent fund or a Gárda benevolent fund at the present time. If a licence were given to a canteen manager in a camp situated in close proximity to a town that might interfere in some measure with existing licensed traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no interest whatever in the licensed traders in my constituency, but I do know that in Edenderry a licence issued to the turf camp manager there would interfere with <Col N="809" /> the licensed traders in the town.  I do not know what the Minister's intentions are in a case of that kind. There is nothing radically wrong in giving licences to Bord na Móna and permitting the canteen manager to provide reasonable facilities in camps situated a long distance from a town.</P>
    <P>I have listened to a number of people talking about the danger involved in the procedure laid down in this Bill.  I took the opportunity of pointing out to some interested parties that no objection was taken when the Minister proposed to grant licences in the case of airports.  This is merely an extension of an existing practice.  I do not believe for a moment that in Deputy Coogan's lifetime we are going to see the nationalisation of public houses in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the present proposal is quite good under the circumstances.  Like Deputy Davin, I do not think that the turf workers should suffer under an inconvenience that does not apply to other sections of the community.  Reference has been made to the facilities given to airports, to newly established hotels, and to guest houses either for the entire year or for a specific season.  In the case of the turf workers the camps were established under Government auspices.  Having brought about an influx of people because of the industrial development of our bogs, which the State has to subsidise substantially or to underwrite, it naturally followed that catering facilities had to be provided for the workers.  I might point out that there was no possibility of any scheme of turf development being undertaken by private enterprise or, if undertaken, being carried out successfully.  I have heard no suggestion that the catering now carried out by Bord na Móna would have been better done by private enterprise.  I do not know if any representations were made by the catering section of the community that their rights were being infringed in this respect.  I think there is no justification for depriving these camps of the facilities ordinarily available to other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan says that it is an interference with existing publicans <Col N="810" /> and those in the catering business.  I do not agree.  The publicans to whom he refers have had their licences long before the bogs were developed.  These licences are based on population.  No doubt they have received some benefit from the camps and no doubt they will continue to do so.  We are considering here the proper facilities which we should afford to our workers and not the facilities that are to be afforded in the form of financial gain to those engaged in existing businesses.  On that basis it is hardly justifiable to argue that licensing facilities should be withheld from our camps and from our bog workers when those facilities are freely available to every other section of the community.</P>
    <P>If it were possible to increase the business of those engaged in trade that would, no doubt, be very excellent and, in small towns, a necessary thing. Should not our first consideration be the provision of facilities for workers rather than for those engaged in the liquor trade?  In my opinion, facilities should be made available for bog workers, in view of the fact that facilities have not been offered by local licensed traders.  It has been suggested that the profits should be given to a benevolent fund.  I cannot see how the two statements can be reconciled. It is not suggested that anything less than the ordinary would be charged, or that there would be any profit to hand over to the benevolent fund.  If the argument is that the profits made in this business should be handed over to a benevolent fund, clearly the way to accomplish that is not to hand the trade over to those engaged in the licensed trade.  I do not follow the reasoning of Deputy Coogan in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a teetotaller. I have substantial interests in public houses.  Is there nobody in this House except myself to deal with the question of providing beer, wine and spirits for consumption in places remote from the nearest town?  Apparently there is going to be a surfeit of amusement or distraction for those interested at the end of the working day until they go to bed.  If you take 120 fellows, and if most of them would sooner be on the <i>seachrain</i> than at home, which is <Col N="811" /> evidenced by the fact that they are gone to the bogs, and plant them down with beer, wine and spirits there to the limit of their capacity, what are they going to do?  I put that point for consideration by any Deputy who knows the kind of boy who would prefer to go to the bog rather than work at home with neighbouring farmers. Would he be easier in his mind if he heard there was no beer in the camp?</P>
      <P>I have no objection to having a comfortable canteen for men where they can get a good nourishing meal at a cheap price.  I wish to see them able to get refreshments.  I do not think beer, wine, spirits or lemonade was mentioned.  This is a Bill to abolish the provision of milk or lemonade.  It is a Bill to make certain that anyone who would sooner have something else than milk or lemonade will have an abundant supply of it at hand.</P>

      <P>Milk will have pretty formidable competitors.  I would not like to be puritanical.  Suppose we heard on the authority of University College that undergraduates opened a kiosk in the main hall, where students could get beer, wine and spirits as long as they had money to spend, would we not think that a very odd arrangement?  In both cases those concerned are boys. Neither of them are ancient, and neither are overburdened with prudence or wisdom.  I do not think, even in regard to young men of 18, 19 or 21, it is any part of the duty of this House to be maternalistic, and be legislating to make them good.  There is a far cry between making people good and going out of the way with temptation.  It seems to me to be a reasonable kind of maternalism for any young chap away from home, faced with the possibility of the boredom and tedium of a long evening, to leave the situation as it is, so that if such a person wants to go and get a drink there will be that check upon his inclination, that to get it will involve a walk of two or three miles.</P>

What shall we do suppose we find that a substantial number of these young fellows instead of saving their money are spending all they can earn on beer, wine and spirits?

      <P>Does the Deputy approve of it?  He smiles nonchalantly; he will not say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and he will not say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I shall vote against this Bill if there is a division challenged on it because from my experience of my fellow-men&mdash;and I am not confining myself to workers&mdash;I know that if you gather a group of men together in a given place and require them to stay there to endure a considerable measure of tedium, and put beer, wines and spirits in their midst <Col N="813" /> to the limits of their pockets' capacity to pay, it is only natural to expect that these workers will bring home less of their money to their wives and to their dependents.  It is not only turf workers who will try to relieve the tedium by having recourse to stimulants of an alcoholic character and to drink more than is consonant with prudence. Deputies in this House know well what I mean.</P>
      <P>I think that we should provide on the bog, in so far as it is necessary to keep men there at all while alternative supplies of fuel are scarce, good food and such other provender as working men may require to maintain strength and health, and that these things should be provided on the most advantageous terms we can contrive. I believe that if persons employed there or anywhere else want alcoholic refreshments it would be much better that they should go to the nearest licensed premises and there consume, in the company of their neighbours or strangers whom they meet there, such beverages as they choose to call for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose that logically one could build up a case for imposing on such persons the necessity of walking a distance to a public house before they get drink.  I doubt if there is a single practical Deputy in the House who does not know that if there is an open pub. in every turf camp, a lot of young fellows will get drink, and take drink, who would never think of taking drink had they to walk three or four miles to get it.  It is very easy to speak here in lofty detachment, but the plain fact is that there is no Deputy who has not seen the tragedy of a young fellow going off to England or to work elsewhere where he has got into bad company as a result of excessive indulgence in alcohol.  The family who has to deal with a boy of that kind when he returns home has a very unhappy tragedy on their hands.  I think this House ought to scruple before they put temptation under the very hands of these boys.  I am not suggesting to the House that we have any duty to control them.  We have neither a right nor a duty to control them so long as their conduct conforms to the existing laws but we have, it seems to <Col N="814" /> me, an obligation not to put temptation in their way.  I am saying that with due deliberation, as a person who is not a teetotaller himself, and a person who has 20 years' experience of the licensed trade.  Is there any Deputy in this House with that kind of experience who is not in his heart in substantial agreement with me?  If there is, it astonishes me.  I never knew a young fellow to be improved by having beer, wines and spirits brought to his door. I never knew a young fellow harmed by his keeping away from them.</P>
    <P>Why should we be the means of inviting these young fellows to make the acquaintance, if not to become the familiar friends, of alcohol, when but for what we propose to do under this Bill these boys might never make its acquaintance at all?  Is there any Deputy who would not be happier to know that his 21-years-old boy was a teetotaller rather than that he habitually consumed alcohol?  Is there a single countryman of our acquaintance, knowing that his daughter is about to marry, who would not be relieved in his heart to know that her suitor is a teetotaller? Is there any Deputy who says that any young fellow was prudent in abandoning total abstinence for moderate or immoderate drinking? There are many, I admit, who, adhering stictly to moderation all their lives, have suffered no evil consequences, but how very many all of us know who, having been brought into close contact with alcohol, have wrecked not only their own lives but the lives of those closest to them?</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by saying this: I am not asking the House to undertake the duty of making anybody good, of making anybody sober or of making anybody wise.  All I am saying is that, if my vote will help, I will do what in me lies not to place under the very hand of these boys the kind of temptation that I would not like anyone to have put under my hand when I was their age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can quarrel with what Deputy Dillon has said, so far as putting temptation under the hand of young people engaged on turf work is concerned, but I think it is a <Col N="815" /> nice question whether those who are afforded facilities in a canteen have, in fact, less temptation, although the canteen is quite convenient to them or just outside their doors, than those who are obliged, if they wish to secure drink, to go three or four miles for it. I have some experience of the facilities which were provided in Army canteens, and I cannot remember a single occasion on which I saw a person under the influence of drink who had obtained that drink in an Army canteen.</P>
      <P>I shall come in a moment to the desirability or otherwise of the proposed procedure under this Bill, but I imagine that if the facilities intended to be provided are provided, they would be something similar to those provided in Army canteens.  These canteens were run by a particular firm which had the contract.  The price charged for liquor was lower than that which normally prevailed and the canteens were open at certain times.  That being so, those who wanted to avail of the facilities could do so at certain times and those who wished to avail of them in excess could not do so, unless they were unusually fast drinkers.  The facilities being there, however&mdash;and only beer and stout were provided&mdash;I think that far less temptation was put in the way of the soldiers than was the case when they had to leave barracks or camp and go to the local public house.  That is my experience.</P>
      <P>The situation further was that, if a person by any chance did drink to excess in the canteen, he had not very far to go before reaching his billet or camp.  If, on the other hand, a person is forced to go a distance and drinks to excess, he encounters all kinds of danger on the way home, and not only is he a danger to himself but he is a danger to others.  I need not elaborate on that, but my experience is that if soldiers were forced to go, or if they went, to a public house a mile or two miles away, invariably, at some time or another, there was trouble, either because complaints came in from local people who were molested or interfered with, or someone in the camp was obliged to bring back some of these men who could not get back under their own steam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> While it is not possible, and certainly not desirable, that we should try to legislate to make people good, it is a very moot question whether, if these facilities are provided close to where the men work or close to the camp, if there is proper regulation and if the canteen is open only for a short time&mdash; say, from 12 to 2; from 4 to 6; and again from 7 to 10 p.m.&mdash;it was under some such arrangement most Army canteens were run&mdash;and if these hours are adhered to, the temptation will be any greater.  So far as my experience goes, you will have a larger preponderance of young men in an Army barracks or camp than in a turf camp.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Dillon, one would get the impression that those employed at turf work are all boys.  I cannot speak from very close experience, but, having gone through some of these camps and having been in close proximity to some of them, I can say that there are people there from 18 to 60 years of age.  Most of them are from 25 to 35 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Army, on the other hand, particularly in the early days of the emergency, very many were between 18&mdash;and maybe 17, if they succeeded in getting in&mdash;and 21 and 22.  If these canteens are established, they should be controlled in the same manner as canteens established in certain barracks and camps by the Mountjoy Brewery, which ran them for the Army.  If they are run on the same lines, there will be less danger than there would be by not providing the facilities, because the workers will be obliged then to go further for their drinking facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy propose the exclusion of spirits?  I think that would be a very good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No spirits were sold in any of these canteens.  Only beer and stout were supplied, and they were sold at prices cheaper than the trade prices and, so far as I know, the funds which the canteen collected were devoted to charitable or welfare purposes. Whether it will be possible to <Col N="817" /> get people to provide these facilities under these terms or not, I cannot say, but I suggest that it is desirable that stout and beer should be the only types of liquor provided.  On the other hand, I suppose we cannot object if a person wants to drink spirits and will drink only spirits, and in that case he will go to the nearest public house.</P>
      <P>While everyone here wishes to see that workers in these camps are provided with comfortable and suitable surroundings, and some facilities which will render life tolerable under the rather unusual conditions, what I object to in the Bill is the fact that the method adopted is a departure, and a very grave departure, from the ordinary procedure in licensing cases. It may be said that the system under which licences have been granted in the circuit and district courts is not sacrosanct.  That may be so.  Any system may be built up from experience or decided on at some stage in an arbitrary fashion, but the system which has developed in this respect is one which, so far as my experience of it goes, can be commended.  First of all, if there are a number of applicants, they will be considered and, if there are objectors, the objections will also be considered.  In addition, the Gárda are in a position to give evidence as to the suitability of applicants and of the premises.  While it is an easy matter to provide suitable premises for a canteen, it will not be quite such a simple matter for the Gárda to see that the law is strictly complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed procedure under the Bill gives the Minister directly a monopoly.  I hate to think of the Minister at the same time as I think of M. Molotov.  But, when one reads the pronouncements of M. Molotov, they can be put into the same category. M. Molotov says they are all in favour of peace and have no totalitarian ideas. They are all in favour of disarmament, yet they are preparing for war.  They are not reducing their army, if they are not building it up.  They are all the time most unreasonable.  The Minister, on numerous occasions, praised private enterprise and said that he was in favour of it.  But, practically all the time, the Minister introduces provisions <Col N="818" /> in Bills here which prohibit private business getting under way.  So far as the Minister and M. Molotov are concerned in that respect, I think there is a similarity.</P>
    <P>I think the ordinary procedure should be adhered to.  In this Bill, power is given to the Minister to give a monopoly to someone.  If this monopoly is to be given under the same terms as the canteens which were run for the Army, then the monopoly is not a very great one, and I do not think anyone could object to it, except that it prevents the ordinary licensed traders in the district, or other traders who are anxious to start, applying for these facilities.  Under the Bill, the Minister can pick any person he wants and that person will then have a monopoly.  I suggest that the Minister, at any rate, should consider bringing in an amendment which would allow tenders to be made for the position of canteen manager or canteen owner.  I remember one case in which a person who had got a contract from the Turf Development Board, which was the predecessor of Bord na Móna, said that out of one contract alone he made a clear profit of £12,000.  That case may be an exception. But it is an example.  I would be loath to think that any person who was granted a monopoly, or a contract, as it will be in this case, could make such a profit without everyone else being afforded an equal opportunity for tendering for the contract.  I suggest to the Minister that in this case tenders should be invited before any contract is given.  I object to the procedure adopted in the Bill, and I suggest to the Minister, if he will not consider amending it, that, at any rate, he should consider allowing people to tender before any contracts are granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported this Bill on its introduction and during the subsequent stages.  I disagree entirely with the suggestion made by some Deputies that this is an attempt to nationalise this branch of industry.  I think the fears on that score are quite unjustified and do not arise as a result of any experience, either of this industry or of others.  I think even Deputy Davin will agree with me that the <Col N="819" /> nationalisation of the liquor industry in this country will never be suggested by this Government or any subsequent Government for the next 40 or 50 years, at any rate.  I have always been a constant and consistent supporter of private enterprise.  I agree, of course, that there are certain industries which would bear nationalisation.  However, I have sufficient confidence in my fellow countrymen to feel that there will be no attempt made to nationalise this industry and that these fears which have been given expression to to-night are without any foundation in fact.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced, I felt that bog workers were entitled to get the same facilities as are granted to workers in the towns and cities. The fact that canteens will be established on the bogs does not indicate to me, or to anybody coversant with the lives of persons in the rural areas and in remote areas, that they will be an inducement to these persons to get intoxicated. I do not share the fear given expression to by Deputy Dillon that this will be an extra temptation put in the way of these young men. My experience of these canteens&mdash;and I have been in a few&mdash;is that I have never seen a case of drunkenness in any one of them.  On the contrary, I have seen more discipline exercised in these canteens than you will see exercised in any of the public houses.  Therefore, I think a lot of time has been wasted in expressing fears that these canteens will lead to more drinking and, eventually, to drunkenness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remoteness of some of these bogs from towns and villages has not been exaggerated.  One Deputy stated that five or six miles was about the average distance of some of these bogs from the nearest licensed premises.  I know cases where members of the Construction Corps, and other members of the Army had to walk five or six miles to get refreshments on week days and holidays. If these people had a canteen on the bog, it would give them the facilities which are enjoyed by some of their civilian brother in the cities and towns.  I cannot see any analogy between an undergraduate attending a university and a man working on a <Col N="820" /> bog.  The man on the bog has to put a lot of physical energy into his work and, at the end of his day's work, he is not very much attracted to a bottle of lemonade; he would much prefer a pint of stout or porter.  It is not very fashionable to give expression to these views.  But some people outside who hold up their hands in horror at a bog worker being given facilities for getting a drink on Sundays and other days, can themselves go into clubs and other places and consume all the drink they require.</P>
    <P>With regard to the profits that may arise in the establishment of these canteens, I have the feeling and also the hope that the Minister, with the experience he has behind him in this matter, will see to it that any profits will be devoted to a benevolent fund.</P>
    <P>There is an Army benevolent fund to which, I understand, a good deal of the profits from Army canteens are devoted.  If the profits made out of the bog canteens were put into a benevolent fund, so much the better, and it would have the benediction of the general public.  Deputy Cosgrave referred a moment ago to the desirability of inviting contracts.  I would be in partial agreement with that suggestion but, if there is a question of excess profits, the books of the civil contractor should be available and profits over a certain amount should be put back into the benevolent fund.</P>
    <P>However, this is not a case so much for private enterprise as it is for State enterprise.  The objection has been made that it would be the initial step towards nationalisation of various industries.  I do not believe a word of that.  The fear is quite unjustifiable.  I have every hope that these canteens will be a success and I do hope that the Minister will put them into the hands of trained personnel.</P>

      <P>I, as a worker, am glad that the Minister is providing facilities so that the workers may get refreshments. Men who are sent to the bogs from my constituency have told me that on a summer evening they would have to walk three or four miles if they wanted a pint.  Some of these men live for a pint.  Some of them would have <Col N="821" /> a pint in preference to their tea.  I have had experience of working in England and Scotland in camps where canteens were operated.  I know that in cases where there was no canteen men lost their lives by going along a railway to the nearest village and being knocked down by a train.  In England and Scotland there is a canteen on the job.  There is no such thing as men going mad.  Any man who has to work hard needs a drink.  There is not much nourishment in a bottle of minerals.  I cannot see why there should be opposition to a canteen being provided for 400 or 500 workers when there was no opposition when bars were being provided at the airports for people who had only to get into a plane.  There was a great deal of opposition by some Deputies to-day to the provision of canteens for turf workers.</P>
      <P>We all know that the bogs are situated in isolated parts and the nearest public house may be three or four miles away.  We all know, for instance, that dockers would not be able to keep going were it not for the drink they get.  Men working on the bogs are working on a piece rate.  Perhaps Deputy Dillon has at the back of his mind that some of the bog workers around his area might drop into his own public house and that he might lose their custom if canteens were established.  I am glad that this provision is being made and I do not think there is any need for alarm about the worker going mad if he gets a few drinks.  That does not happen.  There is a bar in the Dáil and there is no opposition to that.</P>

      <P>I think it is desirable to make it clear what this Bill is intended to achieve.  Its purpose is to permit Bord na Móna to operate what <Col N="822" /> are called wet canteens in turf camps in isolated areas.  Deputy Coogan talked about interference with local traders.  I tried to make it clear when introducing the Bill that if there is a local trader providing reasonable facilities for the persons resident in the camp, within reasonable distance of the camp, no licence will be issued to the camp manager under this Bill to operate a canteen in the camp premises.  I am sure, however, that the members of the Dáil fully appreciate that by their nature turf camps are as a rule removed from centres of population. That is not universally true.  There is a camp in Newbridge.  There is a camp at Edenderry, and some of the existing camps established during the emergency are within easy reach of towns and villages.  Where that is the case, no licence would be granted.  But the bogs to be developed under the machine-turf scheme, which were set out in the White Paper circulated to the Dáil, are in many cases remote from towns and villages and it is very likely that no facilities of any kind will exist in the localities where the camps are established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are camps established in these areas, it is desirable that the Turf Board, which will be providing in these camps recreational facilities as well as canteen facilities, should be permitted to undertake the sale of beer.  It is their intention, I understand, to permit the sale of beer only in their camps.  If I understood Deputy Coogan properly, he objects to that system and wants to substitute for it one by which the sale of drink in the turf camps will be undertaken by private traders.  I would strongly object to any such system.  If there is to be established at these camps canteen facilities for the sale of drink.  it should, I think, be done by the camp authorities and not by private traders. The private trader in such circumstances, in any circumstances, would be concerned only to sell as much drink as possible and make as much money as he could out of the business. The camp authorities will be mainly concerned to give reasonable recreational facilities to their men and to ensure that the conduct of the camp is properly supervised and that no unsatisfactory <Col N="823" /> features will result from the provision of the facilities.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to give these licences on a contract basis.  The intention is that the official of Bord na Móna employed as camp superintendent or as canteen manager will be given the licence <i>ex officio.</i>  He will hold that licence so long as he is employed in that capacity by the board.  If he ceases to be employed by the board in that capacity he will lose the licence.  He will have no property in it.  There is no intention of permitting him to make any profit out of it.  He will be employed for that purpose by the board at a salary.  It is extremely unlikely that there will be any profit.  The board does not make any profit from the provision of hostel and canteen facilities at its existing camps, quite the reverse.  All the accommodation provided there, the board and lodging and recreational facilities, are provided at substantially less than cost price.  I think, in any circumstances, the board would be quite happy if they recovered their costs in the operation of the services for their workers.</P>
    <P>Clearly, however, it is undesirable that there should exist any private property in the right to sell drink in these camps and it is for that reason that this Bill is so framed as to make it clear that the licence given to the board official to operate a canteen can be withdrawn at any time for any reason and will be withdrawn if he ceases to hold that particular position in the board's organisation.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to stress that there is no intention behind this Bill of interfering with private enterprise in the licensed trade.  This is no more interference with private enterprise than is the sale of drink on a dining-car by the railway company an interference with the licensing trade. The structure of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts requires that there should be a licensee.  It would be a simple matter to frame this Bill to permit the board to operate wet canteens at their camps; but as it is intended that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will form part of the whole licensing code, it is necessary to have a licensee and the <Col N="824" /> sole purpose of the Bill is to enable a licence to be given not by the procedure laid down under the Acts but by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to an official of the board who will, in fact, be in charge of the canteen arrangements.  If we followed the procedure of the Licensing Acts we would be creating a property in the licence and operating these canteens upon a profit-making basis&mdash;that is to say, a private profit-making basis&mdash; which is certainly not intended.  If, however, there do exist in the vicinity of the camp reasonable facilities provided by private interests then a licence will not be given.  I have said that before, and I want to make it quite clear now.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything in the arguments advanced by Deputy Dillon.  I think the few common-sense remarks made by Deputy Cosgrave adequately disposed of them.  It may be that people should not take beer after their day's work; or it may be that some people hold that view, but I see no reason why facilities to obtain refreshments of that kind should be denied in some camps when they are available in others.  If the camp is in the vicinity of a town the facilities are there.  If it is not in the vicinity of a town, then it is considered desirable that facilities should be provided.  In the view of the board it will make not merely for contentment amongst employees in the camp but will also facilitate the recruitment of workers for this work.</P>
    <P>This is a very simple Bill and at one time I thought that it would go through the Dáil with very little discussion.  I find, however, that any Bill which reacts upon the licensing trade always promotes the maximum amount of discussion. I want to repeat that the sole purpose of this Bill is to facilitate Bord na Móna in providing wet canteen facilities at isolated camps in turf areas where such facilities have not been provided up to this by private traders.  I indicated my personal view that the absence of such facilities within a radius of two miles of the camp would justify the granting of a licence under this Bill.  I would regard it as an unnecessary hardship to require <Col N="825" /> workers to walk a greater distance than that after the very strenuous work in which they are engaged on the bogs during the day.  I think there is a great deal of common sense in the view put forward by Deputy Cosgrave as to the wisdom of not requiring them to do so.</P>

The board have informed me that it is their intention to permit the sale of beer only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 4, on the Second Reading the Minister explained to the House that the purpose of the measure was to enable the company to carry out certain investigations regarding the possibility of manufacturing certain chemicals here.  I was rather dubious about the proposal because of the record of this company and the promises that were made by the Minister when this company was set up. The Minister stated definitely that the company would produce industrial alcohol at 1/9 per gallon.  So far as I know, they never were able at any time to produce alcohol at less than 3/6 a gallon; recently, in fact, the price of industrial alcohol has risen to 7/6 a gallon.  When we remember that industrial alcohol has only two-thirds the propulsion power of petrol and that petrol can be bought at 8.9d. per gallon, we can draw our own conclusions.  In the extension of powers the Minister suggested that one particular chemical was contemplated which might be produced here, namely, sulphate of ammonia.  The Minister has made no attempt to convince the House as to the possibilities of producing sulphate of ammonia here at an economic price. I am concerned with the proposal from the agricultural point of view.  Any man who has any experience of agriculture realises the very narrow margin that accrues to the primary producer if we are to have an exportable surplus and if we are to export that surplus in competition with countries able to produce under more favourable conditions and who can get the raw material necessary for production much more cheaply than a similar article produced here.  A higher price than the price of the imported article would be a serious handicap. I am not opposed to producing sulphate of ammonia here if it can be produced at a comparable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am vigorously opposed to any project which will increase the price of raw material to the agriculturist.  We discussed this matter before and the Minister quibbled with me in relation to the tariff on superphosphates.  I did not advert on that occasion to how <Col N="827" /> carefully he put in Great Britain at that discussion; subsequently I looked at the report on the importation of superphosphates from Great Britain and I discovered that we have never imported phosphates from Great Britain.  In the past I have imported large quantities of Belgian phosphate myself, equal to the best manufactured here or in Great Britain.  The Minister misrepresented me when he said that I was opposed to the manufacture of superphosphate here.  Before ever his tariff was put on superphosphate was manufactured here in competition with Belgian superphosphate.  I remember after the last war when continental superphosphate was allowed in here the home manufacturers had to sit up and do their job; in a year or two they were able to sell in competition with continental imports.  The Minister's quibbling is not to his credit.  I looked up, too, the customs list and on page 96 of the 1938 Customs and Excise Tariff List, reference No. 245, &ldquo;superphosphate, ground mineral phosphates and compound manures ad valorem 20 per cent.&rdquo;, and then there is a preferential &ldquo;United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, free.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have not been very long on the matter and I am just on the point of finishing.  We did provide a subsidy here which was supposed to help the agricultural community, but the entire subsidy went to the manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sulphate of ammonia is a very important raw material for agriculture. The Minister has not attempted to give any idea of how it can be produced here, so as to give that essential raw material to the agricultural community at a competitive price.  If an examination is to be made, an independent commission ought to be set up <Col N="828" /> to investigate the matter.  If this company is to manufacture sulphate of ammonia, it ought to give evidence and show its capacity to do so, by convincing an independent commission as to the possibility of the project.</P>
    <P>Here is a State board, manned by a group of men drawing salaries.  It is a nominal company in which they have no shares, but administering with funds provided by this House.  The men on that board will be anxious to keep their jobs, and whether it is an economic proposition for this country or not, they are not going to say whether it is wise of this country to launch this company into the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia.  The Minister finished his speech with a challenge.  He defended the wisdom of starting this industrial alcohol company, and wound up by saying that it could be possible that the Government would decide for one or the other and see if it would be better business to turn them into some other form of production.  I venture to say the decision has been already made. The Minister wants to save his face. He is turning this company over to other interests.  He is going to burden the raw material of our primary industry by making it pay a higher price than British or North of Ireland farmers have to pay.  I could not support Section 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I charge that the Minister, when making a case for Section 4, for the extension of the powers of this company, made three catagorical statements which are not true&mdash;plain and unadorned&mdash;are not true.  In the first of these statements he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is very important to get these fertilisers lest an emergency should come upon the country similar to that through which we have passed. In the emergency which has passed it was a comforting thing to know that if the supply of petrol dried up, we had the means, through the industrial alcohol factories, of providing a substitute power fuel which would have taken its place.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement is not true.  Industrial alcohol will not drive an internal combustion engine under any circumstances and the Minister must know that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the proposal to extend the functions of the factory.  What the Minister may have referred to was that it was possible to manufacture what is called naphtha which, I believe, is manufactured from tar, which could be got by a further process of distillation of industrial alcohol, and a combination of straight industrial alcohol with ether.  Such a proportion would cost £1 a gallon at least.  He knows that it is not a substitute for petrol, and that it could not be used as a sufficient quantity could not be got to carry out the second distillation process to make it worth while.  Therefore, that ground for extending the powers of the company falls to the ground.  The second statement of the Minister which I declare to be not true is set out in column 538, where he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the beginning of the war arrangements were speedily completed for the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia, and to undertake the manufacture of that commodity in this country, and it was only the advent of the war that prevented this scheme being carried to completion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I refer the House to Vol. 29 of the Official Debates, cols. 925-926, where the Minister for Agriculture stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have a confession to make to Deputy Dillon and others, and it is that only for me we could have had any amount of nitrogen during the war.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce had a proposal submitted to him prior to the war by an outside firm to set up here a plant for the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia. They were prepared to guarantee that the price would not exceed 10 per cent. over the price of sulphate of ammonia manufactured in Great Britain.  I, as Minister for Agriculture, held that even 10 per cent. was too big a margin, and that it should be sold at a price no higher than that of sulphate of ammonia manufactured in Great Britain, and because of this attitude of mine the <Col N="830" /> firm concerned would not go on with the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Either of these Ministers is stating in this House something that is not true. I believe the Minister for Agriculture. On a third charge, I want the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell us that his statement on a previous occasion was not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, sulphate of ammonia.  The third point is at present in hands.  He says that the company is about to produce not only industrial alcohol but a spirit which served its purpose during the war, but was not good enough.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They (the Industrial Alcohol Company) are satisfied, however, that they can produce a very fine neutral spirit which will be readily accepted by hospitals, laboratories and industrial users, and they are installing a plant for that purpose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the same speech he said that one of the prime concerns was to ensure that no future activities will conflict with industrial undertakings carried on by private enterprise.  I challenge the Minister that there is a firm in Cork producing the most highly rectified spirit, which will compete with the highest grade alcohol produced in any country, and the plant to produce it is installed at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Either of the statements made by the Minister must be untrue.  Either he is going to compete with the firm which is already producing highly rectified spirit or else this new company can never undertake this production.  I warn this House that under all the decorative language employed in Section 4, there are two purposes&mdash; possibly three, but certainly two.  The first purpose is to defeat the Minister for Agriculture, who is a weak and flaceid man.  The truth is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has got him down and the only petition <Col N="831" /> of the Minister for Agriculture is: &ldquo;If you are going to roll me in the dirt, at least do it under the rules&rdquo;, and so, sulphate of ammonia is not going to be brought in as sulphate of ammonia.  It is going to be brought in as an alternative occupation, initiated subsequent to a period of research, adumbrated and encouraged by Dáil Éireann in the new company which used to rejoice in the name of the Industrial Alcohol Company. When that industry is established in this country, quality for quality sulphate of ammonia will cost our people 15 to 20 per cent. more than it costs our competitors in Denmark, Holland or Belgium.  If you want to take a broad average of manure for a statute acre of land in this country, it will be 4 cwt. of &ldquo;super&rdquo;, 1 cwt. of muriate of potash and 1 cwt. of sulphate of ammonia and for such cwt. of sulphate of ammonia, if you pass Section 4&mdash;face up to it&mdash;you are putting a tax of 2/- to 3/- on every farmer in the country who uses it.  That means that on every acre of Irish land that is manured hereafter, you are going to put a tax of 2/- to 3/- and for what purpose?  To provide a respectable funeral for this rotten fraud, the Industrial Alcohol Company.</P>

To feed pigs. I have been feeding pigs and I know the reason I do not get the same return out of my land in the way of potatoes is that I have not got sulphate of ammonia.  I do not blame the Minister for that.  He could not get it but the moment the markets of the world begin to open to me to enable me to get sulphate of ammonia to ensure a better yield of potatoes and to enable me to produce pigs at a price which will permit me to compete on the British market, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is going to come in and, in the teeth of the Opposition and the Minister for Agriculture, is going to put a tax on sulphate of ammonia whether the Minister for Agriculture likes it or not.  You are all going to help him.  And 90 per cent. of the Deputies represent the farmers!</P>

    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the valuation of any land, turf bog or turf bank should not be increased by the operation of emergency legislation; and more specifically by reason of the taking or purchase of turf thereon by or for disposal through local authorities or through schemes intended to provide fuel during the emergency contemplated by the Emergency Powers Act, 1939; and that proposals for any necessary legislation should be introduced forthwith by the Government.&mdash; Risteárd Ua Maolchatha.</P>

      <P>When the debate on this motion was adjourned on Friday last, I was trying to put before the House the grave injustice which has already been inflicted on a number of bog owners, and the grave injustice which, I presume, will be inflicted on every bog owner in the country with whose bog the local authority has had <Col N="835" /> any touch within the past six years. Up to the present, it would appear that the county in which most of the victims have been found is Tipperary, but if what the Minister says is true, that there is legal justification and authority for this action, that it is being done in accordance with law, then I presume that it will be extended to every county in the State, and similar injustices inflicted upon farmers or bog owners with whose bogs, as I have said, the local authority has come in contact.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy, in introducing the motion, and I subsequently, put before the House a number of actual cases. Valuations have been increased by from 100 to 3,000 per cent.  The Ceann Comhairle, quite understandably, looks at me in amazement.  I was amazed myself when I first learned of some of the increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you are not, but you are showing quite understandable amazement that such a thing should happen in this country.  I quoted one case on Friday last&mdash;I had the letter before me and I had, and have, in my possession the demand notes&mdash;where a man's rates were increased from 13/- to £39 12s.  I want to emphasise that, if there is a legal right to do this in Tipperary, there is an equal right to do it in any other part of the State, and I presume that the county managers, backed by the State, having initiated this step, will carry it out in every part of the State. Therefore, this is a motion which is, or should be, of deepest interest to every Deputy, and particularly every Deputy representing a rural constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I know, and I was present at a discussion of this matter by a county council, the justification given for this action was that the county council took over part of the turbary during the emergency&mdash;in some cases, with consent and at a price agreed between the local authority and the owner, and in many cases, compulsorily, under the powers conferred by Emergency Powers Orders, in spite of the owner, and at a price fixed by the <Col N="836" /> local authority in which the owner had no say whatever.  But mark you this: the county council in many cases entered upon a bog, proceeded to cut turf and then tried to save that turf&mdash; and this, of course, was quite understandable, particularly in the beginning of the campaign when very few people hardly knew anything about turf or about the cutting or saving of turf&mdash; and then found that in a great many cases it was hopelessly uneconomic for various reasons to cut and save turf on that particular bog.  They finished there that year, having got the turf out at a very high cost, and did not go back there any more.  In many cases, far from conferring a benefit on the local bog owner, they actually did considerable damage.</P>
    <P>I quoted a case&mdash;and I could quote a number of others which I know of my own personal knowledge&mdash;of three acres of a good callow field with running water bounding it on one side, a field that was valuable at certain periods of the year to the owner for the grazing of cattle and a field on which neither in his memory nor that of his father, which went back for a long period, had even an attempt being made to cut turf.</P>
    <P>The county council went in on that long, narrow field and they dug trenches this way and that, and then left it there, having discovered that it was a hopeless proposition from the point of view of producing turf.  They left it there also as a completely hopeless proposition for grazing, and, as a matter of fact, that same man was unfortunate enough to lose one of his best working horses valued for £40 or £50 in the boghole and he found that he had no case in law and that there was nobody from whom he could recover.</P>
    <P>I could give several other cases, but I suggest that if we are to countenance the adoption of the principle that if on part of his farm&mdash;and in many of these cases the bog was part of his holding&mdash;a farmer once in centuries, gets an opportunity of making a few shillings or pounds, or, if you like, a few hundred pounds, out of a property which was up to that time of very little use, beyond perhaps producing sufficient fuel for his own requirements, <Col N="837" /> the valuation officials are to be sent in to value it on the profit which it is alleged he is making from it, surely the next step is that if he experiments with some crop, hitherto ungrown, on an ordinary field on his farm and instead of making £50 or £5&mdash;take any figure you like&mdash;profit out of that acre of ground in the year, he makes five times that amount, the same principle will be put into operation and the valuation of that part of his farm increased. It seems to me that that is the principle.</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer, and do not presume to know anything about the law, but, whether I misunderstood or got the wrong impression, I have always heard&mdash;and I say this particularly in view of the fact that it is now stated that it is the intention, when the county councils are finished with these bogs, either to reduce the additional valuation or to wipe it out altogether&mdash; that there is no legal power to increase and certainly no legal power to reduce the valuation of land in this country. I may be completely wrong in that, but that is what I have heard.  If there is any legal authority for what is now being done, and is apparently to be done on a much wider scale from this onward, I think we ought to have the section and the Act.  Even if there is legal authority for it, I suppose they will have to go back a long way.  It is a gross injustice.</P>
    <P>I think it will be admitted by Deputies who know rural Ireland fairly well that the most impoverished section of our agricultural community was, generally speaking, those who live close to bogs.  I think I would be safe in saying that the five or six years of the emergency was the first time that they ever got an &ldquo;even break&rdquo; or an opportunity of raising themselves, if I might put it so, above the bog level.  There were many valuable contributions for the welfare of this State and its community by various sections of the people during the last six or seven years.  I am not so sure that one of the most valuable was not made by the people living by and near bogs. If the county councils went in on these bogs, if they made roads to these bogs and drained these bogs, it was not for <Col N="838" /> the sake of the farmers who owned the bogs.  The roads were not made in their interest, but in the interest of the community.  So far as I know, the community has no reason to complain.</P>
    <P>I want to go further.  If we are to get down to this question of getting back for the community, as it is put, some of the profits which certain people got; if we are to get after the profits that were made out of turf in this country, let us start at the right end where the big, easy profits were made.  Every Deputy knows that as well as I do.  Those of us who are acquainted with bog areas and live near them know that they certainly are not the most cheerful parts of our countryside, or that they are not the most valuable or productive, notwithstanding the fact that the people living there are often more industrious than those living on the good land.  Perhaps they had to be industrious in order to eke out an existence.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that it is their duty to be satisfied on this matter before they allow it to go any further. Up to the present, apparently, it has been a happy-go-lucky sort of affair. There has been no co-ordination about it.  It just depended on whether the county manager wanted to do it or not. In some counties no action has been taken.  It is notorious that where the greatest amount of turf was cut by local authorities no action was taken.  In some counties it was only taken against two or three individuals.  In others, like the northern part of my county. some 40 or 50 individuals have been penalised so far.  If there is legal authority for it, and if there is to be any justice in it, why is it not being applied all round?  Why are certain people being picked out?  All people are supposed to be equal before the law.  If it is the law that is being administered, it ought to be administered in a just, fair and impartial way. I do not know what case the Minister may make on this matter, but I think he will find it extremely difficult to justify what is being done.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want again to warn Deputies that the inquisition forms have already gone out to bog owners in every one of their constituencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> They should not waken up to this matter when it is too late.  We have tried to put the position before the House as it has been given to us by constituents who have been affected. We have gone to some trouble to check as many of these statements which we received as we possibly could.  It is a very serious matter.  I hope the House will give it serious attention.  I hope the Minister, if he insists on seeing this matter through, will be able to satisfy the House (1) that he has legal authority for it, and (2) that it is either wise or desirable to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time most Deputies get demands from some of their constituents to approach the Commissioner of Valuation or the Minister for Finance to get the poor law valuation of their land revised or reduced where they think the valuation is excessive.  I have been at the Valuation Office several times.  I may have taken it up in a wrong way, but I have been told on more than one occasion that the valuation of a townland cannot be either increased or reduced.  We have now been brought up with a rude shock against the fact that the Commissioner of Valuation can increase the valuation of a townland.  But if the land owner or the bog owner attempts to get his valuation reduced, the amount by which his valuation is reduced must be spread over the townland, so that the valuation of the townland will remain as before.  Whatever adjustment is made, the valuation of the townland must remain as it was before the revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we find that the Minister can increase the valuation of a bog. Already forms have been sent out to several people in my county and they cannot understand the matter.  Up to this they were the owners of tracts of bog which were perfectly useless to them.  Not alone that, but they were paying rent and rates for bogs which were just a death-trap for their stock. One man who has been asked to supply information told me that during the five or six years of the emergency he had lost 11 head of cattle in this bog. Now we have a situation in which, if a county council has gone in and <Col N="840" /> opened up a bog, they have made it still more dangerous for stock by cutting trenches of turf in any way that suited them and without any plan.  Yet we find that bog owners are to be subjected to an increase of valuation and to increased rates.</P>
    <P>These people gave their bogs freely because they were useless to them up to the beginning of the emergency. They allowed the county councils to cut the turf, when the case was put to them that failure on the part of the farmers or bog owners to supply sufficient fuel and food would probably mean our forced entry into the war, on one side or the other.  These people responded in a wonderful way.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a most vicious system.  We find that the State has the power to increase valuation at will. When a particular farmer or tenant applies to have his valuation reduced, if he thinks it is excessive, he is told &mdash;and I am told&mdash;that the valuation may be reduced or altered within a townland but that after the revision, the townland as a unit must have the same valuation as it had.  I do not know the first thing about the laws governing poor law valuation but I should like to know whether, in the case of the increased valuation of bogs, there will be revision of the valuation of the townland, or whether, to compensate for the increased valuation of a particular land or bog, the valuation of some other land or bog in the townland will be reduced so that, as in the case I have quoted, the townland will emerge at the same poor law valuation.</P>
    <P>In many cases bogs were cut up by the county council and the bog owners did not grumble because they realised that they were making their own little sacrifice, during the emergency, to keep the country out of the war.  In some cases, at least, the bogs are totally cut away.  Even the Minister knows quite well the value of a cut-away bog.  It is absolutely useless without the expenditure of a life-time of draining and reclamation, and even then it is only very poor quality stuff.</P>
    <P>In other cases, principally in Mayo, where by dint of the labour of the owners, their families and their forefathers, they have tilled and cultivated <Col N="841" /> the surface of the bog and made it tolerably good grass-land, according to the locality&mdash;in some cases it was the best grazing land that they had&mdash;the county council had power to go in, under Emergency Powers Orders, and cut out that bog and they did so ruthlessly in some cases without regard to the fact that they were taking away the farmer's means of living.  It was just the same as if they went into my grass-land and carted away the soil and the sub-soil.  The farmer can cultivate his land in time of emergency and can rob the fertility of the soil to produce essential food but when the period of crisis is over the farmer can take steps to restore the fertility to the land.  The turf can never be restored.  It would take many thousands of years to do that.  We find that the Minister steps in and viciously attempts to increase the valuation of bog that was useless prior to the emergency and is still more useless now by virtue of the fact that its one value has been cut away and there is nothing left but a few inches of turf mould or marl or whatever the sub-soil may consist of.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make a definite statement on this matter.  He has taken power, or the power is there already by some previous Act that was passed close on 100 years ago in the British House of Commons, to increase the valuation of bogs simply because a few farmers have made a few pounds, and only a few pounds, out of it, a meagre living at best, during the emergency years.  Does he also take unto himself power to increase the valuation of poor quality land which inexperienced tillage inspectors under the Department of Agriculture specified as arable and where, perhaps through sheer compulsion, the farmer by his labour and by heavy dressings of farm-yard manure and whatever little fertiliser was available, succeeded in growing a patchy crop?  Does he also take unto himself power to do that, because, if he has authority and power to increase the valuation of bogs simply because use was made of them during the emergency, I say he has also power to do the other thing and I should like to hear what he has to say on that subject.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if the Minister is <Col N="842" /> accepting responsibility now for increasing the valuation, he should accept responsibility for the loss in stock that occurred up to this in useless bogs.  Will he accept responsibility for the losses in stock in future that are definitely attributable to the cutting away of the bogs, leaving dangerous trenches and holes in the bogs?</P>
    <P>This is a very poor recompense for the first people in the country who helped to preserve our neutrality, under God.  It is a vicious system. All that will be gained in any county by the increase of rates is negligible and it should be beneath the Minister and the Government to do it.  It is very poor recompense and if we are ever involved in an emergency again, which God forbid, it is very poor encouragement to those who will read the debates on this particular motion to make any sacrifice for this country. If any two classes in this country are responsible for preserving neutrality, it is those who gave unselfishly and produced fuel and food.  These are the people who deserve our gratitude and, since the last shot was fired in the war, I have not heard one word of congratulation or thanks for either of these sections of the community from any of the Government benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. What I intended to say has been said by Deputy Blowick in his closing remarks.  I think it is a most ungrateful thing on the part of the Minister to make this attack upon the bog owners who unquestionably made a very loyal contribution in a period of great stress. Even if it were to be considered an advantage to the Exchequer, it could be very easily waived as a gesture of appreciation of the efforts made by the bog owners during that period of crisis.  But, apart from being ungrateful, it does not seem to make sense. It is a very nonsensical approach to the problem.  You are going to have increased valuation on bogs that have been cut up.  I am aware of some of the places referred to by Deputy Morrissey, which are adjacent to my constituency.  Where there was a bog there is now a lake.  The county councils went in and cut the turf and <Col N="843" /> left lakes and bog-holes and trenches and the place looks battle-scarred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems a senseless proposition to increase the valuation of these places for all time.  If there were to be a contribution extracted from bog owners, one would think it would be in respect of the amount of turf they sold and, if they did sell a certain amount of turf in any one year or two years, why not tax the profits they made on the turf? Of course, if that were the case, you would be taxing profits on turf rather than bogs and as Deputy Morrissey said, it would be inequitable.  There are many people in the community who could be taxed for the profits they made on turf but they are not the people who out it or the people who own the bogs. The get rich quick methods of a lot of people are notorious throughout the country.  They used the emergency to get away with it.  The unfortunate owners are now going to have a permanent increase in their valuation. Deputy Morrissey has given us some of the figures.  I know some of these cases.  He mentioned one case where there is an increase from 13/- to £39. That is an impossible impost.  It is inequitable, unjust, ungrateful and senseless. I appeal to the Minister to give ear to the appeal that is being made and not to persist in this because, if it is the intention to have an increased valuation, bogs all over Ireland should he revalued.  It is not the bogs that have been cut away, but the bogs that have not been cut away, that should be revalued.  Why start revaluing in places where the sacrifice was made and the turf has been taken away and the place left in a morass?  It should be done on a general basis.  It does not seem to be an equitable proposition and there would not appear to be much gain in it for the State but it will impose a crushing burden on the individual, and as Deputy Blowick has said, if we are ever again faced with an emergency&mdash; and with all the efforts of the United Nations Organisation, we cannot guarantee that we will not be&mdash;the Government would get little response to its appeals.  The Government should bear in mind that those who were necessary during the <Col N="844" /> last emergency to contribute their voluntary efforts in meeting food and fuel shortages should get a fair requital. This is not a fair requital.  It is unfair.  If the Minister were to approach it reasonably he would abandon the proposal and give ear to the motion tabled by Deputy Mulcahy and thus earn the gratitude of bog owners and of all right-thinking people in the community.</P>

      <P>I would point out that this is actually an expense on the Exchequer&mdash;this valuation of bog lands when they come into production of turf for sale.  As far as the Exchequer is concerned it would be much better if this particular law did not exist.  Now, what is the law? Deputy Morrissey wants me to quote the law in regard to the revaluation of bogs.  This is the law and this is the relevant section&mdash;Section 12 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this Act the following hereditaments shall be deemed to be the rateable hereditaments; viz., all lands, buildings, and opened mines; all commons and rights of common, and all other profits to be had or received or taken out of any land; and in the case of land or buildings used exclusively for public, scientific, or charitable purposes, as hereinafter specified, half the annual rent derived by the owner or other person interested in the same, so far as the same can or may be ascertained by the said commissioner of valuation; and all rights of fishery; all canals, navigations, and rights of navigation; all railways and tramroads; all rights of way and other rights or easements over land, and the tolls levied in respect of such rights and easements, and all other tolls: provided always, that no turf <Col N="845" /> bog or turf bank used for the exclusive purpose of cutting or saving turf, or for making turf mould therefrom, for fuel or manure, shall be deemed rateable under this Act, unless a rent or other valuable consideration shall be payable for the same: and provided also, that no mines which have not been opened seven years before the passing of this Act shall be deemed rateable until the term of seven years from the time of opening thereof shall have expired; and no mines hereafter to be opened shall be deemed rateable until seven years after the same shall have been opened; and mines <i>bona fide</i> reopened after the same shall have been <i>bona fide</i> abandoned shall be deemed an opening of mines within the meaning of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Act upon which all hereditaments in the country are valued.</P>

      <P>It is the Act upon which bogs are valued when the owners rent banks or cut turf for sale.  If the owner cuts the turf for his own use there is no valuation put upon the bog as such.  But, once it becomes a valuable property, where the owner either lets the banks each year for a consideration or cuts turf for sale, then the Valuation Commissioner&mdash;if the matter is reported to him by the secretary of the county council that such owner has commenced to cut turf for sale&mdash;has no option under the law but to make a revaluation.  The initiative in this case does not lie with the Minister for Finance, or with the Minister for Local Government, or with the Commissioner for Valuation.  It lies with the local authority.</P>

      <P>If they are doing their duty, yes.  If it is reported to the county council, the county council in turn will report it to the Commissioner for Valuation and the commissioner must then send his valuers to value the bog.  All this weeping and gnashing of teeth over the poor bog owner is just sheer nonsense.  Deputy Morrissey quoted a case where a valuation went from 13/- to £39.  What did <Col N="846" /> that mean?  It meant that the person who had rather a useless tract of land, which was worth only 13/- in rateable valuation, was getting at least £150 a year out of that 13/- valuation and, perhaps, more.</P>

      <P>The valuation is normally about 27 per cent. of the amount of rents taken in, or turf sold from the area.  If, therefore, the valuation is £39 the owner is getting, roughly, £150 a year; not only does he get it for the year but he gets it for three years before that.  It has to be the average of £150 before a valuation of £39 is placed upon it.</P>

      <P>Before I leave this I want to say that the valuation placed upon a bog from which turf is sold or upon which banks are let is placed on the basis of the previous three years' takings.  The owner can at any time move to have his rateable valuation reduced, and can have it reduced if he can show that his income from the bog has been reduced.  If his income ceases altogether then the valuation upon the bog ceases altogether.  I <Col N="847" /> think it is only fair and equitable that the ratepayers in any county&mdash;Tipperary, or Mayo, or Limerick&mdash;so long as they are compelled to pay rates for the houses in which they live, or for the lands which they own, or the other hereditaments in their possession have a right to see that the law is carried out and that the owners of such bogs should pay their fair and equitable share of the rates.  If the bog owners do not pay then their neighbours have to pay.  In counties where the county councils have not moved to get new valuations made the other ratepayers in such counties are paying more rates than their fair share.</P>

In this case it was increased from 2/- to £50.  What did the owner get out of it for paying rates on £50 valuation? The rates amounted to £33 3s. 7d.  He got £1,033.  That was not a bad bargain.  If he had not paid the £33 3s. 7d. the neighbours or labouring people in the adjacent village who gave him the £1,033 would have to shoulder his rates as well.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy at least went to the trouble of swotting a lot of questions and figures about the matter. Deputy Keyes did not pay the slightest attention to it.  On the basis of an exaggerated case made by General Mulcahy, Deputy Keyes went on to describe this as unjust, inequitable and a vicious policy.  He said that we were imposing a crushing burden on the owner.  If Deputy Keyes wants to impose the same crushing burden on me, and if he gives me £1,033 for a payment of £33 3s. 7d.  I am prepared to take it any day he likes.  There are other cases.  There was one case where the valuation was raised to £70 but the owner's receipts were £1,284.  I state quite deliberately that the community that paid these people these sums of money are entitled to see that the law is carried into effect, and that county councils and county managers do their jobs by reporting these cases, and having them revalued during the time they are drawing these rather large sums of money.  If they do not do that, then they are asking their neighbours to shoulder these people's rates as well as their own.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey and, I think, Deputy Mulcahy talked about the great disimprovement that was caused on certain lands which county councils entered compulsorily for the purpose of getting turf.  They said that no compensation was given the owners. If that is the case, the owner was not looking after his business.</P>
      <P>Under Emergency Powers Order (No. 310) of 1944&mdash;I think this power was in another Order as well&mdash;it is provided, in Section 22, sub-section (1):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The council of a county acquiring compulsorily land under this Order, shall pay, by way of compensation, to every person having an interest in the land such sum as fairly represents the diminution in the value of such interest occasioned by <Col N="850" /> the exercise pursuant to this Order of, as the case may be, any right of turbary over the land or any right to prepare or store turf thereon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore if a council took over land to cut turf or to prepare or store turf on it, the owner was entitled to claim such sum as fairly represents the diminution in the value of his interest.  The owner in question, if he were not satisfied with the offer of the county council, could have the matter submitted to arbitration and be entitled to the award of the arbitrator.</P>

      <P>I have explained the law in the matter.  I am perfectly satisfied that the ordinary ratepayers, who have paid dearly for the right to cut turf, or for the turf that was cut and sold by the people referred to by Deputy Mulcahy, would like to see these bogowners shouldering a fair proportion of the rates of their county.  People who have had to buy turf do not want to pay the rates for these bogs after having paid for the turf and after paying through rates and taxes for the building of roads into these bogs to enable them to be developed.  They do not want to shoulder the rates of these people in addition.  As I said in opening, there is nothing in this but expense for the Exchequer.  The Exchequer has to pay salaries and expenses of the valuation officers who are called in by the county council to do this job of revaluation.  The law is there and when we are called upon to do that work, the Valuation Office is accountable for it.  They have no option.</P>

      <P>The Minister has depicted a new section of war profit-mongers, of get-rich-quick merchants&mdash; the men in the bog.  When I was a boy&mdash;that is a good many years ago&mdash;I saw Irishmen caricatured in two different ways.  In one type of caricature, a young man was depicted with a pig either on a lead or with the pig marching through his cottage door. The other type of caricature was in some way connected with a bog.  A donkey was shown with two panniers or two baskets of turf on the way to the market or the caricature was connected some other way with the bog. The Government have already &ldquo;extinguished&rdquo; the pig.  We no longer see caricatures connected with the pig and now they are doing their best to do away with the bogman.  If it had not been for the advent of the war the bogman would nearly be extinct now; but in case there would be any chance of his surviving after the war, the Government, through their instruments, the managers and local bodies, are going to put him out of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion does not concern me in my county so far, and there are Deputies from other counties whom it does not concern either, but I was rather horrified by a suggestion made by Deputy Colley, who must have inside information, that a beginning had been made in Tipperary and the intention was to go on to other counties, so I expect Limerick will get a &ldquo;dart&rdquo; one of these days.  I am speaking with some knowledge of this matter, because I was in Newport in County Tipperary not very long ago and I saw some of <Col N="853" /> these profit-mongers to whom the Minister referred.  These are men to whom the Minister, seven, eight or ten years ago, would have been referring in very sympathetic terms as downtrodden members of the Irish race, but just because they had a year or two years of prosperity, they have suddenly developed into war profiteers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick referred to the real profit-mongers and we all know them and we all know that the millions made out of turf were not made by the men in the bogs.  The Minister himself will know of cases near Government Buildings in which more money was made in one day in connection with turf than the bog-man made in a year.  I peregrinated into Newport through four feet of water.  The bogs of which the Minister's tools have increased the valuation, so that rates which were 13/- are now £40, were wide expanses of water.  I saw no bog, but I saw a sea for four miles, and some of this land was land which the Minister's tool or instrument in North Tipperary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If my remark was rather strong, I withdraw it.  The remark may have been somewhat extravagant, but it was not incorrect.  The Minister, ten minutes ago, having refuted the idea that the Government were even indirectly responsible for the increased valuation, said, when pressed, that the managers were urged by the Local Government Minister to see that the proper rates were paid. How can the Minister think that any Deputy will not infer from that that the managers got a nod at least from the Minister to see that those valuations were increased?  The managers, being in the position in which they are, and being&mdash;to use the crude language <Col N="854" /> the Minister does not like&mdash;the tools of the Minister for Local Government, because they are nothing else and every Deputy knows it, had no option but to accept the Minister's nod and increase the valuations.</P>

      <P>I withdraw it in the original instance in which I used it, but I am not withdrawing it as I used it on the last occasion, because I used it also earlier to-day when speaking to the Minister for Local Government. I said then that there is no such thing as local government and that all we have is the tool of the Minister who acts in the Minister's name.  I do not intend to withdraw it because he exists, and everybody knows it.  It is altogether beside the question for the Minister for Finance to say that the people's representatives in the local bodies are the people who did this. They had no more to do with it than I, who had nothing to do with it.  To add one calumny to another, he said it was the ratepayers.  Did any Deputy ever hear of a ratepayer begrudging the man in the bog the couple of shillings he makes?  Did anyone ever hear of a ratepayer in any county being so mean as to begrudge the bog-man <Col N="855" /> making a few pounds once in a lifetime? The Minister never worked in a bog, and I doubt if he knows what a slean is, except when he sees the Taoiseach putting his foot on one down in Clonsast, but some of us know what a slean is and know what the men who produced the turf had to do to get the turf out on the bog road at 16/- or 17/- a ton, turf which eventually reached the cities&mdash;in a watery state because they put the hose on it&mdash;at £3 4s Od. a ton.  Everybody knows where the bulk of the profit went and it did not go to the man on the bog.</P>
      <P>We have now gone back and taken advantage of an Act of 1853 Victoria and we ought to put another wreath on the statue outside Leinster House. We have gone back to this Act to oppress the unfortunate bog-man in Ireland.  I warn Deputies to be careful of the way they vote because, while it is the bog in Tipperary, which is now a lake, which was increased in valuation, their time is coming.  The Minister read out part of the Act and the position seems to be that if any Deputy finds gold or silver on his land, he will be caught.  Will the Minister tell me if sand or gravel is a mineral?  I have always been led to believe it is.  There is sand and gravel in my area, and if I develop it and make a few pounds in one year, is this dreadful statute of Queen Victoria to be used against me?</P>
      <P>This Act under which the Minister's tool is proceeding is an Act of Victoria 1853, the implications of which nobody was aware of until this year.  We all thought that if these obsolete Acts of an alien Government were not wiped out, they would not be operated by a Government such as that in office to-day. We were once told to burn everything British but her coal, and it would be no harm if we burned this Act.  The Minister blamed Deputy Mulcahy for not operating it, but I do not believe Deputy Mulcahy knew it existed, or perhaps I do him less than justice in saying that, because he is too wide awake not to have known of its existence.</P>

We are not done with Queen Victoria or her successors yet.  They are very near and dear to us when it suits our purpose. This is a case where it suits.  I would not be surprised when I go to Newport next if the cry is: &ldquo;Up, Victoria,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Up, Dev.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is so serious that the only way you can kill it is by ridicule. Ridicule is the best way to kill things like that.  Eventually, ridicule even got the Fianna Fáil Party into office.  The people put them there as a result of ridicule.  However, at the next election they will hear about the bogs and the bog holes.  When the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office, one of the ablest politicians of the Fianna Fáil Party said to me: &ldquo;You will be beaten at the next election.&rdquo; When I asked why, he said: &ldquo;We will have the propaganda and when we get in we will stay in for 20 years because we will keep the ball rolling.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>My fear is not so much that my valuation will be increased, but that I shall have no redress.  The Minister said I could appeal to someone. When the bog is worked out, I <Col N="857" /> can appeal to somebody or other to get the valuation back to normal again. That means that when there is no turf there you can get the valuation reduced. The ordinary small ratepayer is not so learned in the law or in the operation of the law as to be able to extract from the local authority the extra rates that he had paid.  He will not find the operation too easy.  If this Act is to be applied at all, it should logically be applied to gravel pits and sand pits.  Deputy Blowick referred to other matters which, I think, were rather outside the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the excess profits made on turf and the price charged to the unfortunate people in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be just as good a case for operating the Act against the man who, in the 1914 war, sold a bullock for £50 which he bought for £20.  There would be just as good a case for raising his rates and rent, but it was not done by the British Government.  Even when we made 6 or 7 times the profit we ever made in our lives, they did not raise the valuation. If we had a Fianna Fáil Government in office then they would have done it.  But we had an honest, straight British Government who gave us a fair crack of the whip.  They did not put up the valuation of the land or the bogs.  There is a grave danger that the rates on sandpits and gravel pits, etc., may be raised.  Then there is the question of compensation. Where a man has been injured as a result of the conditions of the bogs worked by the local authorities, what redress has he?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know one case in my county which illustrates the reverse side of the picture.  I know of a bog on which there was very little turf.  The present owner of the land got the farm in a fairly good state of preservation because his father had expended between £500 and £1,000 in reclaiming two fields.  These fields were in pasture for many years until the turf scheme came into operation.  The county surveyor served notice on the owner and proceeded to cut turf there.  He scarified these two fields which cost <Col N="858" /> nearly £1,000 to reclaim.  In fact he cut the whole place to ribbons as a result of lorries running over it&mdash;not alone the two fields that were reclaimed, but the whole farm.  Eventually he gave up the task as a bad job.  I think the man got some compensation for the turf taken, but he is hardly likely to get any compensation for the damage done to his land, although it will take many years to bring it back to its former condition.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any Fianna Fáil Deputy made any demand on the local authority or on the Government that the unfortunate bogholders' rates should be increased.  I do not believe there is one farmer in my county or in the County Tipperary who made any demand that the rates should be increased on these unfortunate bog holders, who for very many years have been the worst off people in this country, because for a period of six or seven years&mdash;once in a lifetime&mdash;they made a few pounds by their exertions in producing an article at a fair price that kept this country going&mdash;not the inflated price of £3 4s.&mdash;which the unfortunate citizens of Dublin have been paying for watered turf.  The turf was not in that condition when it was produced by these men.</P>
    <P>This old Act should never have been operated.  No Deputy with any sense of justice would have made the demand which the county manager is making on small ratepayers in the County Tipperary.  If Deputies have any spark of decency in them, this motion will be carried by a large majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very opportune that this motion should have been brought forward, because, while it has been stated that there are only five or six counties in which valuations have been substantially increased, and only two counties in which they have been substantially increased, it is well known to every Deputy that the officials of the Department of Local Government are moving in regard to practically every county and are not only personally investigating the returns from the various bogs used during the emergency, but have issued forms to hundreds and perhaps <Col N="859" /> thousands of bog owners asking for particulars of their income during the past three years.  In my own constituency I know that bog areas have been invaded by inspectors during the last few months.  One particular farmer informed me that he had pulled one inspector out of the same bog hole three times.  But he told me his conscience would not compel him to pull that inspector out a fourth time.  I would advise the Minister to count his inspectors at the end of the year and see if they all returned safely.</P>
      <P>In Wicklow valuations have been increased or new valuations created during the past two years to the extent of £99, but that is only a small beginning. The inspectors are only now really getting busy.  In one case in which an increase was enforced I happen to know the circumstances.  It is the case of a small farmer owning a piece of mountain and bog.  This man had ruined his health by reason of the fact that he took part in the operation to which Deputy Bennett has referred, that is, the taking of the British Government out of this country.  His health was completely broken down and he was struggling to live and rear a family on his small patch of land. The county council demanded the right to cut turf on his land.  He refused because he believed, and rightly believed, that they would injure and lower the value of his property but the county manager, of course, resorted to his compulsory powers and proceeded to enter upon the bog and cut it away. As a result, the valuation was increased last year by £33.  I think his total rate was actually increased by £26 because, in regard to bog valuation, there is no abatement in respect of the agricultural grant either in its primary or supplemental divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises an important question. Is a bog not land?  Is not it agricultural land?  Is turf not agricultural produce?  In the various statistics that are fired at our heads by the Minister, turf is classed as an agricultural product for the purpose of showing the value of the output from agricultural land.  But, apparently, for the purpose of raising valuations, it is <Col N="860" /> classed as a mineral.  I do not think that classification is correct.  I do not think the Minister is interpreting this ancient and venerable Act properly.  I feel with Deputy Bennett that if this interpretation is put upon the Act, there is nothing to prevent the Government or the valuation authorities from going after sandpits, quarries and other operations of that kind.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister falls back on the fact that he is simply carrying out the law as he found it.  Surely the Minister will admit that the Government has power to initiate legislation and to amend laws that are unjust and unfair. When all the laws that have been enacted, re-enacted and amended, since the Fianna Fáil Party came into power are taken into account, I do not think anyone will suggest that the Government has been in any way timid or shy in introducing legislation and, if it is necessary to introduce legislation in order to prevent this injustice from being done, I think that legislation should be promptly and immediately introduced.  Here you have a section of the community who have been always wronged and trampled upon, people living in backward bog areas, people who have never been able to make a decent income, who have never enjoyed the decent amenities of life, who have always suffered the greatest hardships in inclement years, storms, and so on. We remember the great snowstorm of 1933 when numbers of my constituents in the bog and mountain areas, at the risk of serious injury, had to try to save their stock.  These are the people who are singled out now from the hundreds of thousands of war profiteers as the villains who ought to be penalised and punished and from whom additional taxation ought to be collected in respect of whatever small return they secured during the war years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that if he and his Department had not moved in this matter, the neighbours of those bog owners would intervene and demand that he should move.  I happen to know bog areas well and I can assure the Minister that there is no demand from any section of the ratepayers, particularly from any section of the <Col N="861" /> rural ratepayers, for intervention and increase in valuation.  No rural ratepayer would demand that there should be an increase.  From the point of view of self-preservation he would not encourage an increase of his neighbour's valuation, knowing that the same weapon could be used at any time against himself.</P>
