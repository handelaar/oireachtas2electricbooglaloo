    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the acute shortage of boots for children; and if he will state when increased supplies of footwear, suitable for use by children, will be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since January, 1944, footwear factories have been subject to control to ensure that reasonable quantities of essential types of footwear, including boots for children, are produced.  Returns for the year 1945 indicate that the production of heavy footwear for children has been increased to a higher total than in normal times although supplies are still lower than the demand which has been increased by the reason of the absence of supplies of children's rubber boots.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to state when increased supplies of children's footwear may become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether he proposes to take any steps to improve the quality of the leather used in the footwear because of the fact that the present unsatisfactory quality is, in fact, increasing the demand for footwear, as the existing footwear is not lasting a fraction of the time that pre-war footwear lasted? Can the Minister do anything to remedy that situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to take action to improve the quality.  I do not think the quality is as unsatisfactory as Deputy Norton suggests, but, to the extent that it is below the pre-war quality, it is due to scarcity of tanning materials and inability to obtain imported materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether any additional supplies of children's boots will be made available, particularly for the remainder of the winter period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The production of children's boots is as high as the factories in the country are capable of turning out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we expect any increase in view of that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The production of leather for heavy boots for children and for adults is being maintained at maximum level, but the scarcity is due to the fact that rubber boots, of which there were 1,000,000 pairs per year sold here before the war, are not now available. There is no likelihood that the supply will equal the demand until rubber boots are again available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that a number of the more extensive bog areas in County Mayo have been recently examined by the Turf Development Board, Ltd., but the question of their suitability for machine development cannot be finally decided until further detailed surveys have been made.  The development of the Mayo bogs and particularly the great bog areas of Bangor Erris presents a special problem which is being borne in mind for future attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state when he expects that there will <Col N="419" /> be an improvement in the supply of smoking pipes; if he will state the number of firms engaged in the manufacture of these articles in this country; and whether, if it is a fact that the short supply is due to scarcity of materials, he will endeavour to make arrangements to have such materials made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present three firms engaged in the production of smoking pipes in this country.  The scarcity of pipes which has been experienced for some time past is due to difficulties in securing raw materials from abroad.  There is, however, reason to believe that the raw material position will improve in the near future and that supplies of pipes will become more plentiful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the inadequacy of the existing provisions relating to injuries by accident caused to workmen in the course of their employment, he will consider the introduction, at an early date, of proposals for amending the law in this regard and, in particular, proposals for increasing the payments authorised by the Workmen's Compensation Acts in cases of non-fatal accidents; and whether, in this regard, he will bear in mind the very substantially larger payments provided in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not at present proposed to amend the law relating to workmen's compensation.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the maximum compensation for total incapacity was increased in 1943 by an Emergency Powers Order, and provision will be made in legislation this year to maintain this Order in force for a further period, during which the position will be reviewed in the light of prevailing conditions.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, the answer is in the negative.  The scope of our social services will be determined by our own domestic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="420" />
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, as the Minister said, that there was an increase during the emergency.  But would the Minister agree with me that the allowance of 36/- per week which is now possible is entirely inadequate for the individual who may be affected, particularly over a long period of incapacity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum allowance is 37/6.  I would not agree with the Deputy, but, in any event, the position will have to be reviewed in the light of the conditions that are likely to prevail.  The war-time increase which has been sanctioned may have to be embodied in permanent legislation, but I think we should await the development of events before deciding generally to embody it.  After the last war, the war-time increase in workmen's compensation was maintained on a temporary basis for quite a considerable period.  In fact, it was not until 1934 that the war-time increase was embodied in the permanent measure.  I do not think we should contemplate waiting so long on this occasion, but, clearly, it would be undesirable to modify the permanent legislation at this stage in view of the general uncertainty of conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, having regard to the importance of the town, he will give favourable consideration to the question of establishing an employment exchange at Naas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Grady) Seán O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years there has been a local office of my Department at Droichead Nua which has served that centre, as well as Naas, which is distant only about seven miles.  The expense of maintaining a local office at both centres would not be justified, and the additional work involved by the proximity of the Turf Development Board's operations in recent years makes Droichead Nua the more suitable centre.  Should the situation change, the needs of the Naas area would of course receive consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> I should perhaps add that steps are being taken to fill the position of branch manager at Droichead Nua which has been vacant for some time. Because of the nature of the premises at that centre I have decided to vacate them and to have the work of the office administered from Dublin as a temporary measure pending the selection of a new branch manager.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say when it is likely that the exchange activities will be returned to Newbridge from Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say if he has any particular premises in mind, as very serious inconvenience is occasioned to local people by having the unemployment insurance legislation applicable in the area administered from Dublin?  Serious travelling inconvenience is thereby caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the work in the office will be carried out from headquarters and it is not anticipated that there will be any difficulty or inconvenience caused.  Part of the conditions of appointment of the new branch manager will be that he will have to obtain suitable premises.  The vacancy will be advertised in the course of the next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that, where a person secures insurable employment and was not previously in insurable employment, he is required to go personally to the employment exchange for a card?  If the exchange is in Newbridge, he can get it without delay, or if he is in Naas he may go there and get the card in a relatively short period, but if he is offered employment in the morning and has to travel to Dublin to get the card, he may lose a few days' work in that week.  Can some arrangements not be made whereby a difficulty of that kind will be obviated, in the interests of those likely to get employment of that character?</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given on the 17th October last to a similar question (Official Debates, Vol. 98, No. 2).  It was then stated that this matter has been in abeyance for some time.  As indicated in reply to a similar question in the year 1942, certain discussions had been initiated and until these had been satisfactorily completed a decision in regard to the Report of the Judge Shannon Committee of Inquiry was not likely to be taken.  There has been no alteration in the position since.  The commission was appointed on the 6th March, 1940, and its report was made on the 9th May, 1940.</P>

      <P>The northerly end of the Rotunda Gardens was specially selected as the site of a garden of remembrance to be dedicated to those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish freedom, following representations made by the Dublin Brigade Council of the Old I.R.A. as to the associations of this site with the events of Easter Week.  Any criticisms of the site are outweighed by these associations and by the further consideration that the garden of remembrance will provide an open space not hitherto available upon the main artery of the city and within easy access.  The area of the site is admittedly small, but is not regarded as inadequate for the type of memorial contemplated and, in any case, it is not to be assumed that the conversion of this site into a memorial as proposed must necessarily preclude the erection elsewhere of a more adequate national memorial to those whom the nation may desire to honour and commemorate. <Col N="426" /> Invitations to architects to submit designs have already been issued by public advertisement and I am not prepared to cause an inquiry to be held as suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>On representations from other Deputies I undertook a careful examination of this problem and find that the additional cost involved in providing a six-day delivery in all rural areas where it is now less frequent would be very substantial and would not be justified, as the postal services in these areas would be operated without a prospect of making them self-supporting.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I regret that I am unable to consider any general increase.</P>

      <P>That notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Standing Orders, and until further resolved, the following provisions shall apply in respect of sittings of the Dáil on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my position clear.  This matter was mentioned at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It was then thought, as the matter was not <Col N="434" /> dealt with at any great length, that no particular difficulty would be experienced in reverting to the 10.30 closing down here, with the provision that, if any subject was to be raised on the Adjournment, it would be raised at 10 p.m. so as to permit the proceedings of the House to be terminated at 10.30.  Since then I understand that the decision to go back to the 10.30 sitting may have an adverse effect on certain members of the staff of this House.  It has been brought to my notice that if the House sits until 10.30 and the last public conveyance leaves at 11, members of the staff, such as the ushers, the restaurant staff, the typists and the telephonists, may not be able, in all cases, to contact with the public transport in order to get home.  It is one matter, perhaps, to have to walk home at 9.30, if you miss the 9.30 bus, but it is another proposition to have to start to walk at 11 o'clock at night, if you miss the 11 o'clock bus.</P>
      <P>If, however, the 10.30 arrangement will work satisfactorily, without causing great hardship to the staff, I do not desire to oppose the motion, but I would hope that the officers of the House concerned would be able to make arrangements whereby the staff which serves the House in various activities would be enabled, by some readjustment of their duties, to make contact with the last public conveyance so that they might get home by bus, instead of having to walk.  If that can be done, I have no objection to the motion, and I hope it will be possible to do it.  If not, I want to reserve my right to ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to reconsider the matter at a later date, in the light of any difficulties experienced by the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In this connection, I think that Deputy Norton might perhaps leave the House under a false impression.  At its meeting, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was clearly left under the impression that the proposed new arrangement would permit of the staff of the House making contact with the last public vehicle.  I believe the Ceann Comhairle was under that impression; I certainly <Col N="435" /> was, and I believe the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was also. I believe that if our minds were directed to the fact that any difficulty such as is now envisaged by Deputy Norton existed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to make an observation. I do not at all appreciate the tone of the Tánaiste's remarks.  This House is not run on the lines of a penitentiary, and we are well aware that there are certain Civil Service Regulations, but there are also certain human relations which exist.  I have never been improperly approached by any member of the staff in regard to his conditions of employment, and I should be amazed that the Leader of the Labour Party had willingly entertained <Col N="436" /> improper representations, but I regard it as no breach of the privileges of the House if, in a friendly way, one discusses matters generally with persons with whom I am brought in daily contact, without in any way seeking to subvert the discipline of the officers in this House.  I very much resent the implication in the Tánaiste's words that either the Leader of the Labour Party or I made any improper contact with the servants of this House for the purpose of derogating from the duties of the Superintendent or any other superior officer of the House.  I am not aware that the Leader of the Labour Party has done any such thing, and I certainly have not.</P>

      <P>I do not believe the members of the staff have any great complaint about this matter at all, and I am sure that all aspects of the case were present to the minds of the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges when they discussed and considered it.  During the emergency, as Deputies are aware, the House rose at 9 o'clock and the last bus left at 9.30, so that a margin of half an hour was left for members of the House and members of the staff to catch the last bus.  Now it is proposed that the House should rise at 10.30 p.m., instead of <Col N="437" /> 9 p.m., and the last bus leaves at 11 o'clock, so that, there again, there is a margin of half an hour.  There is this difference, however, that, under the old arrangement, a motion on the adjournment was taken at 9 p.m. and the House did not adjourn on the occasion of such a motion until 9.30 p.m., whereas, under the proposed arrangement, a motion on the adjournment will be taken at 10 p.m. and the House will adjourn at 10.30 p.m. leaving at all times a margin of half an hour for members of the staff to catch their buses.</P>

      <P>I do not want to make a second speech, but I adverted to the last point made by the Parliamentary Secretary in the course of the remarks I made.  I said that it was one thing to walk home, having missed the last bus at 9.30 p.m., and another thing to walk home at 11 o'clock at night.  The Parliamentary Secretary ought to appreciate that difference.  One might very well like to walk home at 9.30 p.m., but one would not relish walking home at 11 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the Tánaiste that I was not approached by any member of the staff personally and, if the Tánaiste desires, I will show him the documents on the basis of which I make these remarks.  I was not approached personally on the matter, but, even if I were, surely one can discuss with a member of the staff of the House, of which the Deputy himself has been a member for a long period, some matter affecting the sittings of the House.  If the matter were mentioned to me by a member of the House, I would not see, and do not propose to see, the slightest transgression by a civil servant in the discharge of his duties.  This House is discussing the matter, not with a Civil Service slant, but with a Parliamentary slant.  I think the House is well served by its staff and the desire of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, as I take it it is the desire here, is to make an arrangement which will cause the minimum of inconvenience to everybody.  It is from that standpoint only that I raise the matter.  I am not raising it against a <Col N="438" /> background of the conditions of employment of the staff.  I am raising the matter purely from a social point of view and purely from the point of view of reasonable convenience for human beings.  In no other sense am I raising it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I am aware that this Bill, which is of a somewhat technical nature, is probably one which Deputies find it difficult to interpret, and it was in anticipation of such difficulty that I circulated with the Bill an explanatory memorandum.  The <Col N="439" /> Bill deals largely with matters of administration in connection with the children's allowances scheme.  Deputies will remember that, when that scheme was under discussion in the Dáil on the submission of the Children's Allowances Act, 1944, the House was concerned with the efficiency of the proposed methods of administration.  I explained then the reasons which led to the adoption of certain devices which seemed likely to minimise the difficulties which members of the public would have in understanding their rights and obligations under the scheme, and, at the same time, reduce the staffing problems that were likely to arise in connection with it.</P>
      <P>Under the original scheme, payment of children's allowances to qualified applicants was made upon the basis of six monthly periods.  Qualifying dates were fixed, and on the basis of the family circumstances upon these qualifying dates the amount of the allowance was paid during the ensuing payment period on a flat rate basis without regard to changes in the family circumstances until the next qualifying date.  I mentioned then the staff problem that would arise if the same qualifying dates and the same payment periods were fixed for the whole country.  In such an event the task of adjudicating on claims and of issuing vouchers for the payment of allowances would become particularly heavy at certain periods of the year, while the administrative work to be done in the remaining periods would be light, thus making the economical use of staff a matter of some difficulty, or necessitating, what most Deputies would regard as undesirable, the periodical employment of a large number of temporary officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the period which has elapsed since the inauguration of the scheme experience has been gained, and that experience has suggested that there are changes which might usefully be made.  We are avoiding the concentration of the work of administering the scheme into certain limited periods of the year by the device of providing in the Bill for a division of applicants into groups on a <Col N="440" /> regional basis.  Three regions were fixed, and different qualifying dates and different payment periods were fixed for each of these groups thus, to some extent, spreading the administrative work over the whole year.  That system of administration, on the basis of regional areas, had certain advantages other than those which I have indicated already.  It was devised mainly as an administrative measure to solve a staff problem, but it was recognised that it would also be beneficial to persons claiming children's allowances if, in each locality, the same qualifying dates existed for all claimants and the same payment periods.  Although the attention of claimants and beneficiaries under the scheme to their obligations, particularly the need to renew their claims at particular dates, is drawn by advertisements in the Press and by announcements over the radio, in practice, as most Deputies realise, the most effective method of getting these dates understood and obligations appreciated is to have them a matter of common knowledge in each locality. The adoption of uniform qualifying dates and of uniform payment periods for each region facilitated the administration of the scheme in a manner which would not have been possible if each individual applicant had a separate date for qualifying and a separate period during which payment might be made.</P>
    <P>However, in the matter of administering the Act, as passed, the system of grouping claimants upon the basis of fixed regions determined by Order proved to be too rigid, nor did it entirely eliminate the problem associated with the economical use of staff which we had in mind when framing the scheme originally.  The number of claimants in each of the regions proved, in the event, to be uniform, and the adoption of that particular device involved also quite elaborate provisions to deal with the cases of persons who transferred their residences from one region to another. There was also the very particular objection, to which expression was given during the course of the debates in the Dáil on the Bill, that the adoption <Col N="441" /> of two qualifying dates in a particular year meant that, in certain cases, there would be an unduly long delay between the date upon which a family might become qualified to receive the children's allowance and the actual commencement of the payment of the allowance.</P>
    <P>The original scheme, as I mentioned, involved two qualifying dates and two payment periods for each region.  If the qualifying date for a particular region was the 1st May, a family which became qualified by the addition of a third child on the 1st April, would prove its entitlement to the allowance on the 1st May, and proceed to draw the allowance upon the basis of that entitlement for the six months from the 1st August, irrespective of changes in the family circumstances, until the next qualifying date, which would be 1st November.  On the other hand, the family which did not qualify for the allowance until 1st June, or any date shortly after the qualifying date, could not become qualified under the scheme, or could not prove that it was qualified, until the next qualifying date on the 1st November, and would not be entitled to receive benefit until the payment period beginning on the 1st February.  The change in the system of administration which it is now proposed to adopt, and for which this Bill provides, will go a long way to remove that objection.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, practicable, as Deputies will understand, to adopt any system of grouping of applicants which would divide them into groups of more or less equal numbers.  Conceivably, applicants could be grouped in alphabetical order or in numerical order, but as there are advantages in the regional system of grouping it is desired to retain it.  This Bill will provide, however, only for grouping without specifying the basis of groups, or making it a legal obligation to have applicants grouped by area of residence.  The intention is to maintain the regional system of grouping for the reasons I have indicated.  By making it a statutory obligation, however, to have claimants grouped in groups of some kind, a greater degree of flexibility is introduced.  Any drift of population <Col N="442" /> from one region to another can be easily adjusted and, by the further device of taking power to alter the first payment period in individual cases, a much more free system of administration can be introduced, with considerable advantage to beneficiaries under the scheme.  Instead of having the fixed areas with two qualifying dates for each area, and two payment periods for each area, we will have in future areas which can be varied from time to time if the occasion should arise and, by the device of taking power to alter the first payment period, it is possible to introduce a welcome innovation in so far as new entrants can be admitted into the scheme at any qualifying date for any area.</P>
    <P>It will be understood that the problems of admitting new claimants into the scheme will offer much less difficulty under this new arrangement. There will be for new claimants, not merely two qualifying dates appropriate to the area in which they live, but six qualifying dates during the year and any new claimant can establish entitlement to a children's allowance at any one of those six dates.  If the claimant is admitted as having a proper claim under the Act he will, of course, be put into the group to which he belongs according to the location of his residence but the duration of the first payment period of children's allowance to that claimant will be altered so as to make it conclude at the time at which the current payment period for that group concludes, so that, for subsequent payment periods, the new claimant will in fact have the same qualifying dates and the same payment periods as everyone else in the locality in which he resides.  That change for the benefit of new claimants can, if this Bill is passed, be brought into operation on the 1st October this year.</P>
    <P>That system of dealing with new claimants can be applied also to the case of persons moving from one area to another.  Under the original Act, we had very complicated provisions to deal with the case of a person who moved from one area to another but, under this new system, all these old complicated regulations can be dispensed with and the case of a person <Col N="443" /> moving from one area to another can be dealt with by the very simple method of altering the duration of the payment period next after the transfer so as to bring its conclusion into line with the conclusion of the current payment period for the new group area in which he will reside.</P>
    <P>The advantages secured by that proposed change in the legislation are, therefore, first, this easier access to the scheme by new claimants, a much larger number of qualifying dates, so that there is not the same delay in admitting to the scheme a family that becomes newly qualified, and, on the other hand, a simplification of the administrative problems which arose in connection with the employment of staff for the operation of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Another change which it is proposed to make relates to the qualification of the person claiming the allowance. Certain difficulties have arisen because in the Principal Act the basis of a claim for an allowance in respect of a child was that the claimant was maintaining the child.  It is true that the Act was so framed as to make the fact that a child was resident with the claimant evidence that the child was being maintained by the claimant, and in the vast majority of cases it is, of course, true that the child resides with the person who is maintaining it.  The fact that it is not universally true did, however, cause difficulties, as in cases where children were not living with their parents, even though one or both of the parents were alive, and certain people have failed to qualify for children's allowances on that account. It will help Deputies to understand the problem if I give an illustration: A child might be living with its grandparents on the qualifying date.  There might in fact be no payment of any kind by the parents to the grandparents for the maintenance of the child, and the grandparent might claim a children's allowance in respect of the child on the ground that the grandparent was maintaining the child, proof of the fact being that the child was living with the grandparent.  On the other hand, the child would <Col N="444" /> ordinarily be regarded, and should ordinarily be regarded, as residing with the parents even though for reasons of family convenience or otherwise, the child was for a period residing with his grandparents.  We are, therefore, proposing to take out of the Bill this condition of maintenance and to regard as entitlement to a claim for a children's allowance the question of residence only.  Ordinarily a child will be regarded as residing with its parents even though it may at the qualifying date or for a temporary period, or otherwise, be actually living with some other relative, or elsewhere.  The principle will, however, be to relate the child to the parent unless it is clearly shown that there is in fact no link whatever with the parental home. The advantage of that to the public is that in certain cases of larger families the full entitlement to a maximum children's allowance can be established by the parents, whereas in cases where housing difficulties and other problems had involved the breaking up of the family amongst relatives that entitlement to children's allowance at the maximum rate might not be capable of demonstration.</P>
    <P>In order to simplify the problem of administration, it is proposed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have power to prescribe the rules which the deciding officers will operate in determining with whom a qualified child normally resides.  I want to make it clear that these rules will be so framed as to make it clear that the decision must be that the child normally resides with its parents unless it can be adequately demonstrated by some claimant who is not the parent of the child that the link with the parental home is completely severed.</P>
    <P>A further change which has been made will permit an Irish citizen to claim, even though he is not resident in the State on the qualifying date. As the law stood, the claimant had to be resident here on the qualifying date.  The change will permit a claim to be made even though the parent is not resident here on the qualifying date and will operate to permit some <Col N="445" /> other person to apply on behalf of the parent in the parent's absence.</P>
    <P>There are some other minor changes which are designed to make more adequate the provision designed to ensure that a child will not be the subject of more than one allowance at the same time and to provide also that a child who is admitted to a reformatory or an industrial school after a qualifying date will cease to be regarded as qualified.</P>
    <P>These amendments do not affect the principle of the original measure but they are all the outcome of the experience which has been gained in the operation of the principal measure since it was enacted.  They were considered first of all in relation to the administrative problems that arose, and are designed to effect certain improvements in the operation of the measure which will be of benefit to the people of the country.  I recommend that the Bill be adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is very little to be said on this matter.  As the Minister has described it, it is a machinery measure to remove certain difficulties that there were in the original Act and to effect some further improvements.  So far as I can see it must go a long way to simplify and make more regular the administrative work and, from the staff point of view, ensure a greater degree of economy. I think some of the new provisions are to be welcomed from the point of view of the applicants.  For instance, instead of having two qualifying dates in a year, the Minister now proposes to have six.  I am sure the House will also welcome the provision for grouping of applicants.  We have the assurance of the Minister that the working of it will be simplified to make it more convenient from the administrative point of view.  He still proposes, although grouping the applicants, to keep it on a regional basis.  We, of course, support the measure and we appreciate that it will make the administration more flexible.</P>

      <P>There is very little to be said on this Bill except that, in my opinion, there were a few flaws in the <Col N="446" /> previous Bill that are not removed here.  I have in mind the case of a woman and family who came from Great Britain during the emergency, while her husband is still resident in Great Britain.  In many such cases, the husband is not able to maintain his wife and family in this country. This particular type of family is denied the children's allowance.  In Section 5 (b) there is the provision&mdash;I wonder is it a slip on the part of the draftsman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the case of people living in fairly backward places who are not familiar with the qualifying dates, etc.  Quite a few <Col N="448" /> cases were brought to my notice where parents were illiterate or, if not illiterate, were bordering on it, and where they were not aware of these things in the beginning.  The result was that they were victimised.  Perhaps that word may be a bit extreme to use, but they were definitely disqualified from getting the allowance for a certain period.  I think that should not be the case.  If officials in charge of a particular case like that find out that the family were definitely qualified and if they are satisfied that, through no fault of the parents but because of illiteracy, or the fact that they were living in a backward place, they did not make application in time, I think they should be given the full amount due to them.  It seems queer that, because a person failed to fill up a form by a certain date, he should be denied the children's allowances due to him.  That has happened in a few cases which have been brought to my notice.  I took it up with the Minister's officials but nothing could be done about it as the law said they were deprived of it.</P>

      <P>In the main, this is a machinery measure and does not require much comment.  I think that the amendments which the Minister has <Col N="449" /> introduced in the parent Act will substantially improve the administration of that Act and make it a more flexible instrument, particularly in regard to the movement of claimants from one area to another and their immediate integration into the scheme of allowances applicable to the area to which they have moved.  In that respect, I think the amendments proposed by the Minister are commendable.  I am very glad the Minister has seen his way to remove the provision in the main Bill which necessitated the child being resident with the parent before the claimant was entitled to a children's allowance.  In one case, the deciding officer decided that, since the children did not reside with the claimant, the claimant was not entitled to benefit; but the claimant happened to have the rather unhealthy job of rear gunner in a Lancaster bomber and was stationed in some eastern aerodrome.  Quite obviously, in a case of that kind, he could not reside here to claim and the children could not reside with him. Therefore, the claimant's application was turned down.  However, when the facts were brought to the notice of the Department, they realised the absurdity of maintaining a contention of that kind and the allowance was duly paid. The amendments which the Minister has made now will obviate such cases of that kind occurring in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Act was a complex piece of social legislation and one which, I hope, is only the beginning of many improvements in the same sphere and is but the first step in an extension of the scheme of children's allowances, I think that it has been administered, on the whole, with very considerable smoothness, which is a credit to those charged with the administration of the Act.  I have had occasion, from time to time, to make representations to the Department about certain cases, most of which were complicated, but I have to say, to the credit of the officials concerned, that they made a very painstaking effort to make clear their point of view.  That is a form of activity which I recommend to some other Departments, in charge of the Minister's colleagues.  I think the Department has administered this very difficult Act with smoothness and <Col N="450" /> efficiency.  Whatever blemish may be there, in respect of the smallness of the allowance or the eligibility for pension, it is not their fault.  I would place on record that the officials have administered a very difficult Act with smoothness and efficiency and there has not been the volume of complaint which might well be expected to arise out of an Act of such complexity as the Children's Allowances Act.  I think the amendments which the Minister now proposes will make the administration move more smoothly than in the past and, if that position is reached, there will be very little cause to complain about the administration of the Act under the present Department.</P>

      <P>I welcome the administrative changes which have been brought into the Bill.  I am sorry that the Minister did not see his way to bring about also an administrative change in connection with income-tax payers.  I would remind Deputies that, in this country to-day, the income-tax payers are not all confined to the wealthy classes, that there are many artisans and tradesmen who are now payers of income-tax.  It is a pity that some arrangement could not be made by which there was a sort of offset of the amount they could claim for a child against the loss of the income-tax allowance for the third child.</P>
      <P>In the first place, the income-tax payer labours under a disadvantage in connection with the third and subsequent children, under which he did not labour before this Act came in.  Even leaving out of account his financial disability, which has come about as a result of the Act, he is put to a great deal more trouble in the collecting of the half-crown a week.  I would be glad if the Minister could see some way to introduce a system whereby his payments and receipts could be netted in some form.  I do not know if that is possible, but surely some arrangement could be made with the Department of Finance for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill also.  I am not quite sure if the Minister has taken powers to deal with a case which came to my notice some few <Col N="451" /> months ago, where an unfortunate family lost both father and mother within 18 months.  There are six children, ranging from two years to 11 years of age, and through force of necessity they had to be divided up, as the estate was too small to maintain them.  Nos. 1 and 2 went to live with A, Nos. 3 and 4 went to live with B, while Nos. 5 and 6 went to C.  The unfortunate part of this case is that all of the children have been deprived of the children's allowance.  I think that is a very unfair attitude even for officials of the Department, whom I have found to be very courteous and who facilitated me in every respect. When this matter was brought to their notice, they informed me that they had no powers to deal with the matter differently.  I looked up the 1944 Act and could not find any reference there setting out the penalising of children who have been penalised already in a way that never can be redressed, that is, by the loss of both father and mother.  Surely, it was never the intention of this House&mdash;and I am quite sure it was never the intention of the Minister&mdash; that, if the family had the misfortune to lose both father and mother, the State would say the children were no longer entitled to assistance from the State, since the parents were dead. Those were the simple facts of the case.  I think it is only necessary to bring such a case to the notice of a sympathetic Minister, as the present Minister is, to put that matter right. Such an attitude was never the intention of the House.  When this piece of beneficial Fianna Fáil legislation was passing through the Chamber, the boys of all the Parties were scrambling to get up on the band waggon.  Even Deputy Dillon was tearing his nails to get on the band waggon when the Bill was passing through.  I hope the Minister will make the position clear in regard to such cases as this, before this Bill gets its Final Reading.</P>

      <P>Would it not be better to discuss this matter in the light of the Bill, rather than try, as Deputy Walsh tries, to work political <Col N="452" /> propaganda out of it?  That is not my intention now, and my only reply is that, when people are in a minority, they are not so strong as when they have a huge majority.</P>
      <P>In the matter of the qualifying date, the change now is a very important one.  Very often in the past 12 months in my constituency, Galway, some people who did not hear the announcement about the dates, and who have not got them into their heads yet, were deprived of this badly needed allowance. Of course, one could not blame the officials for that, as the Act was there.  The great change, by the introduction of more qualifying dates, will mean a vast improvement.  I join with Deputy Norton in congratulating the officials on the manner in which the Act was carried out within the past 12 months.  In every way they did their best.</P>
      <P>We have gained experience in regard to the Act, and there is one thing I am afraid has not been covered yet, namely, the case where the children of one family go in with friends.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to introduce some provision for payment in such cases.  I have one case in mind.  A father died, and the mother went to England.  The two children were left with their aunt.  The aunt was the mother of two children also, and the result was that there were four children solely dependent on her.  She was refused a children's allowance for two of the children.  I might mention that the four children were under 16 years of age, and in the usual way two would qualify for the allowance.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider making a change in this respect.  Such an amendment would be very necessary. There are a good many cases of this kind in my own area, and I am sure in other parts of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure has been brought in as a result of the experience gained in the administration of the Principal Act.  In my own experience I have found, particularly in the rural areas, many cases of hardship, and, in fact, of injustice.  This, I am sure, has also been experienced by <Col N="453" /> the Department.  As the law stands, it was not possible up to the present to deal with these cases satisfactorily, but now that the Minister is very substantially improving the machinery, I wonder if he will consider doing something on behalf of the people in the rural areas particularly.  These people have to travel very long distances to the sub-post offices.  I am sure the Minister, and indeed everyone in the House, will agree that many of these sub-post offices are administered by most inefficient people, simply because the Government will not pay sufficient wages so as to get efficient people around them.  Many mistakes have occurred, with the result that poor people have been deprived of the allowance.</P>
      <P>People who are entitled to 5/- or 7/6 a week often think that it is better to make the journey once every month or six weeks, and it happens very often that the slip put into the book to remind them is not seen in time.  People who can afford to have a bank account never miss the bus.  They get an indication by post from the Department which they complete the moment they get it, and thereby they will get every shilling to which they are entitled under the Act.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister, in consultation with his advisers, now that he has put his hand to the job, to improve the legislation still further by making some alteration so as to have a better method of administration.  I think it should be possible to find a better method of notifying those people, particularly in the rural areas, rather than expect that they should be able to keep their eyes on the slip inserted somewhere in the middle of the book. I hope that the cases that have been the cause of complaint in the past will be remedied, and that every effort will be made to overcome such difficulties in the future.</P>

      <P>The principle underlying this Bill, as Deputy Norton said, is to be commended.  In the administration of major legislation such as this, steps will be taken by the Minister as soon as possible to come into the House and submit proposals <Col N="454" /> calculated to benefit the people whom it is intended to benefit under the original Act.  I think that is a very desirable procedure, more especially as the number of qualifying periods will be extended, and there will be less difficulty so far as the individual is concerned.</P>
      <P>I rise to supplement the appeal made by several Deputies in respect of the applicants who fell down on the first application.  There were a large number of them.  References were made to the rural areas, but the same thing applies to the City of Dublin.  I have some cases in mind where the first qualifying period went by the board, and the families suffered in consequence. Having regard to the short period that has elapsed since the operation of the Act, and the fact that the family circumstances are known, as from the first qualifying period, to the inspectors and the officials of the Department, I suggest that it would be very much appreciated by those concerned if the Minister would indicate that payment might be made in certain circumstances to those who failed to qualify in the first period.  I do not know whether there would be a considerable amount involved, but the fact remains that the principle underlying that suggestion is sound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain amount of praise has been given to the Minister and to his Department arising out of the introduction of this legislation. I suppose we all welcome it, but we should realise that it is machinery which the Government find themselves compelled to introduce following their experience with the Principal Act.  I find that under this legislation not only will some of the cases that I have in mind be more easily dealt with but some of the cases that other Deputies <Col N="455" /> have mentioned in the course of the debate will be more easily handled, because there is a wider discretionary power being taken by the Minister.  It is peculiar that of the outstanding cases which I had in mind in which the applicants failed to qualify, one came under the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the other was dealt with by another Department altogether.  Because of the rigid form in which machinery was set up when the Principal Act was passed, there was no loophole by which the Department of Industry and Commerce could remedy the defect.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with one section, and I shall strike a note somewhat contrary to that struck by other Deputies.  I refer to Section 5.  The Minister dwelt upon that section somewhat briefly. He indicated that it is proposed to alter to some extent one of the qualifying bases so far as the Principal Act is concerned.  It occurs to me that it is a question of changing the emphasis from that of maintenance to that of residence.  It is not quite easy to discuss the matter at this stage because in sub-section (2) the Minister is being given power to make certain rules, and under these rules there may be a very wide or narrow divergence from the definitions in the Principal Act.  The basis of our discussions in the debates on the Principal Act was acceptance of the fact that we are providing an allowance for the maintenance of the child as such rather than for the relief of the burdens based upon the parents.  It seems to me that we should be slow to change the emphasis from maintenance to residence, and that, to some extent, the avoiding of the very pitfall which we are trying to bring about by this alteration may be offset by the creation of other pitfalls of equal or possibly even greater significance so far as the child is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that our main concern in securing the payment of the allowance is to ensure that whatever sum is paid will be spent for the benefit of the particular child or children who qualify and I can quite envisage cases &mdash;it is not necessary to go into the <Col N="456" /> point now; we can deal with it later&mdash; in which a particular person would qualify for payment and in which it would be very doubtful that the money would be expended to the advantage of the children.  I do not know whether it would be possible on Committee Stage for the Minister to enter a little more fully into the lines along which his mind might run when drafting the rules, so that we might be a little clearer as to the change that will take place, but it does seem to me that the important thing which we should maintain is the principle on which we based the original Act, that is, of contributing to the welfare of the child and not to an increase for one or other parent for the advantage of that parent and not the advantage of the child or children.  As I say, it is difficult to deal with it at the moment, but perhaps the Minister might keep it in mind when we come to the later stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I stated in my opening remarks that in making rules under sub-section (2) (a) of Section 5 it would be my intention to place the emphasis upon the claim of the parent, that is to say, to relate the child to the parent, rather than to the person with whom the child might actually be residing on the qualifying date.  In the original Act we used the term &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; in order to determine the qualification of a claimant, but we endeavoured to devise a system under which the fact of maintenance would be proved by the fact of residence.  That was unwise, as experience has shown, and led to a great number of conflicting claims. We have to stand on one foot or the other, it seems to me, if we are to get clear-cut administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case I gave by way of illustration previously will serve here.  A child normally residing with its parents, who are living, is, on the qualifying date, residing with a grandparent, and both the parent and grandparent claim a children's allowance in respect of that child&mdash;the parent on the ground that the child normally resides with him and the grandparent on the ground that the <Col N="457" /> child is being maintained by him.  As the law stood, conceivably the person maintaining the child, that is, the grandparent, might be able to sustain a claim.  In the actual administration of the Act we tried to do what will be done under the new measure, that is, to support the claim of the parent with whom the child normally resides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that not be subject to the assurance that the money would be used for the maintenance of the child?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed that on the main Bill, and the principle adopted then was to assume that in fact the allowance would be so spent, until the contrary was shown.  If the contrary is shown, there is power under the original Act to dispose of the allowance in some other manner so as to make sure that the benefit will go to the child.  The particular case I have mentioned might not be so serious if both the parent and the grandparent could in fact sustain a claim for an allowance in respect of the total number of children residing with them; but clearly in that case, if the claim of the grandparent were admitted, there would be other cases when, because of the splitting up of a family between parents and grandparents, none might qualify, whereas, by the device of relating all the children to the parents and regarding them as being normally resident with the parents, and consequently qualifying the parent for an allowance, unless it is clearly shown that the link with the parent is finally and permanently broken, the parent will in fact be able to secure the highest rate of allowance practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to cases in which people failed to secure the allowance because they did not apply on the commencement of the Act.  I do not think we could go back on these cases.  Something more than an application for an allowance is required The scheme provides that an application can be investigated, and it is not possible to proceed in the manner suggested by Deputy Blowick of regarding the facts stated in the application <Col N="458" /> form as entitling a person to the allowance until they have been investigated. I do not say that every case is investigated, but wherever there is reason to believe that there may be some misstatement of fact, an investigation takes place, and the investigation may reveal that the actual person claiming is not the person entitled to claim, or that the number of children residing on the qualifying date was different from that stated.  I think it is true to say that, in the period in which the Act has been in operation, we endeavoured so far as possible not to adhere to the strict letter of the regulations or to impose absolutely the dates prescribed for the making of applications; but once the qualifying date has passed and the process of issuing an allowance book is in progress, it is not possible to go back on any claims.  Claims which come in at that stage have to be related to the next qualifying period; but one of the advantages of this change is that the next qualifying date will now be much nearer than it would have been under the old scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donell misunderstands the purport of the Bill, if his question was intended to be a serious question. The parentage of the children does not determine a claim to a family allowance. If the children are residing in the household, whether they are the progeny of the head of the household or of somebody else, provided that it is their home and they are normally resident there, a claim can be made in respect of them.  Under the change being made here, an allowance will be paid in respect of every qualified family, provided the person claiming is an Irish citizen, or has been resident here for two years, even though the claimant himself may be absent from the country.  That, I think, disposes of one case mentioned by Deputy Blowick.  In the circumstances described by him, an allowance would be payable.</P>
    <P>It is not so easy to deal with the case mentioned by Deputy Walsh.  He has a Parliamentary question down about the case to which he refers&mdash;at least, I think it is the case to which he <Col N="459" /> refers.  In that case, the parents died and the home was broken up.  Two of the six children went to live in one household; two in another; and two in a third.  The children's allowance which was payable on the date upon which the last surviving parent died was distributed amongst the three households to which the children went for the balance of that payment period, but, when the next qualifying date arose, only one of the households to which these children had gone had other children, and consequently only from that household could a claim for a children's allowance be maintained. It was quite clear in that case that, because of the unfortunate circumstance of the death of both parents, the home had in fact been broken up, and the children who had formerly resided in that home are now, and will in future be, permanently resident in the new homes to which they have gone.  Consequently, it is the circumstances in the new homes which determined whether the children's allowances were payable or not.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is the number of children over two and under 16 years of age in the household which determines the entitlement allowance. With regard to the case which was mentioned by Deputy Donnellan, I do not think that he has the facts right. As he stated the case the allowance would be payable.  As I understood the Deputy the man parent died and the female parent abandoned the home and went to England, with the result that the children were permanently resident with another relative.  In that case, the claim for the children's allowances could be made by the person maintaining the children if the circumstances of that home were such as to qualify that person.  A fact which the Deputy may not have ascertained, and which may have disqualified the person with whom the children were residing, was a contribution to the maintenance of the children from the female parent in Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was the circumstance of disqualification, then this Bill will change that because in future it is not the consideration of maintenance by a parent that will determine a claim but the actual fact of residence, of permanent residence in a new home.  I do not know how to deal with the case of people who fail to repeat a claim, such a case as that mentioned by Deputy Pattison.  It will be understood that in the case of new claimants, most of the difficulties have now passed except in the very odd case of a new claimant by the head of a family where a new child is born. In that case, he will now apply for a children's allowance when the child is born, at the time of the registration of the birth.  That application will be related to the next qualifying date. There will, of course, be circumstances where families will become entitled to claim because the children of a relative are residing with them, but in the great majority of cases claims will arise because of a birth, and I should think that it will become the normal practice to make a claim simultaneously with the registration of the birth.  In the case of persons who have already established their right to the children's allowance and who have been receiving the children's allowance, it is not necessary to continue to prove entitlement at six-monthly intervals, but in order to make sure that people do not inadvertently fail to make a repeat claim, there is inserted in the book of vouchers supplied to them a form to remind them, and on this form they make their repeat claim.  We will do everything possible to prevent people losing their right to benefit by their own mistake.  I think that we could not go much further than we have gone in order to ensure that people who have become entitled to the children's allowance, and who have been receiving it, will continue to receive it.  The fact that a person may only go to the post office every six or eight weeks to draw the allowance and <Col N="461" /> may on that account fail to note the form inserted in the book on which to make the repeat claim is possible, but I do not see what more we could do to avoid it except by means of the publicity which the Department undertakes from time to time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the position of income-tax payers in relation to the scheme.  I think that he will have to raise that matter with the Minister for Finance. So far as the children's allowances scheme is concerned, everyone is in exactly the same position and is entitled to the children's allowances provided, of course, they comply with the conditions laid down.  As the Deputy knows, there is no means test. The point to which he referred arose out of the position that the Minister for Finance decided that simultaneously with the coming into operation of the Children's Allowances Act, allowances previously given in respect of income-tax should be modified so that persons in that class would not benefit financially. That was done under a Finance Act, and any modification of that provision would have to be made under a Finance Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know there is no intention to change the position. It was decided to put persons in the income-tax-paying class in this position that they could get the children's allowance the same as anybody else. Whether, in fact, they claimed the children's allowance to which they were entitled, they were going to lose this concession which they enjoyed under the income-tax code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was, could the income-tax payer not be deemed to be getting a proportion of what he used to get?  I think that under the income-tax code the allowance, in the case of a third child, was £40.  That meant that he was getting an allowance of 47/6.  Now he is only getting 2/6 a week.  Could there not be an arrangement between the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce whereby a smaller income-tax allowance could be made?  Where a person is paying income-tax twice a year there would be a saving of time in administration and a saving of time on the family if they could get their children's allowances by way of income-tax relief.</P>

      <P>No.  First of all, I would strongly oppose putting upon the Department of Industry and Commerce the obligation of segregating claimants into payers of income-tax and non-payers of income-tax.  The Department is not concerned at all with the financial circumstances of the applicant; the only thing the Department has to take into account is the number of children residing with him. Secondly, I think the Revenue Commissioners would have strong objection in principle in giving to the Department of Industry and Commerce or <Col N="464" /> anyone else a list of the names of persons paying income-tax.  They would, I think, regard that as information confidential to themselves which should not be made generally available.  Any other points that arise we could deal with on Committee.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate for a token sum is to enable a surplus in Appropriations-in-Aid and savings on salaries, wages and allowances to be applied to meet an excess expenditure on travelling expenses.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that there will be an excess expenditure of £2,700 on travelling expenses.  £1,000 of this excess represents extra travelling, mainly on school inspection work, by the staff of the architectural branch, and £1,600 is for increased travelling by the engineers in connection with arterial drainage surveys, which have proceeded on a larger scale than was anticipated when the original Estimate was framed. The balance of £100 is due mainly to the relaxation of emergency conditions, which has had an effect in facilitating necessary travelling generally.</P>
      <P>There will be a surplus of some £2,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid.  Requisitions during the year for works on an agency service basis by outside bodies (such as the British Office of Works, Central Bank, etc.) have been more numerous than was expected and, accordingly, the amount recoverable as administrative expenses will be greater than estimated.  Services rendered by the technical staffs in connection with employment schemes have also been greater than was anticipated and will result in an increased amount becoming recoverable from the Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes.</P>
      <P>Difficulty has been experienced in filling posts in the architectural branch. As a result there will be a saving on sub-head A which will be sufficient to meet the balance, £700, of the excess expenditure on travelling expenses.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1946, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 58, and No. 34 of 1928), including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is concerned only with one sub-head of the <Col N="467" /> Forestry Vote.  It is a Token Estimate introduced solely to obtain the approval of the Dáil for the payment of an increased grant to University College, Dublin, in connection with forestry research.</P>
    <P>Since 1942-1943 the university authorities have been engaged, at the request of my Department, in the pursuit of a detailed survey of insect pests injurious to forest trees.  An expert, a graduate of the university, with special qualifications, chosen by the college authorities, has been employed fulltime on the work and has surveyed carefully not only State forest areas but also private woodlands throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  It was originally planned to complete the survey of both insect pests and fungi within a three-year period which expired last summer.  The magnitude of the task, however, prevented completion of the insect survey within the three years and little more than a preliminary survey of fungi was practicable.  A full report of the three years' work was made available to my Department some months ago through the university authorities and has been carefully studied by the Departmental experts concerned with forestry matters.  They tell me that the survey, even in its present incomplete state, has proved well worth while.  Additional and valuable information was obtained in regard to pests which were already known to represent a danger in Irish woodlands.  Data were also obtained in regard to other pests, the prevalence of which to a dangerous extent was for the first time discovered, and attention was directed to the presence in this country of pests which have caused grave damage in other countries and which will require special control and preventive measures in the event of more widespread attacks in Irish forests.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, subject to the approval of the Dáil, to continue the arrangement made with the university for a further period of two years, in order to permit of completion of the work in connection with insect pests and to <Col N="468" /> provide for a detailed survey of injurious fungi.</P>
    <P>The rate of annual grant to the university during the initial three-year survey was £200.  The total cost to the State in respect of that three years amounts to only £600.  It has been agreed between my Department and the university that the annual rate of grant should be increased to £300 during the further two years for which the survey will be continued and the Supplementary Estimate has been introduced for the purpose of obtaining the Dáil's approval for that course. A sum of £200 was provided for the grant in the original Vote for Forestry for this year.  An additional sum of £134 is provided in the Supplementary Estimate, so that the total provision in the financial year will be £334.  This sum comprises one instalment of £67 of the initial grant which should have been met out of the Vote for 1944-45 but which was not issued out of the Grant-in-Aid before the close of that year, the final instalment of £67 payable out of this year's Vote in respect of the original three years' grant and two instalments of £100 each in respect of the new grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think farmer-Deputies will fully appreciate the enormous damage that can be done by fungoid attacks on plants.  Similarly, I am sure that if a particular fungus grows on trees there must be similar destruction there.  Therefore, it is of vital importance that proper research should take place into the problems of fungoid attacks on our forests.  The Minister told us that a survey, a preliminary survey I take it, has been made of State forests and private forests as well all over the country and that it has revealed a lot of very useful information.  He did not inform the House as to the extent of that, nor did he tell us whether the moneys voted for the purpose have been spent altogether on the survey or not; whether it is necessary to experiment in order to find out how to control the attacks of these pests; or whether the control substances and treatment of fungi are known already to the experts at University College or to the technical <Col N="469" /> experts in the Department.  I think it is a very essential and vital work that the research workers were asked to perform.  Of course, it would be unfortunate if we went to the expense of planting new forests and then allowed fungus to destroy the useful work of plantation.</P>
      <P>When we are on the question of research, I should like to ask the Minister if there is any specific sum provided for other types of research, for instance, research as to the possibility of growing trees and producing wood, say, in bog areas where the Department have failed to establish timber up to this.  I have read that experiments have been carried out by other countries as to the possibility of establishing timber on lands that were believed to be unsuitable and on lands where it was impossible to establish trees heretofore.  In that respect, it is essential that sufficient money should be provided for research generally. This particular sum is provided for a specific purpose, to deal with the pest problem.  But I feel that the amount of money and the facilities provided for research generally by the Department are not nearly sufficient.  I know that it has been pointed out by the Minister and the Department that you want a reasonable degree of fertility in land in order to produce commercial timber.  But I think it might be possible, even from a scenic point of view, to get land covered by timber that is not useful for any other purpose and where we have failed to establish timber up to the present.  For that reason, I think the Minister might ask the House to vote a bigger sum of money in the future for research purposes. Facilities are available for experimental purposes at the Albert College and the National University for actual experiment on fungoid disease.  I should like to ask if these experiments are carried on in the vicinity of the college or is the treatment carried on all over the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  In regard to the normal pests from which we suffer, the cure is known when the incidence of the pest is discovered.  There are in the country some new pests&mdash;it even occurs in politics&mdash;but they are not unknown, as they have been known in other countries and the treatment for them is known.  Therefore, in regard to discovering the treatment, there is no need for research.  The research now is to discover the types of pest from which we normally suffer and the types from which we abnormally suffer due to the incidence of new arrivals.</P>

      <P>I think it would be far better if we discussed the various other points on the Forestry Bill, including this question of being able to plant trees on lands hitherto non-planted, or where they have been failures.  I am glad to see enthusiasm on the part of a farmer-Deputy of Fine Gael, as generally farmers are not too enthusiastic for forestry.  I think it is of very great importance that we should develop our forestry as far as possible Different trees grow on different soils and particularly the long-lived hard woods need more soil fertility than the pines.  That is one of the reasons why <Col N="471" /> we have been developing our forestry with more pine woods rather than with more native hard woods.  There have been experiments in the past and, naturally, there are at all times experiments going on into the type of tree most suitable for a particular locality and the effects on various trees in acid soils, particularly with certain adventitious aids like phosphates.  I have seen experiments carried out where, in one particular soil, planting the trees in the soil as it existed was a complete failure, whereas with the addition of certain phosphates to the soil we had a reasonably successful growth.  That is from my layman's point of view, and the Deputy will understand that better than I would of course.  I suppose phosphate treatment is rather expensive.</P>
      <P>We have only a certain limited amount of money for forestry.  For the moment, it is quite adequate, and, for the moment, the forestry policy is quite adequate to the needs of the country. If we could proceed at a faster pace, I would be very glad, as I am very much interested in it.  In my opinion, what constitutes, and will constitute, the great difficulty in the development of forestry is the difficulty of securing land suitable for forestry and it is a poor type of land that will not grow trees.  However, with the Deputy's permission, I prefer to discuss all this matter on the Forestry Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to say very much in connection with this Bill. It is a necessary Bill and I have no fears that the powers given to the Land Commission will be abused.  We hear of hundreds of houses all over the country, built for allottees, being left idle or sublet and it is time the Minister responsible should take action. All the talk about comparisons in the past with people evicted in the days of the landlords is so much bunkum, as the position is different now.  Anyone anxious to see the land properly used <Col N="472" /> and the houses built in the last 15 and 20 years not abused will realise that these powers are necessary.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was brought before the House I was not present, and a Deputy from my constituency, Deputy Flanagan, thought fit to make certain charges here.  It was not the first time he made such charges, and I think it would be improper for me, as a Deputy from the constituency concerned, to allow them to remain on record uncontradicted. He knew quite well in making those charges that they were untrue and, with your permission, I would put the thing straight before the House.  I believe the vast majority of the members of the House realise that this is the national Parliament and that we, at least, should have some sense of responsibility and decency and that statements made here should at least be true.  The statement referred to is found in the Dáil Report for the 31st January, column 337, and I will not take up much time with it.  Deputy Flanagan said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I must not forget that very serious allegations were made here by Deputies on the Opposition Benches against the Government for using political influence in the allocation of land and giving it to certain applicants.  I can speak with absolute authority, because I was for three years secretary of a Fianna Fáil Cumann in my constituency.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here is the important part:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was warned by Fianna Fáil headquarters, and by a Fianna Fáil Deputy from my constituency, to send no name to the Land Commission other than that of a Fianna Fáil applicant or a strong member of the Fianna Fáil Cumann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an absolute falsehood.  Fianna Fáil headquarters can speak for themselves, but I am the Fianna Fáil Deputy referred to here and the contrary is the fact.  As a Fianna Fáil member of this House, I am out for fair play and for a fair and impartial distribution of land.  I can say that every member of the House from time to time is asked to make representations on behalf of people who come to him and I make no apology to anyone for having made representations for <Col N="473" /> people who asked me to make them. However, in making those representations I knew, as all Deputies know, that the Land Commission inspector puts up the scheme in the first place to his superiors and that the responsibility rests, in the final resort, with the commissioners, who are responsible for the choosing of the applicants.  Deputy Flanagan goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I rose here to place those facts before the Minister for Lands, when his Estimate was under discussion, I was faced with the severest of criticism from Government Deputies, simply because they know they are still following the path which I walked off.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, he is wrong there again.  He did not walk off, but was expelled from the cumann for conduct which could not be tolerated in the organisation and he need not be trying to create that wrong impression.  He continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They have instructions from their organisation, from the Government, to see that the case of no applicant but that of a Fianna Fáil tout in the area is examined.  I am speaking with knowledge, because I am a man who once acted hand in hand with the Fianna Fáil Party in my constituency to keep many a decent man out of a farm, and I ask God's forgiveness for it.  I was associated with the Fianna Fáil Party for three long years and no man has more experience of the intrigue and treachery used...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan is telling his own story about his own activities and not speaking truthfully as regards the organisation to which I have the privilege to belong, or truthfully in regard to his fellow members of the Mountmellick Cumann, whom he charges here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is not speaking truthfully, either as regards the Land Commission inspectors, who have no opportunity of coming in here to defend themselves, or those others to whom he referred. If there was an inspector who could be influenced to do a wrong thing and <Col N="474" /> keep many decent men out of farms, as the Deputy mentioned here, then that inspector is not fit to be on the pay-roll of the Land Commission.  So far as I am concerned, I believe the Land Commission inspectors do their job fairly well and it is very unfair to make such charges against them, charges which cannot be substantiated. I challenge Deputy Flanagan to produce the name of one decent person who was in any way interfered with in getting his rights.  I further challenge the Deputy to prove that there was any undue percentage of Fianna Fáil supporters who got land in the few divisions&mdash;not the several divisions which the Deputy mentioned&mdash;which took place down there.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this denial of the allegations, the wrong statements, made by Deputy Flanagan, will go on the records of the House, and I hope also that in the Press of this country these denials will be given the same publicity as was given to the allegations made by the Deputy last week.</P>

      <P>Briefly, the attitude of the Labour Party towards this Bill is that where dwellings are provided on these holdings it would be absolutely indefensible to permit these dwellings to remain unoccupied for an indefinite period, having regard to the housing conditions as we see them through the country.  That is one aspect.  The second is that we are particularly concerned with Section 4 of the Bill, which gives arbitrary power to the Land Commission in so far as the issuing of a certificate with regard to good husbandry is concerned.  We propose to submit an amendment in order to ensure that an individual who, through no fault of his own, but through lack of equipment, domestic circumstances or other factors, finds himself in difficulties, will not be penalised as a result of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We take the view that since the Land Commission was responsible for the allocation of these holdings and since, in the light of the Minister's statement, serious results have accrued, it would not be a correct procedure to designate the Land Commission as being the one and only institution <Col N="475" /> that should issue that certificate in so far as good husbandry may be associated with the particular allottees. We would like to see, as a result of Section 4, some institution associated with the Land Commission in that decision regarding the certificate of good husbandry.</P>
    <P>We also take the view that you will continue to have trouble in connection with allocations until fundamental factors are taken into consideration by the Land Commission, factors which apparently were not taken into consideration in a number of these cases. One of the conditions we would name is adequate equipment to ensure that the allottee is in a position effectively to manage the holding allotted to him. So far as the Bill is concerned, we propose to vote for it.</P>

      <P>When this Land Bill came before the House we expected a more comprehensive measure.  We who come from the congested areas are very disappointed with regard to the operations of the Land Commission.  The man responsible for the operations of the Land Commission is the Minister, who is the head of that Department. It is rather funny to find that in the county I come from there are 6,000 acres in the hands of the Land Commission and much of that land has been in their possession for ten and even 15 years.  Every time I and any of my colleagues address a question to the Minister asking him when he intends to have the land allocated, we get a very unsatisfactory reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain how it is that the Department which comes under his care is not more effective and is not prepared to see that the land already in its possession is divided among the people living in the congested areas of County Mayo. We believe there is almost sufficient land in County Mayo which, if properly allocated, would meet the congested conditions that exist there.  If the Minister feels that that is not so, then he, or at least his predecessors, should have taken care, when selecting allottees or small farmers for migration, that they were men prepared to <Col N="476" /> work and cultivate the land they were about to get.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has information on the subject and, therefore, I would like to know how it came about that men were selected who had not the foggiest idea of land cultivation and who had no desire or vocation so far as land is concerned.  How is it they got 20 acres and a house and equipment?  The inspectors must know that these men knew nothing about farming.  If I go into rural Ireland or walk through a country village, I have not to ask anybody whether a farmer is a good or a bad farmer.  No matter what size of holding he may possess&mdash; he may have only two, three or five acres&mdash;if I have a look at his haggard, at his fields or at his potato crop, be it small or large, I can tell whether he is a clean or a bad farmer and whether he is a suitable person to be allowed to migrate to the midlands at considerable expense to the tax-payer.</P>
    <P>Now, at this late hour, the Minister tells us that a big percentage of their work has been in vain and that the only alternative is to come to this House for extreme powers to turn unfortunate human beings out on the roadside, leaving them with no hope for the future.  If a Bill of that type was introduced in Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy, we would have big headlines in the paper.  But here you have it happening in Ireland, where we are supposed to have a democratic Parliament.  Here we have a Government and the Minister responsible for the actions of the Land Commission, and the Land Commission inspectors and higher executive officers are responsible for picking these allottees and bringing them up, during the last 15 or 20 years, to the Midlands. We find that these men who got the land do not want it.  Is not that a rather peculiar state of affairs?  Here is what the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the year 1944 it was decided to set up a special section of the Land Commission staff to deal with investigation for usership, and since then inspection has proceeded in a more systematic way.  Including some reinspections in cases already <Col N="477" /> brought to notice by previous investigation, nearly 4,000 holdings and parcels have been inspected for usership during the past year, and of these some 700 were found unsatisfactory&mdash;17½ per cent.  Sixty-nine of some 1,250 houses on holdings covered by this inspection were found to be unoccupied.  Outside this systematic inspection, some 400 additional cases of non-residence and 450 cases of unsatisfactory user have been brought to notice individually, making a total of 1,150 unsatisfactory user....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Should not the Government, the Department and the Minister responsible for this state of affairs feel ashamed?  Should they not be ashamed to have to come back to the House to ask for powers which no democratic Parliament would or could give to a government, in view of the fact that the position created is due to misgovernment and to the fact that poor people from the West of Ireland, from Donegal and elsewhere, with little knowledge of land cultivation, were brought up and given land which they were not perhaps capable of working or which they could not work for want of finance to secure machinery, ploughs, harrows, horses and other necessary implements?</P>
    <P>Now we find the Minister prepared to turn these people out on the roadside, unless they toe the line and do exactly as the Land Commission official tells them.  What is to happen to a man who, just before getting a holding in the Midlands, got married, and who, since then, has been blessed with five or six children?  He may have contracted a nervous ailment, tuberculosis, or some other disease, with the result that he is not fit to work the land to the satisfaction of the Land Commission.  What does the Minister propose to do with such a man, if he is to be thrown out on the roadside?  The Minister tells us that he will be considerate, but that individual has no appeal.  There is no appeal board before which he can go to oppose the decision of the Land Commission agent.</P>
    <P>I consider the Minister's action very high-handed and I consider that he is <Col N="478" /> seeking too much power in seeking our approval of the provisions of Section 4. As other Deputies have said, it is the same as a man being brought into court, being found guilty of a crime and being sentenced to 12 months' hard labour.  Notwithstanding the fact that he is doing 12 months, the court goes on to confiscate all his property, with the result that he has nothing to come back to.  The Land Commission agent goes down and condemns a man for bad husbandry and notwithstanding that he will be punished in that his land is taken from him, he is to be thrown out on the roadside without a home or means of earning a livelihood. Is that what we are to expect from this Government?  Is that the situation which this Government has brought into being?  We are confident that the Government are responsible for the situation.</P>
    <P>Many Fianna Fáil Deputies have tried to deny that political pressure was used in respect of the division of land.  Political pressure was used and will be used so far as the picking and choosing of small farmers from the West of Ireland who are to be sent to the Midlands.  It is well known in the area from which I come and in various other parts of County Mayo who were the people picked and selected for migration and it is a well-known fact that it was not always the best type of tenant who was picked.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick made a very wise suggestion on the previous night which the Land Commission should consider, that is, that, in selecting allottees, the Land Commission should pick the type of small farmer who, first, is prepared to migrate&mdash;we do not say he should be forced&mdash;and, secondly, who proved beyond yea or nay capable of cultivating the little farm he had in accordance with the standards the Land Commission would expect, and should give these men decent holdings of 20 acres, 30 acres or whatever acreage they are prepared to give.  They would then take the little farmer along the western seaboard with a small acreage, the man with the less arable type of land, such as a reclaimed bog, and place him on the little farms which have been vacated.  They will be more suited to <Col N="479" /> that type of land than to the land in the Midlands.  The jump is too great in many instances.</P>
    <P>The vocation of some of these people is not the cultivation of land.  Many of them are fishermen and many have other callings.  Many of them were accustomed to go to England year after year.  If the Minister would leave it to the discretion of the Land Commission officials, he would find that they would do the job and do it well. He should tell them that they must make their selections irrespective of any influence which may be used by a Fianna Fáil cumann, a Clann na Talmhan club, a Fine Gael club or any other club.  Leave it to their discretion, and let them pick the most suitable tenants, and I am sure that the men selected will prove worthy.  I have never yet known any decent farmer or any man willing to till and cultivate his land whom a Land Commission agent could tell how his land should be cultivated.  Most of them know damned little about the cultivation of land, and it would be too bad if any official from the Land Commission should be given power to go down, with his bag under his arm, to my father's place and tell him how to cultivate his land.  What do they know about the cultivation of land?  Admittedly, if they see docks, thistles or nettles growing on the land, they know it is wrong, but there are times when that cannot be helped.</P>
    <P>We propose to vote against the giving of these powers, not because we do not want land divided, but because we believe that all this mess is due to the interference carried on during the past 15 years, particularly with the inspectors of the Land Commission. We believe that the Minister's predecessors&mdash;not the Minister, because he has been here only for a short time &mdash;who were responsible to this House failed in their duty in not seeing to it that the Land Commission carried out their work in an above-board fashion. How many farmers migrated under the British Government and migrated under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government have proved to be duds? How many of those will now be thrown out?  I should like to have the figures, so that I might know how many will <Col N="480" /> be thrown out under these new powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be a very softhearted man who would not like to see a poor man with his wife and children thrown on the roadside, but he will know nothing about it.  It is the agent working in his name who will read the Riot Act, like the landlord of old, who, sitting in his Park Lane mansion, enjoying wealth and luxury at the expense of the poor tenants of this country and wanting to remove one of his tenants, instructed his agent to tell the tenant to get out.  The agent then went down and read the Riot Act and the red caps, the police and the crowbar brigade soon got him out.  There was no appeal board then.  There is no appeal board under this Bill.  The Land Commission is reverting to the position of the landlord, so that its agent will go down and tell those people when they should get out or get in.  If the right type of farmer had been selected there would be no necessity for that.  In my county we have hundreds and thousands of young men who are quite prepared to migrate and cultivate the land because there is a shortage of land in their areas.  That is why we have thousands of young men in my county going over to Great Britain year after year.  If the Minister's Department and the Government had divided the land properly they could have done so on a five-year plan and have completed the work in that period.</P>
    <P>I hold and maintain that land division is held up for political purposes and for propaganda at election times.  The people are then told that the land is about to be divided, that they are going to be migrated and that they will get this, that and the other. But, in the last five or seven years so little has been done in the way of land division that we still have congestion in my county.  The Land Commission itself has 6,000 or 7,000 acres of land in that county, some of it for the past 15 years, and what I want to ask the Minister is: what is he going to do about it?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon will say that when I and others talk about land division we are land grabbers.  I am not.  The people believe, and I believe, that both Davitt and Parnell fought for the <Col N="481" /> division of the land amongst the tenants of the country.  They did not fight for fixity of tenure so that it could be used for the protection of a man having 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 acres of land.  Deputy Dillon thinks that we are going to nationalise the land and hand it over to the State, or that we are going to remove fixity of tenure. I would not object to the removal of fixity of tenure if it helped to speed up land division and did away with the congestion that exists.  I do not think there is any necessity to abolish fixity of tenure in order to have land division speeded up, and the work finished once and for all.  If there is nay sincerity in the Minister or his Department he will take immediate steps to settle this land question.  If necessary, let a loan of £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 be floated in order to settle the question.  If not, then some other Minister sitting in the Minister's place will not require half the pressing that he is getting to settle it, and will do so within five or six years.</P>
    <P>We are told that the work cannot be done because of the emergency.  But, surely, the emergency should not prevent the Land Commission from dividing land and making sod fences. We have plenty of shovels and spades to do that work.  We have the maps and we have plenty of qualified engineers to get the work done.  Why is it not being done?  We have tens of thousands of our young men going over to England, and when we ask questions about land division we are told that, because of the emergency, the land cannot be divided.  I say that is all humbug and tommy rot.  It is an insult to the Minister's intelligence that he should make a statement of that kind.</P>
    <P>We are going to vote against this Bill not because we do not desire to see the mess that exists at the moment cleared up, but because we feel that the Minister is taking to himself powers which are not necessary, and which certainly will be abused in the case of the helpless people who have been migrated to the Midlands.  They will suffer, and the Minister has not said what he is going to do with them. The Irish people are very sympathetic, but they are not going to stand for any <Col N="482" /> Government, whether it be British or Irish, that would attempt to use the methods of the crowbar brigade.  I say woe betide the Land Commission agents that would come into the part of the country that I belong to and attempt that.  They would meet with the same medicine as the landlords' agents did.  That is the spirit which is alive in rural Ireland to-day.  The people there are prepared to die for and to defend even the bad farmers who have been put on land through the incompetence of the Land Commission. We will defend those people, and are not prepared to give the powers asked for in this Bill.  Not only is power being taken to punish those persons, but to confiscate their bit of property as well.  When that is done they are to be thrown out on the roadside with no home to go to and with no guarantee for the future.  For these reasons we are going to oppose this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the fact that I was suffering from an attack of the 'flu I was not able to be here for the Minister's opening statement.  In the atmosphere which is being created by some of the speeches made on this Bill, I have been wondering whether we are living in the days of an Irish parliament or whether we have gone back again to the old days or coercion and all that that word connotes.  I have the habit of facing up to the realities of most positions.  In this case I must bear testimony to most of the facts stated by the Minister in his opening speech.  I have personal experience of what the Minister has stated, that some of those allottees who got decent farms of 30, 40 or 50 acres did not use them as they should have been used. Some of those farms were value for, roughly, £1,000.  Deputies should remember that all that money did not come out of the pockets of the farmers. A good share of it was contributed by the general taxpayers, by men living in the back lanes in the City of Cork, the City of Dublin, Limerick or Waterford. With all respect to my friend here from the North or South Mayo, their representatives have a perfect right to intervene in a debate of this kind and criticise.  I know a man who <Col N="483" /> got a good tract of land as a result of his activities.  I am not aware whether his activities were supplemented by his work as a member of a Fianna Fáil club or any other club.  What I do know is that the inspectors of the Land Commission are a fair body of men. They are human like the rest of us and may make a mistake, but I have the very gravest doubt that any member of the inspection staff of the Land Commission would be influenced by any Fianna Fáil club, any Fine Gael club or any other club.  From what I know of the records of those men I have the utmost confidence in them.  From the facts mentioned by Deputy Cafferky and by the Minister, there are 1,150 persons who cannot be considered as desirable allottees.  Take the case of the man in a city who does not act up to his responsibility and pay his rent, he is evicted, and when that takes place there are no brass bands out.  It is time that we got rid of a lot of moonshine. We are not dealing with a foreign Government.  We are dealing with a native Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this Bill may I refer to a question which was on the Order Paper to-day?  It referred to the division of land in some part of the County Mayo.  The landlord, Mr. Michael Begley, was tilling his land in accordance with the best traditions of good husbandry.  He is to be fired out by the Land Commission and allottees put in on his land, according to the Deputy who put down the question.  He complained of the slowness of the Land Commission in dividing such land.  As a city man, I cannot understand why anyone should want to get rid of that man and put other people on to his land if he is working it in the best interests of the community.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the Minister will see to it that there will be some kind of appeal.  What form it will take I do not know nor can I suggest anything at the moment.  Whether it should be a judge of the High Court or some official appointed by the Land Commission or by the Minister, I do not know, but I feel that something will be done because there has been a consensus of opinion in the House that <Col N="484" /> some appeal court should be available before a man is evicted.</P>
    <P>Many things have been said during the course of the debate which I feel are not in accordance with the facts. The Land Commission has been charged with being very slow.  Some people forget that this is a constitutional assembly and that the landlord has certain rights.  Property owners have certain rights.  These rights cannot be filched from them and land or property of any kind cannot be taken without the whole procedure of law.  Of course, if you abolish that and use the policy of force, then you are no longer a constitutional institution or a constitutional government and the law courts will be brought into contempt.  A challenge has been issued by Deputy Cafferky that they will oppose bitterly anything of this character, even though the Land Commission may be quite justified in evicting.  That is a very harsh thing to say.  Of course, if I were on the side of the angels, I could join in the cry of &ldquo;Stop thief&rdquo; but I am not built that way.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have certain responsibilities to the community. They have undertaken these responsibilities and they are endeavouring to carry out their duties to the best of their ability and to give a fair crack of the whip all round.  If they are slow, it is due to the legal procedure that has to be gone through before the land is divided.  There are many reasons which, I am sure, are well known to most Deputies, why land is not divided as speedily as one could sell a lb. of tea over the counter but I do certainly object to any suggestion of force being used against the Land Commission, even if they have to evict.  It is very dangerous to use the old term &ldquo;grabbers&rdquo; but if the taxpayers of this country give a man a farm and a house, to the value, roughly, of £1,000, is it not up to the Land Commission to see that that person makes the best use of the land, in the interests of the community?  I say they have a moral and a legal responsibility in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The best business people make mistakes and I am quite certain that the Land Commissioners and the inspectors of the Land Commission will admit, as a result of the experience they have gained, that they put in certain persons who were entirely unfit but they did not know that at the beginning.  They accepted these people at their face value. Most of them, I am quite certain, claimed that they were farmers' sons, evicted tenants' sons, or had some other claim on the land. As a matter of fact, many people are beginning seriously to think whether or not land division has gone too far. That seems a revolutionary statement to make here but I am beginning to think that, as a result of the discussion I have heard.  I think the slowing up process is a very useful process before another mistake is made of putting 1,150 persons into occupation of land which they will not use in the interest of themselves and their families.  We all have sympathy with the farmers. Not one of us can go back a generation without having some member of the family a farmer.  While I have some sympathy with the poor fellow who, because of sickness, disease, family circumstances, does not till his land in the way it should be tilled, again I realise that we are not dealing with the old landlord class; we are dealing with our own people and I am quite certain that every leniency will be shown to those people who, as Deputy Cafferky said, have suffered from some sort of disability.  Due consideration will be given to all these factors before any allottee is evicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feeling is borne in on me as a result of the debate that the process instead of being speeded up should be slowed up so that this kind of mistake <Col N="486" /> will not be made again.  With the exception of Section 4, I fully support this measure.  I have the greatest sympathy in the world with the inspectors from the Department&mdash;and I am not looking for land for myself or for anyone else&mdash;I have the greatest sympathy with those officers of the State who go out and do their best and then meet with the kind of criticism we have heard.  I do not believe that these men were influenced one way or the other by Fianna Fáil clubs or anybody of that character.  I know something about the ramifications of Fianna Fáil clubs and I tell them what I think of them at times, but I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that influence was not brought to bear in this case.  I know too much of how some of the higher civil servants and some of the rank and file of the Civil Service do their work.  I know they are not persons who could be corrupted or bribed in that respect.  Even if it is only one small voice, I think I am justified in raising it in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to take part in the debate because I thought there would not be a very long discussion on this Bill, simply because I expected the Bill would be accepted in its entirety by every Party in the House.  This Bill is designed to deal with people who obtained land from the State and who did not make proper use of that land.  In the first instance, such people signed an agreement with the Land Commission that they would make proper use of the land, that they would use it according to the methods of good husbandry and that they would live in the houses provided for them by the State.  Those who were landless men convinced the Land Commission inspector that they had a certain amount of capital to work the land before the inspector would recommend them for land.  In view of the exaggerated statements that have been made in the House on this Bill by three or four Deputies, it would be well, I think, to let the House know that, in my opinion, Deputy Bennett from the Fine Gael Benches has given a truer picture of conditions in estates allotted by the Land Commission than any other Deputy.  Speaking from <Col N="487" /> casual observation of conditions in County Meath, where the Land Commission have divided a large acreage of land, I can assure the House that the majority of allottees, be they migrants from the West of Ireland, the South, or the North, or local allottees, are making fair, good use of their holdings and are living in the holdings and rearing their families on the holdings.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to deal with the people who are not making proper use of their holdings, and Deputy Cafferky, from the West, can rest assured that if the transferee who has come into the County Meath or the Midlands from the West of Ireland is making proper use of his holding, if he is living in the holding and working it, the Land Commission, in no circumstances, will interfere with his occupation of that holding.  The Land Commission inspector in dividing an estate in the Midlands is bound by certain rules and regulations.  The dispossessed employee must get consideration from the Land Commission. He is losing his job and the Land Commission have gone so far as to say to the inspector that the dispossessed employee must get preference, and rightly so.  Local people, who have uneconomic holdings within a certain distance of that estate, must get additions to those holdings from the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission inspectors are not concerned with the political opinion of either the dispossessed employees or the local congests in the selection of people for land.  The only instances in which the inspectors could be challenged with giving political preference to applicants is in the case of landless men.  In the case of landless men and everybody else the Land Commission inspectors in their recommendations to the Land Comsioners give a preference for services of a certain kind to this nation when the nation was fighting for its freedom. I know cases of landless men in the County Meath who obtained land from the Land Commission and who are not members of the Fianna Fáil Party but the Fine Gael Party and who served <Col N="488" /> in the I.R.A. prior to the Truce and in the National Army before the Civil War.  They are making good use of that land.  They got that land from the Land Commission when this Government was in power.  From 1932 up to the present such persons have obtained land in the County Meath and they were not at any time members of the Fianna Fáil Party but were definitely opposed to that Party. Within the last 12 months a prominent Fine Gael member of the Meath County Council obtained a parcel of land from the Land Commission and he is making good use of his land.</P>
    <P>I mention these facts to show the House that it is not true that Fianna Fáil clubs divide the land in the Midlands. If Deputy Flanagan would tell the House the truth, he would have to say that he wrote more letters to the Land Commission complaining about inspectors passing over members of Fianna Fáil clubs than he did to obtain land, by his influence as secretary of a Fianna Fáil club, for landless men who were looking for land.  If other Deputies would also tell the truth, it would be found that members of Fianna Fáil clubs in County Meath have the public support of Deputies who are not members of the Fianna Fáil Party in their protest against the Land Commission's stand in not dividing land along political lines in the County Meath.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission provides not alone for migration from the West of Ireland to the County Meath but also for migration within the County Meath from areas which are congested.  The congestion within the county, however, is small in comparison with the congestion which exists along the western seaboard.  I have every sympathy with those living in congested areas along the western seaboard.  I realise as much as any Deputy that the Land Commission is a national body administering a land policy for the whole of the country.  Every citizen is interested in the operation of the Land Commission and people from every parish are catered for by the Land Commission. People, whether they come from the West of Ireland, or the North of Ireland, or anywhere else, who think that <Col N="489" /> the claims of local people should not be considered in the division of estates in the Midands are making a mistake. They must never have heard of such a person as Laurence Ginnell.  They do not realise that down to the 1800's the people of Meath and Westmeath were evicted from their holdings and the descendants of the evicted people are still living in these districts where estates have been divided or have not yet been divided.  These people think that, in justice, they have as much claim to consideration as the people who live along the western seaboard. Within the memory of our grandfathers and fathers the roads of our county were black with the people who were driven from the good, rich land of Meath and Westmeath and the descendants of these people think that they have a claim to a holding of land on these divided estates just as much as the people who live in small holdings in the West or in the South.</P>
    <P>The migrants in County Meath were slandered in this House during this debate.  It was stated that you could not walk through the village of Athboy owing to the conduct of these migrants. I wish to protest against that statement. The majority of the migrants working these holdings are as decent men and women as you will meet in any part of Ireland.  The Celt is the same whether he comes from Fair Head or from Cork.  Such statements bring this House into disrepute and the administration into disrepute.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with the negative side of the activities of the Land Commission. The Minister said that there were 1,100 holdings involved and that this Bill would, in the main, be concerned with 1,100 holdings.  He did not tell us the number of small holdings created by the Land Commission.  Some time ago he stated in the House that there were 76,000 holdings to be vested in the tenants.  If there are 76,000 to be vested and 1,100 families have failed to make good on their holdings, I think that, on these figures alone, the work of the Land Commission is worthy of more praise than it has got from Deputies.  If the Land Commission has succeeded in establishing 76,000 holdings <Col N="490" /> and the majority of the allottees are making good on the land and producing food from it, I think the Land Commission have done a good day's work.  I hope that in the near future, when conditions become better, the Land Commission will proceed to extend the work until the land question is settled for ever.  The land question is not of our making; the land question was made for us.  The question of the land and land division have been so closely related to the struggle for national freedom that it is very difficult to separate them.</P>
    <P>All this comparing of these 1,100 people with the people that Michael Davitt and Parnell, a former representative from the County Meath, stood for, is taking a wrong view of the matter. They were interested in farmers struggling to make a living on the land, but this Bill deals with people who are making no effort whatsoever to make a living on the land.  The Minister and the Land Commission wish to see that the land so occupied shall be given to those people who will make use of it.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, in regard to all lands, whether they are given to an allottee by the Land Commission, whether they are purchased by a person or whether they are handed down in the family from generation to generation, the State maintains that the State has the right, in times of national emergency and otherwise, to insist on the users of that land producing food on it for the people.  In this Bill, no powers of an extraordinary nature are being taken, as far as I can see, to deal with the problem, but the whole tenor of this debate, in so far as three or four Deputies are concerned, has been to try to prove to the House and to the public generally that land was divided on a political basis.  I deny that charge and say here now that, if one particular Deputy who made the charge, Deputy Dillon, had to substantiate it, he would do as he did when he was before the Railway Tribunal and say he never made any charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody reading the figures in the Minister's statement <Col N="491" /> must be convinced that the failures are much wider and greater than those of migrants from the West into Meath. Various people seem to think that the problem is confined purely to the migrants from the West.  I would remind the House that the figures given by the Minister must necessarily deal with migrants over the entire country. The alarming figures of 1,100 failures cannot be so alarming when taken from the whole country.  I have the opinion that these are not the kind of failures one would imagine at first reading.  I do not think they failed because of complete incompetence in the working of the land.  I am rather inclined to the other view, that it is not difficult in rural Ireland to find anyone who knows sufficient about land to work it reasonably well, provided they get the proper equipment, and I believe that many of the failures will be found to be due to the fact that they were given holdings without suitable equipment or suitable finances to get the necessary machinery to put the holding in proper order.  A previous speaker has referred to one of the conditions in the regulations, whereby employees on an estate being divided rightly get the first preference. Those people, because of their agricultural pursuits with their employer, have proven their capacity to work a holding for themselves, but they are given a 25 or a 30-acre holding, one which, according to the nature of the soil, is considered an economic holding, and are given a house.  I suggest that such a man, for a few years, is not capable of working the holding, as he has no funds and there is no provision in the Land Commission code to give him any financial assistance.  The best he can do is to let it to someone who wants hay and then go to the county council and try to work for them, to keep the wolf from the door.  I have known the Land Commission to treat these cases very kindly.  On more than one occasion I have had to go to the Land Commission and appeal to them not to enforce the regulations in such cases but to give the man a chance to build up a fund to work the land.  I have known some of those people who made good and who are doing well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Land Commission had <Col N="492" /> power to take possession.  While this seems to be a drastic Bill, I think the same powers were vested in the Land Commission before they introduced this Bill at all, or at least they thought they had those powers, and it was only when they went into court that they found they had not got them.  I would like to remind Deputies that we are working under the old Land Commission regulations and Acts.  We must all have thought that what was set out in the Statute Book was capable of being enforced, but it took a judge to tell us otherwise.  What we are really doing is pipping the i's and crossing the t's of what was contained in previous legislation.  If that is so, I do not think there is anything to be alarmed about and I believe it is the intention to try to secure the best possible use of the land.  I agree with that principle.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we are a bit squeamish about Section 4, which seems to be very drastic.  There should be some sort of appeal to prove the failures which are alleged by the report of the inspector.  In the first analysis or in the last it is based on the Land Commission inspector's report. Against those people it is charged that they have been putting so many unsuitable people on the land. No one said they were infallible, but if they were not infallible in putting in the wrong people, they may make mistakes also by putting out some of the successful workers.  There ought to be some kind of appeal, as under this all that is required is the seal of the Land Commission.  That is to be satisfactory proof that the man has been a complete flop, that he has failed hopelessly, and he is fired out on the road.  Why should there be any objection to some form of appeal?  What is the investigation required before an appeal is fixed?  We have not been told what machinery is to be set up to make a satisfactory investigation and ensure that those put out will be the incorrigibles. I am perfectly sure the Minister meant what he said when he told the House it was the incorrigibles he was after.  No one wants to shelter them, but there is grave danger that people other than they will be caught in the mesh.  The Minister should cast <Col N="493" /> round for some more democratic method to ensure there will be no hardship under Section 4.</P>
    <P>It comes to my mind at the moment that use could be made of the county committees of agriculture.  These are people drawn from all Parties in the country and supposed to be well versed in agriculture.  They could be utilised in some form or another to come in as a kind of court between the Land Commission and the men who are to be thrown out on the road.  They will be able to intervene and say whether or not a man had definitely failed and was a flop who should be thrown out. Some appeal should be left, rather than the remote figure of some inspector coming in and making his report to the Land Commission, the seal being affixed, and the next thing being the battering ram.  I am sure the Minister would be a very unhappy man if ever he came to that time and had to evict fellows out of Land Commission holdings, and I am sure he would be the last man to do anything like that. However, when laws are passed, it is not a question of the Minister there now but a question of what happens under the auspices of whatever Minister is holding the fort.  Before the Bill is passed, some effort should be made to secure a guarantee of some appeal, to ensure that people will not be thrown out on the road under some misapprehension or mistake.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of play regarding the regulation that the allottees should reside in the houses. Many holdings given by the Land Commission had no residences at all and they were well worked, although the allottee had to live in a cottage or shebeen, sometimes fairly remote. There were, of course, houses which were built by the Land Commission on very easy terms and where the contribution to be paid, in addition to the annuity, was most reasonable and as easy as any Irishman could ask for. However, I had one case where a house was built for the Land Commission by a contractor and it was absolutely uninhabitable and remained so for many years.  It has recently been repaired and it is only now&mdash;and I cannot say even now&mdash;that it is satisfactory <Col N="494" /> for the occupant.  No one could ask a man to go into a house unfit for human habitation.  I have only one case in mind at the moment and I see the Minister looking very hard at me about it&mdash;it is the Black and Tan one.  You cannot sweep all the people into one mesh, but must take cases as you find them.  There must be individual consideration of the circumstances of each case and in regard to many of these supposed failures I am not prepared to accept that they were failures.  They want an investigation. If they have been warned and cautioned and do not conform with requirements, then you can take drastic action.  But we need not be too drastic about it.  The very fact of a measure of this kind being passed, will act as sufficient warning.  Already the Minister has evicted 90 people and a whole lot of others may go in the meantime.  If you find 90 have been put out already, before this measure has been passed, why be so alarmed about the powers it contains?</P>
    <P>As regards the selection of tenants in order to make sure that they are suitable, I do not desire to enter into the political hurly-burly at all. There will be enough of that.  There has been so much political slanging that we have almost lost track of the Land Bill.  It is all hurly-burly.  I will say that the Land Commission inspectors are very much handicapped in the selection of suitable men and one of the regulations that ties their hands is the distance regulation.  A landless man must live within half a mile of the estate to be divided and an uneconomic holder must live within one mile of the estate.  I know of a case where an estate was being divided and a man living five-eighths of a mile away &mdash;the distance was carefully measured &mdash;was ruled out.  In the case of a landless man, because he was a mile and an eighth away he, too, was ruled out. The next farm to be divided would be probably 60 miles from him and once he is ruled out from the first farm, he is ruled out for life.</P>
    <P>That type of thing has caused very severe hardship.  I have known good working agriculturists who have been <Col N="495" /> deprived of land because they did not fit into any scheme of division.  Estates were divided north, south, east and west of them, but none came within their ambit.  When estates in their neighbourhood were divided they were unfortunate enough to be ruled out by the distance regulation.  They are not considered suitable as migrants and they want to live in their own counties. I have had evidence of the hardship that is caused in ruling out desirable people because of this cast-iron regulation about the half-mile and mile radius.</P>
    <P>The inspectors have not the free scope that some people seem to think they have, apart altogether from any question of influence.  So far as influence is concerned, I have tried to get holdings for people.  I succeeded in doing so&mdash;at least, my nominees were successful, but whether my influence helped I do not know.  I was unsuccessful more times than I was successful.  I have never charged it against the inspectors that they were influenced or biassed.  I think that they have been doing as square a job inside cast-iron regulations&mdash;which really ought to be amended&mdash;in order to select a suitable type of tenant and I believe that if they got more scope in that way there would be less cause for complaint about unsuitable people being put into holdings.  If these inspectors doing the job for the Land Commission got a little more freedom in their work they would, knowing local circumstances, pick suitable men and you would have less cause for complaint. My only concern is that I think Section 4 will require some investigation in order to see if something less drastic could not be inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Cafferky, I come from an area where there is an awful lot of congestion and, having lived to this stage on a congested holding, I think I can claim that I know as much&mdash;perhaps not more, but at least as much&mdash;about congestion and land division as any Deputy who has spoken so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> The first thing that I will do is I will compliment the Minister, not for introducing the Bill, but for being honest enough to admit the failure of the Land Commission and the failure of his predecessors in office.  We know that it is gall and brimstone to anybody, even the smallest schoolboy, to have to eat humble pie and admit he has done something wrong.  But when a responsible Department like the Irish Land Commission has to admit that it has done wrong and that it has exercised bad management, then it must be very galling.  It must also be galling to a Government who claim that they are almost infallible in everything.  Therefore, I compliment the Minister on being so far the most honest Minister for Lands that we have had.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it, 21½ per cent. is too big a percentage of failures in any scheme.  I think it was Deputy Corry who said that in every walk of life we will have failures.  We will have failures on the land, failures in the different professions, and I suppose we will have failures in politics, but still and all, in the choice of applicants for land, a good deal of what has to be remedied now could have been offset if a little more attention was paid to the types who were selected.  That may be very hard to do.  When a Land Commission inspector goes into an area he will find it very hard to decide who is the most suitable applicant to migrate; he will find it very hard to decide who is the most suitable uneconomic holder or the most suitable landless man.  But he should not be influenced in any way by a political party.</P>
    <P>There have been charges made that Fianna Fáil cumainn and clubs have had a certain amount of the distribution of lands under their thumb. How right that is I do not know; it may be right and it may be wrong&mdash; arguments have been put up for and against.  Candidly, I know that in my locality&mdash;I will speak in a fair and honest manner&mdash;Fianna Fáil supporters have been victimised, but the reason was quite simple because, in order to victimise them, the Land Commission <Col N="497" /> found themselves in this position.  If they gave these people land they would be coming down on the head of one of their own best supporters, so it was a case of &ldquo;We will victimise those who are the smallest rather than turn one of our outstanding supporters against us&rdquo;.  That man happened to be the rancher in the locality, and they could not take land from one of their own rancher friends and give it to others, even though they were supporters. They chose what to them was the lesser of two evils and they did allocate a certain portion of the land. I do not know whether it was out of spite at the kick-up, the row that was created, but in my own village Fianna Fáil supporters were victimised.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Grady said he issued a circular some time ago and in that circular he said that he would rule out one section and that was the Old I.R.A.&mdash; that they were to get a certain privilege and preference.  I can say this much, that in my locality men who were in the Old I.R.A. were not given any special privileges; they were not given even what they deserved.  I know one individual who had a £2 5s. od. valuation and that is all he has to-day. Deputy Anthony referred to a question I raised to-day with regard to the land of Michael Begley.  I do not think we are doing anything wrong or that I did anything wrong&mdash;I am sure that I did not&mdash;when I asked why the land would not be taken from that individual.  Why should any man be allowed to hold up the Land Commission in the course of their activities?  He refused alternative holding after alternative holding for a number of years.  What respect is there for the people who want the land?</P>
    <P>That is probably getting away from the Bill.  Quite candidly, this Bill is disappointing.  We hoped that the Land Commission would get wider powers.  If they look for them they will get them gladly from this side of the House in order to enable them to speed up land division.  Land division has proceeded with almost tortoise-like progress.  I want the Minister to give us the figures of the amount of money spent in the ten years immediately following the passing of the Ashbourne Act, the Birrell Act or the Wyndham <Col N="498" /> Act, as well as the amount spent immediately following the passing of the 1923 and 1933 Acts.  We may have spent more in each of the latter ten years, but candidly I do not think we have.  If we have regard to history and to a rough estimate, we have not. If Lord Ashbourne or Lord Wyndham, under their Acts, spent £10,000,000, and if we spent £100,000,000 for the purchase of untenanted land, was not that what we threw them out for?  Was it not one of the reasons why we kicked England out that we might put it into the hands of our own people and so speed up land division?</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that this Bill does nothing but, as several Deputies have said, make an effort to clear up the mess which incompetent Ministers and perhaps an incompetent staff have created.  The incompetency, I am sorry to say, has spread all the way down.  It must have started at the top, but it has certainly gone down to the bottom, and the situation represented by 200 holdings badly worked, 700 sublet and 820 houses unoccupied is certainly very serious and assuredly indicates incompetence.  It is, I admit, hard to blame the Land Commission for that.  They may have acted with the best intentions in the world, but one thing is certain: failure has resulted in 21½ per cent. of their efforts.</P>
    <P>Let us look at it from the other side. Give a landless man 14, 15 or 16 acres; give him the four walls of a house; give him something in the region of £1,000 and put him into the holding and say: &ldquo;Live here and work this holding; till it and husband it.&rdquo;  What can he do? Admittedly, he has got £1,000 as a present from the State, and a Deputy has said that the Land Commission examine into the financial position of such men.  It seems to me, however, that in at least 21½ per cent. of cases their financial position was very bad. These men are put into the holdings and are given the four walls of a house; they cannot work without machinery, without money to buy live stock, without the one hundred and one things a farmer wants, and no effort is made to provide them with money.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say he has provided enough for them, but why is a <Col N="499" /> scheme of loans for such men, or for all farmers, not introduced to give them a chance to get on their feet, because a loan is something which will in time be repaid with interest?  Perhaps, however, it might be better if loans were not given, because we would have 21½ per cent. of failures walking away with more State money.  From that point of view, it is very hard to criticise this Bill, but it is also very hard to give the Minister the powers he looks for.  It is unfortunate&mdash;and I have noticed it in my short time in this House&mdash;that Ministers have a habit of looking for rather too wide powers, powers that suggest that we are moving somewhat beyond the limits of democracy.</P>
    <P>For my part, I will oppose this Bill for various reasons.  We are told that 700 parcels of land have been let in conacre, but how many parcels have been let in conacre by the Land Commission? Why should the Land Commission criticise these people whom they put on holdings of land for doing something which they themselves are doing?  In my own locality, four and five crops of oats have been taken off land owned by the Land Commission. What right have they to criticise men who have been allocated land for doing what they are doing themselves?  If the Minister starts at the top and says that the Land Commission will not be allowed to let in conacre land in their possession&mdash;for tillage, for grazing or for whatever other purpose&mdash;but that the land will be divided immediately, or as soon as possible, I should not have the slightest hesitation in giving him the powers he wants.  But he cannot do that and perhaps 11 years must elapse before these matters can be settled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry raised another point, the question of allowing the B. and I. Shipping Company to come in here and purchase land.  When the Land Commissions do such a thing, they are not a Land Commission.  They are definitely giving over the land of this country to outsiders.  If that company wants food produced for itself, there are many good farmers here who can produce it.  We produced a lot in the <Col N="500" /> last three or four years and we will produce as much again if we are paid for it and if it is made worth our while.  Deputy Flanagan instanced a situation of the same kind when he spoke of an individual who was allowed to buy gigantic tracts of land, to subdivide them into parcels and to sell these parcels at a profit.</P>
    <P>If I am not mistaken&mdash;I was not in the House at the time and cannot give the exact quotation&mdash;the Minister said that such men were of more value to the State than those who had to be assisted by the State.  They are of more value from the point of view of money&mdash;they have money to buy&mdash;but it was not for the purpose of looking after these people that the Land Commission was set up.  The Land Commission was set up, following the Congested Districts Board, with the object of relieving congestion and looking after the uneconomic holders. If that was the exact statement made &mdash;and I am open to contradiction&mdash;it reveals a rather queer state of affairs, and suggests that the Minister is a funny man to have at the head of a Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>We find in Section 6 of the 1933 Land Act that the commissioners have power to determine who is to get land, the land to be acquired, the price to be paid and the amount to be allocated to people from whom land is taken.  There were, therefore, ample powers in the 1933 Act to bring about a settlement of the land question of Ireland.  There is no doubt that if the Land Act of 1933 had been operated with the determination with which it was intended it should be operated, there would be no land question now, but unfortunately&mdash;and I think I instanced the cause earlier&mdash;the Minister or the Department had to move slowly when he commenced to move on to some of his own supporters. Perhaps when he touched one of his own big men it would not do to take his land.  If the Minister comes into my locality, I can show him 250 acres of land which should be divided, and is at the moment untenanted.  I should point out that the average valuations in that area are from £4 10s. to £5.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> A lot has been said about the migrants who came to Meath and of the type of individuals they were. There may have been failures there. You may have failures in Meath or Westmeath.  One Deputy said that the people who were brought from the dens of Mayo and Connemara were an eyesore there.</P>

      <P>We are paying 5/10 in the £ for public assistance.  If these men are thrown out, the people in our county will have to bear their share of the cost of making provision for them. There will be a hue and cry as to where they are to go.  There may not be all these evictions, but certainly this Bill smells very much of the crowbar brigade.  Any man living on an uneconomic holding wants to see land division speeded up.  That may mean interference with the rights of citizens. We were told to-day that we cannot interfere with the rights of citizens. When the Land Commission decided, <Col N="502" /> as they did ten years ago, to go ahead with land division they should not have hesitated.  At that time they satisfied themselves on the question of shifting men from certain localities and of dividing land among uneconomic holders.  They decided to do that without trying to satisfy the individual owners concerned.  Therefore I submit they should move much faster than they are doing.  I do not think that, after ten years of failure on the part of the Minister and his predecessors, it is too late to expect them to mend their ways now.</P>
      <P>I would be glad to see a broad and comprehensive measure introduced that would give the Land Commission good powers.  It would be a good thing, I think, if Section 4 of this Bill, which is to be applied to the allottees, were applied to the ranchers.  If the Land Commission were to do that they would be doing a good job.  How many of the large farmers and big ranchers pulled their weight until they were forced to do it under the Tillage Order made under the Emergency Powers Act?  You had about one out of a hundred of them tilling his land.  The man with the 20 acres of land always tilled it.  He has the land blood in his veins.  He tilled because it paid him to do it.  His experience during the last five years has taught him that he can produce on his own farm as good feeding stuffs as he imported before the war.  He will till his land because he has a love for the land.  You cannot take a man and make him a farmer overnight.  The tradition of farming is handed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that the Land Commission should do, in my opinion, is to take more powers to enable it to speed up the division and acquisition of land.  In the second place, it should give land to those who have lived all their lives on the land.  The uneconomic holder should get land.  He and his father before him have lived and worked on the land.  That is the type of man who should get first consideration. The Minister will tell me that we cannot do all those things in a hurry. My answer is that very little has been done during the last 20 years.  During that period, I imagine that smaller sums have been spent on the purchase of untenanted land than were spent by <Col N="503" /> the Congested Districts Board or by the different English Lord Lieutenants that we had here.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be unduly harsh on the Government.  Failure has been admitted on the part of the Government. The Minister was honest enough to admit incompetence, not perhaps on his own part, but on the part of his predecessors and on the part of the Land Commission.  If he were to introduce a Bill now giving him more sweeping powers for the division of land, he would have the support of this side of the House.  He would also have it if he were to apply the provisions of Section 4 of this Bill, not to the tenants who are being criticised, but to the ranchers who are holding up the division of land, and who are putting every obstacle in the way.  I suggest to him that he should give the land to the uneconomic holders and to the landless men.  If he were to do that his Bill would be worthy of support. Unless he does that, I will oppose this Bill.  Every member of the House must admit, whether he is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party or the Clann na Talmhan Party, that if he represents a rural constituency almost 50 per cent. of the correspondence he receives daily deals with questions relating to the land.  The Minister is responsible.  If he takes the steps he should take he will get the support, but the steps he has taken under this Bill are no indication that land division will be improved or increased in the years to come.</P>

      <P>Bheadh tuairm, ag duine ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht seo an tseachtain seo caite agus an tseachtain seo, nach raibh aon roinnt talún go dtí go dtáinig an Rialtas seo isteach agus nach raibh géar-ghá leis an mBille seo go dtí an lá inniu.  Tá scéal eile agam agus táim chun é innsint: Caithfe mé a rá go bhfuil áthas orm go bhfuil teanga mhuintir Ráth Chairn agam agus go bhfuil na daoine sin a mease mo charaid.  One would think that there was never land division in this country until Fianna Fáil took office.  One would imagine that there was not any settlement of land until the native Government was <Col N="504" /> established here and that there were no failures until the year 1922 or 1923.  Coming from a constituency in which land division has occurred for, I suppose, 50 years, I want to recall to the House that failures occurred to a greater extent before there was a native Government than in the last 20 years. In County Westmeath, as a result of the work of Laurence Ginnell, large-scale division of estates took place. Houses were built, out-offices were set up, roads were made into the estates. If Deputies will examine the records of the Land Commission, under the 1903 Act, I challenge them to find 10 per cent. of the original holders there.  As soon as the lands were vested the farms were put up for sale and sold and the occupiers went back to their previous occupation.  Therefore it is wrong to blame Fianna Fáil for the 20 per cent. failures now and to pretend that there have never been failures before.  I give two instances.  The Nugent estate in the electoral division of Fore West, in the north of County Westmeath, was a very extensive estate of over 2,000 acres.  Roads were made into that estate.  Houses were built.  To-day there are not 10 per cent. of the people who got those holdings living on them.  South from where I live there is the Featherstonhaugh estate, which was divided under the 1923 Act.  The same story obtains there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came into this House I have advocated, on the Land Commission Vote, and I have been talked down from the Opposition and from my own side of the House, that there should be a minimum period of 20 years before land would be vested in anyone, so as to allow an examination to be made as to whether the individual had settled down on the farm and carried out the rules of good husbandry.  I advocate that policy to-day and I shall continue to do so.  All this talk about political favour is ridiculous.  I have not seen a Land Commission inspector for ten years.  I am sorry that the Deputy in the Opposition Party who represents Westmeath, with me, is not here, but I say, and I do not think he will contradict me, that he has been visited by <Col N="505" /> Land Commission inspectors again and again.  I have not been visited by them.  I say that they have not carried out his wishes or the wishes that I have expressed in letters and visits to the Land Commission, and it is a good job for the country, in both cases, that our wishes were not entirely carried out because I assume that we would be somewhat biassed.</P>
    <P>Under the 1923 Act the Killian estate was divided in the electoral division of Glenee.  There are not 40 per cent. of those who got holdings there to-day.  Sixty per cent. have sold out, on vesting.  To those Deputies&mdash;Deputy Dillon and others&mdash; who have talked about politics, I want to say that, of those who got these holdings, none was of our way of thinking.  The two Parties at that time were Cumann na nGaedheal and Sinn Féin.  There had been a civil war and even if the Government or the then Minister for Lands wanted to be impartial, the force of public feeling and the bitterness in the country arising out of the civil war would not have permitted of their giving a bit of land to a Sinn Féin supporter.  Notwithstanding that, not 40 per cent. of the people who got land at that time are there.  Similarly, I could quote instance after instance, south of Mullingar, where the same story obtained.  Therefore, my advocacy over a number of years of the policy of having a period of waiting of 20 years to see how the farm would be worked is logical and equitable.</P>

I will say this much about Deputy Giles: he is very sincere and earnest but he lets his tongue get away with him too much and he exaggerates a lot.

That is the best proof that they are working their farms well.  The small market that there used to be in Athboy on Saturday is now a fair.  Rathcarne is nobody's child.  Rathcarne gets all the abuse and kicks, but they are well able to give them back.</P>

      <P>And when we are all dead and gone the people of Rathcarne will be there and will be a credit to Meath.  I would plead with the Minister that when he is putting this Bill into operation, to do it kindly.  I am sure he will.  The fact of the Bill going through the House and through the Oireachtas will give these people a chance.  When an individual is translated 150 miles from his kith and kin he has to stand up, he has to work his holding and live on it, but when he is taken only a mile away from his own place and when he is living with his father and mother he will not work and he will not live in the new house and, certainly, very drastic steps are needed to deal with that position.  I want to assure Deputies from the West that I am conversant with the migration policy in Meath and that there are very few farmers there.</P>
      <P>There is another thing wrong with the division of land by the Land Commission. This thing of giving a prerogative to an employee to get land is wrong.  I know an estate beside Kilbeggan which was taken over some years ago against the wishes of the owner. The owner translated a man from County Kildare into a broken-down house on that estate.  That man was near 70 years of age, and the owner had him working as a herd for 18 months.  That man got a farm on the representation that he was a herd.  He died in a short time and eventually his relatives sold the farm.  Then there was a case in the West where a butler on some estate got a farm.  He did not know how to work it, and, in a very short time, permission was given to him to sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often on these estates you have <Col N="507" /> a number of retainers who are past their labour and who never did any real work.  When they get a bit of land they do not know the first thing about it, because they never worked in their lives.  Therefore it is an absolutely wrong policy on the part or the Land Commission to give these men, whether they are able to work land or not, a holding.  Something should be done in order to give them a sum of money instead of putting them on a farm and allowing them to sell it afterwards. If you examine these 21 per cent. of failures I think you will find that a very big percentage of them had been retainers on these estates who were, by right, given farms.  I welcome this Bill, because it will enable the Land Commission to get on with the work.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the B. and I.  Company purchasing a farm in County Meath for the production of foodstuffs for their particular class of business.  I have been listening to the Opposition for a number of years past talking about the right of free sale. There will be an Opposition vote on this Bill and we would like an expression of opinion about it.  I wonder do the Opposition, particularly Clann na Talmhan, stand for a policy of getting a map of the country, dividing it into squares, and giving everybody a square of land.  Would it be a right contention on my part to say that, if you had a 200-acre farm, tilled to the gates and to the ditches, with proper housing for the employees and the employees getting good wages, the community living on that farm would be in a better position than a number of congests?  You can go too far with land division.  You have to look into the fact that, if you produce store cattle in the West of Ireland, you must have a place to improve the stores if you are to export them.  Therefore, while I am not putting up a defence for the B. and I. Company buying this particular farm, it leans on a particular aspect of land division which should be examined.  I have gone to the Gaeltacht where the people from Rathcarne came from and I have not been stabbed in the back.  I have gone there summer after summer and <Col N="508" /> I want to say this to those on the Clann na Talmhan Benches who are extremely anxious about relieving congestion. Six or seven years ago I saw holdings that were taken from the migrants.  The walls and the roofs of the houses were knocked down.  What is the position to-day?  Others have gone into these holdings that were taken over and have built new houses and created new congestion.  There will always be congestion there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate merely because this Bill contains provisions to which, in principle, I could not subscribe.  In the course of the discussion on this measure, Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Hughes and others on these benches have indicated their concurrence in the principle which appears to lie behind this Bill.  It has been indicated that we agree that there is a problem to be dealt with.  But, in certain respects, in the manner in which it is proposed to deal with that problem fundamental principles have been abrogated.  The Bill proposes to interfere with existing rights, vested interests, and existing contracts and, to a very considerable extent, to oust the jurisdiction of the courts.  In so far as this Bill, in its present form, deals or appears to deal with matters of that kind, principles of fundamental importance, we could not subscribe to this measure.  If the Minister will, when his attention has been drawn, as it has been drawn to some extent, to the points to which we take exception, give an undertaking to the House that, on the Committee Stage, the provisions to which we take exception will be drastically amended, then we will not oppose the Second Reading of the Bill. On the other hand, if there is no such undertaking, then we must vote against it.</P>
      <P>I propose to occupy the House only for a few moments in asking the attention of Deputies to provisions in this Bill in which fundamental principles are abrogated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Sections 2 and 4 there are provisions enabling the certificate of the Land Commission to be conclusive evidence in the matters referred to in those sections respectively.  To the <Col N="509" /> extent to which it is desired or intended that those provisions should be pressed, then those provisions amount, in fact, to ousting the jurisdiction of the court, to enable the Land Commission to be judge and jury in a matter of deciding against an individual without giving him an opportunity of being heard or having a chance to make his case before an independent tribunal of the courts of justice set up in this country.  Those provisions contravene the rule of justice and should be opposed by this House, and certainly will be opposed vigorously by the members of this Party.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in Section 4 that, where an agreement or undertaking to purchase a holding or parcel of land contains a provision by which the purchaser agrees to work the holding in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, if the Land Commission gives a certificate that a person is not carrying on the working of the land in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, that certificate is conclusive evidence, that is to say, there can be no appeal by the individual concerned.  I was discussing this particular section with some of my colleagues, practising members of the Bar, and one of them informed me that recently he had a case in court where an effort was made by the Land Commission to eject from his holding a tenant purchaser who apparently had entered into an agreement of this kind. The allegation was that he was not carrying out his undertaking by working the farm in accordance with the proper methods of husbandry.  Evidence was given on behalf of the Land Commission and on behalf of the tenant, to the judge paid by the taxpayers, appointed by the Government and set up in accordance with the Constitution. An independent tribunal heard that case and decided against the Land Commission.  The Land Commission evidence was not accepted by the judge and was, in fact, as my colleague informed me, conclusively disproved on cross-examination.  The case was dismissed and there was no appeal from the Circuit Court to the High Court, certainly thereby impliedly admitting that the decision of the <Col N="510" /> circuit judge was correct.  If this section in its present form had been the law at that time, when this action came for hearing or was instituted by the Land Commission, that man would have had no opportunity of making any defence in the courts of justice. The Land Commission's certificate would have been produced in court and could not be questioned.  Notwithstanding that evidence was given in that case to establish that the defendant was carrying on his operations in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, that evidence could not have been tendered if this section had been in operation.  I certainly could not stand for that, nor do I believe that any member of this Party could vote for a Bill in which that section would be retained.</P>
    <P>I do not wish in any way to discuss the propriety of a covenant being inserted in such an agreement.  I would express the opinion that it is a proper covenant to have and that it should be properly enforced but the place to try out whether it is being properly carried out or not is the courts of justice.  This section is designed in terms to allow the Land Commission to oust the jurisdiction of the court.  They will have to go to court, under the provisions as they stand at the moment, to prove the case against the tenant purchaser, but the method of proof provided is the conclusive certificate of the Land Commission, against which there can be no appeal, no evidence can be given and no case whatever can be made in court.</P>
    <P>The standard of proper methods of husbandry is nowhere indicated.  It is a matter on which, I suppose, various farmers can properly and conscientiously disagree.  It is a matter on which there will be disagreement in various parts of the country; it is a matter which will vary from time to time, even amongst experts in different parts of the country; but the only standard put forward here in this section is the conclusive certificate of the Land Commission.  I do not propose to discuss what are or are not proper methods of husbandry.  I am <Col N="511" /> not competent to do so, but what I am competent to do is to raise my voice, so far as I can and as effectively as I can, against a provision of this kind, which I can only describe as bureaucracy <i>in excelsis.</i></P>
    <P>Section 3 contravenes existing contracts and, therefore, in my view, is wrong in principle.  It may be that a good case can be made that people who are given allotments of land, by means of the machinery of government and public moneys, should be made work that land, through their own labour and with their own hands and brains, that they should not be allowed to let out the lands either in agistment or conacre lettings.  A strong case can be made, and I think has been made, that conacre and agistment lettings should be allowed and are necessary in certain circumstances. Again I am not going into a controversy on that point, as I am not competent to express an opinion of any authority, while I may have my own views.  What I do direct the attention of the House to is that, in the history of the Irish landlord, starting from Deasy's Act of 1860 until the present time, it has been recognised that lettings by agistment or conacre or grazing did not contravene a lease, an agreement or other document providing that the land could not be sublet. Therefore when the tenant-purchaser entered into such an agreement, he did so on the basis of the existing law, that lettings by way of conacre or agistment would not be a breach of the covenant.  That was the covenant entered into between him and the Land Commission, that was the agreement that was drawn up by the Land Commission. If it had been intended at that time that conacre lettings and agistment lettings or grazing lettings should not be permitted, it would have been easy to insert a clause into that agreement, making provisions to that effect.  The tenant-purchaser entered into his contract on the basis of the existing law, signing a document drafted by the Land Commission; and it is again a principle of law that a contract drafted by one party to the contract is interpreted against that <Col N="512" /> party.  This section contravenes all those principles.</P>
    <P>I am again taking my stand on this section on principle.  It would be easy for me to say that a large number of these people who entered into these agreements got their lands through political pressure and push and pull.  However, I feel so strongly on this question of principle that, even in those cases where people got land improperly through political influence, I am prepared to give them the benefit of the principle I am advocating.  If it is thought as a matter of public policy that, in future, no person should be allowed to make agistment lettings or conacre lettings, that can be done easily by the insertion of a simple clause in the agreement.  This interferes with the contract already made, deliberately made, by the Land Commission, leaving out a clause that it is now sought to insert by force of an Act of Parliament and contrary to the agreement between the parties.</P>
    <P>In clause 5 there is a provision regarding a certain type of land which, by reason of its particular tenure and the circumstances in which the agreement to purchase was entered into, descended as fee simple property and not in the ordinary way that it is provided by statute that land subject to Part IV of the Registration of Title Act of 1891 should descend.  The general principle is that that land, known as freehold registered land, on the death of the registered holder, is divisible, in the absence of a will, amongst the next-of-kin.  Although it has in fact all the circumstances of freehold tenure, it is fee simple for all purposes except the purposes of descent.  It descends to the next-of-kin and not to the heir-at-law, in accordance with the old feudal principles of descent.</P>
    <P>That is the general principle; that is a principle, I think, to which everybody will subscribe.  But what I want to draw the Minister's attention to in this Bill is that he may be interfering with rights which have been acquired, because he provides not merely that land which is of the type comprised in this section shall henceforth be subject to the provisions of Part IV of the Act of 1891, but that <Col N="513" /> those provisions shall apply in the case of deaths occurring before this Act is passed.  In other words, while, of course, I assume that there are very few cases to which this section will apply, there may have been cases occurring within years past where a person who had this particular plot of land died and, it not being subject to the provisions of Part IV of the Act of 1891, on the death intestate of that person it was given to his heir-at-law and not his next-of-kin.  That person has acquired, under the law as it stands, a right to that property.  He has made his dispositions in accordance with that property and probably paid estate and other duties.  He has possibly entered into possession and has been in possession for some time. That right which he has acquired is to be taken from him by this section.  I do not know whether the Minister intended that, but there can be no doubt that that is the effect which this section will have in the retrospective operation which will be given it if this Bill becomes law and it will, therefore, possibly not merely interfere with vested rights, but will very probably create very grave injustice.</P>
    <P>These are the outstanding matters to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention.  I would like&mdash;and I think I am authorised by my colleagues&mdash;to ask the Minister to direct his attention to these matters and give us his views on the points of principle to which I have adverted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a mixed blessing.  I have no doubt in my mind as to the purpose of the Bill, the object it has in view, but looking at it in a general way, I feel that the Minister for Lands could in justice do nothing less than what he is doing.  When the Minister seeks to interfere with ownership of any description in this country, whether in regard to land, house property or anything else, he must have justification for it.  This departure in respect of the interference with ownership of land is not new.  In fact, it goes back a very long time in the history of this country.  Prior to the establishment of our own Government it was operated by British Governments here with the intention of <Col N="514" /> remedying a situation which in itself had been created by various conquests and which demanded, in the interest of justice, attention by various governments from time to time.  Now the only justification any government can have for interfering with private ownership is this, that in doing so they are out to re-establish a better order of things than what they found.</P>
      <P>The only moral right which a Minister or a Government can have for interfering with ownership of land, irrespective of who the owner may be or has been, is that it is intended to substitute for the individual owner a greater number of people, whose families will settle on that territory. They, in turn, will be expected to support themselves and their families and give greater wealth to the nation as a result of their work out of the property thus acquired by the State and given into their care.  Should the Government, acting on their right&mdash; and they are entitled to act on such a right and for such purposes&mdash;and having utilised the power to take from the owner his property, compensate him from public funds and redistribute the land among a number of individuals and, in turn, allow these individuals who, at the public expense, and through interference with the original owner, were put into possession, to utilise the land to the same purpose or put it to no better use than the previous owners, then their action could not be justified.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be useful if, in the course of time, the Land Commission find that they have improved the general conditions of a number of people by placing them on the land securing, in return, more production from that land and greater wealth for the nation.  But if they find that that purpose is thwarted by the inability or the inefficiency of the individuals concerned, they are morally bound to take back that land and put it into the hands of those who will utilise it for the purpose for which the distribution of land originally was intended.  That is the only justification that can be offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also this danger attached to it, that men who were given farms in the last 20 years were, in consequence, <Col N="515" /> established in the eyes of the community as people who had certain property and were accordingly entitled to certain credits.  Merchants and other people probably advanced money to them because they owned land and were possessors of property.  This legislation will now dispossess them of that land, in many instances, and therefore the position created by the Land Commission in the past was bogus in so far as the confidence of the public was deceived.  The Government, in the first instance, having made these men property owners and given them some sense of security to the extent that merchants and others advanced money to them, now dispossess them with an entire disregard of those people who felt entitled to give them assistance and credits, believing them to be credit-worthy.</P>
    <P>I do not know if that is entirely justifiable on the part of the Government. I think it is a factor that they will have to consider seriously.  By granting farms to these men, they established a form of credit, business people considering these people creditworthy and advancing them money on such a basis.  This measure now proposes to disestablish all that and all the background of credit goes.  In spite of all that, I still adhere to what I said in my original statement, that the Minister for Lands could do nothing less than what he is doing and that is to ensure that the distribution of land will have as its primary object that the land will be placed in the hands of people who will make use of it to their own advantage, for the advancement of the family and for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a good deal of manipulation in the way of political influence took place and that probably the difficulties which the Land Commission and the country as a whole find themselves confronted with, as evidenced by the introduction of this Bill, were due to political interference. I was a member of Fianna Fáil; I am not now.  I can safely say that in my experience of the distribution of land Fianna Fáil did not exercise any undue or unfair influence whatever.  I must <Col N="516" /> say, speaking for my constituency, that I did my best occasionally to get land for people and give a preference to one man as against somebody else, but I do assert, to the credit of the Land Commission administration and their officials, that they honestly carried out their work and did it in a fair way without regard to any attempted political pull and I will say that the political pull was not generally unfair.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the people who made up the body of the Fianna Fáil organisation were ordinary country people with a fair outlook on things. They were as generous in allowing the claim of the other fellow as they were in&mdash;by no means, unreasonably&mdash; advancing their own claims.  I say that, finished with Fianna Fáil as I am, and if I were asked for a reference for a few of their principal leaders, I would say that I was not in a position to say I found them entirely honest, just or loyal.  I can, however, say it of the general body of Fianna Fáil, and that, through Fianna Fáil, no unreasonable pressure was applied, or, even if it were, that it was unsuccessful, with regard to the distribution of land.</P>
    <P>This Bill should not be objected to and should not be a Party problem. The land of this country is the foundation and the substance on which this country's nationhood has survived through generations of tests, and the effort of all Parties should be to see how best that valuable asset of ours can be utilised for the benefit of the nation.  I make no bones about saying this, that if more care had been taken in the selection of candidates for land, when land was being divided, fewer of the problems with which we are now confronted would have resulted.</P>
    <P>Speaking as one who has lived in a congested area and who has tried to advocate that the first duty of the land of this country should be to relieve congestion, which is the equivalent of the city slum, I say that that has not been done.  I say that in respect of any ordinary business in which men are employed, no person will consider giving a man charge of his counter to sell even in a minor way, who has not some experience, and if you seek as landowners men with experience of <Col N="517" /> what hard-working, industrious people are capable of doing, you will go back to the congested districts, to the men who, in spite of weather difficulties and other hardships, were able to wrest from an unfriendly and bitter soil a living for themselves and their families for generations.  That, to my mind, is the real test of the ability of a man to work his land.  These people are left in the slums of the congested districts and land is being divided and men being put on new farms, without, in many cases, any reference to the ability of these men to work these farms created at the expense of the State.  Examination, in the first instance, is better than inquest after the event, and I recommend the Minister, in the future development of land division, to take into consideration the merits of the applicant and to give land on merit alone.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about land to-night.  Not half the interest is taken in land or its division in the country to-day as was taken ten or 15 years ago.  If there were free exit from this country to-day, there would be very few people from the congested areas anxious to take land, even in the richest parts of the Midlands or around the City of Dublin. They have had a long and wearisome wait.  They were promised by Government after Government that their condition would be a first consideration and that the rich lands of Meath would be placed at their disposal.  They are tired waiting, but if they leave the country the country will have lost the greatest asset it could ever lose, an asset which it will never be able to replace, a love of the land.  Allow the congests another few years and open the ports, and you can have your ranches back in their entirety, because you will have lost the only salvation of successful land operation, the hard-working toilers of the soil in the congested areas.</P>

      <P>I think I am one of the few farmers here who have no affiliations with any political Party, and for that reason I may be able to speak in a detached way.  When the landlady asked her shy lodger how his egg was, he said it was good in parts. <Col N="518" /> This Bill is good in parts.  The history of land is the history of a terrible problem in this country.  I heard of it from nonagenarian grandparents, two of whom were evicted from their holdings. My county did more against landlordism and did more to bring about fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale than any county, or any ten counties in Ireland.  When Ireland was a corpse on the dissecting table, it was to Tipperary that the people looked.</P>
      <P>It is known to the House that Gladstone paid a visit to Ireland, following the shooting at Ballycohey.  He came <i>incognito</i> to Tipperary town, where Michael Dwyer and a few of his friends went out against Darby Scully. He came to the conclusion that when men could risk their lives in defence of the land there was something very wrong with the system, and it ultimately made a Home Ruler of Gladstone.  Any of you who have read A.M. Sullivan will have read these facts.  I live in that district and it was mother's milk to me to listen to them. It was Tipperary which brought about the Land Act, Home Hule and the present condition of affairs, if you like. I have listened to a spate of talk here to-day.  You are all attached to political Parties, but I would walk out of any political Party, as a farmer.  I am an Irishman, first, and a farmer, secondly, descended from farming stock of 1601, and I get fairly sick of the whole thing.  There was not much talk about the land in 1850 after the Famine and up to the late '60's, when the three F's came along.  If you put men on the land you must give them fixity of tenure.  I remember the Land League; I remember the evictions. When the landlord evicted people he had to give notice to the workhouse that these people were being evicted. Is an Irish Parliament going to do that?  I do not think you will.  You cannot do it.</P>

    <P>Deputy Maguire talked about the division of land.  We have sea erosion going on.  Are we going to take in the Irish Sea?  Deputies from the County Mayo said that there were five or six estates down there that should be divided.  I think we have only a few hundred farms in Ireland of over 200 <Col N="519" /> acres.  One thing that occurred in the course of an interview with the Minister very much impressed me, and it was when he said that he did not want to make agricultural slums.  I admire him, but still I think he is in a sorry plight over this Bill.  If evictions take place, the sheriffs will have to serve notice that the evicted people will have to be admitted to the workhouse.  That is not the Minister's style.  I want to give credit where credit is due.  It is the fashion now, wherever there is a 100 acre or a 120 acre farm, for five or six individuals in an area to say that they are going to have that land.  If they did get it, of course they would be getting it at a quarter of what land bonds would cost you.  That is not right.  That is robbery.  It all comes down to the question as to what is an economic holding.  The famine in 1848 was caused in a way by the splitting up of the farms.  Many of those on the land had to leave, and when they went abroad they won the colonies for England.  You had first of all the breaking up of the 20 acre farm into a ten-acre farm.  In the next generation, the holding was further sub-divided.  But the Minister is not going to be an agricultural slum maker.  You want at least about 30 acres of good land to support a pair of horses.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the old saying &ldquo;To Hell or to Connacht.&rdquo;  On this question of land division, there are no migrants in my county.  It would not be good for their health to come to Tipperary.  I am not anti-Irish. As the saying has it, I am as &ldquo;Irish as the pigs in Droghéda.&rdquo;  I am not against the Irish, but you want some qualification other than that of being able to talk Irish, in order to be put on land, and to make a success of it.</P>
    <P>The various plantations started in my native county.  That, I suppose, is the reason they gave it the title of the premier county.  They mapped out the best land there when the plantations started.  With the idea, I suppose, of anglicising it they described it as the North and South Riding of Tipperary. They did not succeed in reducing us <Col N="520" /> into being Saxons.  These plantations were carried out in the time of King John, Elizabeth, Henry VIII and down along the line.  We also had the Cromwellian planters.  Some of their descendants are there still.  The natives were driven up the mountain sides or across the Shannon.  When the planters came their portions of land were surrounded by trees which showed the security they had.  That, of course, was long before Tim Healy won the three F's for the Irish farmer.  The descendants of some of those planters went to the Colonies, and became the best farmers there, largely for the reason that they had not Irish farmers to compete against.  Most of the planters are gone now, and the Burkes and the Sheas are back on the plains again.</P>

      <P>I want to come back to this question of fixity of tenure. You have the descendants of the old holders of the land there to-day, and you cannot put them out without compensation. On the maternal side, I suppose some of the land I have has been in our possession for over 1,000 years. I would not give it for all the wealth of a Pierpont Morgan.  It is that love of the land that I want to bring to the notice of the House.  We do not want to see hordes of inspectors coming around to teach us how to farm.  We know our business.  The snag that we see in this Bill is, that, apparently, it is the intention to send hordes of inspectors around to inspect our farms. We are not going to have that.  We will farm our land in the way that we think is right, in the way that is best for the nation, but we do not want compulsion. We had, of course, to have compulsory wheat-growing during the emergency so that the people of the nation might be fed.  There was no compulsion to grow beet.  In the Dáil restaurant all you get is an eggspoonful of sugar that is not sufficient for a cup of tea.  If the farmers are paid enough they will produce all the sugar beet that is required, but compulsion stinks in their nostrils. This Bill is the thin end of the wedge to send around inspectors.  It is a two-edged <Col N="521" /> sword, but we are not going to put a sword into any man's hand to chop off our heads.  We will do what we think is best for the nation.  We do not want any inspectors or instructors. We are sick of them.  I would not give a tinker's curse about any Party, but I am going to vote against this Bill.  I will vote against the Bill.  It will be a sorry day if these men, some of whom have been in occupation of the land for 20 years, and more, are wronged.  The houses have been referred to.  It has been said that they have gone into disrepair. It has been said that they have not tilled the land.  Are the inspectors going to come into my land and ask me am I working it properly?  I say they will not.  My county will say they will not.  The guns will be out again.  We have only to die once.  Deputies may vote as they like on the Bill.  I do not care a tinker's curse how they vote, but I personally will vote against the Bill. We are sick of it.  We are sick of compulsion and sick of the little political twists.  It will be a sorry day when, on the eve of an eviction, we have to serve notice on the sheriff to evict these men and, at the same time, a notice to the workhouse or the county home to give them shelter.  We have fought for freedom.  We are inspected, suspected and expected to support every gang that comes along to tell us what to do. We know our job.  We have done it well.  We fed the nation and got very little for it.  We did not get a price for milk or sugar, and you are short of butter and sugar through not giving us a price for our work.  Men are going into the Labour Exchange, and we cannot get men to work on the farm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I read with very considerable care the speech which the Minister made in introducing this Bill. While I do not share all the conclusions which he has drawn from the problems which confront him, I am forced to the conclusion that the Bill is a regrettable necessity in view of the facts as revealed by the inquiries conducted by the Land Commission.  The Minister painted for us what I think he and every member of the House must regard as a very bleak picture indeed.  Faced with a situation of that kind, I think the House has no alternative, <Col N="522" /> if it is going to maintain the original purpose of land division in this country, to voting for a Bill of this character.  The primary purpose of land division was to acquire land for the relief of congestion, not merely in the congested areas, but in areas which were not specially indicated as congested areas.  Whatever the method of administering Land Acts has been, that, at all events, has continued to be the viewpoint of those responsible for the introduction of land legislation in Ireland.  The primary purpose of land division was to break up the large ranches and to give holdings and houses to those who were living in congested areas or who were in the category of landless men, and who were anxious to secure land which they would exploit to their own personal advantage and the nation's welfare. If that is the primary and the main purpose of land acquisition and division in Ireland, then quite obviously we have to deal with every problem which challenges the continuance of that policy.  Neglecting to utilise land to the fullest, declining to occupy houses provided by the State, are surely a challenge to the whole policy, and to the wisdom of the policy, of acquiring and dividing land in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read with interest the Minister's review of the inspection carried out by his Department, and let me say that I do not think the review was a very creditable one to the Minister's Department because it reveals quite clearly that, whatever method of selection was employed by the Land Commission, those responsible for making the selections and the recommendations were quite obviously not agricultural psychologists, because many of the people who were recommended as the best allottees in the view of those making the recommendations have turned out to be gentlemen who will not use land and who will not occupy houses, with the result that in a country where there is virtually a land hunger, you have persons installed on land who will not work the land and, in a country where there are still too many rural slums and rain-soaked mud-cabins, you have persons who will not go into the decent <Col N="523" /> houses that have been provided for them by the Land Commission.  It would be bad enough if we had a small number of cases of that kind, because instances of that kind provide extremely bad example in the matter of the best utilisation of land, but when we get the very substantial problem revealed by the Minister's figures, it is quite clear that those responsible for the selection of allottees which produce a result of this kind were quite unfit for the performance of these duties in a manner calculated to yield satisfactory results to the nation.  If this Bill discloses anything, it discloses the necessity for a different method of selection of allottees, different methods of investigation, and the production of more evidence than has been required in the past that persons who are being given land will utilise the land and occupy the houses that the State is providing for them.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made on both sides of the House regarding the use of political influence in the allocation of land.  The Fine Gael Party charges the Government Party that it has used political influence in the allocation of land to its Party supporters and the Government Party retort: &ldquo;Ah, yes, but nothing at all like what you did during your nine merry years in office.&rdquo; One gets the impression that there was an American spoil system between both Governments.  Whatever the methods employed, and I do not make an assertion one way or the other, the results indicated in the Minister's examination of the problem are not too creditable to either Government because they disclose a state of affairs which quite clearly indicates that persons were put into land, whether through political influence or otherwise, who quite clearly were never intended to be farmers, and quite clearly never wanted the land if it meant that they had to use their energies upon it.</P>
    <P>Now that this whole question of the value of political pull in getting land has been raised&mdash;and it is well that the issue should be dragged out into the open&mdash;I think the Minister should make it clear beyond all doubt that, so far as he is concerned&mdash;I am the last in this House to accuse the Minister of any political manipulation in <Col N="524" /> land, from what I know of the Minister's attitude in the matter&mdash;and so far as the Land Commission is concerned, political influence will not be permitted to play any part in the selection of allottees so far as the future allocation of land is concerned. It may have played a part in the past &mdash;I make no allegations in that respect&mdash;but if it did play a part in the past, I think it is time now that the Minister should make it clear that, so far as he is concerned and so far as the Land Commission and Land Commission officials are concerned, the test of entitlement to land will be ability to work the land to the fullest, to practise good methods of husbandry, and that the political badge which the person wears will not be allowed to make up for his deficiencies as an agriculturist in respect of land allocated to him at considerable expense to the masses of the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said he was opposed to this Bill and was going to fight the thing strenuously, almost to the point of bloodshed.  If the Deputy examines the matter calmly and remembers that nobody is going to take his personal holding from him, I think he will find that he can scarcely justify that whole-hog attitude towards the Bill.  I had considerable misgivings about the introduction of it at this late stage.  I had misgivings about the manner in which it will be administered but in that respect I have been somewhat consoled by the assurance of the Minister that it will not be administered in any brusque way but that it will be administered with sympathy and understanding.  The net position with which we are confronted is: According to the Minister's statement, based on his investigations, there are empty houses in this country which have been erected by the Land Commission for allottees, and there are in the country a considerable number of holdings which are either entirely unused or badly used.  What we have to ask ourselves in connection with this Bill is: Are we going to sit here in this Legislature, knowing that there are empty houses around the country, knowing that, in this time of crisis, there is unused or badly used <Col N="525" /> land, and refuse to deal with a situation of that kind?  I do not think we can refuse to deal with it.  I think we must deal with it.  It seems to me to be nothing short of a shame that, in areas where men are clamouring for houses and for land, through a mistake on the part of the Land Commission, you should have people having title deeds under the Land Acts to that empty house, having title deeds under the Land Acts to that unused or badly used land, whilst those willing to live in the house and to work the land are denied, because of the methods practised by the Land Commission in the past, an opportunity of occupying the house and of utilising the land.</P>
    <P>If we proposed to erect houses in various places throughout the country and said to citizens: &ldquo;Whether you like it or not, you have to get into that house,&rdquo; one could understand a man's objection to occupying the house.  But in all these cases, the original allottee was usually keen to get both the house and the land.  He got both the house and the land and usually got them in the area in which he lived and where he probably had a keen desire to get them.  Having got the State to provide him with house property worth, in present circumstances, close on £1,000, having got a holding of land from the Land Commission, are we to say that it is a hardship on him to occupy a house valued to-day at almost £1,000 and a holding of land at the price at which land is fetching to-day?  Frankly, I do not see how we can say that.  I think, quite clearly, that the situation has to be dealt with.  I regard it as no hardship whatever to say to a man: &ldquo;If the Land Commission, build a house for you and give you 25 acres of land, the least you ought to do is to live in the house and to work the land for the national advantage.&rdquo;  In other words, what we have to say in tabloid form to the man is: &ldquo;Either live in the house, or vacate it; either work the land, or give it back to us and let it be reallocated to somebody who is prepared to use the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some of the cases of abuse of land by allottees, in my opinion, produced some startling results that will be <Col N="526" /> known when the Land Commission try to reallocate some of the land possession of which may be resumed under this Bill.  But it is a well-known fact&mdash;it happened in my own constituency&mdash;that when substantial farms are acquired and divided the original owner takes the land over from the allottees.  So that when you have broken up the main farm and given it to allottees in the hope that they will work it to their personal advantage, the original landowner is, nevertheless, able to secure letting agreements for the land and to utilise the land virtually with as little restriction as before and, in many respects, to use it with considerable advantages which were not previously available to him. It is well known that, in many cases, the land which is sublet by allottees is not farmed at all.  It is not even grazed in an agricultural sense.  The land is simply mined and quarried to such an extent that, after a few years, its fertility is exhausted, and whoever gets the land in future has considerable sympathy from me if he imagines that he will get a crop out of it without the expenditure of a considerable sum of money on manures and the utilisation of very considerable reserves of energy.</P>
    <P>That vice of subletting has, in my opinion, exhausted the fertility of a very large acreage of land.  It is one of the vices of land allocation which ought to be grappled with.  I know, of course, that not every person who is not able to utilise the land to the fullest extent, not every person whose land was the subject of investigation by the Minister, is a defaulter so far as land utilisation is concerned.  I am driven to the conclusion that the whole method of allocating land and the manner in which we approach the allocation of land begets the condition of affairs which the Minister found in the course of his recent inquiry.  It is a well-known fact that the Land Commission allots land to persons who have very little capital and very little stock, because their economic position as agricultural workers is such that they are not able to accumulate any capital or to aggregate any quantity of stock.  These people, so handicapped for want of capital resources, are put <Col N="527" /> into holdings of 20 or 25 acres.  They have no agricultural equipment and are depending on a friend for the loan of a plough or a couple of horses. Perhaps they have a few head of cattle.  It is in circumstances such as these that they set out on the task of exploiting to the fullest 20 or 25 acres of land.  That problem is one which has been responsible for more headaches on the part of small farmers than probably any other problem with which they could be confronted. Deprived of capital resources, deprived of agricultural equipment, deprived of that measure of family help which is so essential in embarking on a task of that kind, in many cases they find themselves financially crippled in a short time.</P>
    <P>If you take a man who has been an agricultural worker and tell him: &ldquo;There is your land and your house; get in and look after the fencing of it and clean it up and till it&rdquo;; if you give him a job which will take two or three months and which often necessitates the employment at his expense of additional labour, if you tell him that there will be no income from that land until the fall of the year, and then a rather haphazard one, you will find that that man is not in a financial position to stand out of the money until whatever harvest he reaps comes in.  The result is that many of them revert to the device of subletting the land for grazing or cropping.  In that way, many of these people in the beginning follow the path which ultimately leads to their abandoning the land except as a means of subletting for grazing or cropping.</P>
    <P>I think one of the most useful experiments undertaken by the Land Commission was the method of land allocation adopted in the County Meath.  In that case, the Land Commission did something which was notable for its intelligence. I pay that tribute to the Land Commission in that respect, and in that respect only.  In that instance, they brought people from the West to lands in Meath.  They gave them the land, they gave them houses, they tilled the land for them.  They gave them stock and they gave them an allowance until such time as they could acclimatise <Col N="528" /> themselves to Meath conditions. At all events, they said: &ldquo;There is your ship fully equipped; off you go, make a success of the voyage&rdquo;.  I think it will not be denied by anybody who has seen these holdings and the way they are utilised that the experiment has been a success.  It may have been a costly experiment, but it certainly justified itself, and it has certainly proved to be the only way in which you can satisfactorily establish men on land in circumstances which will enable them to make good, instead of having this downward drift which shows itself in the unoccupied houses the Minister refers to, and in the unused and badly used land.</P>
    <P>This is probably neither the Bill nor the occasion on which to develop at any great length an advocacy of new methods of land allocation, such as were practised in the case of the allottees in Meath; but the Minister, who has a fairly fresh mind in this matter, might very well give further consideration to it, with a view to seeing whether that policy cannot be extended, if not on the Meath scale at least on a scale calculated to give these people a very much better start than that which they got by saying to them: &ldquo;There is your house, there is your land, sign the letting agreement here; do the best you can, how you can; and, so far as the State is concerned, beyond inquiring occasionally as to how you are getting on, we have no further interest in your activities of any material value to you&rdquo;.  As I said, in some respects I have some misgivings about the Bill, misgivings that it might possibly lead to cases of hardship, though here I must say that my experience of the Land Commission in the matter of treating sympathetically the case of a person not able to utilise land in the way the Land Commission required, has been a favourable one, indeed.</P>
    <P>I want to put this consideration to the Minister, in conclusion.  He has already indicated that this Bill will be administered in a sympathetic way, and that it is his desire to avoid any harshness.  Many of the people who are not able to utilise land on the Land Commission standards have got themselves into that position because <Col N="529" /> of some domestic adversity or some agricultural adversity.  Cattle die, horses die, or they find themselves unable to meet bank bills or grocers' bills, because of some adversity in the family.  Where that happens, I suggest to the Minister that he should give an assurance&mdash;and I feel he could give it&mdash;that the matter will be examined sympathetically.  If an allottee has not been able in the past, or even if he has not, for peculiar reasons of his own, been willing to utilise land to the fullest, he ought even now be given an opportunity to make good.  I suggest to the Minister that, no matter what he may have thought in the past about allottees who might be stigmatised as unsatisfactory allottees, if they are prepared in the future to give a guarantee that they will utilise land to the fullest, and if, by their own activities, they demonstrate on the face of the land their willingness to comply with that undertaking, their assurance should be accepted, and they should be allowed to remain on the land.  The test should be that, once they promise to utilise the land, they fulfil that promise without question.  If, in other cases, through illness or any other cause, the person puts up a case that has considerable merit in it, that there is a reason for his not utilising the land to the fullest, the Minister should give a person of that kind some opportunity of making good.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is administered sympathetically, and the House can be assured of that fact, I do not think there will be very strong objection to its enactment.  Therefore I would ask the Minister to give the House an assurance that, in any case where there is an element of merit of reasonable proportions, the allottee will be dealt with on the basis that, no matter what his faults were in the past, he will get an opportunity of making good in the future.  I make that suggestion to the Minister because I do not want to see the situation arise in which there may be evictions by the Land Commission in respect of badly used houses.  The whole country will sympathise with the man who was unable to utilise land for reasons outside his control.  If he <Col N="530" /> gets a chance to make good, I think the country will feel satisfied, and his neighbours will feel satisfied, that he is getting that chance.  No one will stand for the policy of houses remaining idle and land remaining unused.</P>
    <P>If, notwithstanding the Land Commission's warning, after the enactment of this Bill, houses continue to be unoccupied and land remains either unused or badly used, then the Minister and his officials will find all the moral endorsement they require for taking steps to give the unoccupied houses to people who want them and the unused land to people who will utilise it.  If the Minister embarks on the administration of this Bill in a manner guided by that prudence and sagacity of which he is capable, he may find that the mere introduction of the Bill and the discussion on the problem in this House, publicised as it will be through the country, may well help to cure the problem without resort to any drastic methods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies have stated one of the questions which, I am afraid, never will be satisfactorily settled in this country.  Belonging to a very small county in which there are very few ranches, I must say that, as far as I am personally concerned, in my 17 years here, I do not think I have written one letter to the Land Commission in regard to getting land for an allottee.  I am wise enough to know that, owing to the scarcity of land in this small country, and owing to the very large number of applications received for parcels of land, for the one man you please you displease 30 or 40 others.  Therefore it is not of much advantage for any Deputy to get land for people looking for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister finds it necessary to introduce this amending Bill and to issue a statement here that, at the moment, there are houses unoccupied which were built at great expense by the Land Commission, notwithstanding the fact that there is such a scarcity of houses at present and that there are so many people at their wits' end to know where to get living accommodation. The Minister says that in this year, 1946, he is forced to admit that there <Col N="531" /> were houses unoccupied.  I do not care whom it pleases or displeases, I would not stand for that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>As regards the parcels of land allotted to people who had no land, I was always under the impression that the governing factor which guided the Land Commission in giving land to people was that the people who got land already had a little farm of a few acres and that, therefore, the position implied by Deputy Norton would not arise, that some people who got land had no horses, cattle or anything else with which to work it.  I was under the impression that, in the main, land was given to people whose holdings were uneconomic, that they were given sufficient land to make those holdings economic.  However, to my great surprise, on reading the Minister's report, I find that people got land who never had land before and naturally had not the wherewithal to work it.  That came as a great surprise to me, not taking any particular interest as to who did or did not get land.  The officials of the Land Commission, so far as my very scant knowledge of them went, were carrying out their duties in a manner that gave general satisfaction.</P>
    <P>There is just one section in this Bill which I look upon with a certain amount of suspicion and it is the section which gives the officials of the Land Commission the power to take land from people who, in the opinion of the Land Commission, are not working the land to advantage.  My difficulty at the moment is that this amending Bill does not indicate who shall determine whether the farmer in question is working his land properly or not.  I always thought that each farmer in his own way knew how best to work his land.  If the Minister simply refers to people who are not working the land at all and who possibly are sub-letting it, then there is something to be said for the introduction of this section.  Notwithstanding the powers given to the Minister under previous Acts, the law courts have proved that they are not ample enough, and though he thinks it necessary to have these added powers, I <Col N="532" /> think we should be slow to give them to him unless we have a guarantee that they will be used&mdash;as I am sure they will&mdash;not to impose any undue or unnecessary hardship on the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not a farmer but I know there is a great difference of opinion existing, even among expert farmers, as to what use certain lands can be put to. We hear talk here about ranchers. Some Deputies seem to think a rancher is of no advantage to this country.  I want to disagree entirely with that viewpoint.  So far as the grasslands of County Meath are concerned, they have always been looked upon as the clearing-house for the small farmers in the West.  I do not know whether the small farmers in the West, with their one and a half and two year olds, would get the prices they now get and have been getting were it not for the big ranchers in County Meath, who went down and bought their cattle.  There are two ways of looking at this matter, a right way and a wrong way.  We cannot take our own opinions and base them on the condition of things pertaining to our own immediate area.  We must think of the country as a whole when we consider the division of land. Therefore I do not agree with the saying that because a farm happens to be a farm of 200 or 300 acres, that it is a ranch.  It is nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>No matter how you divide the land of this country, you will not have sufficient for the people who want it, because the country is not big enough and cannot provide everybody with land.  If you carry this question of land division to its logical conclusion, you will arrive at the time when you will not have satisfied everybody. You will be dividing the five-acre farms into two and a half acre farms and the two-acre farms into one-acre holdings.  In the course of time, you will have a thrifty farmer buying up the other fellow and after 30 or 40 years he will become a big farmer himself, because he will have half the countryside bought up.  That is the experience of a great many people in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> The other section I am suspicious of is Section 6, which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Where a holding or parcel of land (in this section referred to as the additional land) is at any time provided, whether before or after the passing of the Land Act, 1939 (No. 26 of 1939), for a purchaser for the enlargement of the holding (in this section referred to as the original holding) purchased or agreed to be purchased by him or any of his predecessors in title and the additional land has not been consolidated with the original holding, it shall not be lawful for the purchaser (whether the additional land and the original holding are or are not or either of them is or is not vested in him) to assign, transfer, sub-let, or sub-divide, without the consent of the Land Commission, the original holding or the additional land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be years before the holding is consolidated and vested in him, and I quite agree that the Minister is right, that people, possibly, might be clever enough and quick enough to dispose of the parcel of land.  The Minister may find it necessary to use these powers, but the whole thing is qualified by the expression &ldquo;without the consent of the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the two sections that I look upon with a certain amount of suspicion.  I quite agree that when this Bill becomes law the Minister, backed up by his officials, will administer it with consideration and moderation.  I would not like to go as far as Deputy Norton has gone in asking the Minister to stay his hand for too long a time because, as I could observe from the report here, the Minister has had very bad experience of the use made by allottees of the land given to them. Judging by the figures given by the Minister, I consider that there is a necessity for certain sections if the purpose of land division is not to be defeated.  I have in mind especially the question of empty houses.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should explain in greater detail the powers he seeks in regard to title and also what he regards as real good husbandry. I would like also to know the <Col N="534" /> person who will determine whether a farmer is or is not utilising his land to the best advantage.</P>

      <P>If I were to reply merely to those who dealt with the terms of the Bill, my speech would be so short as to appear discourteous to the Dáil.  Deputy Costello and Deputy Morrissey are the only members of the Opposition who addressed themselves to the Bill.  I did anticipate that we would have a debate ranging over the whole area of the administration of the land code.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton put a few points with which I should like to deal before I proceed to a general answer.  As long as Deputy Norton addressed himself to the Bill, he was clear and logical, but when he went outside the Bill and discussed the whole administration of land in the country he went as far down the winding primrose path as Deputy O'Donnell.  There is no political influence in regard to the allocation of land.  This Bill is not a punitive measure; it is a reform measure and it will be administered as the Land Commission administers all statutes, with sympathy and understanding.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion that Land Commission inspectors have been very lax in the choice they have made of allottees, let me say that no one&mdash; Deputy, Minister, inspector or judge on the bench&mdash;is infallible.  This is a bad situation which I have exposed to the House, but it is only a boil on the body politic and not leprosy, as some people seem to think, and it is curable.  This is the measure with which we propose to cure it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business of an opposition is to oppose, to try to pave the way towards the downfall of the Government and each Deputy in opposition will select the method which he thinks most effective and most suitable.  Deputies like Deputy Bennett, Deputy D. Morrissey and Deputy Costello have examined the measure before the House coldly and calmly, accepting that portion which they thought was good, and refusing to accept that portion which they thought was evil.  In my opinion, that is the method which Deputies of an Opposition should utilise in order to bring <Col N="535" /> about the downfall of the Government. They should give confidence to their followers by showing that they had a sense of responsibility, by showing that they were not merely attacking a measure simply in pique or because they were in opposition to the Government.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies seem to think that the best way to secure the downfall of the Government is to heap abuse on the Government, to accuse them of corruption.  I do not know how sincere and how earnest those are who make these charges of corruption.  It seems to me that, according to the general trend of the debate, the land code generally is acceptable to the Dáil. There are different opinions with regard to it among the Deputies.  It may appeal to Deputy Cafferky and Deputy Commons in one way, which Deputy Dillon particularly dislikes.  It may appeal to Deputy Giles in another way, but, taking it generally, the land code is acceptable to the Dáil.  It is the administration which is wrong.  It is because the responsible Minister is corrupt, because he has, under pressure from Deputies of his own Party and under threat by the clubs in his organisation, intimidated and bullied and corrupted the officials of his Department into wrong and evil-doing.</P>
    <P>Deputies, to my mind, have been most illogical in this debate.  They have not only held the Minister to be corrupt, but have said that the officials of the Land Commission are corrupt. Every Deputy knows the land code. Every Deputy knows that, under the 1933 Act, the Minister divested himself of a number of powers enumerated by Deputy Commons.  He has nothing to do with acquisition; he has nothing to do with allotment; he has nothing to do with price, resale, exchange, or any matters relating to husbandry.  All these things are reserved by the 1933 Act to the officials of the Land Commission, and when it is said that the Minister in office for a very short period has been able so to cow, bully and intimidate the Land Commission into evil-doing, they having these powers by statute, it is calling them not only cowards but knaves, and I have a <Col N="536" /> higher opinion of the Irish Civil Service than to believe that opinion of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan, the monetary reform Deputy&mdash;I had forgotten, like himself, that he was the monetary reform Deputy until he made his pump-priming proposals the other night&mdash; comes along, complete with little button on top, with his proposals and suggests that the Land Commission, having selected these allottees, having allotted land to them, and having built houses for them, should now proceed to help out the failures by handing them a substantial sum of fluid capital, and by stocking the lands. Deputy Norton made some such suggestion, too.  I think it is a most idiotic suggestion, and, so long as I am Minister for Lands, I tell Deputy Flanagan and anybody else who has that view that I will oppose that point of view tooth and nail.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan says&mdash;I have to refer to him, because he does make certain statements which may find credence in the country if they are not contradicted; otherwise, I would not bother with him&mdash;that in the gay, gladsome days when he was secretary of the Mountmellick Fianna Fáil Club, he was instructed never to send to the Land Commission, as secretary of his organisation, the name of any applicant for land other than a member of the Fianna Fáil organisation.  I hope that is correct, and I find no fault with such instructions to any member of a Fianna Fáil club.  The duty of a Deputy, once elected, is to serve the people in his constituency, irrespective of whether these people voted for him or not.  It is his duty and his privilege to make recommendations to every Department of State on behalf of those who ask for his help in looking for something to which they are entitled under the law.</P>
    <P>The organiser of a political organisation is in a completely different position. His job is to try to build up his organisation to the fullest strength, and one of the methods of doing that is to serve the members of his organisation. One reason we are told&mdash;it was said at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis yesterday&mdash;why the organisation of <Col N="537" /> Fine Gael has fallen flat is because the secretaries of the various units of the organisation did not give attention to the needs of their people in their own localities.  I make no apology for the secretary of any Fianna Fáil club who serves the members of his organisation. I have no apology to make for any member, Fianna Fáil or otherwise, who makes a recommendation, on behalf of those who seek his services, to any Department.  That is his duty and his privilege.  I hold that it is the duty of the officials of every Department of State to take particular cognisance of the representations of Deputies because they are the representatives of the people.  If that be treason, make the most of it.  I would quote James Bryce, who was a good Victorian Liberal, and Deputy Dillon would probably accept his dictum.  Writing in the <i>American Commonwealth</i> he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I will speak presently of public duty.  Meanwhile let it suffice to remark that to reply on public duty as the main motive power in politics is to assume a commonwealth of angels.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The people must be served and their needs must be attended to, and if a Deputy does not attend to the needs of his constituents to the best of his ability he will not be long here serving them.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputies addressing themselves to a measure before the House should read the terms of the Bill and should not read into it anything that it does not contain.  Deputy Hughes said that, in his opinion, much of the matter that the Bill contains should have been included in the written agreement as between the allottee and the Land Commission.  All this matter in regard to the contract between the allottee and the Land Commission is written into the agreement, and the allottee is neither under compulsion nor illusion.  It is all there for him.  In regard to what is in this Bill, which we are seeking to make effective, all these matters were included in the 1923 Act, Section 31.  I read the debate many years ago on the 1923 Act.  It could hardly be <Col N="538" /> called a debate.  It was a paean of praise of the Minister, and a complete welcome to the Bill.  No faults were found with it.  Everybody welcomed it, and they welcomed the particular section which contained these clauses which we are now seeking to make effective under the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I think that property in land is so fundamental that every precaution and effort should be made to safeguard it. It should be guarded by the action of the law courts but, if I think along correct lines, the Land Commission was created, among other purposes, to discharge a legal function which could not be discharged by the ordinary law courts with adequate celerity.  The Land Commission has, in effect, the standing of a law court.  The terms under which the commissioners are appointed are, roughly, the same as those of the judges.  If, as possibly would be right, if the problem were not so urgent or so wide, the law courts were to decide the fact as to those in whom land should be effectively vested and to whom it should be given, it would be, I think, the wisest course to take, but the problem was so urgent, so wide and so necessary that, to leave the decision as to those who were to get land in this country to the courts of justice would give us &ldquo;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&rdquo; again, and because that was the position it was decided, wisely, that a special tribunal should be set up to deal with the question of land.</P>
    <P>The contract is not a mere contract between the allottee and the Land Commission.  It is a contract between the allottee and the people of this country who pay for the land, and the Land Commission is the people's effective instrument for dealing with the proposal.  Even if the Bill is passed, the Land Commission will still have to go to the courts, but I do hold that nobody is in a position to say whether the land is really being worked according to the proper methods of husbandry other than the Land Commission. Nobody is really cognisant of whether the allottee is living in his house or not other than the Land Commission. We merely want to go before the courts with our certificate that the land is not being worked, not for <Col N="539" /> the purpose of having wholesale evictions, but to try to secure that the beneficiary who has secured a very substantial piece of property from the State shall carry out his own contract with the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, full of sound and fury and Victorian declamation, comes along to the House and talks about the corruption of the Minister, the Fianna Fáil Party, and the Land Commission. This is what he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Bill has been made necessary by the corrupt interference of the Fianna Fáil Deputies with the administration of the Land Commission. Everyone knows that rotten, corrupt interference has been going on for the last 15 years.  Certain elements in the Land Commission have strenuously and courageously resisted it and many a man has suffered for the honest fight he put up to maintain some standards of decency in the operation of the land law....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, in wild anger apparently, says, &ldquo;We will never get the files.&rdquo;  Why should you? There is a very easy way of getting at the files of the Land Commission.  It is open to the Deputies of the Opposition Party.  It is quite a simple matter.  All you have got to do is to go before the country with an effective policy and get elected in a majority to this House and appoint a Minister and the Minister you appoint will have all the files of the Land Commission available to him.  Deputy Flanagan, talking about the corruption of the Land Commission and what he did in the old days when he was secretary of the Mountmellick Fianna Fáil Club, made an allegation in this House that there was no land ever divided in his district that the inspectors of the Land Commission did not call to consult him as to the manner of its division.</P>
      <P>I leave it to the Deputies of this House.  Even in 1946, when Deputy Flanagan has been several years in this House, is there any man in the House who would consult his opinion in regard to any serious matter and, five years ago, when he was secretary of the Mountmellick Fianna Fáil Club and when he had not had the experience he now has or the opportunities he now has, surely it is not to be expected that any inspector of the Land Commission who has had to pass an examination to get into the Land Commission, who has to have some education and experience and who is supposed to have some tact, would go to consult with the secretary of the Fianna Fáil club, Deputy Flanagan. When Deputy Flanagan made that statement in the House I caused an immediate inquiry to be made and as a result of that inquiry, made by the responsible heads of the Land Commission, I say that there is not a shadow of truth in the allegation made by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> Deputy Dillon has referred to the files that &ldquo;we will never get.&rdquo;  Of course they will not.  They will never be elected to get them.  The first man to object, if a departmental file were brought into this House concerned with such a matter, would be Deputy Dillon, and he would be right.  I could produce letters from Deputy Flanagan complaining to the Land Commission of the fact that nobody in his locality got any land other than Fine Gael supporters, that members of the Fianna Fáil club were completely ignored by the inspectors of the Land Commission.  I thought I understood Deputy Dillon to say, a few nights ago, that responsible officials of the Land Commission courageously opposed the policy of Fianna Fáil.  I thought I understood him to say that.  Reading the debates I find that is not correct but, if there was any official of the Land Commission who opposed the Government policy while I was Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the land war and Deputy Blowick spoke about the sacrifices made for the land in this country.  Many of us on this side of the House have read closely the history of the land war and have reason to know, outside of that, a good deal about it.  Many of us have reason to know of the work that was done and the sacrifices that were made.  Who fought the land war?  Clann na Talmhan seem to claim a proprietary heirship, if I may so call it, in the land war.  If the farmers of Ireland alone had been concerned in fighting the land war and if they were the only people who made sacrifices there would be very little land in the hands of the farmers now.  Some of those who were most prominent in helping them to get the land, as Deputy Dillon knows, were, by the new co-operatives, called &ldquo;gombeen&rdquo; men.  Was not it the shopkeepers in Tipperary, was not it the craftsmen in the towns, was not it <Col N="542" /> the labourers everywhere in the country that stood by the farmers unselfishly and made the sacrifices to help them? I hope the farmers throughout the country and their representatives in various Parties here, Clann na Talmhan, etc., will not have forgotten and do not forget what other people did to win the land for them.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion <Col N="543" /> that in order to secure a more equitable distribution of the burden of local rates, and to promote increased employment on the land, legislation should be introduced providing for complete derating of the first £20 of the poor law valuation of each farm and the further total derating of each additional £15 of the poor law valuation in respect of each adult worker employed on the holding; and that the deficit be made good from the Exchequer.&mdash;(Deputies Cogan and Halliden).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying on the last occasion on which this motion was debated that the question of some kind of derating must be taken seriously into consideration in the very near future.  In most counties at present the estimates have been prepared and will be submitted to the various county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every single case they show an increase in the rates.  Various excuses have been put forward for this increase, the principal one being that there is a sharp increase in the cost of road maintenance and repair, due to insufficient material and equipment being available during the emergency years. In many cases, roads have deteriorated, as anybody who travels over them knows, and they must be put in repair. While that is happening, there is also another matter which is adversely affecting the ratepayers.  We have certain road users who do infinite damage to the roads and who are not contributing towards the rates or towards the upkeep of these roads what they should contribute.  There are many other factors which contribute to an increase in the rates and make it very hard for the ordinary ratepayer to meet his liabilities.  The rates are on the increase and there is no indication whatever that they will not continue to increase.  In my county an estimate has been prepared for a rate of something like 19/10 in the £ for the coming year. That rate, I have no doubt, will be passed as it stands.  We have no guarantee that in ten or 15 years' time the county council that will be then in charge of my county will not be faced with an estimate of something like 39/10 in the £.  While all that is happening <Col N="544" /> there is no corresponding increase in the income of the ratepayer. Something will have to be done in the matter of partial derating to meet that situation.</P>
    <P>In the Six Counties, I understand, they have complete derating for all farms.  I may not be absolutely correct in that, but I think I am not wrong in saying that there is complete derating. At the same time, we are looking forward to the day when the Border will be removed and the 32 Counties will be all under one Parliament.  I cannot see Northern Ireland farmers looking forward with any great hope or joy to the removal of the Border if they have to come under an all-Ireland Parliament under which they will have to pay rates on the land again to the amount we are paying here.  That is only a slight argument, but it is a very definite argument in favour of doing something towards partial derating.  We are not asking for complete derating, because that would raise a big question and would place a huge burden on the shoulders of the taxpayers in general. What we ask for is derating of the first £20 of the valuation.  That would include the small farmers who are finding it increasingly difficult from year to year to meet their liability for rates.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to give the motion very favourable consideration, and the Minister to meet it as favourably as he can.  It has been put down for no other purpose than to bring a very large measure of relief to a class of people in the country who are least able to bear the burden of rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion that I heard Clann na Talmhan Deputies speaking to a motion in this House they were complaining very bitterly about the enormous and ever-increasing burden of national taxation.  To-night they will walk into the Division Lobby to add another couple of million pounds to that enormous and ever-increasing burden for the taxpayers.  I was very glad to hear a number of Deputies on this side of the House, particularly Deputies from the west, who understand the conditions of the small holders, point out to Clann na Talmhan that if this £2,000,000 is to <Col N="545" /> be collected off the taxpayers instead of the farmers and if additional taxes are put on commodities like tea, sugar and tobacco, the small farmers will pay more by way of increased taxes than they are paying as rates.  That cannot be denied.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to notice that only a certain section of the Clann na Talmhan Party showed any great enthusiasm about this motion.  On the last occasion on which we debated this motion for a long time only two members of the Clann na Talmhan Party were present.  It is noticeable that those who come from districts in which the majority of the farmers are small farmers have not taken much part in this debate.  I should like Deputy Donnellan, the next time he can take a little time off from abusing Fianna Fáil, when he goes round the country to explain to the small farmers that he addresses how it came about that his particular Party in the Dáil was proposing that they should pay more in taxation in relief of rates in order to take the burden off the larger farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one has made a case, not even Deputy Hughes, for complete derating, or for this additional £2,000,000 of derating, according to the scheme set out here in the Clann na Talmhan motion. No one has made a case for it on the basis that the farmers want it or are in need of it.  Indeed, Deputy Hughes went so far as to say that farming conditions were good and Deputies Cogan and Blowick assented to that statement.  Why, then, is it proposed, when farming conditions are good, to add £2,000,000 to what Clann na Talmhan called, in another motion, &ldquo;the enormous and ever-increasing burden of national taxation&rdquo;?  I would like to see the farmers always well off and getting a reasonable income, but one of the most disastrous things that could happen the farming community is that people who claim to speak as their representatives should cry &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; when there is no wolf there.  Deputies Hughes and Cogan know as well as I do that there is no necessity to cry &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; in relation to this matter and that, if there is a farmer who is not making a living at present on the land, the best thing he <Col N="546" /> can do for himself and the country is to change his occupation.</P>
    <P>Allusion was made here to the derating put in operation in England and the Six Counties.  It is not true to say, as Deputy Cogan said, that the farmers either in England or the Six Counties are completely immune from rates.  Deputy Blowick repeated that here to-night, but then seemed to get some doubts about it.  They have still to pay rates on their houses and, in a few rural districts which I looked up in the Six Counties, I noticed that, a few years after the land was derated, the poundage went up on what was left in the houses by more than double.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not believe, first of all, that our farmers are in such a plight at the moment that the rest of the community should come to their assistance. As has always happened in wartime, when food is short, food producers do better than when there is a surplus in times of peace.  The amount of money which our farmers got for their produce has increased greatly since 1938 or 1939. The value of their produce, that is, the net produce after taking from the gross output the amount which they paid for seeds, manures, and so on, in 1938 was £41.1 millions, at 1938 prices.</P>
    <P>In 1944, the value of the net output in current prices was £90,000,000.  Now, surely we should realise that the other sections of the community have not had values or wages increased to anything like that extent, from £41,000,000 to £90,000,000?  I do not think it would be fair to ask the general taxpayer, in present circumstances, to bear any increased burden, for the purpose of giving any further relief in rates to the farmers at this time.  I think the farmers are ill-served by the Deputies who make such a claim on their behalf at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan made a statement which he made here on another occasion. I corrected him then, and I have to correct him again, to see if I can get him to accept the facts.  He said there has been a reduction in the volume of agricultural output in the last five or six years.  The truth of the matter is that, between 1938 and 1944, there was the increase in the value of net output that I have given, from <Col N="547" /> £41,000,000 to £90,000,000; and taking the volume of 1944 and valuing it at 1939 prices, there was an increase in the net volume of output of 8 per cent.  It went up from £41.1 millions to £43.9 millions.  During the war, notwithstanding all their difficulties, the fact that machinery and parts were hard to get and that artificial manures were short, the farmers raised the volume of output by 8 per cent. during those years.</P>
    <P>Anyone who thinks that 1 or 2 per cent. increase per year is small should recall that, in the 1920's, when there was what the Americans regarded as a very big increase in industrial efficiency from 1920 to 1929, they used to boast that the industrial efficiency went up by 3 per cent. per annum.  In America at that time, one need only have the money to buy anything he wanted in the line of machinery and so on, yet the American industrialist, with plenty of money and a big market for the output, with the urge to cut costs owing to high wages, only increased the industrial efficiency in those years at an average of 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>During the war, with all the handicaps that our farmers had to contend with, they increased their volume of net output by 2 per cent. per annum.  I think that that was a magnificent achievement and that they are to be congratulated upon it.</P>
    <P>I also think that we should look at these figures from another angle.  Even at present day prices, prices which are very much higher in many respects than either the English or the Six-County farmers are getting, and twice as high as the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand or American farmers are getting for many commodities, that £90,000,000 is produced from over 12,000,000 arable acres and it really represents only an output of £8 per acre. That is a figure that is disappointing. It is a figure that will have to be improved if our national income is to go up in terms of real goods and if the standard of life of our people is to be improved.  We can only distribute what we have got and, if we want to distribute more agricultural goods, we shall have to produce more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> If Deputy Cogan or Deputy Hughes comes forward here with a proposition, with any sort of promise in it, designed to increase the volume of output per acre, I would welcome it, even though it might cost something to do it.  But the proposition that they have put forward, and spoken in favour of here, is not designed to increase the output per acre, and would not have that effect.  It has been much more valuable for our community, and for our farmers, too, that the approach of the Government in helping the farmers took the shape of encouraging them by fixed, guaranteed prices, high prices in many respects, for the goods they were prepared to produce.  It was costly from a monetary point of view to produce the wheat that we produced before and during the war, but that production saved our country in time of need and I think that will be always a good policy for our people to pursue&mdash; to be in the position to say at all times that if they cannot get produce from abroad, they will be able to produce a fair quantity for themselves.</P>
    <P>The price that we are paying for wheat, even at the moment, on the basis of wheat dried down to 14 per cent. of moisture, is £7 a ton more than we can get Canadian wheat for, landed in Dublin.  The £7 a ton extra that is given to our farmers for that wheat would go far, and probably might even surpass, the figure of a couple of millions which is asked for in the motion.  I think the money is much better spent in giving the farmers of this country that much extra for their wheat rather than simply doling it out to them in relief of rates. The community at least, in giving a subsidy for wheat, get value for it, and they do not pay until delivery is made.  No wheat production, no money. But if they were to spend the £2,000,000 simply in relief of rates, not an ounce of wheat would be produced.</P>
    <P>Take beet.  Last year I saw an estimate somewhere that the farmers got £2,500,000 for their beet.  I think it is better to give the farmers an extra price for their beet, even though we could get sugar from abroad at any particular time.  Give them a price for their beet that will encourage them to <Col N="549" /> grow it, so that this country will be preserved in a crisis and will not have to go begging for sugar from other countries.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Cogan would only get rid of this habit of his of trying to get votes in 1946 on the lines of certain arguments that were put forward by Fianna Fáil 20 years ago, and would get alive in 1946 and face the problems of 1946 and put forward solutions for them, it would be better for the country and, in the long run, it would be better for his Party in getting votes.  It is true that in 1931 the Fianna Fáil Party, when the farmers were very badly off, proposed that we should hold the land annuities and give half of them to farmers in relief of rates.  It is true that Fianna Fáil, when it was elected as the Government, said that instead of giving the £2,000,000 to the farmers in relief of rates they would give it to them in the form of halving the land annuities.</P>
    <P>We changed our minds, told the people what we were going to do and since then we have fought I do not know what number of general elections. The people knew and were satisfied with the reasons we gave them for applying the £2,000,000 which we promised them in relief of land annuities rather than in relief of rates.  If I had £2,000,000 to-morrow, if somebody gave me £2,000,000 to spend as I would like and I wanted to use it to benefit the agricultural community, I would not give it in relief of rates and I certainly would not give it under any circumstances in relief of rates on land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan differed on whether or not it was advisable to derate farm buildings.  I thought Deputy Cogan had made rather the better argument there.  If we are to spend money on the relief of rates, if the farmers' conditions are bad, it would be better, from the point of view of the community, to relieve the farmer in relation to his buildings rather than in relation to his land.  By increasing our agricultural buildings, I have no doubt that we would increase our agricultural output, and I hope that the farmers, as soon as material becomes available, will increase <Col N="550" /> their farm buildings, their stores and sheds, in order to put themselves in a better position to increase agricultural output.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan admitted that his resolution was somewhat vague as to what he meant and as to whether he meant to apply the relief of rates to agricultural buildings as well as to agricultural land.  The motion is a little vague and it simply reflects Deputy Cogan's mind on this whole matter.  Deputy Hughes, however, talks about rates on agricultural land being the same as a tax on raw material.  That is just clap-trap.</P>
    <P>The whole of the taxation of this country, both local and national, can be regarded as a tax on our total national income, but if we want the services which the community is providing for itself, such as roads, health services, social services and public services of all kinds, the money to be spent on them must be got somewhere, and whatever proportion of our total national output is consumed by the people to whom we make these various payments has to be subtracted from what is left for the producers.  At the moment, that proportion is fairly high, and the only way in which we can increase the services demanded by the people who want better roads, better health services, better pension services and so on, without taking a bigger proportion still from the producers, is to increase out national output.</P>
    <P>That is why I say that, while I reject this motion, I would welcome suggestions from Deputies at any time even though they do cost money, if they have a fair hope of increasing the national output of goods and services so that we may have them distributed to the community and the farmers particularly will have to set themselves to increasing this miserably low output per acre of £8.  If the average farmer came up even to the second best among our farmers, that output per acre could easily be doubled.</P>
    <P>To listen to Deputy Cogan and Deputy Hughes, one would think the Government had no interest in agriculture and had done nothing to relieve the farmers during its term of office. Apart altogether from the guaranteed <Col N="551" /> prices for wheat, beet and so on, and apart altogether from the £2,000,000 which went towards halving the land annuities, the supplementary agricultural grants voted each year amount to £1,270,000.  The Department of Agriculture, which is a Department whose expenses largely consist of educational and research work on behalf of the agricultural community and of schemes for the development of various agricultural projects, is costing about £1,000,000.  There are, too, the agricultural produce subsidies and for dairy produce alone last year the amount estimated to be spent was £825,000. Deputies saw recently the White Paper issued by the Government showing that, for the next five years, we propose to guarantee certain prices to the farmers for milk in relation to costs.  That is much more valuable work than merely giving the farmers a dole when, as Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan admit, they do not want it, when conditions are good.</P>
    <P>Apart from these various schemes, there is a scheme which I regard as very valuable, that is, the farm improvements scheme, costing around £350,000 per year.  I should much prefer to spend £2,000,000 in that way, in improving the land of the country, than in merely giving it in relief of rates at a time when farmers do not want it.  The subsidies given in that way for farm improvements not only improve the farmer's capacity to make an income but improve the national income by increasing the farmer's capacity to produce goods for the sustenance of the people.</P>
    <P>All through this Book of Estimates, there will be found, in most of the Estimates, sums of money which are being spent in order to educate the farmers to make better use of their land and in order to give them and their dependents relief in case of necessity.  I appeal to the farmers at this time not to go about crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; when they are not in danger, but to bend themselves to the job of increasing their production, of improving their land, so that in a permanent way, they will be better off and the nation will benefit by their efforts.  I will conclude now as I understand the <Col N="552" /> proposer of the motion is to be allowed 20 minutes to reply.</P>

      <P>I will not take more than two minutes.  The only thing that I am concerned with in regard to this motion is the argument put up here, time after time, by members of other Parties in connection with what is going on over the Border.  The argument made is that certain things going on here militate against the Border position.  When I sat on the Opposition Benches 18 years ago, I advocated derating and I got what I wanted&mdash;a reduction of 50 per cent. in our land annuities.  That amounted to £1,000,000.  We got the Cosgrave Party to knock off £750,000, and we gave the other £250,000 ourselves when we came in.  Deputy Hughes talked about the man with a £50 valuation holding whose rates were 12/8 in the pound. He first of all gets a reduction of £5 15s. 0d.  Then, he said, that for each man that farmer has he gets a reduction in his rates of, I think, 5/9½ on £12 10s. 0d.  That amounts to £3 12s. 4d.  If the man has two sons working with him on the farm he gets a reduction, according to Deputy Hughes, of £12 19s. 8d. in his rates. Then there is a further supplementary grant of 3/1½ on £5, so that in all the man gets a reduction of £13 14s. 8d. That, according to the Deputy, brings his ordinary rates of £31 13s. 4d. down to £17 18s. 8d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the position of the joker across the Border, let me remind the Deputy that a man on a holding with a £50 valuation has to pay his land annuities in full, even though John Bull does not charge him a penny in <Col N="553" /> respect of them.  His annuities, let us say, amount to £20.  In the case of the farmer here whose annuities were £20, he is now paying only half that amount, namely, £10.  Therefore, we must take that £10 off the £17 18s. 8d. that he has to pay.</P>
    <P>I find now that the farmer across the Border is now paying 135 per cent. increase in his housing rate.  If you take it that £12 would be a fair valuation for the farm buildings, it would mean that a man was paying something like £9 12s. 6d. a year.  So that between what we are giving to our farmers here plus the reduction of 50 per cent. in their annuities, our farmers are better off than the farmers across the Border.</P>
    <P>Therefore it would pay those jokers across the Border to come in here.  I hate the kind of arguments that were put up on this question.  The Labour Party say that the people across the Border are getting so much better social services than our people.  Other Deputies say that the farmers across the Border are far better off than ours because they are getting derating, and that it is because of that they will not come in here.  In my opinion none of these things would bring them in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's arguments are silly.  The Minister spent a good deal of time in seeking to contest this motion.  His first argument was that we in this Party advocated some time ago by a motion that the cost of government should be reduced and that national taxation should be reduced. We stand firmly by that demand.  We <Col N="554" /> hold that the cost of government should be reduced by economies in all our national services and that the money saved by such economies should be utilised for the derating of agricultural land.  If that is done all the arguments that have been used against derating fall to the ground&mdash;the arguments that derating would impose an additional burden upon the general taxpayer, upon the small farmer and upon the townsman.  Derating will impose no burden on any section of the community if it is financed by economies in national administration and that is the line on which we suggest it should be financed.</P>
      <P>As there is not much time left, I think I ought to try to correct a mistake under which the Minister appears to be labouring in regard to the volume of our agricultural output.  I think that the only way to correct him since he will not accept my word is to quote the actual words of his predecessor in office, made in the course of the last Budget statement.  In introducing the Budget last year the then Minister for Finance said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Between 1938/39 and 1943/44 (the latest period for which statistics are available) the gross output of agriculture rose in value by 79 per cent. while the value of net output of agriculture (or the value added to the materials by the agricultural process) increased considerably more&mdash;by 103 per cent.&mdash;because of the decline in the volume and value of materials. This increase in the net value of output of agriculture was due principally to a marked increase in agricultural prices&mdash;which have nearly doubled since the outbreak of war.  On the other hand, the gross volume of agricultural output declined by 11 per cent. in the same period.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <P>I am afraid I will have to read it again for the Minister: &ldquo;On the other hand, the gross volume of agricultural output declined by 11 per cent. in the same period.&rdquo;  I am afraid the Minister is incapable of distinguishing between volume and value, and that <Col N="555" /> is where he has got himself completely mixed up.</P>

      <P>I was rather glad that Deputy O'Connor intervened in this debate because he honestly and fairly revealed to the House the hard core of ignorance and prejudice in regard to agricultural matters that exists amongst a large section of our people. Deputy O'Connor, speaking as a member of the legal profession and speaking from the heart of the City of Dublin told us, first of all, that farmers pay their men miserable wages; that farmers do not pay their fair share of income-tax; that the banks are bursting with farmers' money.  What are the facts?  Let us get down to the official figures of national income.  The national income, as stated by the Minister's illustrious predecessor, last year, was £250,000,000.  The net income of agriculture for the same year was £81,000,000.  There are 650,000 people employed in agriculture.  There are approximately 650,000 people employed in other gainful occupations. It does not require higher mathematics to calculate the income of the individual worker on the land as compared with the income of the individual worker in other occupations. According to these figures, the average income of the individual worker on the land, for last year, was £124; the average income of the individual worker in all occupations other than agriculture, was £260.  Therefore, you have the position that the average income per head of those working on the land amounted to £2 7s. 6d. per week while the average weekly income of those engaged in all other occupations was £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can anyone dare to say, in face of <Col N="556" /> these figures, in face of the fact that those outside agriculture derived a weekly income of more than double the income of those engaged in agriculture, that the farming community are more prosperous than any other section of the community?  Where, out of that income of £2 7s. 6d. per week, can a person engaged in agriculture find the money wherewith to burst the banks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Must not maintenance be added to that?  Is not that the net income?  The Deputy is talking about net income in one case and gross income in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  I am talking about the total income in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>But one is net and the other is gross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not&mdash;definitely not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Those working on the land have maintenance in addition to £2 7s. 6d and the others have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolutely untrue, because, in all statistics calculating the value of the output of agriculture, the income from all sources is taken and the cost of maintenance is included.  There is an atmosphere of prosperity in our larger cities and towns and it is only natural that our statistics of income and of the distribution of national income should bear out what we see.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that we were demanding derating at a time when agriculture is more prosperous than it was, perhaps, six or seven years ago.  The case for derating does not rest upon whether agriculture is prosperous or otherwise.  The case for derating rests upon the fact that the burden of taxation is inequitably distributed. If we were to base our case for derating on the fact that agriculture was going through a temporary depression, we would be asking only for temporary derating but in this motion we are asking for a permanent reform, a reform of our rating system which will last for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be some misapprehension as to the conditions of farmers <Col N="557" /> in Northern Ireland and Great Britain in regard to derating.  The Minister seemed to suggest that only agricultural land is derated in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  The fact of the matter is that agricultural land and farm buildings are completely derated.  The dwelling-house only is subject to rates in Northern Ireland.  I think that is also our demand here, that in so far as this motion applies to derating of agricultural holdings, it shall apply to land and farm buildings.  I have advanced a number of arguments as to why farm buildings should be included in derating. They are the farmers' working capital; they are the equipment with which he works the land; they are as much entitled to be free from rates as the farmer's plough, his harrow or his reaper and binder.</P>
    <P>I hope the motion will be accepted in spite of what the Minister has said against it.  I am sure there are sufficient farmer-Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party to support the motion in <Col N="558" /> spite of what the solicitors and the Minister may say.  If the motion is accepted it will mark a far-reaching reform in the financing of local administration and a far-reaching reform in the working of agriculture.  It will make for increased output on the land inasmuch as it will give real encouragement to the farmer to employ more men to each holding.  That is what we need at the present time.  We want a more intensive system of farming, greater output, and now is the time to give that encouragement to the farmer. Now is the time, particularly in view of the fact that the farmer will have to compete with other countries in the coming years under difficult circumstances as far as our export trade is concerned.  It is essential that costs of agricultural production should be cut to the lowest.  I therefore recommend the motion to the House and hope that it will be accepted.</P>
