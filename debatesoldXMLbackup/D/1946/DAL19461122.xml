    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time local government and public health are under the one Ministry.  The idea in regard to this Bill is to appoint a second Minister.  At present there is one Minister and two Parliamentary Secretaries.  We know what happened during the last session, that a lot of time was wasted on a Public Health Bill which is now to be scrapped.  In my opinion, there is a good deal of overlapping.  I think that, instead of having a second Minister, it would be better if we had more co-ordination. It might be better, instead of the proposal before us, if we were to appoint a manager or a Minister who would have control over all.  We are discussing local government and public health. We have, for example, public works and water control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the second <Col N="1405" /> Minister is appointed you will have local government and social services. Water control will come under these.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes and he will be subject to questions on these matters, but he has not yet been appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy agrees with me that the Minister has not yet been appointed.  That being so, I do not see how his administration can be discussed now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of the duties that he will have to perform. My point is that co-ordination of Ministries would be very much better.  I think there is too much overlapping. For instance, I am one of those who believe in the County Management Act.  I think it is a great Act.  We were at sea in the county councils until a manager was appointed.  Now you have someone that you can approach.  You can ask the county manager why this thing or that thing was not done.  I think there is overlapping, and that each Minister is a law unto himself.  The managerial system has been on trial now for some years, and in my opinion very good work has been done under it.  As I have said, a lot of time was wasted on the Public Health Bill in the last session and now it is to be scrapped. If you had the co-ordination of services that would not have happened.  I <Col N="1406" /> suppose that we have the highest tuberculosis population in the world.  I take it that the future Minister for Public Health will pursue the scheme already drawn up for the building of three tuberculosis sanatoria.  This is a paramount need at the present moment. But I would suggest that the root cause of tuberculosis in rural Ireland is impure water.  I maintain that one out of every ten of the present rural water supplies would not bear an analytical test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I might find myself in the soup then.  The functions of the newly-appointed Ministers are the matters in which I am most deeply concerned.  I do not want to have overlapping of functions.  That has been a great weakness in the past. Some attempt must be made at co-ordination of the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on two points mainly.  The first is that there will be more expedition in the discharge of the services undertaken by the new Ministries.  Secondly, new and unrelated matters, some of which have been referred to as the stepchildren of other Ministries, will now be brought together in such a way that they will receive more personal attention and so ensure a better service to the community.  This discussion has travelled over a very wide field and it has intrigued me to hear members, more junior even than I am myself, making charges of incompetence and indolence against State Departments in a most reckless manner.  In my experience these services have been efficiently conducted in the past.  Undoubtedly, because of the emergency, and for some other causes too, there has at times been considerable delay and disappointment occasioned to local authorities. But the fault cannot be laid at the door of the Minister or his Department in these matters.  The emergency has ceased now, even though some of the emergency conditions still prevail. I think it is a very welcome change to <Col N="1407" /> establish new Ministries for the discharge of these social services.</P>
      <P>I have heard Deputies talking of the tuberculosis scare and other matters of that kind.  Some of them were prepared to make the wildest statements in this House reflecting on the community in general and on their country without any regard to facts and figures. I think our race is just as healthy, if not more so, than any other race on the earth.  At home and abroad our people have engaged in the most hazardous enterprises and have come through them with credit to themselves and to their country.  No doubt in this community, as in all other communities, there are defects.  These defects can be remedied partly by a better education of the people themselves and partly by the efforts made by the State to make conditions at home more hygienic and more sanitary.</P>
      <P>I give Deputy Morrissey credit that at all times his contributions to the House are impressive even though they may not always be convincing.  I must admit, however, that I consider his contribution to this debate in no way convincing.  He maintained that housing could not be divorced from public health.  I think even the public bodies themselves, if they were canvassed in this respect, would still advise a separate Ministry for housing alone. Housing is a vital need all over the country at the present time.  That is the function of the Minister for Public Health and I think it could be in no more capable hands than it is at the moment.  I take it that it will continue to be his function in the future.  The local authorities are the people who will make recommendations for the provision of housing for those persons who for accommodation or health reasons are most in need of new homes.  Even in the local authorities themselves I think it would be wise to have a completely detached section dealing with building, repairs, subsidies to private individuals and public bodies, rent collections and so on.  I think that is a service which will require all the energies of the local authorities.  The matter is urgently in need of a certain amount of reorganisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> I heard some Deputy last night speak of a medical administrator for public health.  I hope that public health administration will not be taken out of the hands of the local authorities and passed over to a medical administrator. Medical administrators both in the dispensaries and in the other county services are very necessary.  At the present time they give all the necessary assistance to the local authority. I think, however, that no medical administrator should have direct responsibility to the Minister in matters concerning public health.  The voices of the duly appointed public representatives should still be heard. County homes and hospitals will in future come under social welfare.</P>
    <P>Whether the home assistance patients in the hospitals will be paid for by the public assistance authority on a <i>per capita</i> basis, or by some other method, is something that will have to be worked out and I can see that it will present some difficulty.  However, taken in general, I think that suggestions made in the Bill are very wise and timely, that the public will in the very near future get more expedition in the administration of local government, that the delays and inconveniences that now occur will in great measure be removed. Also, by reason of more personal contact with the services which are administered, I am sure that the new Ministers will see the defects, both financial and in the matter of administration, and they will be able to improve the services in a way that has long been calling out for attention.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much else that I need say on the matter.  I am sure the House will approve the steps that are being taken and that the administration of these services will be a credit both to the State and to local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because I believe the population of this country, and particularly the population among the necessitous classes, has increased to such an extent that it is necessary to have an additional Department which one can approach when making an appeal for the necessitous people that we can see around us <Col N="1409" /> Therefore, without making any complaint with regard to the past I think it is well, because of the increase in the population, that these services should be provided.</P>
      <P>Looking over the explanatory memorandum, I am tempted to ask the Minister if there is anything in the Bill that does not show itself clearly to the average mind in the House.  For instance, in the middle of the explanatory memorandum this appears:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These functions will include the supervision of the direct preventive and curative health services which are at present the responsibility of county councils, county borough councils, sanitary authorities and public assistance authorities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the word &ldquo;supervision&rdquo; is on one line in that paragraph and the word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; only two lines down, I should like to know if there is any effort being made, through some method not plain to be seen, to take certain administrative powers from the local authorities and give them to some Department?</P>
      <P>We have 360 old age pension committees functioning all over Ireland. Will any effort be made to interfere with those democratically elected committees, which form a sort of appeal board between the Minister's Department and the applicant for a pension as regards their system of administration? I hope there will be no attempt to remove or interfere with that type of committee, which arbitrates between the Department and the applicant for an old age or blind pension.  I should like the Minister to clear up that point. I hope he will give us an assurance that there will be no effort to interfere with these democratically elected bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker must also have something in his mind along these lines, because he referred to the question of public health and the medical services being taken from the local authority.  For instance, public assistance and unemployment assistance hinge together.  I will ask the Minister to look up a very short file I sent him some time ago in connection with <Col N="1410" /> what was known as the Knockmaroon Relief Scheme, which was dealt with by the Department of Industry and Commerce because of unemployment benefits, and by the Department of Local Government because of home assistance.  About 20 men went out to Knockmaroon from Dublin to engage in relief work.  They were told there was to be no wet time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will merely deal with the point where two Departments clash, with resulting loss, to the extent of £7 or £8, to 20 men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>How does that enter into the consideration of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two Ministers about to be appointed and in the case I am dealing with I had the misfortune to be referred from one Department to another and I could never get the matter cleared up.  I will deal very briefly with it.  An officer said that the men had refused work and he would not give them unemployment benefit.  When they were refused that benefit another Department gave them home assistance but stopped the vouchers.  When the men were not getting unemployment assistance they could not get the relief vouchers from the other Department.  Eventually three arbitration courts decided in favour of the workers.  Let me call the officer the first court, then there was a supervisor and then there was an unemployment court.</P>
      <P>The men eventually won their case, but the home assistance authority put in a claim against the workmen's benefits and got paid for the vouchers which they gave them.  I hope, whatever Minister takes over the administration of public assistance in the city, will see that that kind of investigation and victimisation will not take place. The memorandum goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It will also take over other services for the relief of necessitous persons.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I implore the new Minister who will <Col N="1411" /> come to take out of the hands of the relieving officers and the inspectors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be a little longer in public life than that Deputy.  I see in the explanatory memorandum words that I would like to be clear about, because I may be told in a month or three months: &ldquo;You agreed to let it go and it was referred to in the memorandum.&rdquo; This memorandum is full of new duties for the new Ministers.  Surely, a member of the House who has to vote one way or the other can draw attention to the dangers he sees in this and the fears that he will be told he agreed to, if he does not draw attention now to the duties of the new Ministers and ask if those duties will cover up certain points that we feel should be covered up and in regard to which we have a grievance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree with me that he is endeavouring, under the guise of discussing the duties of the new Ministers, to discuss details of cases already administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply because they are described in the memorandum that has been issued to us, giving reasons why these new Ministers should be appointed.  Again I say I welcome the new Ministers, I am glad they are coming in and that we will not have somebody who is as busy as the present Minister to appeal to to remove <Col N="1412" /> the grievances we know exist all round us.  For instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, the Deputy must realise he cannot discuss the grievances that already exist.  The memorandum points out the duties which will be assigned to the new Ministers, if they are appointed.  That is all.  How the Minister will administer his affairs when he is appointed is a matter for later discussion.  How the present Minister administers those affairs may not be discussed now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a Chinn Comhairle, we know the Ministers will be appointed.  We know the Minister's majority here and that he has only to say the word and get what he wants. I say this is an opportunity, because of what I am reading here and because of the explanations given to us, when I should, to the best of my ability, put forward the existing grievances to which the new Ministers should attend.</P>

      <P>There were other things I wished to deal with&mdash;the treatment of blind pensioners and the School Meals Act.  However, when the new Ministers have been appointed, I may ask for an opportunity to draw attention to those things which are growing up around us in the city, due to the increasing number of the very necessitous classes, who are unable to obtain employment, in addition to which we have discharges from our Army of men for whom there is no work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Health, we have been told, is the greatest wealth and charity is among the first of virtues; but health and charity, if the speeches in this debate can be taken as indicating their true minds, count for nothing with the Fine Gael <Col N="1413" /> Party and count for nothing, too, with the allies of that Party who have lumped themselves together under the nominal leadership in this House of Deputy Blowick.  That is, I suggest, the reason why this Bill has been opposed in the insincere and, in some cases, grossly ill-informed speeches which have been delivered against it.</P>
      <P>Take Deputy Cosgrave's speech as an example.  The Deputy is undoubtedly a young man of promise who, in the short time he has been in this House, has made his mark.  Before, however, he ascended to the questionable elevation of the Opposition Front Bench, he committed himself to a statement&mdash;a wise statement, a far-seeing statement, one which I cordially approved of at the time.  It is given in Volume 91, Column 1510 of the Official Debates. The statement was made in the debate upon the Estimate for the Department of Local Government and Public Health on the 3rd November, 1943. Deputy Cosgrave said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I suggest to the Minister that he should consider the separation of Local Government and Public Health and have two separate Departments. I do not know if, in doing that, I am advocating legislation, but in view of the necessity for increasing attention to the requirements of public health, I think it would be advisable to have two separate Departments.  I would not like the Minister to consider just separating himself and his Parliamentary Secretary.  I think it would be advisable to get a new Minister for either one or the other of the proposed new Departments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, in expressing that view, Deputy Cosgrave was almost inspired, because for some time previously the question as to whether there should be or should not be a separate Department of Health had been engaging the consideration and attention of the Government. It was a good thing for the Minister, who was urging upon his colleagues the need to set up this separate Department, that he should be fortified and supported by a Deputy who normally might be found in opposition to such a proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But that was Deputy Cosgrave in November of 1943.  Deputy Cosgrave <Col N="1414" /> in November of 1946 is a changed man. He has made the transition from one of the back benches to the Front Bench and, in doing so, would appear to have undergone that process of metamorphosis to which Dean Swift alleged the Irish bishops used to be subject when they were crossing Hounslow Heath. If you remember, the saintly men, the good men, the Dean alleged, were held up by highwaymen and their outer garments appropriated by ruffians who descended upon this country in the guise of bishops.  That would seem to be the position with Deputy Cosgrave. I am sure that, when the Deputy advocated the establishment of the Department of Health and the constitution of a separate Ministry in 1943, he was speaking with all the sincerity of youth. When he opposes that proposal in 1946, I must assume that he has been contaminated with the insincerity which informs every public declaration of the Fine Gael Party in regard to any measure which may be put before this House by the Government for the improvement of the conditions of the people.</P>

      <P>There is another member of the Opposition Front Bench who distinguished himself in this debate in the customary way peculiar to that Deputy.  Deputy Hughes is a member of the shadow Cabinet.  His utterances in this House in that capacity remind me how truthfully he spoke who said: &ldquo;Shadows we are and shadows we pursue.&rdquo;  He is ambitious to be a member of the Government of this country.  Yet, in his speech, he showed himself to be grossly ignorant of the constitutional position of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, respectively.  Last night, Deputy Hughes said that Parliamentary Secretaries were responsible to this House in respect of their administration.  It is upon that unfounded assumption that, apparently, some part of the opposition to this Bill in so far as that opposition may be sincere, is based. Therefore, I want to show how erroneous is the argument which would ask this House to reject this Bill on <Col N="1415" /> the ground that matters relating to health and social welfare could be handled as well in the House and in the Government by Parliamentary Secretaries as they could by Ministers. Deputy Hughes said last night that Parliamentary Secretaries were responsible to this House for their administration. That statement is without foundation either in law or in fact. While he was making it I endeavoured to prevent Deputy Hughes from committing himself to this untenable and foolish proposition.  I regret to say that my charity and goodwill and concern for the Deputy's public reputation were completely misplaced.  In quite the most boorish way, the Deputy brushed aside my kindly intervention and, by reiteration of the statement that Parliamentary Secretaries are responsible to Parliament, continued to make a fool of himself.  If Deputy Hughes were the only member of the Opposition to display ignorance in this matter, I should not waste my time or the time of the House with the matter, for the Deputy, as the House knows from experience, is, by capacity and temperament, incapable of learning. But Deputy Hughes was not the only member who showed by his speeches on this Bill that, though now, at least, two and a half years in this House, he has not yet taken the trouble to inform himself in regard to certain elementary principles which regulate the whole government and administration of the country and the procedure in this House.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of those members who are anxious to know the truth in regard to this question and in the hope, particularly, that Deputy Cogan and other members of his Party may grasp, at least, the essential relationship between a member of the Government, a Parliamentary Secretary and Dáil Éireann, I propose to set out the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three documents which govern that relationship.  There is the fundamental law of the State&mdash;the Constitution.  I know that certain members of this House have little regard for the Constitution.  I know that the Constitution under which we live to-day was carried in spite of <Col N="1416" /> them.  I have some reason to believe that that applies, particularly, to many members of Clann na Talmhan.  But, whether with their goodwill or against their active opposition, the Constitution was enacted by the people, is the fundamental law of this State and governs, in the first instance, the relationship of the Executive to this House.  Section 4 (4)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For the benefit of those members who have just entered the House, I may say that I was dealing with the assertion made by a member of the Opposition Front Bench that Parliamentary Secretaries are responsible to Parliament and that, therefore, the business of the proposed Departments of Health and Social Welfare could be carried on by Parliamentary Secretaries with no disadvantage and with the practical advantage, from the point of view of economy, that the person entrusted with that administration would be paid the salary of a Parliamentary Secretary instead of the salary of a Minister. Linked up with that suggestion by Deputy Hughes was the other one which he also made&mdash;that one of the reasons why we were creating this Department of State was the self-aggrandisement of the Ministry.  I do not think it is worth while to deal with that argument.  It is worthy of Deputy Hughes.  I mention it so that the House may be aware that that is one of the reasons why that Deputy opposes the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying that the relations of the Government to Parliament are determined by Article 28 of the Constitution and I was going to point out that Section 4, sub-section (1) of that Article declares that the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann.  A Parliamentary Secretary is not a member of the Government.  The Government consists of those members who are nominated by the Taoiseach to be heads of Departments of State.  Therefore, since the Constitution prescribes <Col N="1417" /> that only members of the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann and that only the Government collectively shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann, it would be quite inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution to make a Parliamentary Secretary responsible to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The special position of Parliamentary Secretary is dealt with in two Acts, one of which is the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924.  The power to appoint a Parliamentary Secretary was first conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 7 of that Act which provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Executive Council may from time to time, on the nomination of the President of the Council, appoint so many persons, being members of the Oireachtas and not exceeding seven in number, as the Executive Council shall consider necessary, to be Parliamentary Secretaries to the Executive Council or to Executive Ministers, and may at any time remove any Parliamentary Secretary so appointed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A Parliamentary Secretary is appointed by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A Parliamentary Secretary is appointed by the Government and, in so far as he is not responsible directly to his Minister, he is responsible to the Government but he is not responsible to Dáil Éireann, neither under the Constitution nor under this Act.  Section 7 of the Act of 1924 states further in sub-section (7):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Each of the Parliamentary Secretaries appointed under this section shall by his appointment be assigned to act as Parliamentary Secretary to the Executive Council or to a Minister and shall have such powers and perform such duties as the Executive Council or such Minister with the consent of the Executive Council may from time to time delegate or assign to him.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Parliamentary Secretary carries out duties which are not assigned to him by Dáil Éireann, not assigned to him in any statute, but assigned to him either by the Government or by his <Col N="1418" /> Minister.  Therefore, once again let me say that, under the Act of 1924, despite the ignorant assertions of Deputy Hughes on Wednesday night, a Parliamentary Secretary is not responsible to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The matter is carried further, however, in the Act of 1939 where any doubt or ambiguity which may have resided in the provisions of the earlier Act is completely removed because Section 9 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939, provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Government, by Order made on the request of a Minister having charge of a Department of State, to delegate to the Parliamentary Secretary to such Minister all the powers and duties of such Minister under any particular Act, or any particular statutory power or statutory duty of such Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of that section goes on to provide in paragraph (d):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every statutory power and duty delegated by such delegation shall be exercisable and performed by such Parliamentary Secretary in his own name but subject to the general superintendence and control of the Minister on whose request it was made and subject to any condition or restriction stated in such delegation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was pointing out that paragraph (d) provides that the exercise of a statutory power by a Parliamentary Secretary under a delegation order shall be subject to the general superintendence and control of the Minister on whose request it was made.  Paragraph (e) of the same sub-section goes on to provide:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every statutory power or duty delegated by such delegation shall, notwithstanding such delegation, continue to be vested in the Minister on whose request such delegation was made but shall be so vested concurrently with such Parliamentary Secretary and so as to be capable of being exercised or performed by either such Minister or such Parliamentary Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Finally&mdash;and this is the conclusive argument against the assertion of Deputy Hughes&mdash;paragraph (f) of the same sub-section declares:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Such delegation shall not remove or derogate from the responsibility of the Minister, on whose request it was made, to Dáil Éireann or as a member of the Government for the exercise or performance of the statutory powers and duties thereby delegated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well that we should have that point cleared up.  I hope that those who, as leaders of the various Parties, purport to guide, direct and advise their followers in this House will in future be under no misapprehension whatever as to who is and who is not responsible to this Parliament or responsible for any legislation which may be submitted to it.  These two great Departments of State which it is proposed to set up cannot, in view of the developments which are now visualised, be administered by Parliamentary Secretaries, whether they act <Col N="1420" /> under a delegated order or not, and that is the conclusion to which the Government has been driven after the most searching investigation into the problems confronting us and into the measures which should be taken to deal with these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera, in the very thoughtful speech which he delivered on this measure, went to the kernel of the matter when he said that this Bill is an administrative Bill, a Bill which seeks to provide for the better administration of certain public services and their further development upon lines which will be acceptable to the people and which are dictated by our people's necessities.  Deputy Hughes argued that this Bill was going to create a top-heavy structure.  He stated, and stated truly, that we cannot take out of the pool of production more than is put into it.  This Bill does not propose to take anything more out of the pool of production.  Whether anything more will be taken out of the pool of production or not will depend upon the policies which are formulated by the new Ministers.  But it is quite possible that, in some respects, something more may be left in the pool of production, and yet, at the same time, those who have been beneficiaries under the several Acts now administered by separate Ministers may derive greater benefits and advantages than they have enjoyed heretofore.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, the Ministry of Social Welfare.  At the present moment, measures which may broadly be termed social services, measures which come within the broad category of social services but are concerned with one kind of social service, the provision of relief in cash or in kind for those who, by the vicissitudes of life, are unable and, in some cases, even unwilling, to maintain themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are now under <Col N="1421" /> the control and administration of three separate Departments of State. The amount of money which is taken out of the pool of production, with which Deputy Hughes is so rightly concerned, for these services, is over £12,000,000 per annum.  The number of separate individuals who benefit under these income maintenance services or relief services is certainly not less than 600,000, and may be almost 700,000.  It would be right to say, however, in that connection that no fewer than 340,000 of these individuals are children, in respect of whom children's allowances are paid.  Now, whatever we might hear about extravagance, whatever we may hear about too much being taken out of the pool of production, there is one expenditure at any rate in regard to which Fine Gael, Deputy Dillon or Clann na Talmhan cannot disown responsibility, that is, children's allowances.  I am glad that this Administration was able to put that social measure through, but let us hear no more about extravagant expenditure upon social services when children's allowances is one of the largest of them.  Let us hear no more about pauperising the people and let Deputy Commons be as silent as Deputy Cogan is now, because I did not hear either of these Deputies or any other member of the House oppose the expenditure which it was proposed to undertake in order to provide children's allowances, under which, as I have said, 340,000 children and their parents in this State benefit.</P>

Old age pensions account for an expenditure of almost £4,000,000 directly and immediately as old age pensions.  They account for a much greater expenditure than that, because there are supplementary allowances given under other Votes in cash and in kind for the relief and for the benefit of old age pensioners, and the number of persons who are in receipt of old age pensions is 140,000.</P>

      <P>Deputy Commons said he objected to the establishment of this Department&mdash;and I must say that, though I criticise the speech of Deputy Commons, I sometimes admire his speeches because he speaks clearly and lucidly, and has a point of view to put which sometimes appeals to me, although not in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Commons said that he objected to the establishment of a Department of Social Welfare because he saw that, as this State was heading, the inevitable outcome of it would be to provide all our people with spoons to eat out of the pauper's bowl.  Yet, the Deputy who opposes the establishment of that Department upon these grounds is the Deputy who wishes to <Col N="1423" /> give not merely those who are in need but everybody in this State, whether they are as rich as Croesus or as poor as church mice, 10/- a week of an old age pension, on the ground he argues that there would be a considerable saving in the administration if we did so.  Deputy Commons' remedy for our social ills is that everybody should be fed with his own tail, in the belief that, when that has been accomplished, there will be a considerable saving in administration.</P>
    <P>At present, over 75 per cent. of all persons over 70 years have pensions.  If the Deputy's suggestion were taken, there would be added about £1,200,000 to the pensions bill and the whole cost of administering the old age pension service is £145,000.  But we would not save the whole of that.  If we adopted Deputy Commons' suggestion, perhaps we would save some part of it, a comparatively small part of it, as the officers who, in the first instance, investigate means for the purposes of the administration of the Old Age Pensions Acts also carry out investigations on behalf of other Ministers who are responsible for the administration of other social services.  Therefore, we might diminish the number of investigation officers by adopting Deputy Commons' suggestion, but we would not abolish that service altogether.</P>
    <P>There are two services&mdash;children's allowances and old age pensions&mdash; which account for practically one-half of our total expenditure upon social services.  Deputy Hughes says that our social service structure is top-heavy and he accuses the Government of drawing out of the pool of production for these services more than we can afford.  I challenge Deputy Hughes, or Deputy Blowick, who talked about the army of officials who are administering these services, to put down a motion on the Order Paper of this House providing for the abolition of the old age pension service and providing for the abolition of children's allowances.  If they do, and if, by any mischance, that motion were to be accepted by the House, they would save the Exchequer £6,000,000, but I think they would lose their political life in securing that economy.  Let <Col N="1424" /> Deputy Blowick be honest with himself and with his own people, let Deputy Hughes be honest, if he can, with himself and with his own people.  Let us face up to this fact: that so far from the Government being extravagant in regard to the administration and the provision of these social services, the Government, which has to have regard to the position of the taxpayer and to the size of the pool of production, is the only element in this State which exists to prevent unjustifiable expenditure of public moneys for the benefit of individuals.  Every other Party in the State, in the hope of buying a little political support, puts down extravagant demands for the extension of the social services in the hope that the Government will save the community from the consequences of their demands.</P>
    <P>Surely, if we have, as I pointed out, a considerable number of services costing in the aggregate over £12,000,000, benefiting not less than 600,000 individuals, and administered by three separate Departments of State, it would tend to economic administration, to efficient administration, and, from the point of view of the beneficiaries, to more advantageous administration to put all these under the control of one Minister.  He would examine the anomalies which undoubtedly exist between them, and would co-ordinate these services and the activities of the officers administering them, with the result that we should have services the administration of which might not cost a great deal less because, as I have shown, the implementation of these services is in many cases carried out by officers of one Minister as agents for another Minister.  It would not, as I have said, considerably reduce the number of persons involved in their administration, but would make for easier and smoother, and, from the point of view of those for whom these services are intended, more expeditious and, therefore, more advantageous administration.</P>
    <P>That is one of the proposals contained in this Bill.  That is why, after long examination, the Government have been persuaded that the logic of events, the pressure of existing circumstances, <Col N="1425" /> compel them to set up a Ministry of Social Welfare.  There is nothing top-heavy about that.  On the contrary, it is a rearrangement of a considerable number of services, costing, if you like, a vast sum, in a rational and logical way, which ought to react ultimately in economies and in a more efficient service.  Yet, Deputy Hughes is going to oppose that and Deputy Blowick is going to oppose that&mdash;Deputy Hughes because we are going to have a top-heavy structure, Deputy Blowick because, although he as the Leader of a Party might be assumed to have some knowledge of the manner in which the services of this State are administered, he contends, it is going to lead to the recruitment of between 6,000 and 7,000 additional officers.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement on this Bill I was concerned to point out that many of the existing services are already administered, even though they are under different Ministers, by the same corps of officers.  The officers administering old age pensions are there in the service already.  The officers administering unemployment assistance are there in the service already.  So are those who are administering unemployment insurance, those who are charged with the administration of widows' and orphans' pensions, those who are responsible for the supervision and control of national health insurance. They are all there.  So are the Post Office staffs who pay the benefits to the individual recipients.  So are the headquarters staffs.  What it is proposed to do is to bring all these bodies of officials, all these separate corps, under the control of one individual who will carry undivided responsibility, sharing, of course, in the collective responsibility, to this House, for the administration of these services. There will not be one additional officer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But that sort of argument and that sort of assertion is not worthy of this House where the statements should be made as by informed men to informed men and where we should not rate our colleagues so low as to think we <Col N="1427" /> will get away with fictions such as I have referred to.  I was saying, however, that the officers administering old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, medical services and all the other services, as they exist to-day, are already in the service of the State.  All that it is proposed to do is to bring these several bodies of officers together and to put them under one control. There will be no recruitment of additional officers.

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Conditions of Sub-Postmasters and Sub-Postmistresses&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that legislation should be introduced immediately which will improve the pay and prospects of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses and which will entitle them to pension rights on the same basis as other State servants; and, furthermore, is also of opinion that all auxiliary postmen should be put on the established list so as to ensure for them not only reasonable remuneration, but also decent pensions after long and strenuous service to the community. &mdash;(Deputies Halliden and Blowick.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, as far as the promise given by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to improve the salary scale and conditions of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses throughout the country is concerned, I want to say that a similar promise was made here in this House some two years ago.  At that time he told us that he was going to give special consideration to increases in salary and improved conditions and would, at the same time, look into the question of their unestablishment.  In the interval nothing has been done.  I am one Deputy who is not satisfied with the Minister's promise on this occasion, because I know from experience that he has broken it in the past.  The one section of the community which is perhaps the most pauperised to-day is that section which consists of sub-postmasters, sub-postmistresses and auxiliary postmen.  It is a disgrace that we should have 2,000 of them in receipt of less than £1 per week.  The situation is utterly fantastic when one considers the manner in which the Minister's Department is run, on the one hand, and, on the other, the niggardly scales of pay made to these people.  The average wage of these officials is £1 12s. 0d. per week and these officials have neither annual leave nor pension rights.  In the case of the unestablished postman, he may travel anything from 40 to 50 miles a day; he has no annual leave; he has no pension rights, and he can be dismissed on one week's notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out in this House on a previous occasion that the principal cause for the bulk of dismissals in the post office was embezzlement on the part of the officials.  The reason for that embezzlement is because these people are so badly paid they cannot resist the temptation to help themselves to public funds.  They then find themselves in the grip of the law and are dismissed.  The root cause of our <Col N="1431" /> financial difficulties is due to the Minister's failure to pay them a proper salary.  If those officials were in receipt of rates of remuneration which would permit them to live independently and decently and to uphold the dignity of their offices and the position entrusted to them there would not be this high percentage of dismissals for embezzlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is two years since I headed a deputation from the postmasters and postmistresses to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  On that occasion I got every encouragement from the Minister and from the officials.  The emergency was then on and it was not possible for the Minister to do anything to improve the position at the time, but he fully appreciated the low emoluments of which these officials were in receipt and he promised to do something for them as soon as he possibly could.  I am glad to see that he has taken steps now to do so.  He has given them conditions which are a vast improvement on their conditions hitherto.  One must always, however, remember&mdash;and I am sure Clann na Talmhan will remember&mdash;that taxation hits the farmers very heavily and the general cry of the farmers to-day is for a cheaper and more efficient administration. The Post Office is a very old system.  None of these sub-postmasters or sub-postmistresses is actually dependent on the salary or allowances made by the Minister.  Every one of them has some other means of livelihood. I think the proof of that must be that when a post office falls vacant there are several applicants for it. That would hardly be the case if the emoluments were not attractive.  Every <Col N="1432" /> Deputy in the House knows that when a post office becomes vacant, there are a considerable number of applications for it.  There must be a definite attraction there.</P>
      <P>I am sorry nothing can be done for the rural postmen.  So far as I understand, they are paid on the basis of the wages operating in the district in which they reside.  The work is done by private contract system.  I know that some of them are in receipt of very low salaries but the hours of work are sometimes very short and they are free to take up work elsewhere.  They are not in the same category as sub-postmasters.</P>
      <P>I do want to thank the Minister now on behalf of the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses for the way in which he received them on the occasion of the deputation to which I have already referred, and I want to thank him for having done something to improve the position generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the motion moved by Deputy Blowick.  There is, however, one suggestion which I resent very much and that is that the salary scales paid to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have subjected them to the temptation of embezzlement.  I resent very strongly any mention of the word embezzlement in connection with sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  If there is one section of the community which gives ample proof of innate honesty, it is the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that there are some 2,400 of them altogether and I think the figure given us by the Minister over a period of three years was something like 30 or 40 dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that only one in a hundred is ever charged with embezzlement.  It is most unfair to use the term embezzlement so haphazardly in connection with sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses either in this House or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker said that there was <Col N="1433" /> some attraction in the job of sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress and he endeavoured to prove his point by calling attention to the number of applicants for vacancies.  In this unfortunate country if there is a job of any kind at £8 or £10 a year there will be 40 or 50 applicants looking for it in the hope that from a small beginning it will grow into something worth while as the years go by.  That is probably the reason why sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses take up these jobs at £30 a year in the hope that they will not always remain at that level.  They have had very little help from any previous Minister.  I know the present Minister is sympathetic and has offered to give some help.  I am sure that if he were able to give the maximum help he would do so.  He said the sum available this year was somewhere in the region of £20,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  It is in the region of £70,000.  £20,000 is a separate sum for additional postal deliveries.  The total amount will be £90,000 I hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>£70,000 will be somewhere in the region of about 17/- per head at a rough calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It will represent about a 30 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is to give something like 13/- or 14/- a week. It is not a tremendous increase, but if that much comes it will be something. I suggest the bulk of that sum should be devoted to the 600 unfortunate people who are living on salaries under £1 a week&mdash;some of them considerably under £1.  Those people live mostly in the rural areas; there are very few in the cities or urban areas.  The underpaid sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are mostly in the rural areas and it is for these unfortunate people that I make a very strong appeal.  The bulk of the increases should be given to the lower paid people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the auxiliary postmen, I think something should be done, too. Some of them have light work, but a good many of them have very heavy work, and their job amounts almost to a whole-time job.  I think they are <Col N="1434" /> deserving of some consideration and I suggest that their case should receive the Minister's serious attention.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on one observation he made.  When he was comparing the work of postmen to that of agricultural workers he paid a tribute to the agricultural workers.  It was the first tribute ever paid to them by a Minister in this House.  He referred to the agricultural workers as being highly skilled, competent men. They have always been referred to in Government Orders and elsewhere as unskilled workmen and they were classified on the lowest scale.  I am glad to see that this Minister classifies agricultural workers as very highly skilled, technically qualified men, which they are.</P>
    <P>I rose mainly to express my sympathy with the motion and I trust that whatever relief the Minister will give, it will be something substantial.  An average increase of 13/- to 14/- a week would not be a very great increase and would not very materially alter the circumstances of those people, but at least it will be something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. The Minister has not said a single word about the position of auxiliary postmen. The line he took was that they were quite well paid.  He made a comparison <Col N="1436" /> between the amount paid to auxiliary postmen and what is paid to agricultural workers.  There is no comparison whatever.  We have always contended that agricultural workers are not paid as they ought to be.  We have pressed to Government again and again to do something to enable the agricultural workers to be paid a proper wage, but the Minister and his colleagues have not responded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>That is entirely a question for the farmers themselves, for the Deputy's Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is entirely a matter for the farmers&mdash;that is, provided it is put in their power to pay the agricultural workers.  Most agricultural workers know that, even meagre as their wages are, the farmers are not in a position to pay more.  I will not go any further than that.  Time and time again we have advocated an improvement by the Government, but our pleading has fallen on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran said he could not believe his eyes when he saw the names of Deputy Halliden and myself attached to this motion.  He then says that at one time we deplore squandermania and at another time we advocate it. I want to tell him very plainly and clearly that we will deplore squandermania always, as we have done in the past.  His attitude is that we should save at the expense of the poor, the lowest paid class in the country.  That is not our policy nor is it what we stand for.  We have advocated again and again that such classes of people as widows and orphans, old age pensioners and those in receipt of salaries but who are underpaid, should have their position improved.  If there is a saving to be made, surely it is not on the poor we should save?  That is exactly what Deputy Moran is advocating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even this very day in the House, we had a defence put up by the Minister for Local Government to the further expenditure, and a whole happy list of the wonderful improvements to follow from the two new Departments.  If Deputy Moran were in the House.  I have no doubt he would have trooped into the Division Lobby to vote for that expenditure.  There are many other <Col N="1437" /> motions we have tabled since we came into the House for cutting down expenditure, beginning at the top, so that there may be a more equal distribution of taxation and of the public money. They have been vetoed every single time by Deputy Moran's Party.  We want to raise the level of the lower classes and the Government would be well advised to go into that, instead of establishing new Departments, which, despite the assurance of the Minister for Local Government, I believe will cause expansion in expenditure.  I do not believe that they will not be costly but I would vote for them if I had the faintest hope it would mean giving improved social conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Butler says the motion is not an honest one.  He did not explain why or how or in what it was dishonest.  I do not pay much attention to his vapourings here from time to time&mdash;it is seldom he speaks.  Short as I have been in the House, I have witnessed the duplicity of that particular Deputy on several occasions, speaking on behalf of the organisation of which he is a member, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, with his lips in the House and then deliberately voting against their interests when called upon to do so.</P>

      <P>When I stood up to speak, I noticed that Deputy Butler was in his seat, but he has now vanished.  I would like to say a few more things to him, if he had the courage to remain, but I do not like speaking behind a man's back.  I will not pay <Col N="1438" /> further attention to this charge of dishonesty. He had an ample chance during the past five or six years to give effect to the fears he expressed for his constituents here in the city, but he did not do so.  He is at the age-old game of trying to drive a wedge between the rural population and the urban population, but he will not succeed.  He had many chances; he and his Party came to the country, and were very glad to do so, to ask the people to take them out of the mess, when there was a stoppage of fuel and food, at the beginning of the emergency.  He now seeks to throw dirty water on the rural community, in spite of what they have done.  Not once during the emergency, either before I came into this House or since, did I hear Deputy Butler raise his voice on the question of the wet turf being purveyed through the city, which left the country at £1 a ton but is costing 73/9.</P>

      <P>The rural postmen should get further consideration.  The Minister says that, in the majority of cases, they have land or some other means of livelihood as well.  That is perfectly true.  The case I put up was that the auxiliary postman has to travel a long distance, about 20 miles a day, and it is not ten miles straight journey there and ten miles back, but jumping on and off a bicycle.  It is done in all kinds of weather.  In the summer time, they are subject to the heat and in winter time to the rain, storm and snow.  On that point, from my own observation, I think they are not equipped with waterproofs for inclement weather, as they should be.  I admit that there was a shortage of materials during the emergency and I will not go further than asking the Minister, now that the emergency is over and that waterproof material to make these capes should be more plentiful, to provide capes for the men.  That applies also to the bags or satchels in which they carry the mails.  I know there have been difficulties over which the Minister had no control, but I trust he will look into the matter and see they are fitted out properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> The rural postmen have to deliver from house to house, they have to travel in mountainous districts and they return at 3 o'clock in the afternoon after having been out since 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning.  I cannot see how they could turn in and do a day's work after that tiresome round, in which they cover every single house.  I ask any Deputy who says they can work after all that, to consider if he would employ such a person after having done such work.  He would not, as it would not be fair.  That is the question shortly and simply.  They are entitled to some pension and there should not be a line of distinction drawn between the rural postman and others.</P>
    <P>In regard to the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, I would ask the Minister at least to promise to investigate the position and give some allowance to them.  It has been said that they have businesses also, but they cannot pay much attention to the business, unless they employ a help to take charge&mdash;and that would absorb more than their salary from the Post Office.</P>
    <P>The very inefficient telephone service we have at the present time&mdash;and again I am not blaming the Minister, as I am fairly certain that, but for the emergency we would have a better telephone service&mdash;increases the difficulties <Col N="1440" /> of the ordinary rural sub-postmaster or postmistress.  You go in for a call and have to wait in a country post office for maybe two hours, as in the case of a call from my district to Dublin.  The postmaster cannot leave you and has to stand there and that causes great hardship.  I am not grumbling about the delay, as I have been assured by the Minister and his officials that that will be remedied.  I put the case for an additional allowance for these officials.  There should be a review of the situation of the auxiliary postmen and these postmasters, so that, no matter how small the pension may be, they will get something.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be set up with power to send for persons, papers and records to inquire into and report on the work of the Land Commission in regard to the following matters:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) The method of selection of allottees;</P>
      <P>(2) The standard of living attained by those to whom allotments have been granted;</P>
      <P>(3) The size and nature of the minimum holding which, as a result of experience, can be regarded as economic, and</P>
      <P>(4) The extent to which allottees have failed to make good and the reasons for such failure.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the House that this motion was tabled following a statement by the Minister on the Second Stage of the Land Bill early this year. As reported in column 294, Vol. 99 of the Debates for the 31st January last the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>It was not until the year 1938 that the Land Commission found it possible to have special inspections made to ascertain how allottees were using their parcels&mdash;and then the investigation was only partial and occasional.</P>
      <P>Up to the year 1944, over 4,200 allotted parcels had been inspected for usership and it was found that some 200 were badly worked and some 700 sublet in whole or in part&mdash; that is to say, in 21½ per cent. of the parcels investigated the allottees were not then properly fulfilling their obligations.  It was also found that some 820 houses built by the Land Commission for allottees were either unoccupied or sublet to other persons. Subsequent investigation, however, showed that the warning letters issued by the Land Commission had a salutary effect in a large number of cases and a great improvement was effected.</P>
      <P>In the year 1944 it was decided to set up a special section of the Land Commission staff to deal with investigation for usership, and since then inspection has proceeded in a most systematic way.  Including some re-inspections in cases already brought to notice by previous investigation, nearly 4,000 holdings and parcels have been inspected for usership during the past year, and of these some 700 were found unsatisfactory&mdash; 17½ per cent.  Sixty-nine of some 1,250 houses on holdings covered by this inspection were found to be unoccupied. Outside this systematic inspection, some 400 additional cases of non-residence and 450 cases of unsatisfactory user have been brought to notice individually, making a total of 1,150 unsatisfactory user and 470 non-residence cases disclosed so far.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputy Coogan and myself felt at the time that that was an indictment of the work of the Minister's Department and definitely called into ques- <Col N="1443" /> tion the whole policy in operation here regarding land settlement.  It will be appreciated that the Land Commission was brought into existence for a specific purpose &mdash; the purpose of land settlement, to take over land under the various Acts from the landlords, to have that land re-vested in the tenant farmers, and to tackle, on the other hand, the problem of congestion, work which, prior to the creation of the Land Commission, was operated in the west of Ireland by the Congested Districts Board.  They were further charged with the responsibility of dealing with the large number of uneconomic holdings we have in the country, in so far as it was possible to deal with them, having regard to the limited amount of land available for the purpose.  The problem has been ameliorated to a considerable extent but the policy has been in operation for a long period now.  So far as the national Government is concerned, it has been in operation for a period of 25 years.  I submit that, in view of the condition of things clearly set out in the Minister's statement, I am entitled to ask, and the House is entitled to press for, a full investigation as to whether the present policy is serving the national interest.</P>
    <P>It must be appreciated that the disposition and the utilisation of the land of the country are of fundamental importance to the whole economic structure of the State.  The disposition of land, the size of holdings, the possibility of the tenant being placed in the best position to utilise his land to the best advantage, not merely in his own interest but in the national interest, are matters with which we in this House should be deeply concerned.  I have no doubt the Minister has given very full consideration to this whole question since he was charged with the administration of this important Department, but I say that the attitude of economists the world over, the experience of the world during the war years, and the condition of the world so far as the provision of food for the people is concerned, bring more clearly to our minds the necessity and the vital importance of ensuring that the land of this country is utilised to the best <Col N="1444" /> advantage in the national interest, that it is disposed, tenanted and held by the technicians, if you like to apply that term to the farming community, who use it in the national interest and that they are placed to the best advantage, taking all the circumstances into account.  If we are pursuing a policy at present which is not giving the desired results, I suggest that we should correct it, that an examination is necessary, and even if an adjustment in our policy is not necessary as a result of that investigation, we will have got some good result because we will be able to satisfy ourselves that the land settlement policy we are pursuing is the best policy within the very limited sphere of the Department's activities.</P>
    <P>On this matter of land, I want to direct the Minister's attention to the national farm survey the British Government have made.  They have carried out a complete survey of all the agricultural land of Great Britain and Wales and have compiled an enormous amount of very valuable information. It would be very wise if we carried out the same type of survey here, but that is not the responsibility of the Minister for Lands, although it might be difficult to say definitely how far the Minister's responsibility goes and where one would draw the line as between his responsibility and that of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The sort of detail they have got from that survey in Great Britain is classified under various headings, such as holdings and occupiers, farms and farmers, tenure, rent, length of occupation, layout and situation of holding, condition of farm houses and farm buildings, number and condition of farm cottages, type and natural fertility of soil, managerial efficiency of occupiers, condition of cultivated land and use of manures, area of derelict land, water supply, electricity, etc.  The British Government felt it was essential to have information of that sort regarding agricultural holdings, and I am merely stressing here that this House is entitled to ask, after 25 years, that we should have a very full investigation into the whole work of the Department, that we cannot pass over the conditions the Minister has <Col N="1445" /> referred to and the problems he has brought before the House regarding bad husbandry, conacring and subletting, failure to occupy holdings and so on, as well as the very high percentages of 21 and 17½ to which he referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably tell us that he is carrying out an investigation at present, but I am not satisfied with that investigation.  He told us, as a matter of fact, in his speech on the Land Bill, that investigations were being pursued, that, up to 1938, the Land Commission was very busy and had not had the time or the opportunity to pursue independent and systematic investigations, and I have no doubt that, since that time, certain limited investigations have taken place. No doubt, the Minister will tell us that these investigations are continuing and that the warnings issued by his Department have had a salutary effect and have resulted in some improvement.  I feel that that is not sufficient because it appears to me that a man can scarcely investigate his own work in a detached way and satisfy himself that his own work has been very well done, and we cannot rely on the Department carrying out an investigation and satisfying itself that the work has been very well done.</P>
    <P>I feel that, after 25 years of the operation of a policy of land division, the whole method of selection of allottees, the results obtained so far as a standard of living of the allottees is concerned, the size and nature of the minimum holding which might be regarded as an economic holding, the extent to which allottees have failed to make good &mdash; and we have some information from the Minister on that &mdash; and the reasons why they have failed to make good, should be examined.  I do not think the Land Commission are the right people to make that examination.  I submit that an impartial tribunal should be set up before which the public would have the right to express their views and give information, and before which officials of the Land Commission, inspectors, commissioners and so on, would be called to give evidence.</P>
    <P>It is most essential that we should carry out this work because, in the <Col N="1446" /> last analysis, we all live out of the land.  Almost 100 per cent. of the national income comes, either directly or indirectly, from the land, so that it is of fundamental importance to our whole economy that the land should be utilised to the best advantage and that, if we have been making any mistakes, they be corrected and adjusted in the light of the experience of 25 years.  We have reached the end of a period.  During the emergency, Land Commission activities in the matter of the acquisition and division of land were slowed up, but the Minister probably contemplates new activities in the near future.</P>
    <P>I submit that this motion is most opportune because we are entering on a new period, and, before we enter on that new period and continue the policy in operation for 25 years, we should examine our consciences and have a full and impartial investigation of the Department's work.  Very considerable amounts of State finances have been expended on this work and we want to find out what results have accrued to the nation from that expenditure.  We have to find out whether we are, in fact, creating agricultural slums because the unit which the Land Commission feel is an economic unit has not given an opportunity to the individual to work out a decent standard of living for himself and his family.</P>
    <P>We had a long discussion on this matter on the Land Bill last year and most of us expressed the view that we had no use for the people who failed, that those allottees who were not doing their job, who failed to fulfil the conditions of their contracts, would have to go.  I put it to the Minister that we must be just above all.  It is quite possible that we gave a job of work to individual allottees that could not be carried out successfully because of the conditions, because their activities were limited by the small holding which was considered economic by a man sitting in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>It is all right to be an armchair economist or agriculturist; it is quite a different job to put theory into practice. I have more respect for the practical man who has gone through <Col N="1447" /> the hard school of experience; who has demonstated his capacity to live on a very small holding.  I have great respect for people who are able to do that.  The majority of Deputies, because of their rural outlook, have great admiration for the man who is able to raise a large family on a small holding and to make ends meet.  He is limited in every direction.  He has to be extremely cautious.  He has to be an excellent financier, in my opinion, and a keener judge than the man with a bigger holding who, if he makes mistakes, can afford to make them.  The man with the very limited holding and with family commitments cannot afford to make any mistake.  If he makes a mistake, the reactions and the repercussions last for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>From a social and economic point of view, I hope the Minister will accept this motion as being moved in a spirit of co-operation and anxiety to help, so far as we can in this House, the activities of the Department over which he presides.  I do not want to be critical. I do not want to point to the failures of the Department in the selection of allottees, because it is inevitable in a work of that kind that there will be a certain number of failures.  But is it not reasonable to say that the percentage of failures is too high?  I think the Minister will agree with me that that high percentage of failures calls for inquiry.  From the fact that an inquiry has been going on inside the Department it is obvious that the Minister and the Department felt that investigation was necessary.  But, on the bigger aspect of this whole matter, outside the mere question of individual success or failure, we suggest that the time is opportune for a tribunal to investigate this whole question of land policy from the point of view of doing good to the individuals concerned and to the community as a whole and seeing whether it is necessary to have an adjustment or alteration in the regulations and policy that dictate and control the activities and the machinery of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour it any more than that.  The terms of the resolution speak for themselves.  The Minister is a reasonable man and, from what I <Col N="1448" /> have heard from him, he has a modern outlook on this matter.  He is possibly more realistic than some other man might be in the same office. Therefore, I feel that it is possible that we may succeed in impressing on the Minister the importance of this matter to the whole economy of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The land in this country and in almost all countries is a very involved sort of business.  Generally, people on the land have a decided objection to either inquiries or inspectors.  During the period of the war, and even before that, I think there was too much inspection carried out.  Very often you found that hardworking farmers had a very decided objection to so many of these inspectors coming about their place.  You had the Department of Agriculture inspectors, the compulsory tillage inspectors and the Land Commission inspectors going around.  After all these inspections and the reports which were made, I do not see why we should want to know any more or go any further.</P>
      <P>This motion asks that a tribunal be set up.  For what purpose?  What information will we get?  During my life I have had experience of small farms, big farms and all sorts of farms. One sees farms that were a complete failure when the father was in control being worked successfully by the son. Land is a peculiar commodity and its successful operation depends to a large extent on the man in control and to some extent on the particular period. We have gone through a six-year period of war and there has been a complete change in land economy.  Generally speaking, I think the people on the land succeeded under the greatest difficulties in maintaining and supporting the population of this country &mdash; a low population, no doubt, but nobody was hungry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice occasional farms that are so badly laid out as to be useless.  The house is put in the wrong place and the construction of the whole farm is uneconomic.  I would agree that there might be an inquiry into that matter <Col N="1449" /> so that that would not be allowed to occur.  Very often, inspectors and those in charge do not appreciate the necessity of having a small farm conveniently laid out.  But, as far as the other things are concerned, we ought to have ample information already.  Any amount of money was spent in sending inspectors to these farms.  If we tell the tenants that we are going to set up a court of inquiry, it is my opinion that they will be inclined to get out.  We should leave them alone and give them a chance.  It takes some time to make good on a new farm.  The ordinary little tree takes quite a number of years to grow.  There is no use in allowing anyone to get away with the statement that land division here was failure.</P>
    <P>It is surprising how rapidly people were able to get on their feet.  The percentage of failures was the normal percentage.  It is said that these people got a great chance during the war.  I wonder did they.  These men had to till their land.  There was no artificial manure.  Very often the plough that was used was one which had been stopping gaps for years.  There was no machinery.  The threshing mills were generally inefficient.  Nearly half the corn fell out of them and was lost. Generally, the tenants endured many serious handicaps.  Deputy Hughes knows that well.  In his district it might not be as bad but certainly in County Meath there was difficulty of every description.  The chief difficulty was the lack of artificial manure.</P>
    <P>Taking all the circumstances into account, I think the farmers succeeded extremely well.  The best thing we can do is to leave them alone, and give them a chance to get on their feet. Some of them accumulated a little capital during the war.  They happened to be lucky.  If we set up all these fantastic tribunals to examine into the position, I think the tenants will be inclined to say: &ldquo;We will get out of this altogether.&rdquo;  The farmer is a very busy man, and his wife is an extremely busy woman.  The idea of inspectors being around the place is entirely objectionable.  There was too much interference and the Land Commission got over-nervous and got the impression that land division was a failure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> The only respect in which I consider land division was not successfully carried out was in the laying out of the farms.  The question as to the size of the farm is another matter, which is very difficult to decide.  I do know that at the mills where I have made inquiries the oats and wheat that bushelled best and that were in good condition came from the smaller farms, and the oats and wheat that were in the worst condition came from the larger farms.  That would seem to show that there is nothing wrong with the small farms.  Under climatic conditions here, it is easier to save small amounts than large quantities.  While tillage is a profitable policy, the small farms can succeed.  Anyone can see the traces in the country of a period when tillage was valueless and when cattle rearing was the policy.  I do not know how long the tillage policy will last.  Nobody knows when that particular fashion may go out of date, or when the farmer will have to depend on something else.</P>
    <P>I agreed with Deputy Hughes that the farmer is a good financier.  It puzzles everyone to know how he manages. If the Bank of Ireland were controlled as well as the farmer's purse is controlled, the farmer would be able to buy stuff cheaper.  The industrialists could take a leaf out of the farmer's book.  If one compares the capital on which the farmer works with the capital required for factories, and takes into account the facilities in each class, one must agree that the farmer operates whatever capital he has in an excellent fashion.  We should leave him alone.  The industrialists would not mind tribunals so much.  They are more or less accustomed to them and can cope with them but there should not be a tribunal set up to inquire into the farmer's business and to see how he is getting on.</P>

      <P>I said in the beginning &mdash; and Deputy Hughes knows it as well as I do &mdash; that there are some farms in which the father, to some extent, failed and the mother and sons were eminently successful.  There is nothing in that argument.  There may be 21 per cent. to-day and in a couple of years' time there may be far less.  It is impossible to gauge that.  The less interference we have, the better for the farmers.  The farmer and his wife are busy people and commissions of inquiry will only depress them.  They should be encouraged by being allowed to carry on.</P>
      <P>I think the farmer is doing very nicely.  There are ways and means by which he can be helped.  Some of these he does not thoroughly understand. Very often there is some difficulty in getting work done under rural improvement schemes because of lack of co-operation. We could help a lot in that way without holding an inquiry into his particular business and having someone decide that he is not working his farm properly, or that he is renting it or setting it.</P>

      <P>There were abuses but that does not follow that the whole system of land division was a failure or that the farmers who got these lands were failures.  They were not.  In regard to the question of setting up this tribunal, it is my candid opinion that we should not do that.  To a large extent tribunals are political clap-trap, good enough for the purpose of politics but, as far as the farming industry is concerned, we should leave it alone and keep it apart from politics. If we could retire a number of these inspectors it would be all to the good. There is no need whatever to interfere with the farmers.  I do not say that these inquiries frighten them because they are becoming accustomed to them. They merely irritate them and the setting up of the proposed tribunal would further irritate them.</P>

      <P>It is apparent that the last speaker has completely misconceived the implications of this motion.  It is not the intention of Deputy Hughes or my intention to add anything to the inspectorial system or to harass the farming community by State interference of any kind.  On the contrary we want a tribunal which will examine, first, the manner in which allottees for a share of the public demesne are selected; secondly, how the allotments allotted to tenants in the past have been used and to what extent the allottees have been able to make a living upon the land allotted to them, and thirdly, we want to get an <Col N="1453" /> investigation which will enable this House to come to a decision as to what can be regarded as an economic holding. In the fourth place we want to find out to what extent allottees have failed to make proper use of their holdings.  The speech of the Deputy has ranged all over the map and never once came to the problems set out under these four heads.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully understand the desire of Deputies to be informed concerning the position which has arisen in consequence of the strike at the sugar factories, I consider it desirable to preface my remarks by explaining my position in the matter. The adjustment of the wages and conditions of employment of the sugar factory workers is ordinarily a matter for settlement by negotiation between the company and the trade unions representing the various classes of workers employed by the company.  In the event of failure to agree, the services of the Labour Court are available to the parties.  The determination of wages and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of a settlement, is not a function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The main change which was effected by the Industrial Relations Act, passed by the Dáil this year, was to transfer from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Labour Court all his functions regarding conciliation in industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This dispute which has arisen at the sugar factories is not, however, an ordinary industrial dispute.  The product of the industry is, as Deputies are well aware, a necessary of life.  There is at present no other source of supply of sugar.  The public is, therefore, vitally concerned in the dispute and in its early termination.  I do not think it is unreasonable or unfair to assume that, if the commodity involved was <Col N="1454" /> not essential or if alternative supplies of that commodity were available, the unofficial strike at the factories would not have taken place.  It is because the workers feel able to dictate terms to the community that they have responded to the advice to try it, ignoring the advice of the responsible leaders of their unions who fully realised the gravity of a stoppage of work at the factories at this season, and who endeavoured to make arrangements which would protect the interests of their members and, at the same time, had due and proper regard to their obligations to the community.</P>
    <P>There is, however, some reason to believe that the unofficial strike is due to a considerable misunderstanding amongst the factory workers of the course of the negotiations between the company and the trade unions and of the outcome of these negotiations.  I would like, therefore, to give a short outline of the history of the negotiations and of their results.  In November, 1945, the company proposed the making of new agreements to the trade unions catering for the various classes of sugar factory workers.  The company recognised that there were many inequities and inequalities to be remedied, and desired also to have a new and comprehensive wage agreement to come into operation when Emergency Powers (No. 260) Order was revoked.  After inter-factory discussions, the next stage was the submission of proposals for a comprehensive agreement in writing to the company by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  Subsequently, the company's proposals for a new agreement were submitted to the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union on the 28th August, and to the Irish Engineering Industrial Union on the 6th September.  Correspondence continued with the unions until the end of October.  Negotiations were complicated by some difficulty in securing agreement between some of the engineering unions to negotiate together.</P>
    <P>On the 1st November the Labour Court was informed that certain workers at the Mallow factory had gone on strike, while other workers <Col N="1455" /> there had announced their intention of going on strike but were continuing at work under instructions from their unions.  That dispute at the Mallow factory related, apparently, to matters affecting the employment of fitters. After a conciliation meeting at Mallow on the 2nd November, at which a conciliation officer of the Labour Court presided and which was abortive, the Labour Court decided on the 4th November to hold a sitting of the court to investigate the dispute which at that time had spread or seemed likely to spread to other factories.  The court met on the 6th and 7th November.  The meeting of the court was attended by representatives of all the trade unions concerned, including workers from all of the four factories, as well as by representatives of the company.</P>
    <P>Having heard a statement concerning the sugar supply position, which emphasised the importance of getting manufacture under way as soon as possible, a temporary agreement was reached under the auspices of the court.  The stated purpose of that temporary agreement was to ensure that the manufacturing campaign would be started at the earliest moment at all factories and that there would be no stoppage during the campaign.  The most important clause of the temporary agreement provided (1) no stoppage during the campaign; (2) reference to the Labour Court for settlement by arbitration of any differences which could not be settled by negotiation; and (3) the immediate commencement of negotiations under the auspices of the court for a comprehensive agreement for the regulation of conditions of employment, taking account of the proposals previously made by the company and the counter proposals of the unions.  The court intimated that arbitration on any question as to whether particular work should be confined to a skilled craft union, which was one of the initial causes of dispute, would be carried out by a person with proper technical qualifications. That temporary agreement was arrived at with the unanimous concurrence of all the representatives present.</P>
    <P>The terms of the temporary agreement were, of course, known to the <Col N="1456" /> representatives who attended at the meeting of the Labour Court from the four factories and those representatives, presumably, made the terms of the agreement known to the workers at the factory during that week-end.  The negotiations for a comprehensive agreement were begun at once and took place under the auspices of the Labour Court on the 9th &mdash; which was a Saturday &mdash; the 11th, 12th and 13th of this month.  These negotiations resulted in unanimous consent upon the drafting of a new comprehensive agreement. The text of the draft agreement deals with all matters affecting conditions at the factories, including the engagement of workers, the termination of employment, promotion, hours of work, meals, clothing, annual leave, public holidays and special leave, travelling allowances, rates of pay, overtime, allowances and bonuses, and methods of settling differences with the company. The agreement provided for increases in pay and bonuses for all grades of workers and there was a provision also that the new rates would be subject to revision on the initiative of the unions, any disagreement to be referred to the arbitration of the Labour Court.  The union representatives participating in the negotiations expressed their intentions to recommend the new agreement to their members, the agreement to come into effect from November 12th. However, while these negotiations were in progress, on Monday the 11th the workers at the Tuam factory announced that they refused to work, while remaining in the factory.  The trade unions intervened and the Tuam workers resumed operations.  On the 13th November, when the negotiations were almost completed, the workers at the Mallow factory informed the management of their intention to cease work.  The unions again intervened but without success.  The result of the precipitate strike at the Mallow factory is that the new comprehensive agreement was not signed.  It was to have been submitted to the workers at the four factories with the unions' recommendation for its acceptance, but the fact that the workers rushed into strike action before they saw the agreement prevented its completion.</P>
    <P>The main issue which arises in the <Col N="1457" /> present dispute is not whether the sugar factory workers have grievances, or have a legitimate demand for higher wages, but whether an unofficial strike can get better results than the regular process of trade union negotiation.  It is not denied that there were grievances and that conditions required readjustment in some respects.  Nor is it denied that there is a just claim for higher wages.  These things are conceded by the company.  These were, in fact, the matters which were the subject of negotiation between the company and the trade unions and which, in the opinion of the trade union representatives participating in the negotiations, were satisfactorily settled by the draft agreement.  If there are causes of discontent not covered by the draft agreement, or if there is a desire to amend the draft agreement, such matters can be discussed and settled by negotiation between the trade unions and the company.  There is agreement that if they cannot be settled by negotiation they will be submitted to the Labour Court, whose findings the company will accept.  That is the proper and responsible way of dealing with such issues, but it cannot be availed of while this irregular and unofficial strike is in progress.  I do not know if there is any use in appealing to the more responsible elements amongst the men on strike to exert their influence on their fellow workers. Their action has raised grave danger of a shortage of a vital commodity.  Even if work is immediately resumed there will be loss.  The employment of thousands of other workers is jeopardised. I cannot believe that the sugar factory workers are so completely selfish as to wish to inflict such grave injury on the whole country and, particularly, on the farmers who grow beet and on the workers in other industries to whom the resumption of sugar production means continued employment.</P>
    <P>Neither do I believe that the majority of the workers on strike want to break up their trade union organisation and the machinery of collective bargaining. They can gain nothing by their action. The issues raised by their action are more important even than the supply <Col N="1458" /> of sufficient sugar and they cannot win on that.  I would ask them, therefore, to conform to the agreement which was made by their representatives.  That agreement involves the commencement of the manufacturing campaign and no stoppage during the campaign.  If they carry out that agreement, the new draft comprehensive agreement made with the trade unions will be submitted in the normal, regular way for their acceptance.  If they decide not to accept it, in whole or in part, there can be either resumed negotiations or submission to the Labour Court, but any such resumed negotiations must be conducted through the trade unions. That must be understood&mdash;there can not be negotiations on any other basis. If the workers have legitimate grievances and demands, it is all the more important that they should be settled by the regular method of negotiation through the trade unions than by methods of anarchy.</P>
    <P>It may be that there are, amongst the sugar workers, some men who like disturbance for disturbance sake, or for some other reason.  The majority of the workers cannot be of that mind and, when they realise that persistence in their present course can bring no benefit to themselves and can do the most injury to the country's interests, they will undertake to work the campaign.</P>
    <P>This year is going to be a much more difficult one in respect of many foodstuffs and some other supplies than any of the war years.  Our supplies of wheat are more precarious, our supplies of butter are less, and our turf stocks are lower than at any stage of the war.  If we are to have added to these difficulties a year without sugar, or with insufficient sugar, due to the reckless continuation of an unofficial strike, it would be an act of supreme folly.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that the men on strike should decide, and meet forthwith to decide, in consequence of this explanation of the position which I am now giving, (1) to adhere to the unanimous agreement made by their representatives to start the campaign with no stoppage during the campaign; (2) that they should renew their <Col N="1459" /> contacts with their trade unions to receive and consider the comprehensive agreement which has been made with the company and (3) that they should agree that any difficulties arising out of the agreement and grievances not rectified by the agreement should be submitted to the judgment of the Labour Court.  On that basis the factories can be got going again, the threat of a sugar shortage can be averted, the employment of workers in other industries can be safeguarded, and the conditions of employment of the sugar factory workers can be satisfactorily adjusted.  If that basis is not accepted, we will have a period of very great difficulty which the public will attribute to undue selfishness. Neither in the short run nor in the long run can the sugar workers gain by persistence in their present course.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in the Press that a main cause of the dispute is the employment by the company of some ex-Army men in positions which were vacant.  As the House is aware, the Government has appealed to all employers to employ ex-soldiers whose services with the Forces during the emergency denied them the opportunity of obtaining civil employment which others continued to hold. The Government could not agree that men who served their country as soldiers during the war should be denied the opportunity of employment in this country at anyone's behest.  If there are legitimate grievances arising out of that matter, the company will no doubt examine them; but if there is a view that ex-soldiers are not to get employment with the sugar company, it would be an extraordinary state of affairs which nobody would be prepared to tolerate.</P>
    <P>The sugar manufacturing industry was started in this country by decision of the Government for the purpose of giving employment to the workers who are engaged in it, to give a new outlet for farm produce and to secure essential supplies during such an emergency as that through which we are now passing. The workers in the industry owe an obligation to the community.  In the pre-war years we could have imported <Col N="1460" /> sugar much cheaper than we could make it ourselves.  For the benefit of those workers amongst others we paid a higher price for sugar to keep their employment going.  Possibly in the post-war years we will be again able to import sugar cheaper than we can make it.  Whether we do or not will be decided by the Irish public and their decision may well be influenced by their experience in this year.</P>
    <P>It would be ironic, indeed, if this important industry were to be destroyed by the very men for whose benefit it was established.  It would be equally ironic if, at the time that it is most vital to the country that the industry should work smoothly, its operation was disrupted by reckless action.  It is in consequence of the obligation which the men on strike have to the public of this country as workers in the sugar industry that we can expect them now to show some appreciation of the public needs.  Whatever their sense of grievance, whatever pressure is being put upon them by the organisers of this unofficial strike, they have a duty to their country also.</P>
    <P>If that sense of obligation and duty is not strong enough to induce them to get the factories working without delay, it may well lead us to despair for the future.  However, I am not without hope that when the men realise the consequences of persistence in their present action on the country as a whole, on the employment of other workers, on the prestige of Irish trade unionism and on the future of their industry, they will decide to return to work.</P>

      <P>On the 13th November, Deputy Davin and myself put down the following Question:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he is aware that the owner of the Trench estate, Glenmalyne, Ballybrittas, Leix, agreed, some time ago, to sell the estate to the Land Commission for division among the large <Col N="1461" /> number of deserving applicants in the Ballybrittas area; if he will state what action, if any, has since been taken by the Land Commission to acquire the estate; and whether they recently agreed with the owner or his representative to let the lands for a further period of two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply said that the Land Commission had noted this matter for consideration when circumstances would permit, but have not been in communication with the owner or his representatives on the matter.  The Minister was unavoidably absent that day &mdash; through illness, I believe &mdash; and was represented by his colleague, the Minister for Justice, who, in reply to a supplementary question, stated that the Land Commission was too busy to deal with a proposal of this kind.  I may point out that the agitation in this case has been going on for a considerable time.  On the 3rd October, 1945, the Minister for Lands wrote me as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Lands wishes me to refer to your representations in connection with the acquisition and division of the lands on the Trench estate, Glenmalyne, Ballybrittas. He has already received very strong representations in this matter and has requested the Land Commission to note the case for investigation when a suitable opportunity arises.  As you are aware, however, the emergency restrictions on Land Commission work prevent any action in matters of this nature at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 27th March, 1946, as a result of further representations in this matter, the Minister wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Lands wishes me to refer to your representations in connection with the lands on the Trench estate, Glenmalyne, Ballybrittas, and to state that they have been referred to the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last week it was stated that the Minister was taking no action whatever in this business.  This is a case in which <Col N="1462" /> there is absolutely no difficulty and I raise it in all sincerity and good faith. I ask the Minister to impress upon the Land Commission the importance of moving in this matter.  Here is a huge estate in County Leix, where the owner is anxious to give the land over to the Land Commission.  The owner, Mr. Trench, informed me on Tuesday last &mdash; and gave me permission to use his name &mdash; that he was anxious for the Land Commission to acquire the lands as soon as possible, so that he might dispose of the matter immediately.  He is anxious to sell the estate, which is in a very congested area, where there are large numbers of cottage tenants, small holders, landless men, deserving Old I.R.A. applicants and people taking conacre for a number of years. Those who have been taking conacre find that prices are so high now that the more prosperous farmers are competing with them for grazing or tillage.</P>
    <P>When the proposal was first made, a deputation of the Deputies of the constituency and local parties interested approached the owner, who had no objection to the Land Commission taking over the place and who agreed to set the lands to the local people until such time as that was done.  He was prepared to give the Land Commission every assistance, every help and co-operation, but despite that, nothing has been done and those people cannot get the grass of a cow.  The local people know that, if they have to wait a further three or four years, the land will be completely run out by the time they get it and it will take many years to put it right again.  This is a case in which the Land Commission would have no difficulty whatever, but is acting as a complete obstacle to the owner and the deserving applicants.  We have the Minister for Lands telling us the Department is too busy.  Too busy at what?  The Land Commission is a big, useless, cumbersome body, which is a barrier to progress instead of being of assistance.  I do not blame Deputies for demanding an inquiry into its activities.  If there is one institution in this State which needs a thorough investigation, it is the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one institution in this State which needs investigation into its working, it is the Land Commission.  I hope the Minister heard that.  It is more of a hindrance to progress than a help.  I am sorry I had to have recourse to raising this matter in the House.  If I were a Government Deputy, every time I would go to that district I would be hooted and jeered, just as the Fine Gael Deputies were when they were in power, for refusing to carry out land division schemes. Very little interest is being taken in this by the Government Deputies, as they are tied down by Government policy.  Nothing is being done in this straightforward case, where people are hungry for land in a most congested district.  Some of the applicants are the finest and hardest working young farmers' sons to be found in any county.  They are fully equipped with finance, with agricultural implements and live stock, and there is a huge estate at their door, with the owner anxious to place it at their disposal, but the Government is taking no steps to assist them.  I ask the Minister, in all sincerity, to ask the Land Commission to give this case special consideration, as there are no difficulties in the wide earthly world to be experienced in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see in the Minister's reply that he says he has not been in touch with the owners or representatives.  Was it not a fact that requests came from Deputies representing the constituency and also from the local parties interested, asking him to send down an inspector to make a report on this estate?  Furthermore, would he make representations to the owner, so as to come to terms of purchase?  If ever a case has been brought forward to prove that the Land Commission is a big, useless body which is a barrier to advancement, this is such a case, as there is a clear indication that its activities are of no credit to the Minister or his Department.  I ask him to give this matter his careful consideration and, if my words have been bitter, it comes from all sincerity, from the <Col N="1464" /> pressure brought upon me by my constituents, who I believe are entitled to this estate.  In the event of its being acquired and allocated to these deserving applicants, I can assure the Minister they will prove themselves worthy of the recognition which the Land Commission gives them and that they will make that land produce food for man and beast in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The agitation for the acquisition and division of this estate has been going on for a considerable period.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to state the date when representations were first made to the Land Commission to have this estate divided.  That would be interesting information to me.  It is well over 12 months since the agent of the estate, acting for the owners, advertised in the local papers the sale &mdash; not the letting &mdash; by public auction, in selected lots, of this estate.  Immediately that advertisement appeared, considerable misunderstanding and confusion were caused locally.  All the Deputies of the constituency were approached by all classes of people in the area inviting them to get in touch with the Minister for Lands with a view to getting the Land Commission to take immediate steps to have the estate divided.  Before doing so, however, I suggested to each of my colleagues that we should approach the owner or agent.  A meeting was arranged at which all the available Deputies for the constituency were present.  After some discussion, he and his advisers agreed not to proceed with the sale of the lands in the lots already arranged and that, pending a decision by the Land Commission, they would let the lands to the most deserving local applicants. If the lands had been sold, as originally intended, it would have cut across the whole policy of the Land Commission, if that body should decide at a later date to acquire lands of that kind and divide them amongst the most deserving applicants in the area.  The owner's idea of an economic holding would be entirely different from that of the Minister and his advisers in the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies subsequently approached the Minister and submitted <Col N="1465" /> the case as one requiring immediate action on the part of the Land Commission. This was one of the few cases, in my 24 or 25 years' experience of land owners in the constituency, in which the owner agreed to hand the estate over to the Land Commission for division if they were agreeable to take it.  I dare say the owner is not willing to hand over the estate on the terms offered by the Land Commission. Naturally, he would expect a certain price.  There might be a difference on that question between the Land Commission and the owner but there is a way of settling that difference.</P>
    <P>It was easy for the Land Commission to proceed in this case, because there was agreement on the part of the owner to sell.  The only thing that can have cropped up is the question of the price to be paid by the Commission. I want to know from the Minister what the circumstances are which prevented him and the commissioners from having these lands acquired.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question on the 13th November, the Minister said: &ldquo;The representations made to the Land Commission have been noted for consideration when circumstances permit.&rdquo;  Am I to understand that, up to the present, the circumstances have not been sufficiently favourable to permit the commissioners to go in and take preliminary steps to have these lands acquired and divided?  I ask the Minister for an answer to these questions, because they are reasonable.  I want to know whether the Minister has asked for, or received, any report from any of the local inspectors on the desirability of having the lands acquired or on the question of congestion in the area.  If such a report has been submitted for the consideration of the commissioners, has there been any provisional decision to acquire or not to acquire these lands?</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan, who was evidently speaking to the owner of the estate during the past week, indicated that the owner was anxious to have information one way or the other on this matter.  So are the local people.  The owner is entitled to information as to whether or not the Land Commission intends at any time to acquire these <Col N="1466" /> lands.  If the Land Commission say: &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the owner will be a free agent as to whether he will dispose of his lands by sale or letting.  He is, at least, entitled to that information so as not to have this matter hanging over his head for an indefinite period.  In a case where the landowner agrees to sell, is it not fairly easy to take preliminary steps for acquisition and division? I have a fairly intimate knowledge of this area and I agree that there is a very large amount of congestion in it.  Long before the compulsory tillage regulations were thought of, the people of this area tilled a larger proportion of their land than the same number of people in any other parish.</P>
    <P>If the acreage available in this case had been divided prior to the emergency amongst the most deserving smallholders, cottage tenants and others in the area, there would have been more land under tillage than there has been up to the present.  Like other land owners, the present owner tills only what he is compelled to till. If the people of the locality, who have a tillage tradition, had these lands in their possession, there is no doubt that the acreage under wheat, beet and other such crops would be considerably increased.  This is a part of my constituency which helped to build up the first beet factory and there would be much more land under beet if the estate were divided.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is not of opinion that he is being asked to do anything unreasonable.  If this were a case in which the land owner &mdash; and this was the position in almost all those cases in my constituency &mdash; would go through every line of the Land Act and take advantage of every loophole to obstruct the commissioners in their project to acquire lands, it would be different. But here is a case in which there is an offer to sell.  The only thing in question as regards the acquisition and division of the lands is the Commission's desire to act and their willingness to have a fair price fixed by the body set up to settle differences of that kind between the commissioners and land owners.  I have not been speaking to the owner but I met the agent, in the company of my colleagues, and he <Col N="1467" /> adopted a reasonable and straightforward attitude.  The Minister has information to that effect on his files.  I hope that the Minister will use the machinery of the Land Commission, which is now fairly well oiled, to speed up the acquisition and division of this very large estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan informed the House that he was sorry to have to bring this case before the Dáil.  I think that he was delighted to get an opportunity of speaking on the matter.  I said in a previous discussion on the Adjournment that the justification for raising matters in that way is the inadequacy of the answer to a Parliamentary Question.  I have talked over this matter with Deputies and answered questions in the House and I think that they should be fully informed in regard to the matter.</P>
      <P>The fact that a man desires to sell his land to the Land Commission, and that there are people anxious to acquire it through the machinery of the Land Commission, is no sound reason why the Land Commission should immediately move to acquire that land and divide it.  I answered a question from Deputy Cosgrave yesterday, in relation to the matter of restrictions on the acquisition of land, by saying that I was not in a position to indicate when the Land Commission would be able to resume generally the work of acquisition of land outside the congested districts.  I believe that the main concern of the Land Commission should be the congested districts.  While I do not approve by any means of the tactics adopted by certain members of the Clann na Talmhan Party, I do realise that the evil which they discussed here is an evil that does exist and that every effort must be made to remedy that evil, irrespective of the wrong things done by people who advocate that remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission is trying to concentrate on and trying to do everything it can in, the congested districts, but, irrespective of the condemnation of Deputy Flanagan of the Land Commission, even if I were not Minister <Col N="1468" /> for Lands, I would entirely disagree with the viewpoint he has expressed. The Land Commission might be regarded as the oldest Department of all the Departments.  It is the Department which has most to do with rural life.  It is from that point of view that the Department has created conditions for the farmers which, in spite of everything that has been said, have been of immense benefit to the farmer. The longer I have been in the Land Commission and the more I have examined its workings, the more I am convinced of the immense amount of experience gained and the wisdom of the working of the Land Commission arising out of that experience.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies raised a question here recently in regard to an estate in County Mayo where a demand was made for Land Commission action in regard to an estate put up for sale and sold.  When representations were made about that estate in a very badly congested area, immediate steps were taken by the Land Commission to investigate the matter and nothing that has happened since need stop the Land Commission from taking action.</P>
    <P>In an area where vile congestion exists, it is the duty of the Land Commission to take action.  I have rather conservative ideas, even though on one occasion in this House Deputy Flanagan charged me with being a lawbreaker. I opposed alien control of this country because I believed it was bad for the people of the country and was not the will of the people of the country, but I do believe that the law passed by the Dáil, justly and fairly administered, is the best protection for the people and the best method of securing progress for the people's benefit.  One of the things that must be preserved is a man's right to the property he owns.  It must be preserved; we cannot get away from that, and where a man puts his farm up for sale, no matter what action the Land Commission may take at any time afterwards, it cannot go right in and say to that man: &ldquo;You must not sell your property in the open market.&rdquo; That is confiscation, a thing we cannot tolerate in this country, a thing that would be bad for every single one of us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> Certain charges were made in regard to the farm in County Mayo and again in relation to this farm, but it is not because a man who owns land is willing to sell it, or because a number of people desire to get that land through the operations of the Land Commission, that the Land Commission must take immediate steps to oblige both parties.  Mind you, Deputy Davin is a trade unionist and knows the value of trade unionism.</P>

Sometimes I wonder if some of the terms of that letter are not applicable to the conditions of to-day.  Then I wonder to whom are they applicable.

Was there anything done by way of threat to make him consent to the sale of the land? So long as there is a threat made by anyone, the Land Commission will not take action.</P>
