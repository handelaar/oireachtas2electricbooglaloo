      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that transport delays are seriously interfering with the sale of fresh fish sent from Dingle to distant markets; that a minimum of three days is required, under present conditions, to convey this perishable foodstuff from Dingle to Manchester, Birmingham and other English centres; and whether he will direct Córas Iompair Éireann to arrange for the more expeditious transport of fresh fish.</P>

      <P>Fish consigned from Dingle for shipment reaches the North Wall, Dublin, within 24 hours of despatch.  This is substantially the same service as obtained prior to the emergency.  The main delay arises from the fact that perishable traffic is not now accepted for conveyance by the London Midland and Scottish Railway Company's midday steamer.  This, I understand, is due to unsuitable rail connections at Holyhead.</P>

      <P>The valuation of agricultural land in the financial year ended 31st March, 1946, in respect of which relief from rates was given from the agricultural grant was £6,991,919.  Of this, the valuation of holdings not exceeding £20 in valuation was £2,007,396, and the valuation of the first £20 of holdings of higher valuations than £20 was £1,803,300.</P>
      <P>Where a person is rated in respect of two or more holdings of agricultural land all the holdings in his occupation in a county are for the purposes of the agricultural grant deemed to form a single tenement of land.  The total number of tenements of agricultural land exceeding £20 valuation whether composed of one holding or of several holdings which are deemed to form a single tenement, is 90,165.  Figures are not available showing the number of separate holdings under £20 which get relief from the grant.</P>

    <P>This matter of providing the Ceann Comhairle with a gown has been under consideration for a good while by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and it has been decided to bring it before the Dáil now for its consent. A question also arose as to whether it would be advisable to provide a gown for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk.  It was decided not to recommend that gowns be worn by the Clerk and Assistant Clerk of the Dáil, but the question of providing a gown for the Leas-Cheann <Col N="158" /> Comhairle was left in abeyance, so that if the House has any opinion to express in that regard we would like to hear it.</P>

      <P>If I am in order I should like to say that the proposal in the Report should be extended to the other officers.  Everybody agrees with the proposal in regard to the Ceann Comhairle. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has to occupy the Chair for a considerable time in the ordinary way, and it would look incongrous to visitors to the House to find that while the Speaker had a gown the man substituted for him was in ordinary attire.  I think whoever is in control of discussions in the Chamber ought to be robed if we are to have occupants of the Chair robed at all.  We could not explain why one man was robed and the other was not.  I could understand members of the Committee deciding that temporary occupants need not be robed.</P>

      <P>At the Committee on Procedure and Privileges I supported the view that no matter who was in the Chair, if the Ceann Comhairle was to be gowned, that rule should be carried out generally.  There might be some distinction made in the gowns.  I approve of the Ceann Comhairle being robed, but there is no use in having the occupant of the Chair wearing a robe for a couple of hours, if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not wear one.</P>

      <P>I agree with the last two Deputies.  I think it is the office is being invested with the dignity <Col N="159" /> of a gown, and not the particular occupant.  When the Ceann Comhairle leaves the Chair whoever occupies it is invested with his powers, and to all intends and purposes is the Speaker for the time being.  Considerable argument could be advanced on the lines of having the temporary occupant of the Chair wearing a gown.</P>

      <P>The matter has been carefully reviewed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The position of Ceann Comhairle in this House is a unique one, and a very exceptional one.  It is well to recall that to mind. The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Frank Fahy, came into this House as a partisan politician, elected by Fianna Fáil in a hotly contested election.  Deputy Frank Fahy sat in this House as a strenuous controversial politician, taking an active part in the debates in the House.  Then he was chosen as Ceann Comhairle and his whole status in this House changed.  He became at once the trusted custodian, not only of the rights of the Government Party, but more especially of the rights of the Opposition Parties, and Independent Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak of this with some background in the matter because we have modelled our procedure here very largely on the procedure which has gradually grown up by custom in the British House of Commons and which most Parliaments of the world have taken as their example.  Up to 1881 the Speaker of the British House of Commons could not leave the Chair so long as the House was in session.  I think a reference to the records will show that it was my father, who was then a member of the British House of Commons, who directed the attention of the House to the manifest impracticability and unreasonableness of that arrangement.  It was at his instance <Col N="160" /> that the system of Deputy Chairman was instituted in Parliament. But Parliament consented to that departure with profound reluctance because they were conscious of the fact that to allow anybody else to occupy the Speaker's Chair might very easily confuse the minds of members of the House of Commons as to the unique regard in which the occupant of that position should be held by all sides of the House.  There has been in the British House of Commons always a Chairman of Committees.  He never sat in the Speaker's Chair; he sat in the Chair below the Speaker's Chair. He never mounted the dais and actually went into the Speaker's Chair.  Our practice has been that whoever acts as deputy occupies the Chair ordinarily occupied by the Ceann Comhairle.  I think &mdash; albeit subconsciously &mdash; the motive in proposing to give a special gown to the Ceann Comhairle is more or less for the purpose of establishing the unique position that the Ceann Comhairle holds.  He should be the only officer of the House wearing that distinctive dress to demonstrate that he is impartially accepted by all sides of the House as the representative of us all in Parliament, just as in the old days no one was allowed to occupy the Speaker's Chair but the Speaker himself.</P>
    <P>I think on this occasion, when we seek to give some exterior mark to the unique position occupied by the Ceann Comhairle and the unique attitude of all Deputies on every side of the House to that position, we would lose by putting gowns on everybody and, therefore, I am strongly in favour, firstly, in the determining of some kind of gown analogous possibly to that of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in the United States of America; secondly, in confining it absolutely to the Ceann Comhairle's person and to his alone, so that no other person in this country &mdash;President, Chief Justice or anybody else&mdash;would have a comparable mark of distinction to wear in the presence of the people; and, thirdly, the point I want to make to the House&mdash;and I think it is of very real importance&mdash; a great many young Parliaments have fallen into what is for me the grievous <Col N="161" /> error of slavishly aping all the traditions of the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>Now, it would be fatuous and idiotic for us to put wigs and gowns on the Clerk of this House because there is no historical precedent for it and no historical explanation of it.  The reason why officers of the House of Commons are wigged and gowned is that originally they were associated with the Bar and they came into the House of Commons wearing the distinctive raiment of their profession.  Gradually, as usage ceased to impose on these officers the necessity of being members of the Bar, this office had been so long occupied by members of the Bar that the attire had come to be associated with the office of Clerk of the House of Commons, and so they continued to wear that dress just as you have officers of the Black Rod.  Surely, no one would suggest that we should put Captain Byrne into knee breeches.  We very sensibly chose an attire for him which was suitable and becoming and in complete harmony with our own institutions. The officer discharging equivalent responsibilities in the House of Commons goes about in velvet knee breeches and wears a long sword and he is called the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod.  There is an historical explanation for that and to change it would be to break with tradition&mdash;a tradition steeped in interest and full of history.  Let us not, however, contemplate these accidental features of the House of Commons and seek to import them in here without any reference to their association with the institutions we have here.</P>
    <P>While gladly acknowledging the source of our Parliamentary institutions to be that of the House of Commons, as every Parliamentary democracy must&mdash;and while gladly acknowledging that the House of Commons was right in giving to its Speaker a unique place, not only in their own midst but in the whole community, I agree that we should confer upon our Ceann Comhairle some outward mark of the unique relationship he has with all the Deputies of the House, but we should stop there.  If we go further we rob the mark, which we seek to confer, of its unique character and it <Col N="162" /> becomes virtually meaningless.  Given a gown on the Ceann Comhairle's person I think all who see it will understand. Giving gowns to half the staff of the House will mean that most persons will say it is a waste of cloth and a poor imitation of the original.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon that this is a matter of some significance.  I do not think, however, that anybody suggested that half the staff of Leinster House should be provided with gowns.  I differ very strongly from Deputy Dillon in his suggestion that the Ceann Comhairle is placed in a unique position and that we should suggest, not only for this House but to other people that the Ceann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle alone has the right to exercise authority in this House.</P>

      <P>Closure, yes.  The other is the one to which I always take most exception because to me it seems like asking somebody else to hit the person who hit you.  In any case the whole purpose of all this is to secure the utmost respect for the Chair.  Our practice here, since the establishment of this House, has been that, roughly speaking, the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle sit in the Chair for equal periods.  Are we going to suggest now that, under our rules of procedure and the discipline of this House, there is to be less regard shown <Col N="163" /> to those when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is sitting in the Chair rather than when the Ceann Comhairle is sitting in the Chair?  Are we suggesting that he has not the powers of the Ceann Comhairle to control members? I do not feel very strongly one way or the other about this question of the gown, but I do feel, if we are to have continuity of authority, that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should certainly have a gown if the Ceann Comhairle is to have one.  I do not think that anyone suggests that there should be gowns for half of the staff of the House.  I think that the other matter of the Ceann Comhairle being the sole custodian of the rights and privileges and orders of the House might be carried a bit too far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are deeply indebted to Deputy Dillon for his statement and his effort to lift this matter out of that vein of humour with which we were inclined to start the consideration of this motion.  I have recollections of showing some thousands of visitors around the Mansion House where there is a painting of Foster, the last Speaker of the Irish House of Commons.  In that painting he is wearing a gown somewhat similar to that which the Taoiseach wears as Chancellor of the National University.  I am of the opinion that the Ceann Comhairle should wear, if not Foster's gown, at least something similar to it, because the painting in the Mansion House, which I used to point to with great pride, had under Foster's name words to this effect: &ldquo;Foster, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, defender and asserter of the rights of the Irish people.&rdquo;  It is some ten years ago since I showed visitors around there, but I felt great pride and distinction in showing visitors from all parts of the world that Ireland had its Parliament at that time and that this was the great Speaker who defended its rights.  I can well imagine this House being full of English and other foreign distinguished visitors and if the Ceann Comhairle was wearing a gown similar to that of Foster's we could point to him and say: &ldquo;That gown is similar to that which was worn by the defender of the rights <Col N="164" /> of the Irish people before the Act of Union.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I appeal to the House to make sure that Ireland's historic associations will be recalled by any gown that the Ceann Comhairle wears.  I do not know whether there are any remnants of Foster's gown left but, if there are, they should be displayed here so that we could point them out to visitors to show that we had our independence at one time and that we hope some day to see the Ceann Comhairle presiding, as Foster did, over a thirty-two county Parliament.  I earnestly hope that the day will come when the gown of the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons will be introduced into this House so as to let the world know of our historical associations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very significant and very satisfactory that there is no opposition being voiced to this proposal to provide the Ceann Comhairle with robes of office.  It is only a very short time since there was a tendency in this country to play up to the meaner instincts of our people and deride everything in the way of ceremonial dress, whether the top hat, the tail coat, or anything else.  The nation has, I think, departed from that low standard of public outlook, and it is a welcome departure.  I fully agree with the statement of Deputy Dillon that the Ceann Comhairle occupies a unique position, a position which is much higher in status and much more important in function than that of his deputy.  At the same time, it must be recognised that while as deputy he is presiding over this House he occupies the position of Chairman, and I think is entitled to a distinctive robe, not exactly the same type of robe as the Ceann Comhairle, but at any rate a robe distinctive from that of members of the House.  I think it is ordinary common sense.  I think the fact that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle wears a robe will not take anything from the dignity or importance of the position of the Ceann Comhairle. Therefore, I think there is a sound reason why the suggestion should be adopted that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should also be robed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> I am also in complete agreement that robes should not be distributed broadcast to other members of the House. If the occupant of the position of Clerk or other official of the House were to be provided with a robe there might be an appeal to have Ministers robed and we would then be coming up against the very difficult problem of providing the particular type of robe that each Minister should wear. It might be suggested that the Minister for Agriculture should wear something distinctive of agriculture, and the Minister for Defence some sort of battledress, and so on.  I do not think this proposal should be carried further than that the person who occupies the Chair of the House should wear a definitely distinctive dress.</P>

      <P>The trouble appears to be to bring the matter definitely to a decision.  The proposal is to adopt the report of the Committee.  So far as the first paragraph of the report is concerned, it seems to have practically the unanimous support of the House. As to the other part of it, with reference to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, there does not seem to be the same measure of agreement.  I do not know what is the best way to deal with it from the point of view of order; whether we should propose to refer it back for further consideration or whether, as there seems to be unanimity, we should accept the proposal that the Ceann Comhairle should wear a gown and refer back the question of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill has four main objects.  The first is to permit of a reorganisation of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court which, it is hoped and expected, will contribute to the more convenient despatch of the business of that court. The second is to increase the maximum number of district justices from the present limit of 33 to 40.  It is hoped by that means that we may be able to get rid of the expedient of having temporary district justices.  The third is to abolish the office of assistant justice, which was created under the Courts of Justice Act, 1928.  Deputies are aware that for a number of years there have been in the city three assistant district justices who did the same work as the permanent justices, but they were paid less; they were permanent and pensionable, but they were paid less.  They were to be available for work down the country, but they were kept in Dublin because of the pressure of work.  That will be abolished.  The fourth is to alter the law as regards the tenure of office of the district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies are aware of the unsatisfactory position in Dublin for a number of years.  On the Estimate the question has been pretty fully ventilated and some months ago I expressed the hope that I would be able to bring in legislation to deal with the position in Dublin in respect of the matters I have mentioned.  The fact is that the system and organisation which was satisfactory enough 20 years ago, when the city was much smaller, will not work now.  There were three district justices in 1924, including the senior justice.  They were permanently assigned to Dublin.  There were also three assistant district justices, who were whole-time.  Now we have three justices, including the senior justice, three assistant justice, and two temporary <Col N="167" /> justices, making a total establishment of eight.  The clerical staff has increased from 12 in 1924 to 20. There was only one probation officer in 1924 and now there are seven.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have some idea of the reason for the increase in the business of the court.  There was a great increase in the criminal business, due to the emergency conditions.  There were offences which would not be there but for the emergency&mdash;rationing and other similar offences.  These increased the work of the courts.  There was also the fact that the city has grown enormously. The population has increased considerably and areas that were rural a few years ago are now included in the city.  Consequently, there is a need for a greater number of justices.  I expect also, when we give effect to Part III of the Rent Restrictions Act, passed recently, it will take up a large amount of the time of one justice, who will deal with tenement dwellers.</P>
    <P>On the whole, it seems reasonably clear that it will not be possible for some considerable time to come to operate the Dublin Metropolitan District Court to the satisfaction of all parties concerned with less than six permanent justices.  The Department have been satisfied on this score for a long time past, but, while the emergency lasted, it was considered inopportune to introduce a comprehensive scheme of reorganisation.  We are doing that now.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most serious defect of the present system is that it imposes on the senior justice a burden which, in the new and altered circumstances, is too much for one man.  As I have explained, the original organisation of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court provided for a senior justice and two other justices.  This idea was sound enough at a time when the senior justice and his two colleagues were able to overtake the work.  It was not then too much to expect that the senior justice could successfully exercise general control over the entire work of the district.  When, however, it becomes a question of arranging for the distribution of business amongst seven or eight other justices and <Col N="168" /> arranging for their sittings and, in addition, discharging the duties of chairman of the rules committee, as well as having some responsibilities in connection with a staff of close on 30, it ceases to be a practical proposition for one man to shoulder all these burdens and, on top of them, to discharge the ordinary function of the district justice.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes, as the remedy for the existing unsatisfactory position, that there should be three divisions in the Dublin metropolitan district.  That is provided for in Section 5.  These divisions will not be on a territorial basis.  They will be divisions of the business of the court and the business to be transacted in each division will be settled by the Minister for Justice, who is given, by Section 10 of the Bill, the power to distribute the business amongst the three divisions.  No scheme of distribution has yet been settled; this will be a matter for discussion with the justices concerned.</P>
    <P>Each division will consist of a principal justice and such number of other justices as the Minister for Justice may, from time to time, determine.  That is provided for in Section 5 (2).  It is contemplated that in practice each division will have two justices, a principal justice and an ordinary justice, permanently assigned to it.  In addition, such assistance as may from time to time be necessary may be allocated by the Minister for Justice to any division.  The principal justice and ordinary justices of divisions will be nominated by the Minister for Justice from among the justices for the time being assigned to Dublin.  That is provided for in Sections 6 (1) (a) and 7 (a).  Principal justices will not be transferable from one division to another, except with their consent.  Ordinary justices of divisions will, however, be so transferable. Sub-section (3) of Section 6 provides that the present senior justice must be nominated a principal justice of one of the divisions.</P>
    <P>It will be the duty of a principal justice to arrange for the distribution of the business of his division amongst the justices of the division.  Moreover, he may have delegated to him by the <Col N="169" /> Minister powers in relation to the determination of the classes of business to be transacted at each appointed place and the days and hours at which such classes of business will be transacted. The senior justice exercises very similar powers at present as regards all the business of the Dublin metropolitan district, under Section 5 of the Court Officers (Amendment) Act, 1937, which is now being repealed.  The Minister for Justice may exercise the powers referred to and, in addition, possesses the exclusive power to appoint the places in the Dublin metropolitan division for the transaction of the business of each division.  That is provided for in Section 11.  As regards the latter point, it is clearly necessary that there should be some central authority responsible for the allocation of the available courthouse accommodation amongst the separate divisions.</P>
    <P>The salaries of Dublin metropolitan justices are provided for in Section 8. Each principal justice will have £1,200 a year, the same salary as the present senior justice, and the ordinary justices of divisions permanently assigned to Dublin will receive £1,100 a year, which also is the salary of the present ordinary justices in Dublin.  The proposed change in the law as regards the senior justiceship makes an amendment of the law necessary as regards the chairmanship of the district court rules committee, and suitable provision in this regard is made in Section 13.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the provisions of Part III of the Bill, I think I should touch first upon the proposal in Section 15 for an increase in the number of justices, because the explanation of this proposal is to be found partly in the proposals as regards the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, which I have just been discussing.  Under Section 68 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the number of justices is at present limited to 33.  Of this number three are at present permanently assigned to Dublin, the remaining 30 being each assigned to a separate district. As I have explained, it is now proposed to have six justices permanently assigned to Dublin.  This means an increase of three in the over-all number of justices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> Under the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, not more than four assistant justices may be appointed.  These are whole-time, pensionable appointments, but their salaries are lower than the salaries of justices.  Originally, the salary of an assistant justice was £800. Under the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, that was raised to £900 after five years' service, and £950 after a further five years.  At present there are three assistant justices, as I have mentioned, and they have been for several years past constantly employed in Dublin.  There is no necessity to keep these on any longer.  We are putting all the justices on the same footing as full justices.  The proposal is then, as soon as the Bill is law and there is authority for increasing the number of justices, to appoint the three present assistant justices to be justices in Dublin.  There may be some question that they may be sent somewhere else. I propose that the three who have been in Dublin all along and who could have been appointed as full justices when there were vacancies some time ago and elected to remain in Dublin, will be appointed, when these appointments are made, to Dublin, with the salary they have.  There might have been some fear that that would not be done.</P>

      <P>Since I have been Minister, that is for seven years, we have had more than four temporary justices <Col N="171" /> all the time and I think we may take it that there will be work for them.  If not, when a vacancy occurs, we will not fill it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and if a time comes when there are too many justices and not so much work, if a vacancy should occur, it need not be filled.  I would suggest some way like that.  I have agreed, and every Deputy has agreed, that it is not desirable to have temporary justices.  I do not know whether or not this Bill will remove the need for that to some extent but I hope it will have that effect.  I agreed with the point made here that it was not a desirable practice.</P>
      <P>In regard to the age of retirement of justices, the present retiring age of a district justice is 65, except in Dublin and Cork, and there is power to extend the age to 70 in the Gaeltacht area.  I am proposing, while safeguarding the position of existing justices who are entitled to retire at 70, that the age should be the same for the whole country, that is, 65.  I am satisfied that the work in the District Court in Dublin is of such an onerous nature that a man at 70 years of age is really too old for it and that 65 ought to be the retiring age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my opinion that 70 is too old, especially for Dublin, where the work is very, very severe.  In regard to tenure of office, we are providing in Section 19 of the Bill that the tenure of office of a district justice should be the same as that of a High Court judge, that is, that they will be removable only by resolution of both Houses.  That is in substitution for the present rule under which a district justice is removable by the Government on report of a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General. <Col N="172" /> But, in Section 20, the Minister for Justice is given power to request the Chief Justice to appoint a judge to make inquiry into the conduct or health of any particular justice. That is a very good idea.  At present the only power to do that would be the power to appoint a tribunal of inquiry.  We think that in a matter of inquiry into something about a district justice, the new arrangement is better.</P>

I think it will be found very useful.</P>

      <P>Section 18 is to enable a justice to retire before his time if his health was not quite so bad as would enable him to get a doctor's certificate that he was unfit but nevertheless was such that he ought to go and that the Government was satisfied that it would be better if he did retire.  The proposal here is to enable him to retire on appropriate pension.  That power does not exist already.  We are asking for it here.  There is another matter that has arisen recently.  There is some doubt about the position when there is an appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court as to which court should issue the warrant.  There has been a <Col N="173" /> dispute in Dublin as to whether it should be the District Court or the Circuit Court.  We are making it definite, in Section 22, that it should be the District Court.</P>

      <P>It may not be generally realised how much work district justices get through and the service they perform not merely on the criminal side of the law but, more particularly, on the civil side of the law. They perform effectively and cheaply functions which enable poor litigants or, in the case of small claims, rich and poor litigants, to have their cases decided under a cheap code, a code which has fixed law charges and under which cases can be expeditiously and cheaply determined.  For that reason it is right that the particular status of the District Court should be acknowledged and that Deputies and the general public should realise that district justices and the District Courts perform a very useful function which could not ordinarily be performed by any other court and which enables matters to be determined more quickly than they could be if they had to await Circuit Court jurisdiction.  Therefore, it is only right that their status should be acknowledged and their position in the framework of the Judiciary should be formally established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection I have to certain provisions of this Bill is the implied suggestion that the district justices are unable to regulate their own affairs.  I admit it is necessary&mdash;in fact it should have been done earlier, but owing to the emergency and the conditions prevailing it was not possible for the Minister or the Government to arrive at a decision concerning the permanent nature of the District Courts so far as, Dublin is concerned&mdash;that the district justices should be free to decide their own procedure and practice in so far as the arrangement of business and so on is concerned.  Under this Bill, the Government has power to assign particular <Col N="174" /> work to a particular justice.  That is undesirable from many points of view. First, that a justice may be appointed to the position of district justice and immediately he may find himself dealing with cases where a State Department is prosecuting, and in which, say, emergency regulations have been contravened. He is put in the position that he has to decide the particular circumstance between his employers on the one hand and the citizen on the other.  While, in the normal way, once a justice is appointed, he is independent and free in the exercise of his functions, and while that generally will be so under the Bill, the objection has been voiced here before, and must be voiced again, that temporary district justices should not deal with matters in which the State is a party.  These justices are dependent on the goodwill of the Minister for their reappointment, and in recent years, in many cases of breaches of emergency regulations, these justices felt that, in order to make secure their reappointments, they should secure convictions in as many cases as possible.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, we are to have three divisions in Dublin and, according to the Minister, there will be one principal justice and one ordinary justice for these divisions.  The principal justice will have under his control a justice. I think it extraordinary that it should be necessary to have a principal justice in charge of an ordinary justice.  So far as the regulation of business is concerned, it is desirable that it should be left, if not to the senior justice, to a committee, and, under the provisions of the Bill, it would be better to have that business arranged by the three principal justices than by the Minister or by the Department.</P>

      <P>There will be three divisions of the work.  They will not be territorial divisions.

There will be a chief in charge of each. Another point to be remembered is that once a senior justice is appointed to one of these divisions, he cannot be transferred from it without his consent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the age of retirement in Section 14, I feel that it should be extended to 70 years. I know that provision for retirement at the age of 65 is made in the earlier Acts, but I do not know why that provision was made.  If a judge of the Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court is competent to transact business up to 70 years of age&mdash;in fact, it was extended to 72 years a few years ago&mdash; I do not see why a district justice should be incompetent to transact business at 65.  I suggest that the Minister should raise the age.</P>
      <P>Suggestions are very often made that a district justice, after retirement, becomes unable to transact further business because of his work, but I think it is a bad precedent and one which implies that a person holding the office of district justice who may be quite competent to continue in practice after his retirement at 65, merely because he fills the office of district justice is not competent to transact the business of that office.  If a judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court who, in the normal way, must secure a far wider degree of respect for law and order can continue to 70 years of age, there is no reason why a district justice should be expected to retire at 65.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that he proposes to safeguard the position of existing justices.  As I understand it, there are three temporary assistant justices in Dublin at the moment and these will probably be appointed to the three positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not temporary &mdash;they are permanent assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, there is a justice in a temporary position who has been in Dublin for a considerable time.  I suggest that any person whom it is proposed to leave in Dublin should <Col N="176" /> get the benefit of the age provision. Even if the age is left at 65, such a person should get the benefit of the extended period.</P>
      <P>Section 20 is an objectionable section. The section in the 1936 Act with regard to complaints is objectionable, but much more so is the suggestion that a judge appointed by the Chief Justice should be entitled to investigate the condition of health, either physical or mental, of a justice, or to inquire into the conduct, whether in the execution of his office or otherwise, of a justice.  The section gives the judge appointed very wide powers, but there is no provision compelling the judge to allow the justice to make representations, or to give medical evidence on his own behalf.  It is solely within the discretion of the judge to decide what the condition of the justice is.</P>
      <P>If as Section 19 says, justices are to hold office by the same tenure as the judges of the Supreme Court and High Court, a justice should be just as free in every sense in the matter of his capacity.  A judge has entire freedom in relation to the exercise of his functions and holds office subject to the Constitution.  He may be removed only under Article 35, sub-paragraph 4, Section 1, which says that a judge of the Supreme Court or High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Éireann calling for his removal.</P>
      <P>It would be undesirable that that provision should be invoked, except in very extreme cases.  The provision gives judges a safeguard and makes them independent in the exercise of their functions in that it ensures that a judge will not be removed except for stated reasons and only after resolutions have been passed.  It cannot be said that Section 19, coupled with Section 20, gives a justice of the District Court the same independence nor can it be said, in the light of these sections, that he holds office on the same tenure as a judge of the High Court, and I suggest that that section, if it is not deleted, should be drastically amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave will agree that this Bill is generally designed <Col N="177" /> to raise the status of district justices.  In so far as it tends to do that, I welcome it as a most admirable step in the right direction, because, in my humble opinion, the district justice, in practice, is one of the most important justices we have.  He is the only judge to whom one can have access without going bankrupt.  To litigate in the Supreme Court or the High Court is a rich man's occupation, but the poorest man in the country can make his way into the local district court and get his grievance heard and a remedy provided at no expense at all, if he is not in a position to put up the money.</P>
      <P>I think that is very widely recognised amongst the people, and genuinely appreciated and valued by them.  Is it, therefore, appropriate on this occasion to inquire whether the Minister has considered the advisability of extending the jurisdiction of the courts?  If I want to sue my neighbour for £25 in rural Ireland with trivial expense, we can bring our dispute before the district justice and get it determined in the vast majority of cases to the satisfaction of all concerned.  If a man owes £26, the proceedings must be removed, I think, to the Circuit Court, and by the time the debt is realised, and the dispute resolved, the litigants have spent anything from £30 to £50, so that it would have paid them very much better not to have gone to law at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be so in the City of Dublin, but the Deputy should remember that a 2d. tram will bring litigants to court in Dublin.  If they were living seven miles from the court in rural Ireland&mdash;remember that circuit courts do not come to every town &mdash;they might have 15 miles to travel, and each of them might bring six witnesses.  If there is acrimonious litigation it is not an uncommon thing to bring the blind, the lame and the halt. I think the Deputy would be astonished how costs mount up in rural areas.  I am a member of the legal profession, although I have never practised. I have lived all my life in rural Ireland, and I have wide experience of giving credit as a merchant.  I have <Col N="178" /> long experience and training, both as a farmer and as a merchant, in rural Ireland, and I cannot think of any valid objection to the raising of the jurisdiction of the District Courts.  I would not have the slightest objection in remitting to the jurisdiction of any district justice we have had in our area, since the institution of the State, any dispute of mine.  I think I can say with perfect truth that I would be content to have any matter which would be measured in money determined by district justices, of whom we have had several in the area in which I live.  I agree that when you come to certain types of criminal offence they are invested with a jury and with the panoply of the higher courts.  That is not only desirable but necessary.</P>
      <P>Is not this an appropriate time to draw the attention of this House to another astonishing state of affairs? I can sue my neighbour to-day in the District Courts for £24 19s. 11d.  If a neighbour's hen breaks through my fence, and becomes guilty of habitual trespass on my property, I cannot go to the District Courts to get my neighbour restrained from permitting his or her hen to come on my property.  I must institute proceedings in the Circuit Court, and bring witnesses there. The defendant will also being his or her witnesses to court.  We will have two solicitors and two gentlemen with wigs and gowns, all on the head of the hen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A question of title arises. If my claim to the property on which the hen trespassed is challenged, that raises a question of title.  It must go to the Circuit Court, because the district justice has no jurisdiction on matters of title.  All that is on the head of a solitary hen.  We have two solicitors, and two barristers-at-law, because the Circuit Court judge will not hear cases in our circuit without them.  I cannot speak for other places. There are witnesses on both sides to testify how and when the hen paraded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, engineers and quite likely maps, and not infrequently an expedition by the Circuit Court judge <Col N="179" /> to the scene where the hen trespassed. People may laugh and say that it would be an act of supererogation on the part of the judge to go to see where the hen trespassed, but it is very necessary in order to avoid feuds and family quarrels. It is not only necessary but to do justice and to induce the parties to believe that they have had justice. There ought to be some means of defining, at least, the limited sphere of title matters on which district justices can give judgment.  Speaking with the authority and experience to which I have already referred, I can see no valid objection to such procedure, bearing in mind that from every such decision there is an appeal to the Circuit Court, if it is felt that anything has gone wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Cosgrave in regard to the powers conferred upon one judge, under Section 20, to conduct an inquisition into the state of health or conduct of a district justice is very forcible and strong.  At first glance it seems to me that if three judges were substituted for one, any objection that the clause contain would be removed. Having heard Deputy Cosgrave I think that section should be reconsidered.  I doubt if the advantages it confers at all outweigh the evil that will follow from a qualification, which it unquestionably is, of the status which the Bill in another section specifically seeks to confer on district justices.  The purpose of the section conferring the new status on a district justice is to exalt that status.  There, I think the Minister is perfectly right.  Strangely enough, that is the kind of queer nonsensical thing he is peculiarly capable of doing. I think he will make a mistake, unless he gives much more substantial reasons than he has given so far, if he does not consent to Deputy Cosgrave's proposal to withdraw this provision.  Here, I am as much out of my depth about the administration of justice in the City of Dublin as my friend in the Fianna Fáil Party is about the administration of justice in remote parts of rural Ireland. I have a cousin who was a Chief Magistrate of London for some time. He often told me of the advantage they experienced there in dividing the city into districts rather than dividing <Col N="180" /> jurisdiction by means of subject matter. The reasons he adduced in respect of London may not apply to Dublin.  I do not know.  But he told me that when he was sitting in a place like Whitechapel after a time he became accustomed to the class of crime common in that area.  Not only that, but what might sound very shocking to one who did not know that area, to an experienced magistrate who understood the way the people lived it was not so very shocking at all.</P>
    <P>Deputies know that the police court system in England is somewhat different from the system we have here.  The police court in England is a place where family quarrels are brought and aired. The ordinary people can come in and make their complaints personally.  The police magistrate will chat informally with the aggrieved persons and help them out.  I was told in that connection that it is absolutely necessary that one should know the way of life of the people in the area over which one exercises judicial control.  Otherwise, you would be quite at sea.  A woman may come in and state her problem, expecting you to understand it through the simple phrases that she uses; if you do not know a good deal of the background by experience, you are completely at sea and so, from the word &ldquo;go,&rdquo; some of the confidence which you could command is lost.  If the aggrieved parties see at once that, when they describe their difficulties, you understand them and are able to take an intelligent interest in them, half the battle is won.</P>
    <P>When you come to a district like Vine Street it is quite another cup of tea. There you have suave and charming gentlemen, venerable old figures, being arraigned before you, who are well-known confidence tricksters.  Most of the confidence tricksters who turn up, if they have beards, they are Catholic priests and if they have no beards they are Protestant pastors.  You have naturally to discount their ecclesiastical attire; but if you do not understand that and know that you must discount that, you are at a loss when the Reverend Mr. Lester or the Reverend Father Maguire comes before you for having stolen a lady's handbag and you have to strain <Col N="181" /> your knowledge to its utmost to discover that his name is Abraham Isaacstein and his normal place of residence Lime House and that his success in his profession is due to his pleasing exterior.  I do not know if that exists in Dublin to quite the same extent.  I think it would be better, however, to divide Dublin into areas and to have three divisions in the city instead of having a senior and several junior justices.  In those divisions you should have a police magistrate responsible for the administration of civil and criminal justice.  I do not know if that would be a better system, but I think the people would have much more confidence in justices of that character with whose person and conduct they were familiar and in whose absolute integrity and complete independence they themselves could place entire trust.</P>
    <P>I yield to none in my respect for the Gárda Síochána.  I remember being told by a relative of mine, who is a judge on the High Court bench, that he never convicted any man on the uncorroborated testimony of a policeman. He did not want to suggest that policemen were constitutional perjurers, but he said that when you are 25 years in the police of any country and you know a particular man is a thug, a rascal, and a rogue and it is likely that he has committed a particular crime you are inclined to go into court convinced that the man did commit that crime and, subconsciously sometimes, provide the little missing link that ties the case up and finishes it off.  So, the magistrate who knows his area well knows the Guards in it; he listens to them and gives due regard to the testimony of the police, fully knowing that they are conscientious, honest, straight men but understanding that the nature of their profession creates and induces weaknesses for which due allowances must be made by an experienced judge dealing with similar cases week in and week out, year in and year out.  Those Deputies here who have experience of the administration of justice in the city, will be better informed on that than I am.  I think it would be well if some of those Deputies would refer to the matter which I have raised and give <Col N="182" /> us, from their experience, the benefit of their advice.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Cosgrave that 65 is too early to relegate a judge, puisne or otherwise, to the scrap heap.  Does anyone suggest in this House that we should scrap the Taoiseach?  He is as lively as a kitten. Who will deny that the duties, responsibilities, and the work of the Taoiseach are much more onerous that those of a district justice?  As far as I know, the Taoiseach celebrates his 65th birthday this year.</P>

      <P>He is as lively as a kitten, God bless him, and I think he would be a rash man who would suggest that, on grounds of senility, we ought to get rid of him.  I think he would be the first to say himself that when he tops 70 it will be time enough for him to go to the Phoenix Park, not because he is not brisk and cheerful but because there is a danger that when one passes that age a certain rigidity of mind tends to set in.  It is a terrible hardship on a vigorous man of 67 or 68 to be kicked out and told that he is no good.  Manifestly, it is absurd.  Think of it for a moment.  A judge of 69 years of age, four years in retirement&mdash;it is absolutely idiotic. Some of the best opinions at the Bar are made at that age.  Some of the most learned judgments ever given on the Bench in this country, or Great Britain, were given by men in excess of that age.  I agree it is necessary to fix some age.  Those Deputies who have read the correspondence between Sir Frederick Pollock and Mr. Justice Holmes will understand what I mean. On his appointment at 65, Mr. Justice Holmes wrote to Sir Frederick Pollock and said that he had fully made up his mind that on his 70th birthday he would retire, no matter who pressed him to remain.  On his 90th birthday he wrote to Sir Frederick Pollock, told him that he never felt better and that he was putting in a good day's work.  He died still adorning the Bench in his <Col N="183" /> 93rd year, and a very remarkable old gentleman he was.  But his view changed about the propriety of retiring at 70 as the fatal day approached.  I think, therefore, that it is right to fix some age, but 65 is manifestly too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what about the clerk?  We are making all sorts of provisions here for the district justice.  I think I am entitled to suggest that in reconstituting the courts for their greater efficiency, some regard might be had for the clerks.  There is only one plea I want to make for them, and I think myself it is a modest one; that is, they should be given the same measure of security that every other public servant in the State enjoys.  All I ask is that the District Court clerk, when he has served his term, will get a pension. When this State was established we took over a number of persons who had been Petty Sessions Court clerks. Most of these men were in middle age. We all remember that being a District Court clerk in the early days was no fun.  In certain parts of the country it was a very dangerous occupation. These persons carried on through fair weather and foul.  I think all will agree that the standard of excellence of the District Court clerks is quite extraordinary.  The number of scandals in connection with that class of officers has been most remarkably small considering the speed and emergency that existed in the appointing of them.  Surely it is not unreasonable to say now, when many of them, particularly the middle-aged men, are reaching the age when they will be expected to retire, that they ought to be given pension rights. Nothing is so hard for a man who has enjoyed a very modest salary all his life, but such an income as made it almost impossible for him to maintain a respectable exterior, as to look forward to the time when he has to say to his wife and children: &ldquo;We now must move out of the modest house we have and go into a labourer's cottage, because I have no pension, and to keep up the reasonable exterior of respectability that was becoming an officer of the District Court, we had to live up to the last penny I was able to earn.  There is no nest-egg laid up, <Col N="184" /> because the salary granted to us did not permit of a married man leaving aside anything&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would not break the State to give these men the measure of security they seek and I beg this House&mdash;may I engage the attention for a moment of the public-spirited Fianna Fáil T.D.s present&mdash;to do it now for this reason, that there is an absolutely cast-iron blank wall in the Department of Finance against making any pension legislation retrospective, and, if we do not grant the pensions now and five or six of these District Court clerks go out or retire, even though there is a pension scheme brought in for District Court clerks as a class next autumn, the men who are retired between now and next autumn will not be allowed to be made more eligible for it without any regard to the merits of their claim, because if that pension legislation was made retrospective, there are hundreds of similar claimants all of whom would quote this as a precedent and the Department of Finance will not face the avalanche that might thereby be created.  Therefore, I do most earnestly urge on the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party to encourage their Minister to beard the Minister for Finance in regard to this matter and get for all the clerks equitable treatment in time so as to ensure that we will not have a situation such as existed in regard to the County Court registrars, where every registrar in Ireland for all time to the crack of doom has pension rights except three who happened to retire eight or nine months before the pension legislation was passed.</P>
    <P>When you put that case to the Government you are told: &ldquo;We can do nothing because if we gave these three County Court registrars their pension, other pensions would have to be made retrospective.&rdquo;  Do not let us have that horrible anomaly in regard to the County Court clerks.  We are all agreed that they ought to have pensions.  Let us ensure that all of them will be treated <i>pari passu.</i>  If he will add that to the Bill, then I think the Minister for Justice may have reason to congratulate himself on having brought forward this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Every one who practises <Col N="185" /> in the Dublin District Court will welcome this Bill and the proposed reorganisation of the business.  But I suggest to the Minister that it might be better if, when doing this, he would incorporate the county and have one unit of the District Court to cover Dublin City and County.  The county is in the most extraordinary position. You will read of cases where there may be a sitting at a place like Balbriggan and, if the proceedings have to be adjourned for a small matter of detail, such as fixing bails, the adjournment may be made to a place as far away as Shankill, which would be about 30 miles away.  The parties coming from Balbriggan to Shankill would have to pass by the District Court in Dublin and go miles out.  In the same way, there are certain districts which were only taken into the City of Dublin a couple of years ago and they are still in the county for the purposes of the District Court.  Therefore, if a man from a place like Whitehall in Upper Drumcondra is summoned to attend the District Court, the court he goes to is Kilmainham.  He has to travel to the city and from that to Kilmainham, leaving the Dublin District Court behind him.  All that might be avoided if the city and county were incorporated into one unit.</P>
      <P>I think the greatest merit that will flow from this reorganisation is that there will be a continuity with regard to the hearing of a certain type of case by one justice.  As an example of that, take a civil case which is being heard. If the justice has to adjourn it for any reason, he must adjourn it for three weeks, because it will be three weeks at least before that justice will be hearing civil cases again.  Similarly, when depositions are being taken in criminal cases, the justice very often would like to sit the following day so as to finish the case.  But he finds he has to adjourn for a week or perhaps longer, because he has been assigned to other business which would not permit of his taking depositions on the following day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, the most satisfactory feature of this Bill is the removal of the grave injustice which has prevailed for some years past in regard to the assistant justices.  It was not generally known that these were not <Col N="186" /> assistant justices.  It was only when they were appointed that they may have been told that they were assistant justices.  After that there was no distinction whatever between their work and their responsibility and that of district justices.  The only distinction was that they were paid less.  You had the extraordinary feature that men who might be doing similar work were getting less money than others.  I think it was a grave injustice.  I do not think the present Minister had anything to do with the appointment of assistant justices.  I am very glad that he is now making an end of the practice, so that in future every man who sits in the District Court will be on the same footing, with the exception of the senior justices, and will get the same pay.  I suggest to the Minister that so grave is the injustice done to these assistant justices that he might make this increase or rectification of their salaries retrospective.</P>

      <P>With regard to the age of retirement, I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that the age should be 70, not 65; but I would have no objection if the continuance from 65 to 70 would be subject to the approval of some higher official, such as the Chief Justice or a judge of the High Court.  I think it is not fair that a man who is active and able to carry out his duties should be forced out at the age of 65.  If the age of 65 is to stand, then I suggest that a justice should get the full pension after 25 years' service.  At present the justice must serve 30 years to get the full pension.  The average age of appointment is in or around 40, so that it is not possible for a justice who is appointed at the age of 40 ever to reach the full maximum pension, which I think is two-thirds of the salary.  I would prefer that the age be extended.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggested increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court.  I am afraid that something terrible has happened to either Deputy Dillon or myself, because for the first time since I came in here, I find myself in perfect agreement with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Every question of title within a certain limit of valuation could be safely left to the District Court. There is another important matter which affects district justices, and it is this.  If a district justice serves with distinction and satisfaction, he should be eligible for promotion to the Circuit Court if, and only if, he had been a barrister before he became a district justice.  If he had first been a solicitor and was appointed a district justice, no matter how distinguished he may have been, no matter how great a jurist, he could never be appointed to the Circuit Court, because the qualification for appointment there is ten years practising as a barrister.  I suggest that qualification should be ten years as a barrister or as a solicitor.  Both should be placed on the same footing and I do not think there would be any objection <Col N="188" /> if that were done; I am almost satisfied there would be no objection from the Bar if the Minister were to make that alteration and I think the alteration should be made in this Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the District Court clerks, mentioned by Deputy Dillon, I am not so satisfied that that could be dealt with in this Bill.  I think it comes within the Court Officers Act.  No matter what Act it comes under, I am in perfect agreement with Deputy Dillon that they should be put on a much better basis and they should have pension rights.  It would not be an unusual thing for a Minister for Justice to exert pressure on the Minister for Finance.  I know he has done that before.  Probably he has done it already in the case of the District Court clerks.  I do not think he waited for Deputy Dillon or anyone else to suggest it to him.  If it were represented to the Minister for Finance that all sections of the House would support the proposal, something might come of it.  These men are as much entitled to a pension as other public officials and they should have it.</P>

The whole local government code is about to be operated on the basis of a limit of 65 years.</P>

      <P>The main reason why I argue against an extension beyond 65 years is the growing tendency in industrial and commercial life to retire servants at 65&mdash;and it is a very proper tendency, too.  First of all, it is the time of life when an individual might expect to retire, always bearing in mind he is in a position to do so and, secondly, it gives an opportunity to younger men to get promotion which would otherwise be denied them. Deputy O'Connor made quite a good point with reference to the retirement of district justices at 65.  There might be a hardship.  When I suggest retirement at 65, I envisage that there will be a proper scale of superannuation so as to ensure that the man will be in a position to spend the rest of his days above the stage of want.  Deputy O'Connor suggests that because of his comparatively late entry into the service, the district justice will be precluded at 65 from getting the maximum pension under the present code.  There is a very good case there for altering that section, but, taking one thing with the other, I hope the Minister will urge, because of the tendency in the country to regard 65 as the normal age of retirement, that this Bill should not be chosen as the one to make the exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in complete agreement with a plea made by Deputy Dillon with reference <Col N="190" /> to the District Court clerks.  I know a number of these people throughout the country and, when we refer to the excellent work done by district justices&mdash;and I am quite prepared to pay them that tribute, that they are playing a very important part in the social life of the community&mdash;I think Deputies will agree that a very large slice of that excellence would be missing if it were not for the machinery provided by the District Court clerks. These men are well educated and they usually have a good store of local knowledge.  Not infrequently is the clerk regarded as the adviser of the district justice.  It is monstrous that an individual of that character, who is regarded as occupying an important State post, should be deprived of pension rights.  If the district justice is entitled to permanency and security, these things should equally flow to the individual who is helping him in the discharge of his duties.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor suggested that while this may be quite outside the purview of this Bill, an expression of opinion from all sections of the House might induce the Minister to submit a good case to the Minister for Finance So far as the members of this Party are concerned, I can convey the assurance to the Minister that we are deeply impressed by that aspect of the matter and we would be very glad to see him taking that step.</P>
    <P>As regards the jurisdiction of the court, I find myself in perfect agreement with Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Connor.  Since it is the poorer sections of the people who are mostly affected by the present limit of jurisdiction, I feel a good case can be made for raising the figure of £25, even to the figure suggested by Deputy Dillon, which I think is practicable.  The arbitrary figure of £25 should be removed because it will make for cheaper litigation and it will lower the cost to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would mean cheaper justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. There are certain matters to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. I am in agreement with Deputy <Col N="191" /> O'Sullivan that the age limit should be 65 years.  It is a good thing that justices should have to retire at 65.  At the same time, I feel that better provision should be made for pensions for justices.  You look for an experienced man.  The more experience he has the better district justice he will be.</P>
      <P>I am rather disappointed that there is not some provision made in this Bill dealing with jurisdiction.  For some time I have been asking the Minister to introduce a Bill to increase jurisdiction, as has been suggested in the debate to-day.  From a commonsense point of view, there appears to be no good reason why the jurisdiction of the District Courts should not be increased, particularly in contract and tort.  There is no reason, for instance, why an assault action involving £12 damages could not be tried in the District Court when cases involving up to £10 can be tried in that way.  If the jurisdiction of District Courts were increased, the Minister would go a long way towards reducing the cost of litigation and towards providing a much better service for the people, particularly the poorer elements in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I should like to see pleadings abolished in the Circuit Court, except in some specified cases.  Under our present code, there is a number of meaningless pleadings, such as entering an appearance, and serving notice of trial.  In the old County Court days, when procedure was practically the same as in the District Court to-day, a civil bill was issued.  There was no question of pleadings and in that way a good deal of money in charges and counsels' fees was saved.  To-day the Circuit Court and solicitors' offices are packed with files covering every case. In my opinion, and in the opinion of most of my colleagues, many of these pleadings are absolutely unnecessary. All that leads to extra cost and extra work which ultimately comes back on the litigant.  I suggest to the Minister that, except in some specified cases in which certain pleadings may be necessary, the ordinary rules governing the District Court, under which you can serve notice for particulars and get any particulars you require, should also <Col N="192" /> apply in the Circuit Court and that he should abolish many of the expensive and, to my mind, useless, pleadings.</P>
    <P>It has been generally agreed that the District Courts of this country have been the most successful in our whole code.  There is not so much agreement on the position of the Circuit Court. We have continual complaints that litigation in the Circuit Court is far too expensive for the ordinary man in the street and, to everybody's knowledge, a simple matter of right of way involves a civil bill being issued in the Circuit Court with all the attendant charges of witnesses' and engineers' expenses.  The result is that the families involved in that dispute are liable to be beggared for the rest of their lives by the cost of that simple title action.  The simplest form of action is a title action because generally it involves solely a question of fact.  Generally it involves, if it is a question of right of way, simply bringing in some old persons to say they saw the particular road or path used by their predecessors in title over a great number of years.  Generally there is no complicated question of law at issue.  To my mind there is no reason why a District Court should not be in a position to deal with questions of title. There is no reason why the ordinary countryman should not be able to go to the District Court and have his dispute about a title, a fence or right of way determined there at the scale costs obtaining in the District Court.</P>
    <P>In connection with Section 22 of this Bill, I am at a loss to understand it. I know that there were doubts expressed as to which court should issue the order but I think this particular section, if it is left as it is, will possibly make confusion more confounded. The section says that where an appeal from the District Court in any matter is determined by the Circuit Court, then, unless the Circuit Court has issued the instrument necessary to enforce its decision, the District Court shall issue the said instrument&mdash;unless the Circuit Court has issued it, the District Court will issue it.  I can see in practice how that is going to lead to much confusion, because the ordinary practice is that where you have an appeal from the District Court determined <Col N="193" /> by the Circuit Court the solicitors in the case lodge their order for approval with the county registrar and the costs have to be taxed, and so forth.  I could imagine it happening that where an order of the Circuit Court on an appeal was lodged with a county registrar for approval and for taxation of the costs, you possibly would have the District Court in the meantime issuing an order.  So that you might arrive at a position where you would have, arising out of this confusion, two orders issued.  I think the Circuit Court as the court that finally determines the matter is the proper authority to issue the order. Furthermore, the county registrar is present in the Circuit Court, or one of the staff, when the particular appeal is heard and he will have first hand knowledge of the order of the judge and a note of the order of the judge. The suggestion here that the order might be issued by the District Court would mean that the District Court clerk would have to go to the county registrar's office to ascertain what had transpired at the appeal, to get the particulars and then to issue his own order.  In order to have finality in the matter, to avoid confusion, I think the Minister should determine in this Bill that it is the District Court and the District Court only that will issue the order or that it is the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court only that will issue the order.  The section as it stands may lead to much confusion and on Committee Stage I will ask the Minister to consider that aspect of it and to make the position clear for the future.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, when replying, to indicate to the House as to when the proposed new Courts of Justice Bill will be introduced dealing with these matters of jurisdiction. Finally I would ask him to consider this matter: It is generally accepted that the High Court on circuit has been a very great success, that it fills a great gap in the procedure as we knew it.  It is going back to the position we had in former days.  We find in practice that there is general satisfaction with the position that the High Court judges go on circuit and hear appeals from the Circuit Court.  As <Col N="194" /> some Deputies have pointed out, one of the main causes of the high cost of litigation is witnesses' expenses.  There is genuine hardship at the present time, say, in a running-down case or negligence action in which persons from a remote part of the country are involved.  A person who is struck by a car, perhaps a poor man, has to take proceedings in the High Court and the trial is heard in Dublin.  In order to prove his case, that poor working man or small farmer has to take a number of medical men to Dublin who may possibly have to stay in Dublin four or five days before the case is heard. There will be engineers and a number of other witnesses in addition, and he is not in a position financially to pay these gentlemen, who, in some cases, will not travel, unless a certain amount of money by way of viaticum is given to them before they leave home.  In order to obviate that great hardship, the Minister should allow the High Court on circuit to hear actions of this type.  It would not involve any great change in the procedure because the senior counsel on these particular circuits will be there at the time and these people will be enabled to have their actions tried in their native counties and in many cases it would lessen the cost to litigants.</P>
    <P>It is a common experience in the country that, although a man may have a good action, he may not be in a position, because of these expenses, to come to Dublin, bringing all these witnesses with him, and prove his case. In many cases, these men, who possibly would be entitled to a verdict of £400 or £500, have to be advised to limit their claims to £300, so that they can proceed in the Circuit Court and have their actions tried without going to the expense of bringing medical witnesses, engineers and so on to Dublin.  The whole system of the administration of justice from the cost point of view should be seriously considered by the Minister, and, as soon as he is in a position to do so, I suggest that he should introduce a Bill making the changes in jurisdiction which have been suggested.  If he does so, he will have gone a very long way towards meeting the difficulties with which the ordinary <Col N="195" /> man is confronted in the matter of litigation to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no desire to intervene in this debate, but there has been a line-up on the question of jurisdiction. If we are to increase the jurisdiction from £25 which was fixed in the Courts of Justice Act of 1923, to £100, it can be asked why we should stop at £100.  Surely there must have been some valid reason for fixing that limit. If you fix a higher sum, you introduce actions which are very complicated and it will mean the creation of accounting machinery in the District Court to handle these cases.  Are we prepared, when we talk about cheap litigation, and, on the pretext of giving cheap litigation, urge the raising of the jurisdiction, to set up new machinery in the District Court for dealing with it? Every Act passed here means more cost, and, if we increase the jurisdiction, it means setting up in the District Court accounting machinery to deal with the complicated matters which will come before it arising out of that increased jurisdiction.  The same applies to matters of title.  It will be necessary to have a central office for each county because the District Court will not have an office to deal with these matters.  Surely nobody will suggest that that machinery should be set up, with all the additional cost it would involve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies seem to be very tender skinned with regard to the cost of litigation. My experience of litigants is that, when they want to go to law, they will go, irrespective of the cost, and it would be wise to have some restraining influence on certain people because it is very difficult to keep them from litigation.  Even when advised by their legal advisers, they cannot be restrained. In order not to overload the District Court with complicated matters involving the setting up of accounting machinery, the District Court jurisdiction should be kept at a reasonable figure.  It is supposed to be the poor man's court, but very few poor men enter into transactions in excess of a value of £25.  The amount usually involved is from £5 to £15.  The cow which a man buys and sells runs about <Col N="196" /> £15; the bullock, the calf and the heifer may run from £5 to £12; the value of his pony may be £20 in wartime but normally is £10.  If one looks at it broadly and keeps in mind that the District Court is the poor man's court, the limit of £25 is quite reasonable and avoids the setting up of elaborate machinery to deal with matters arising out of any increase in that limit.</P>
    <P>With regard to the age of retirement, Deputy O'Sullivan based his case on the analogy of the civil servant but, if he thought about it, he would realise that there is no analogy.  I am not particularly perturbed about the age at which a district justice retires, but the fact is that a civil servant enters the service at any age from 17 to 22 and consequently spends his whole life in a very tedious, laborious and confined job, whereas the man who is appointed a district justice is not appointed until he has reached the age of 40 years or over.  With a retiring age of 65, he gives 20 years' service and may be a very fresh man when he retires.  Many civil servants are only at their best at the time they retire, but they are men who have been confined by nature to their vocation so long that they are unable to develop any hobbies and they totter about the streets and in a couple of years have the appearance of men of 80.  It would be much better for the normal healthy man, including the civil servant, to remain until he was 70 or whatever age at which he liked to go, provided he had a virile mind and was active.  It would be a very wise provision to extend the age limit to 70.</P>
    <P>I should like to reinforce what Deputy Cosgrave said with regard to the division of the work.  I take it the Minister referred to the division of business into classes&mdash;criminal, civil and juvenile.  I take it that that is what is meant by the section, but it would certainly be very wrong if the Minister should assign any particular case to a particular justice.  If it is merely a question of dividing the business into criminal, civil and juvenile, there is no objection to it, but it would be very serious if the Minister were to retain the power to assign any particular case or classes of cases to a particular district justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> I should like the Minister to explain the arrangement for enforcing decrees arising out of cases that originate in the District Court.  There should be specific machinery for that purpose, and no wobbling about having it enforced either by the District Court clerk or the county registrar of the Criminal Court.  There should be no misunderstanding about the position.  It should be left to the county registrar to enforce an appeal when it went from the District Court to the Circuit Court. At present a decree would be enforced by the District Court clerk in one case and in another case by the county registrar.  Coming to the position of District Court clerks these men have to eventually retire from active work connected with that position.  The duties make it necessary that they should be pretty active men.  In view of the onerous and confidential work that they perform, it would be prudent that they should be protected by having pensions. The administration of justice should be above suspicion, and the men who administer it should be above reproach. Accordingly they should be put into a position to protect their integrity.</P>
    <P>When it came to considering the position of officers who, in the main, work the machinery, why was an exception made in their case?  It seems to be very ungrateful when men reach 65 or 67 years of age that they have to retire without recognition.  Something should be done to deal with their case.  When so much is done to protect the integrity of the law, we should not stop in the case of officials who have rendered loyal service.  I am in favour of steps being taken to deal with them, because I consider that the gap that now exists should be closed.  Nationally I consider it bad to treat them as they have been treated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is largely concerned with matters affecting the District Court.  So far as it is possible to extract any principle from the Bill, which would be the subject matter of discussion on Second Reading, the principle appears to be contained in the tendency, which I seem to get from the general provisions of the Bill&mdash; coupled with the attitude of Ministers <Col N="198" /> in recent discussions&mdash;to regard the District Court as something apart from the general judicial system; something that is really, or that in the opinion of the Department of Justice ought to be a sub-department of the Department of Justice.  It appears to me that in this Bill there is a tendency to gain greater control by the Department of Justice over not merely the activities of the court but the very members of the court itself.  So far as that principle is contained in the Bill, and so far as there is a tendency in that direction, I would be opposed to any such principle or tendency.</P>
      <P>The Minister may not recall, but many of the principal officers will have a clear recollection of the somewhat acrimonious dispute which arose in 1926 between his predecessor, the late Kevin O'Higgins, and the late Chief Justice Kennedy over that very point, the tendency of the Department to interfere unduly, as the late Chief Justice Kennedy put it, &ldquo;in the affairs of the court.&rdquo;  A formula was discovered by means of which that dispute was enabled to be prevented from reaching serious proportions.  It appears to me that the matters which gave rise to that dispute are contained in some of the provisions of this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister or the officers of the Department do not fully realise it.  At the same time, it is a matter of fundamental importance to the citizens, that the line between the judicial functions and the executive or administrative functions should be very clearly specified and marked out.  The independence of the judiciary is a sacred principle, to which everybody subscribes, at least from the lips.  But in many respects there has been a tendency in recent years to abrogate that principle, at least in part, or to make inroads upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no reason why the District Court should not be regarded, and should not be treated in every respect as an integral part of the judicial structure. Judges are supposed, in accordance with the Constitution, to be independent in the exercise of their functions. I have never been able to understand why district justices should be singled out as exceptional or in part <Col N="199" /> exceptional to the principle of independence in the exercise of their functions. Everybody, no matter to what political Party he subscribes, will agree that the District Court has been an outstanding success in connection with the new judicial system which was inaugurated by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  So far as the District Court is concerned it was inaugurated in 1922. The appointment of professional and paid district justices to administer the affairs of what used to be known as the Summary Court, or Petty Sessions Court, was an experiment in a way.  At all events, it was a revolutionary step, particularly taken at the time it was and in the circumstances in which it was taken.  From the earliest stages in 1923, when the first appointments took place, these people have fulfilled their duties conscientiously and with complete independence; and the whole of the District Court system&mdash;as I think it will be admitted by everybody&mdash;has proved itself to be a complete success and has given every satisfaction to the citizens, particularly the poorer citizens who have to have resort to that court. But it is not merely in reference to the civil jurisdiction of the court that the District Court has been a success.  It has a very wide criminal jurisdiction, and speaking generally, that has been exercised with efficiency and with a considerable degree of clemency which has made it a popular court and a court that is regarded by the people as one in which they will get fair play and just dealing in any dispute which arises between the citizens and the State.</P>
    <P>Any step which is likely to interfere, even in the smallest degree, with that confidence which subsists between the ordinary citizen and the courts is one that should not be lightly taken and, unless there is such an overwhelming necessity for interference in the administration of our system of justice by the Government, there should be no step taken to interfere with the administration of the law by the District Courts, with the conduct of their own business, with the regulation of the affairs of their own courts, or with their independence in the exercise of their functions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> Now, here in this Bill we have at least two matters where the independence and authority of the justices to manage the affairs of their own courts may appear, at all events, to be seriously jeopardised.  There is a power in Section 10 for the Minister for Justice to distribute amongst the separate divisions the business to be transacted. The transaction of business in a court of law is primarily and chiefly for the judge sitting, administering the law.  The time when the dispute to which I have referred arose it was strongly contended by the Chief Justice that any interference by a Government Department with the regulation of the affairs of the courts or the manner in which the business of the court should be conducted was an interference with the independence of the judiciary.  So far back as 1924 and certainly in 1936 an effort was made to make a distinction between the tenure of a district justice and that of even a Circuit Court judge, and certainly that of a High Court judge or a Supreme Court judge.  District justices were subjected to a tribunal under the Act of 1936 which would inquire into their conduct when complaint had been made.  No such tribunal exists in the case of a High Court judge, a Supreme Court judge, or even a Circuit Court judge.  The very fact that such a tribunal is set up rather underlines the tendency which, I fear, appears even more pronouncedly in this Bill because in this particular Bill even that protection, which district justices had under the tribunal set up under the 1936 Act, disappears and their conduct and even their health can now be inquired into by a single High Court judge or Supreme Court judge.  I think that is a very bad principle and one which is utterly unnecessary and I think it is a principle upon which we should not insist.  I do not know what case the Minister makes for that particular provision.  Possibly the matter may be more fully debated on the Committee Stage.  But it is a matter to which I think I must draw attention at this stage because it appears to me to make a very serious inroad into the judicial independence of district justices and to take away from them with one hand what has been given to them <Col N="201" /> by the other.  Under Section 19 they appear to be given a tenure of office similar to judges of the Supreme and High Courts.  The tenure of office of a judge of both of those courts is &ldquo;during good behaviour&rdquo; and no High Court or Supreme Court judge can be removed except for stated misbehaviour, and then only on a vote of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is given to them by Section 19 but Section 20 immediately proceeds to take it away and says that they can be removed by a single judge.</P>

      <P>Even so, what is the effect of it in present circumstances? A single judge reports adversely to the Minister on a district justice.  That particular Minister, whether he is the present Minister or some other Minister, in the way in which the Oireachtas is regulated at the moment has a majority vote in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  That majority vote must be straight away put into effect. That is the worst aspect which can be put upon this case.  Look upon it at its best; why should a district justice be subjected to this inquiry? What is the point in reporting if it is not to lead to his removal from office or a reprimand from the Minister?  Is the Minister to do nothing about it? The Minister may, perhaps, in reply give us some assurances that that is not intended.  As it stands at the moment it appears to me to lead inevitably to either of two things, one worse than the other; either a reprimand from the Minister for Justice which, in my view, is very wrong, or <Col N="202" /> else removal from office by a vote of both Houses.  It is not suggested that the matter should be left alone.  What is intended, therefore, when this single judge has inquired?  Single judges, as we know, may vary from time to time and a district justice who happened to get Judge &ldquo;A&rdquo; might be very lucky and another who got Judge &ldquo;B&rdquo; might be extremely unlucky.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If a district justice deserves any reprimand the way is provided by the Constitution.  I do not see any reason for discrimination as between one branch of the judiciary and another.  Why should a district justice be treated differently from a judge of the Supreme Court, of the High Court, or the Circuit Court? There is only a difference in jurisdiction. Each case that is dealt with by a district justice is of supreme importance to the litigant and, for the litigant, it is the only case that exists. The Minister may, perhaps, give me some reason for the necessity for this procedure differing, as it does, from the Circuit Court.  I see no reason for it. The district justice deals far more intimately and is far more closely in contact with the lives of the poorest and least fortunate people in the country who are subjected to criminal jurisdiction.  He deals far more with the lives rather than with the property of the ordinary people.  Why should he be placed in a degraded position in the judicial system?  That is the plea I <Col N="203" /> make as a matter of principle.  I have no interest whatever in any particular individual on the District Court bench.</P>
      <P>At the present moment 90 per cent. of the personnel of the District Court has been appointed by the present Government in the last 14 years, and appointed very largely for political reasons.  I take no account of that.  I am speaking of principle.  No matter who appoints them, or no matter for what reason they are appointed, the principle for which I plead is a principle embodied in the Constitution of 1922 and carried over into the present Constitution; that is the principle of the independence of the judiciary. That principle should apply equally throughout the entire judicial system. I see no reason why the Minister or the Department of Justice should interfere with the Dublin District Court any more than it should interfere with the conduct or powers of the Supreme Court under the Chief Justice, or those of the High Court under the President.  With these few general observations on the principles embodied in this Bill, I would like now to pass to a few observations on some of the details.  They can be more properly dealt with on the Committee Stage.  I shall endeavour to deal with the Bill in the manner in which a Bill should be dealt with on Second Reading, namely, on the principles contained in it.  The principles, so far as they can be extracted from the various details, tend in the general direction to which I have adverted.  Section 5 of Part II of the Bill deals with the Dublin District Court.  The business transacted in the Dublin District Court is becoming of extreme importance to the Dublin citizen and even to the rest of the country.  It has increased out of all proportion to what people thought would have to be dealt with in that court since the district justices were appointed or the then metropolitan magistrates obtained the status of district justices.  The business has increased enormously.  It is, therefore, of the utmost importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why it was necessary to have these three divisions which are contained in the Bill dealing with the <Col N="204" /> Dublin District Court.  Doubtless the Minister, when introducing the Bill, gave the reasons for the system proposed in Section 5, but, unfortunately, I was not able to be present.  I should like, however, to direct the Minister's attention to one or two matters in connection with the Dublin District Court. The first is that, so far as I can see, the scheme in Section 5 appears to have lost one cog in the machine; it will not work.  The matter can be set right on the Committee Stage.  There is a provision in Section 5 that the division shall consist of a principal justice and two ordinary justices of the division.  Section 6 then provides that the principal justice of the division shall be nominated by the Minister from amongst the Dublin metropolitan justices.  A further part of the section provides that each ordinary justice is to be nominated from amongst the Dublin metropolitan justices. There are only three metropolitan justices at the moment.  There are to be three divisions, and each principal of a division is to be appointed from the Dublin metropolitan justices. There is nothing left.  Perhaps the Minister may consider that matter.  It seems to me that the machinery here misses something.  There are to be three divisions, and each division is to have as its head a person from the existing metropolitan justices.  There are only three of them and, therefore, when the three existing justices are exhausted, there is nobody who can be appointed to the six other vacancies. The Minister did make a statement to me, in the course of the discussion on the Department of Justice Estimate, that it was intended that these people who are acting at the moment as assistant justices in the Dublin District Court would be appointed permanent district justices. They may be appointed permanent district justices, as I hope they will be, in accordance with the Minister's statement, but where is the power to appoint them Dublin metropolitan justices?  Perhaps the Minister will refer me to it in the course of his reply, or look into the matter between this and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have already referred the Minister to the objection I have to Section 10:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" />&ldquo;The business of the District Court... shall be distributed amongst the several divisions in such manner as the Minister may from time to time direct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the power contained in that section, if passed into law, the entire business of the District Court is under the direction of a Government Department.  The late Chief Justice Kennedy objected to a similar provision in the Courts Officers Act, 1926, or an analogous provision, if not a similar one, and made a very public and strong protest against it at the time.  I do not wish to continue any such dispute between the judiciary and the Government Department concerned. I have no interest either in the judiciary or the Government Department except that of an ordinary Deputy endeavouring to see that the administration of justice is carried out, as I think it ought to be carried out, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  I had a very large part to play in connection with the dispute at that time between the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins and the late Chief Justice and succeeded in resolving the problem.  I do not want to see that again.  Apart from not wishing to see any friction between the judiciary and the Minister or the executive arm of the Government, I think it is a serious inroad into the principle of the independence of the judiciary.  A judge, whether he belongs to the lower ranking section of the judicial hierarchy or the higher, ought to have control of his own court.  If he has not control, through the exercise by politicians of control, of the business of his own court, his functions may be seriously interfered with and his independence sapped.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the age of retirement.  I see no question of principle involved in that.  I find it a little difficult to understand why a district justice should have to retire at 65, while a Supreme Court judge, a High Court judge and a Circuit Court judge can go on until he is 72.  I do know that the Dublin metropolitan justices are subjected to a far more serious strain in the exercise of their judicial duties than perhaps the other <Col N="206" /> district justices throughout the country. But I think that is a matter which ought to be taken into account by seeing that they are not overworked and, not being overworked, that they should be allowed to remain on, if they are in good health and their intellect survives the strain, until the same age as the Circuit Court judges and the other judicial personages.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one matter to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention and ask for serious and, perhaps, sympathetic consideration of it.  May I mention here that I am not speaking at the request of any individual?  I am speaking entirely on my own responsibility.  Sub-section (2) of Section 14 provides that, although the general age of retirement for a justice is henceforth to be 65, &ldquo;every person who is, immediately before the operative date, a Dublin metropolitan justice or a justice permanently assigned to the district comprising or including the County Borough of Cork, shall be 70 years.&rdquo;  I should like to make a plea in this respect for those persons on whose behalf I have frequently spoken before in this House on the Estimate for the Department of Justice, namely, those persons who were appointed assistant justices and who did not get what they were entitled to expect they would have got, namely, promotion from the ranks of assistant justice to permanent justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about that.  At all events, for a number of years these people were not appointed district justices.  The Minister did, in reply to me, state during the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Justice last year, and he repeated it, I think, this year, that it was his intention to appoint these assistant district justices in Dublin to be permanent justices.  I am speaking not merely for the Dublin assistant justices, but for assistant justices formerly working throughout the country who, perhaps, may have been temporarily assigned to Dublin.  Originally they were operating throughout the <Col N="207" /> country.  By force of circumstances and the increase in the business of the Dublin District Court, they became allocated to the Dublin District Court, but they did not come within the description, as I understand it, of a Dublin metropolitan justice.  I may be wrong in that, but I think I am not. If these people, who were assistant justices, do not come within the description of Dublin metropolitan justices in sub-section (2), they should be given the right to remain on in the position, subject to the overriding considerations of good conduct and good health, until the age of 70.  Those men were left on a low salary.  They were appointed originally at £800 a year.  It was only after a considerable number of years their salaries were increased to £900.  As regards pensions, they have lost during those years a fair amount of money; it would amount to a considerable capital sum if it were totted up.  I wish the Minister would consider those cases, in addition to a case for the Dublin metropolitan justices, of whom, so far as I know, there are only three.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a provision with which I am in thorough agreement, that there shall be no more assistant justices.  But the Bill lacks a provision that I would like to see inserted in it, a provision limiting the number of temporary justices.  The Minister has repeatedly said that he agreed with me that the appointment of a number of temporary justices is a very bad principle.  The principle has been so much extended in recent years that I was informed&mdash;and I raised the matter during the discussion on the Department of Justice Estimate this year&mdash;that it would appear to be the practice now that no person can hope, in the ordinary course of events, to be appointed as a permanent district justice unless he first serves a term as a temporary justice.  That, in my view, is an extremely bad and vicious principle. It means, in relation to a temporary justice, that unless, when he is being tried out, he toes the line, in accordance with what the particular authorities who happen to be there may wish him to do, he is liable not to be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> I am making no aspersions on the administration of the Minister's Department; I am raising this matter purely as a question of principle.  That is fundamentally what is wrong.  That is what was wrong with the removable magistrates in the British days; they were removable because they did not do what they were told to do.  If you have a temporary justice whose prospect of becoming permanent depends on the way he conducts himself during his tenure as temporary district justice, that lays itself open to very serious considerations which are contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>I understand from Deputy McMenamin's speech, and from what I was told, that the question of increasing the jurisdiction of the District Courts was raised.  It did not appear to me that that question would arise on the Bill, but it has arisen and I would like to make my profession of faith on that particular matter.  I will repeat what I heard a well-known Supreme Court judge stating from the bench on the first occasion on which he sat after the putting into operation of the provisions of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, when all appeals from the Circuit Court were re-heard by the High Court on circuit at a full re-hearing.  The system was changed from an appeal on notes from the Circuit Court to the High Court to a system whereby the appeal was from the Circuit Court to the High Court on circuit, the appeal being on a full re-hearing.</P>
    <P>This judge, who certainly can be said to be eminent in his profession of the law and in his profession as a judge, said, in the course of his observations in opening the court, what appealed to me&mdash;and I shall never forget it, as I was rather against the change from the system in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  One of the reasons for that change was that the bringing of the High Court and Supreme Court judges near to the homes of the people would bring to them, first of all, within the reach of small cases, the judges of the High Court in this country, and the ordinary country litigant would have the opportunity of presenting his case in person to a High Court judge or a Circuit Court judge and have his case <Col N="209" /> heard and determined locally and that would result in respect for the law and bringing home to the people the fact that the law was the law of the people, their own law, and it would induce respect for the law and the courts and the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>If the jurisdiction that exists now is increased in civil cases from £25 to £50, that will take away from the jurisdiction of the High Court on circuit the vast majority of cases heard before these judges, and it will take away from the ordinary people and put into the pockets of a few solicitors practising in the country, some little additional costs and it will take from the ordinary person the right to have his case retried before a High Court or Supreme Court judge.  The vast majority of cases in the country are under £50.  If the jurisdiction is increased from £25 the position will be that necessarily these cases will be heard by district justices, with a possible appeal to a Circuit Court judge, and there will be no possibility of the majority of cases arising in the country being determined by a High Court or Circuit Court judge.</P>
    <P>It may be there is nothing in what I have said, that the bringing of the High Court or Circuit Court judge to the people and letting the ordinary person have his small case about a right of way, a dispute with his neighbour, an assault case, or anything of that nature, heard by one of the most eminent judges in the country.  It may be held that that may not bring about respect for the law, but that that aspect did appeal to me.  It affects little the members of the profession to which I belong whether the jurisdiction of the District Court is increased or decreased, but it may affect a litigant in the manner I have mentioned.  He likes to have his case heard by the High Court judge or the Supreme Court judge&mdash;the judge coming down from Dublin.  I have some experience of dealing with country cases.  Take that away from the countryman and you possibly take away something which is of value along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>The last matter I want to mention has reference to pensions for District Court clerks.  I would like to raise my <Col N="210" /> voice in support of those people.  A good case has been made on their behalf and I do not intend to take up the time of the House in reiterating what already has been said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The closing remarks of the last speaker bore out the views I hold and that I wished to put before the Minister, with reference to pensions for District Court clerks.  The number in the country is very small; I am informed it is about 23.  They give their time and service to the country the same as other officials and they are the only section who have not been granted pensions.  I wish to add my voice to the voices of those who mentioned the desirability of granting these men pensions.  This is a very suitable time to do that.  A number of of clerks will be retiring in the near future&mdash;three or four, I think.  If legislation dealing with this matter is to be brought in in the future, it will never cover these men and it will mean that they will go out without pensions. Legislation may be introduced in a short time, but if it is not embodied in this Bill it will not cover these cases. Now is the most appropriate time to meet the cases in that small and very deserving section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically every Deputy referred to the District Court clerks.  They could not be dealt with in this Bill&mdash;that is a matter for the Court Officers Bill, I understand.  I have been speaking to the Minister for Finance about these clerks and he cannot separate them from the position of other temporary clerks in the service. There is a difficulty about court clerks in this way, that the practice is, as far as possible, to amalgamate different clerkships and different court areas when vacancies arise and try to make the clerkship worth while.  There are remote areas where a District Court is held where it would be impossible to have them amalgamated and where the clerk is simply a part-time man.  There are difficulties of that kind.  In any case, that is not a matter for this Bill. I will bear in mind all that has been said by Deputies on the subject and see if anything can be done but I am <Col N="211" /> afraid the big obstacle is that there are temporary officials all over the service who will have to be taken into consideration.  That is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  He is not prepared, as far as I can see, to separate the question from that of the general question of temporary civil servants.</P>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand Deputy Costello's statement about the way we are treating district justices in this Bill.  I should have imagined that we have improved their status.  There was always a distinction made between the District Courts and other courts. It did not start in our time.  Under the 1924 Act it was on the report of that committee that a district justice could be dismissed.  For some reason, it did not say who was to dismiss him. I think that was an oversight&mdash;it was a hastily drafted Act&mdash;but it was understood to be the Government and, in the 1936 Act, they put it in.  The same machinery was there and, in that way, there was a clear distinction drawn between the position of a district justice and the position of a judge of the Circuit Court or the High Court. That is being remedied by Section 19.</P>
      <P>All we are proposing to do under Section 20 is to give the Minister for Justice the right to ask the Chief Justice to nominate a judge to inquire into matters which he would want to have inquired into and to make a report on the facts to him.  In the other case, a certificate from that committee was sufficient to enable the Government, without coming to the two Houses of the Oireachtas, to dismiss him.  I think that is a very big improvement in the status and tenure of a district justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies objected to the reduction of the retiring age to 65.  Some Deputies approved of it.  I think it was very necessary that there should be the same retiring age for district justices, that is, 65 everywhere except in Dublin and Cork. Those who know the work of the district justices know that they have to travel in all weathers to all parts of the country far more often than the Circuit Court judge and that in Dublin <Col N="212" /> their work is of such a strenuous nature that when a district justice comes to the age of 65 he will find it hard to keep up with the pace that is required. I admit that there is a case, which I will put to the Minister for Finance, to try to do something about reducing the time in which he would be entitled to the maximum pension.  There is a case for that and I will see if I can do anything about it but I certainly think that 65 is a reasonable age considering the onerous nature of the work they have to do.</P>
    <P>Practically every Deputy, with a few exceptions, was in favour of extending the jurisdiction of the District Court. Deputy Costello and, I think, Deputy McMenamin are not.  Deputy McGilligan is always saying that the £1 now is worth only 10/-.  Even from that point of view, I think there is need to consider the whole question of jurisdiction. Of course, that matter will arise under a Courts of Justice Bill.  I cannot say when we will have that Bill ready.  I do not think it will be ready for the next session.  The whole matter can be discussed on that Bill.  I think Deputy Dillon suggested it should go up to £100 and should include questions of title.  That whole question can be dealt with when the Bill comes before the House.  I have not it ready yet.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy O'Connor's suggestion, I think things are bad enough, that there is enough congestion and difficulty in Dublin, without increasing it.  That is why we had to have the arrangement to divide the work into three parts, but I do not know what would be the position if we were to bring in the county in addition.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connor spoke about solicitors in the District Court, and proposed that if they have acted as district justices they should be eligible for promotion.  That would be a matter for another Bill and would not arise on this Bill.  Deputy O'Sullivan made the same point.  He wants the retiring age kept at 65 and thinks there should be some provision made for reducing the time in which they can become eligible for maximum pension. As I have said, there is something in that and I will see if I can get something done about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran had a good deal to say about pleadings.  I think I am right in saying that that is more a matter for the Rules of Court than for any Bill.  I think the rule-making authority should be approached on a matter of that kind.  He also dealt with the question of increased jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the point made about the independence of the judiciary, I simply cannot understand how Deputy Costello can say that we are in any way trying to interfere with that.  We are not in any way.  Surely, if there is a question of allocating the work, the person who is really responsible in the long run to the Oireachtas is the Minister for Justice.  When questions are addressed to him about the court, he is responsible.  If he is satisfied on examination of the whole position that a change is necessary, and if there is a question as to the place in which the courts are to be held and the type of work&mdash;not the particular cases, but the type of cases&mdash;that should be dealt with by particular justices, there is nobody in a better position than the Minister for Justice would be to allocate that. How that can be called an interference or an attempt at interference with the independence of the judiciary, I certainly cannot see.  As a matter of fact, <Col N="214" /> as I pointed out already, we are making the position of the district justice more secure, because he cannot now be dismissed by the Government on the report of any committee; he has got to be brought to both Houses, where every Deputy and Senator will have a chance of saying what he has to say on the matter.  I think most of the other points are really Committee points.</P>

In the case of a judge of the Supreme Court, or any other judge, that is the only thing that can be done, whereas, in this case, we might be in the position that we could not get a resignation from a man who might be two or three years ill and perhaps not in a condition to resign. There is no way of dismissing him other than by coming to the House.  If we could get some impartial judicial person to investigate his illness and make a report to us as to whether he was likely to recover or to be able to do his duty, it would be a solution.  There was a case raised some time ago by Deputies on the opposite side in which I would have liked to have had that power.  I would very much have liked to have been able to get a judge to go down and make investigations on the spot into the complaints raised here.  It would have been very valuable indeed. Under this provision, the Minister will at least have this much: he will have the report of an independent person, a High Court judge, whom no one can accuse of having any bias, who will have inquired into all the circumstances on the spot, and in taking whatever action he takes, having got <Col N="215" /> that report, he will feel more secure than if he were to act on any other kind of report he might get.  In that way, it is even an added safeguard for the district justice.</P>

      <P>I had this matter brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance who is the Minister most directly concerned.  It seems clear that the revocation of the Order is not practicable.  I raised with him the question which was discussed here, namely, whether it was necessary to suspend the operation of the 1929 Act in its entirety because of the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus, and discussed the possibility of amending the Order with a view to limiting its effect to retirements consequential on the stabilisation of the bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, it must be noted that alterations in the conditions of employment of transferred officers, consequential upon emergency conditions, are not confined to stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus.  There were certain other changes&mdash;perhaps of minor importance but nevertheless changes&mdash;which might be used by a transferred officer to claim the right to retire on Article 10 terms.  An illustration <Col N="216" /> is the prolongation of working hours which, in part, still continues and will continue, I understand, until October next.  Furthermore, the examination of the matter which it was possible to effect during the past week did not make it clear that a transferred officer claiming to retire under the Act of 1929 in consequence of some alteration in his conditions of employment, other than the stabilisation of the bonus, or the prolongation of working hours, might not have his pension awarded by the tribunal on a basis which did not take into account the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus which, if that happened, would obviously create a situation of difficulty and embarrassment for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The most I can say, therefore, on the matter is that while it is not possible to agree to the amendment which seeks to revoke the Order in its entirely, the Minister for Finance will consider to what extent it is possible to amend the Order between now and the appointed day under the Bill, with a view to limiting its operation in such manner as to cover cases like those I have mentioned.  It will be possible under Section 3 to amend a continuing Government Order between now and the appointed day, and if the Minister for Finance decides that amendment is practicable, it will be effected.  I cannot, however, undertake to say that the amendment is practicable, because it is obvious that legal considerations are involved which will require some examination, greater examination than it has been possible to give up to the present.  There is, however, a general feeling that, if legal difficulties can be avoided, it is desirable that the Order should be amended so as to permit a transferred officer to avail of the provisions of the 1929 Act where the circumstances of his employment are altered to his detriment otherwise than in a manner which applies to the Civil Service as a whole, such as the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus or the alteration of working hours.  I do not know whether this statement of mine meets with the approval of the Deputy&mdash;probably not&mdash;but it indicates the furthest extent to which it is possible to go, namely, an undertaking to <Col N="217" /> examine the possibility of amending the Order in the manner I have indicated, if it should prove to be feasible to do so, without creating fresh legal difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 24, to add at the end of sub-section (1) the words and figures &ldquo;provided that nothing in this section shall be construed as continuing in force, after the operative date, the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 30) Order, 1940.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, both in this Bill and the Industrial Relations Bill, the details of which I do not intend to advert to, the Minister is the instrument of Government policy.  He says in respect of the Industrial Relations Bill: &ldquo;I propose now to signalise the end of the emergency, so far as wage control is concerned, by revoking the Wages Standstill Order, and allowing the operation of the free play of collective bargaining as between the workers organised in unions, on the one hand, and employers organised in employers' organisations, on the other.&rdquo;  In order that that collective bargaining will be on a kind of order basis, he offers to both sides a labour court, which he hopes will overcome the sharpest points of disagreements until there is a normal settling down in the operation of the principle of collective bargaining.  Therefore, the Minister is really saying to the nation: &ldquo;At the end of next month, the Wages Standstill Order goes.  The Government sheds its right to control wages in the way in which that control has been exercised in respect of workers in private employment since May, 1941.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But under this Bill he is taking <Col N="218" /> power to continue the Emergency Powers Order made in 1940, the effect of which is to deny to a limited class of workers, approximately 6,000 in number, the remedy which they had in the 1929 Act, if the Government repudiated its obligations under that Act, that is, to accept the continued employment of persons under the same tenure and under the same conditions as to salaries and wages as they formerly enjoyed.  In other words, while letting out of the wage control part approximately 500,000 workers who were affected by the Wages Standstill Order, the Minister is keeping within the vice of control, all those civil servants, most of whom enjoyed rates of wages which were no higher in many cases, and in some cases less, than the amounts paid workers in private employment.  The Government is doing that by means of the continued application of the cost-of-living bonus stabilisation, and not only that but is preventing those who had a legal remedy against the Government in that respect exercising it under Emergency Powers Order No. 40.  I think that action of the Government is unfair.</P>
    <P>When the former Minister for Finance was in this House in November, 1939, he spoke of the intention of the Government to set its face against what he said were the efforts of any section of the community to improve its position as a result of emergency conditions.  His method of implementing that declaration was to say to civil servants in July, 1940, that they proposed to repudiate the cost-of-living bonus which up to then they were morally and legally bound by.  He said that it was part of the Government's policy to peg down wages on the one hand, and on the other hand intimated that the Government intended to control prices.  Ten months later the Government made Emergency Powers Order No. 83, the effect of which was to impose a standstill on wages in outside employment.  In the period between 1940 and 1941 the Government was definitely unfair to civil servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That situation was rectified since.  I mean the cost-of-living bonus was stabilised at a higher point, the point it would have reached in 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="219" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What would have happened if they had not stabilised the bonus as the Government did in July, 1940?  It would have meant that in July the cost-of-living bonus would be related to the index figure 110, and payment would be based on the figure 110 from July, 1940, until January, 1946.  What the Government did in the matter is, they continued to pay civil servants on the basis of the stabilised figure 85, and it was only in January, 1945, that they stepped up payment to 110.  Every civil servant lost between July, 1940, and December, 1944, the difference between having wages calculated on the index figure 110 and the stabilised figure 85.  It is true that partial restitution was made in January, 1945, but bear in mind that they kept the amount of money which these people would have received between July, 1940, and December, 1944, and they are making no restitution in respect of that.</P>
      <P>My complaint, and it is a widespread complaint in the Civil Service, is that you took civil servants into the net of wage control in July, 1940, and did not apply wage stabilisation to other workers until May, 1941.  Therefore, they got civil servants within the vice ten months earlier than outside workers.  In 1946 the Government said to outside workers: &ldquo;We are letting you out of the vice on the 1st of September, 1946.&rdquo;  But they are still keeping within the vice of wage control, and still repudiating the agreement by which they were morally and legally bound, 30,000 civil servants.  How can they justify putting civil servants within the vice of wage control ten months earlier than workers outside, many of whom are paid much higher? How could they justify keeping lowly-paid civil servants within the vice of wage control after releasing outside workers from that vice?  I think logically the Minister could not defend that policy.  I am sorry the Minister for Finance is not here, so that we could hear what light he could throw on a code of conduct of that kind. Personally, I do not think it could be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his heart I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has had wide experience in matters of this <Col N="220" /> kind, realises that it is not the kind of conduct that could be justified in ordinary industrial employment, and is not the kind of issue anybody could defend in an industrial dispute.  I think the Government are definitely unfair, and that whatever conceptions they have of equity in this matter, they are completely wrong.  The Government is purporting now to release everybody within the State from wage control, except a group of civil servants that is subject to their jurisdiction.  I do not think that could be justified.  I should like to hear the Minister even now, if it is possible, telling us that the Government propose to treat civil servants in the same way as outside workers have been treated in the Industrial Relations Bill, bearing in mind that civil servants have a special claim to treatment, inasmuch as the agreement was honoured when it was particularly onerous to do so and that their wages were stabilised ten months earlier than outside workers' wages.</P>
    <P>I remember a Deputy in 1931 expressing very considerable sympathy with the claim of civil servants when the bonus agreement was operating in such a way that they were suffering successive cuts, and I remember the Deputy being very willing to accompany other Deputies to the Government then in office in order to secure some abatement of the grievances and injustices imposed on civil servants by the operation of that agreement.  I hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, recognising that the facts are as stated, and that civil servants are suffering very considerable hardships, will be prepared to indicate on behalf of the Government the intention to revoke at least the stabilisation Order.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us when the Government is going to come to a decision on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the Deputy is not so much concerned with Emergency Powers (No. 30) Order, to which his amendment relates, as with the question of the stabilisation of the cost of living bonus of civil servants. So far as Emergency Powers (No. 30) Order is concerned, while it is true that it withdraws from transferred officers the protection that they were given <Col N="221" /> under the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Act, 1929, I would not agree that the action of the Government was unfair.  In so far as the principle of the Act of 1929 and of the section under the Treaty of 1932 relates&mdash;that transferred officers should not suffer a worsening of the conditions of their employment&mdash;it cannot be said that that has happened to them as transferred officers.  The effect of the stabilisation of the bonus on them was no different from the effect upon other civil servants and, when considerations of public interest required it and the Government had of necessity to stabilise the bonus, it was obviously necessary that such stabilisation should apply both to transferred officers as well as to other civil servants.  An impossible position would have been created for the Government if the stabilisation applied only to a section of the Civil Service and not to every section.</P>
      <P>I do not want the Deputy to take from anything that I have said on the issue of the stabilisation of the bonus the impression that a decision, one way or the other, has been taken in the matter.  I would not agree that the stabilisation of the bonus in 1940 was unfair to the Civil Service, even though other non-Government employees did not come under the standstill Order until some months later.  I think that if the Deputy will examine statistics relating to wage rates, which are now in course of preparation and will be published shortly, he will find that there was, in fact, very little upward movement of industrial wages during 1940. The civil servants did benefit by the operation of the cost-of-living bonus between the outbreak of hostilities and the date of stabilisation.  Most of the industrial workers whose wages were stabilised in 1941 had, in fact, secured no increase in wages as between the outbreak of hostilities and the date of stabilisation.  However, that is not a matter upon which I shall enter into any controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy put a specific question to me.  He will have an opportunity of putting that question with the better prospects of a reply&mdash;and, may I suggest, greater relevancy&mdash;to the Minister <Col N="222" /> for Finance on item 8 of the Dáil Agenda for to-day.  I suggest he should put that question to the Minister for Finance.  It is obviously his function to speak for the Government on that matter.  The stabilisation of the Civil Service bonus was not affected by an Emergency Powers Order.  It is not affected in any way by the enactment of this Bill and the decision of the Government in relation to it must take account of other factors than the withdrawal of the standstill in relation to the wages and remuneration of non-Government employees.  It is quite clear that the suitability of the present cost-of-living bonus and its method of calculation in the future, having regard to the fundamental change that has taken place in the whole price structure since the cost-of-living bonus was first devised, must also be considered by the Minister for Finance in deciding upon his future course of action in relation to public servants.</P>
    <P>I think that it cannot be contended that Emergency Powers (No. 30) Order must remain in force while the bonus is stabilised.  Apart altogether from the effect of its withdrawal during stabilisation, the Deputy must also consider the matter to which I referred in Committee, namely, the possibility that even after stabilisation has ended it would still be open to transferred officers to apply to retire under the Act of 1929 by reason of the fact that the bonus had been stabilised in the past.  At that stage, when stabilisation ends and when the Emergency Powers (No. 30) Order is no longer required because of the existence of stabilisation, it will be necessary to make some provision then to ensure that the rights of transferred officers will be restored as from that date and that the Government will not have to face the prospect of very substantial retirements by reason of the fact that stabilisation was accomplished in previous years.  For that reason, if for no other, I think this Order must be continued until some permanent legislation has been prepared covering that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word or two on matters which were discussed in Committee and which I undertook to examine.  First, there was the suggestion that Government Orders to be continued should be scheduled to the Bill.  I intimated that that course had been considered, but that the balance of argument appeared to be against it.  I agreed to reconsider the matter but, on reconsideration, I am still of opinion that the balance of argument is against it.  The Government Orders set out in the White Paper are the Orders which, so far as can now be foreseen, will be in force on the 1st September.  It may happen, however, that some situation would arise which would necessitate the continuance of some other Government <Col N="225" /> Order.  If that situation did arise, it could be dealt with by so informing the Dáil.  If we scheduled the Orders and had to deal with that situation, it would necessitate amending legislation. On the other hand, if a Schedule appeared to the Bill, it would be generally understood to express the position as it would exist on the 1st September. It may happen that some Government Orders set out in the White Paper may not be necessary after the 1st September and will be revoked before that date, in which case the Schedule would be misleading.</P>
      <P>The device adopted in drafting the Bill, including the circulation of a White Paper setting out the Orders to be continued, gave an opportunity of indicating briefly the nature of the Orders which would not be possible in a Schedule without risking certain legal complications.  I was also asked whether it was possible to circulate a White Paper setting out the chief Ministerial Orders which will be enforced on the 1st September.  It was stated incorrectly during the course of the discussion in Committee that no index of these Orders exists.  In fact, an index of all such Orders up to 1st January this year was published in March last.  It would not be advisable to publish a White Paper now setting out the principal Ministerial Orders which will be continued after 1st September because many of them will have to be modified or amended and some of them will be revoked before the 1st September.</P>
      <P>If we were to circulate a White Paper now it would be accepted as conveying a picture of the position in regard to Ministerial Orders as it will exist on 1st September.  Instead, therefore, of circulating that White Paper now, I propose to have prepared an official index of such Orders on the 1st September and published shortly after that date, which will be far more satisfactory from the point of view of those concerned with the administration of the law in any capacity, in so far as it will give them a definite and final picture of the Orders in force on the date upon which the Emergency Powers Act lapses and this Bill comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> I was asked to have re-examined the provisions of Section 8 to ensure that they clearly oblige the Government to lay upon the Table of the House, and make subject to annulment by the House, Ministerial Orders whether made under the authority of a Government Order based upon this Bill or under the authority of a continued Government Order made under the Emergency Powers Act.  I am informed there is no ambiguity about the provisions and the Bill clearly provides that all such Orders made by Ministers in the future, whether under the authority of the continued Government Order or not, must be laid before the House and may be annulled by the House.</P>
    <P>I was asked also whether it was necessary to provide in Section 10 that Ministerial Orders and directions have the force of law.  It seems quite obvious that it is not necessary to provide in the Bill that these Orders and directions would have the force of law in any event.  There is no good reason why it should be deleted from the Bill and the second part of that section, which gives these Orders priority over Acts of the Oireachtas where they are in conflict with them, is necessary.  I mentioned, by way of illustration of that necessity, the possibility that we might at some stage decide to reduce the weight of the loaf as in Great Britain.  I do not suggest we will do so.  I am not at all sure that it proved a satisfactory device in Great Britain but, if we should want to do so, clearly the Order reducing the size of the loaf would be in conflict with the permanent legislation relating to the sale of bread and it is therefore necessary to provide that the Order would supersede the permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>We discussed in Committee Emergency Powers (No. 178) Order which removes the six months' time limit on prosecutions under the emergency code.  I think it will be possible to provide in the Bill that the scope of Emergency Powers (No. 178) Order will be restricted to extending the time limit from six months to 12 months.  I was not able to get such an amendment of the Bill framed for the Report Stage.  It may be that legal difficulties will arise in connection <Col N="227" /> with the drafting of the amendment, but, assuming these can be overcome, I will endeavour to have such an amendment inserted in the Bill in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Order at present removes the time limit and substitutes no other time limit.  The effect of the amendment I have in mind will be to alter the time limit from six to 12 months. The Minister for Agriculture is not satisfied, because he thinks that under the compulsory tillage regulations there still may be difficulty in proceeding with prosecutions in the District Court as it is not always possible to complete the inspection of agricultural holdings and get the evidence necessary for proceedings within 12 months from the date of the commission of the offence.  If that should happen, there is always the alternative open to the Government of proceeding by way of indictment.</P>
    <P>These were the matters mentioned on the Committee Stage that I undertook to look into, and I felt it was desirable that I should inform the Dáil of the result of my investigation.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill has two main purposes.  One is to provide a more effective organisation for the prosecution of industrial research, and the other is to formulate standard specifications for industrial commodities, processes and practices.  For these purposes provision is made in the Bill for the establishment and maintenance of an institute for industrial research and standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the institute to be established under the Bill are set out in the Bill and are, firstly, to undertake scientific research and investigation with the object of promoting the utilisation of the natural resources of the State, improving the technical processes and methods used in the industries of the State and discovering technical processes and methods which may promote or facilitate the expansion <Col N="228" /> of existing or the development of new industries, and the utilisation of the waste products of industry. Secondly, to make recommendations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the formulation of standard specifications for commodities and the provision and use of standard marks for commodities which conform to standard specifications.  Thirdly, to test and analyse commodities intended for sale and for use by the public and to publish the results of such tests and analyses.</P>
    <P>Before describing more fully the status and functions of the proposed institute, I should like to review briefly the position in this country with regard to industrial research activities.  Deputies will be aware that the scientific research conducted in our universities includes a certain amount of research work bearing on industry.  Research on manufacturing problems is also carried on as an adjunct to the routine work of testing and analysis in the laboratories of some of our larger industrial concerns, while activities of a research nature are carried on in connection with a number of technical services administered by Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Special steps to organise research activities have already been taken by the Government in the setting up of such bodies as the Industrial Research Council, the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, the Building Research Committee and the provision for an experimental station in connection with turf development.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Research Council was set up in 1934 and is functioning at present.  The general function of the council is to furnish advice or to take such action as may be approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for promoting the use of natural resources and for furthering industrial development by scientific research. The council, the members of which are unpaid, functions under the auspices of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It was established by means of a formal Minute of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and it is intended that it will cease to function as soon as the new body is established under this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> Despite the energy and enthusiasm of the council, the financial arrangements made in relation to its work were not such as to give it the freedom of action which experience has shown to be necessary to implement a useful research programme.  The practice is that the council obtains the approval of the Minister for its general programme and, before work involving expenditure can be undertaken, the sanction of the Minister for Finance is also required.  The council has no laboratory or permanent research staff. Most of its research work has been carried out in the laboratories of the universities.</P>
    <P>In addition to the conduct of research, the council advises the Minister in the administration of a scheme for the annual award of maintenance allowances to students for training in scientific research.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the council's activities is the organisation of a library and an information bureau for the benefit of industrialists and others requiring information on technical matters relating to industry.  That library and bureau service, which enabled information to be regularly furnished on a variety of problems which were presented to industry by the emergency, proved to be of great value to the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Scientific Research Bureau was established in February, 1941, to give the Government technical advice and to conduct research on emergency problems relating to industrial processes and raw materials.  The Dáil is already aware of the valuable work done by the bureau in helping to resolve many of the special problems that arose out of the emergency.  The bureau worked in co-ordination with the Industrial Research Council and took advantage of the council's organisation and experience.  The activities of the bureau were terminated, as the emergency eased, early in 1945.  Since then, the services of the Industrial Research Council have been available in connection with problems arising out of emergency conditions.</P>
    <P>In December of 1944 a special committee called the Building Research Committee was appointed to furnish <Col N="230" /> advice or take such action as might be approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in technical matters relating to the building industry, including the preparation of standards for building materials.  A number of standards specifications have been prepared by that Committee.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been framed in the light of our past experience.  The new institute which this Bill is intended to set up will be so constituted as to preserve the advantages of the three research bodies to which I have referred and to include other features found in research and standards organisations in other countries and considered desirable in the circumstances of this country.  The Bill has been framed with recognition of the fact that for research, especially industrial research, elastic conditions of control and development are required.</P>
    <P>In order to give the proposed institute as great as measure of independence as is practicable, the Bill provides that the institute shall be a body corporate.  The constituent parts of the institute will be: a council, an industrial research committee, a standards committee, and a director of industrial research and standards.  It might help the Dáil to understand the scheme of organisation if I explained the separate function of each of these organs of the institute:</P>
    <P>The council will consist of the members of the industrial research committee to be appointed under the Bill and of the standards committee to be appointed who shall be <i>ex officio</i> members of the council and, in addition, there will be not more than fifty other members, each of whom shall be appointed for his special attainments. To the first council there shall be appointed as many members of the existing Industrial Research Council as are willing to act.  The first council will be appointed by the Government and succeeding councils will be appointed by the Minister.  The council of the institute will have advisory functions only.</P>
    <P>It will meet at least once a year and will have the duty of considering and making observations on the draft annual report and the programme of work of the institute.  It is hoped and <Col N="231" /> contemplated that the annual meeting of the council, which will be held in public, will ultimately take the form of a scientific convention which, by providing an occasion for the reading of special papers for discussion, will help to arouse interest in the work of the institute.</P>
    <P>The industrial research committee will consist of nine members appointed for their special scientific attainments applied to industry or because they are capable of giving substantial, practical assistance in the work of the institute.  The committee will be appointed every three years by the Minister and will be charged with the general government of the institute and the administration of its affairs, subject to the reservations to the standards committee and to the director.</P>
    <P>The standards committee will consist of seven members of whom three must be members of the industrial research committee.  The members of the standards committee will also be appointed by the Minister and they will have the duty of formulating specifications for standards at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Provision has been made for a standards committee as a separate organ of the institute as it is considered that it would not be desirable to give the standards committee a status inferior to that of the industrial research committee.  The two committees will be linked by having a common director, as well as by having some members in common.  The director of industrial research and standards will be appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and his primary duties will be to direct and supervise the conduct of research decided upon by the industrial research committee and the formulation of standards by the standards committee. The director will, however, have the right, independent of the industrial research committee, to direct such research as he may think proper on behalf of the institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is considered a more suitable scheme of organisation to have the director an independent organ of the institute.  That is a matter on which, I admit, different opinions could be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The director is subject to the committee in so far as he is obliged to direct the conduct of the research decided upon by the committee.  He can, independently of the committee, carry on routine investigations and research on his own initiative and maintain the normal working of the institute.  I think it will prove a satisfactory scheme of organisation, but I admit at once that alternative schemes can be conceived.  As I was saying, the director will have the right to attend and speak at meetings of the council of the industrial research committee and standards committee, but will not have the right to vote at such meetings. He will have power to appoint advisory committees to consult and advise him in relation to his functions, subject, in the case of functions with which the industrial research committee or the standards committee is concerned, to the prior consent of the committee concerned.  That provision will allow the services of existing organisations of a special kind, such as the building research committee, to which I have referred, to be availed of for the purposes of the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill whereby the institute will carry out researches, investigations, tests and analyses at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and also on its own initiative.  The institute will have power to render such assistance, financial or otherwise, as it thinks proper, to persons undertaking research of a kind the institute is <Col N="233" /> itself authorised to undertake.  It can, subject to the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, provide scholarships or other awards for the training of persons in industrial research and pay bonuses or royalties to members of its staff who had made, or had materially assisted in making, important discoveries or inventions.  Discoveries or inventions resulting from researches undertaken by the institute will be the property of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, subject to special provision in the case of work undertaken for private persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the analyses to which the Minister refers analyses of industrial goods produced in the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will these analyses be for the purpose of finding out whether or not goods manufactured here, or goods manufactured elsewhere and sold here, are what they purport to be and are up to the standard they ought to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be one of the main purposes.  Matters of standardisation under the Bill will be dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in consultation with the institute. A standard specification will be prepared by the institute, at the request of the Minister, who may then, by Order, declare such specification to be a standard specification.  Provision is made whereby the Minister may, by Order, prescribe a mark for use in connection with a specified commodity to indicate that it conforms to a particular standard specification.  Provision is also made for the registration of standard marks abroad, for restrictions on the registration of standard marks, for the grant of licences for the use of standard marks, for protection against misrepresentation and for the prosecution of offences in relation to standard marks and standard specifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed that there will be made available to the institute, out of <Col N="234" /> moneys provided by the Oireachtas, first, grants to such amounts as the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may sanction towards defraying the whole or any part of the capital cost of land, buildings and equipment for the institute; secondly, an annual grant of £15,000 towards the expenses of the administration of the institute and thirdly, grants of such amounts as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may sanction for defraying the whole or any part of the cost of special investigations undertaken by the institute, including the cost of any special equipment required in connection with such investigations.  The institute will have power to charge, to receive and to recover fees for researches, tests and investigations undertaken by it on behalf of any person other than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It will also have power to accept gifts of money, land or other property.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme of organisation, the industrial research committee will be charged with the administration of the financial affairs of the institute and will have the duty of keeping accounts in approved form and of submitting such accounts for audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General to be laid in due course before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  An annual report on the work of the institute will be prepared by the industrial research committee, and, after it has been considered by the council of the institute, will be submitted to the Minister, who will, in turn, submit it to the Government to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Bill provides that the industrial research committee and the standards committee must submit to the Minister such information regarding their activities as he may from time to time require.  Each of the committees may, with the approval of the Minister, publish scientific information in the name of the institute. That is an outline of the scheme of organisation of the proposed institute.</P>
    <P>As to the need of establishing such a body, I doubt if there will be any conflict of opinion.  The importance of science to industry is now generally <Col N="235" /> recognised.  Whether a country be large or small, old or new, mainly agricultural or mainly industrial, scientific research nowadays plays an increasing part in the development of its resources, on the provision of employment and on the maintenance of standards of living of its inhabitants. No country desiring to make industrial progress can afford to neglect the fullest use of scientific methods.  The less that a country has natural resources the more the need to employ them by research and investigation. Even if great discoveries may not always follow from scientific and industrial research, its results can nearly always be applied to the improvement of technical processes, to the use of substitutes and by-products, and the elimination of waste.  In the circumstances of this country there is ample scope for industrial research, with a view to maintaining or improving efficiency and technique and to develop new processes and new products.</P>
    <P>As research of this kind is necessarily guided by practical and economic methods, its value tends to be judged by the extent to which its results can be economically applied to production, and the time taken to do so.  The stage of development, that is to say the stage between the perfection of a new process of industrial application, first on a high planned scale, and ultimately on a practical scale, may be prolonged, difficult or expensive, but the time, the effort and the money will nearly always be justified by an increase in efficiency and output, or a lessening of the costs of production.</P>
    <P>The new institution will, it is hoped, place industrial research in this country on a more permanent basis.  The authority responsible will have its own building and equipment.  It will have annual subventions which will be available for use at its own discretion.  It will be able to apply and call on additional funds from the Exchequer to cover special investigations.  All countries have in recent years accepted the obligation to provide for industrial research as a State enterprise, or a State-aided enterprise.  In the great industrial States the major amount of industrial research is, no doubt, undertaken <Col N="236" /> by private firms for their own benefit, but in our comparatively undeveloped State, we have no wealthy corporations who could undertake it on an appreciable scale.</P>
    <P>Unless the State takes a leading part we are likely to be handicapped in our industrial development, or to leave neglected resources which could be developed for the expansion of the national wealth, or for the provision of employment.  The aim to prepare official standard specifications for goods and processes, both from the economic and social viewpoint is, I think, now generally recognised.  Standard specifications for industrial materials facilitate business enterprise, particularly in making clear the obligation of parties to contracts, involving the supply of goods, the construction of works or the performance of processes and practices. The need for having Irish standard specifications is linked up with our industrial development programme.  The intention is that the institute will prepare specifications for such materials in consultation with Irish manufacturing interests, so that the adoption of such specifications will facilitate efficient production here and, particularly, will not militate against the use of native raw materials.  It is intended, however, to go much further than to prepare specifications for industrial materials, and to cover also consumers' goods.  The social aims to be served by the establishment of the standard specification is now more generally understood throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The publication of standard specifications for consumer goods will not merely help to raise the quality of our industrial products, but will also help consumers to protect themselves against inferior products by means of the use of the standard mark.  For example, the publication of a standard specification for workers' heavy boots would enable the manufacturers to give, and the purchasers to obtain, a definite assurance as to the quality of such goods by the use of the standard mark in connection with them. It will not be compulsory, of course, for any manufacturer to make goods to the standard specification, but only goods conforming to the standard <Col N="237" /> specification can be so described, or can have the standard mark attached to them.</P>
    <P>In the course of time, it is hoped to have a whole series of standard specifications prepared and published, and a wide range of goods produced by Irish manufacturers in accordance therewith, and sold under the standard mark.  It is also intended that the institute may take any goods offered for sale, and have them tested and analysed, and the results of such tests and analyses published for the information of the public.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides in Section 40 that no action shall lie against the institute by reason of such publication.  This provision would help to protect the public against the misdescription of commercial goods, or the offering for sale of worthless products by means of glamorous advertising and similar methods.  The institute must not, therefore, be regarded as an academic body concerned only with research. Even its research activities will at all times have a decidedly practical basis, and its standardisation work, together with its testing and analysing of commercial goods, will have definite social aims to serve.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the proposed institute will add an essential part to the machinery required for the development of our resources and to the organisation necessary to raise the standard of commercial practice.  I feel sure that the Dáil will be prepared to approve in principle the establishment of an institute with the powers proposed in the Bill and that any disagreement with its terms will be confined to details which we can discuss more fully in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us a very full explanation of what appears to be, in many ways, an excellent Bill.  As the Minister has said, it seems to fall under two headings, namely, industrial research and standards.  It does not necessarily follow that both of those should come within the scope of one Bill, but I have no quarrel with their being combined together in the present Bill.  They have a certain relationship.  The subject is a wide and complicated one.  Many people <Col N="238" /> are of the opinion that this Bill is long overdue.  As the Bill is presented to us it seems to me that its value will depend on how the details are worked out.  This Bill could be a very great blessing; on the other hand&mdash;I do not scruple to say it&mdash;it might be a very terrible curse.</P>
      <P>As far as industrial research is concerned, I think the Minister is on the right lines.  He has made provision for the big firm which carries out its own research, probably part-time, through the medium of its technical officials; he is going to allow them the expenditure incurred on such research.  He is also catering for the smaller firms by giving them an opportunity of putting their problems before someone qualified to advise them, and they will be permitted the expenditure incurred upon that as a legitimate expense in the running of their business.  As far as small firms are concerned, a number of small problems is perpetually cropping up&mdash;whether a particular thing can be done in a particular way, or whether some process can be slightly altered but, at the same time, produce the same results.  Certainly, during the emergency the Scientific Research Bureau gave considerable assistance by way of advice and information to a great number of firms.  In the majority of those cases no very expensive experiment had to be carried out.  The Scientific Research Bureau, with their wider knowledge, were able to advise the manufacturer, for instance, that what he thought physically possible was, from the chemical point of view, impossible and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>I think a great deal of such help can be given to firms.  I think the Minister is also perfectly right in trying to link up the universities with such research because the universities are technical while industry is practical.  I do not know how far they can go to meet each other and intermingle, but certainly the Minister has started them off on the right lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come then to another section of this Bill&mdash;that is, the standards.  I think that there is a danger there that the bureau will carry out a whole series of investigations, draw up a number of standards which, unless they are very <Col N="239" /> careful, will for practical purposes be of very little, or no avail, either to industry or the community.  I am quite prepared to admit that it is in the interests of the community that that must be considered in the long run.  At the present time specifications and the actual practical work are as wide apart as the poles.  Many specifications have been drawn up and are in force to-day which are absolutely unenforceable.  Nobody has any intention of ever carrying them out.  Nobody thinks that he has been defrauded by something quite different being supplied. The situation is really nonsensical and the sooner that type of specification is done away with the better it will be.  I think industry could perform a great service if it selected a number of specifications&mdash;they would find a lot of them in Government Departments&mdash;and tore them up and said: &ldquo;These are not going to be used any more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was also struck by the way in which the Minister thought of introducing specifications.  I think he is on the right lines when he talks about giving a standard to specifications or goods which conform to the ideals established by the institute.  I think he is on the right lines there.  Any other approach would lead to grave difficulty because one immediately asks oneself where is compulsion in the interests of the community to begin and where is individual liberty to end.  I think very few people are aware of the extraordinary differences which exist all over the world.</P>
    <P>When I talk about the world I am really, thinking of England, the Continent, and America.  As far as our standards are concerned I think that those are the countries which will have the greatest influence on our standards and those are the countries which should influence them.  I can sympathise with the Minister's enthusiasm for having Irish specifications for everything.  In certain circumstances I think he is quite right in that; but, having regard to the volume and the output of work in the countries that I have mentioned, a great deal of the work of this institute will be done for it.  What they have <Col N="240" /> to do is to sift the wheat from the chaff and to see what things they will encourage and what things they will discourage.  Our ton is 2,240 lbs.  I think the American ton is 2,000 lbs. and they call the British ton a long ton.  Their gallon is different from ours.  Then when you get to tubes, on the Continent they go by diameter and we go by the bore.</P>
    <P>There are other matters that have passed out of the field of controversy and settled themselves.  Many years ago cement used to be an unsatisfactory article; you never knew what you were getting.  Then one enterprising group of manufacturers brought in the British standard specification.  There was later a revised British standard specification and, I think, we are working to that in this country and that everybody is satisfied with it.  Of course, that is a case where everybody is satisfied with the existing product and it fills the bill.  In regard to thread on tubes and how many threads there are to be to the inch, I think the Whitworth standard pitch is becoming the standard for the whole world.  At the same time, plumbers in the past would tell you of having gone down to a distant part of the country to put a boiler right that had gone out of order and having found when they arrived with a couple of couplings in their pockets that there were non-standard threads on the tubes and having to return to Dublin to get non-standard couplings made.</P>
    <P>I mention that to the Minister, not with the object of making his flesh creep but, if possible, to point out to him and the House what an enormous field has to be covered and how very considerable sums of money could be expended by this bureau on the wrong lines, the result being that the country would be worse off for the expenditure. I do not know how far people engaged in various industries could be invited to draw up specifications for a start. Whether the bureau agreed with this specification or did not agree, they would start with the viewpoint that one section of the community at least had the benefit of experience.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I take it the <Col N="241" /> Minister will try to bring about is one that probably suppliers have dreamt of for generations, namely, the reduction of the number of sizes of certain articles.  I will give the Minister an illustration of what I mean by that. Take the pavement lights in front of an establishment.  Of course, there has to be a certain variation in size owing to the size of the opening.  I think, however, that I am not far out when I say that there are about 50 of these variations, if not more.  If the bureau could get down to, say, giving ten of these their blessing for a start&mdash;a number of people who have to make replacements have to have non-standard articles that they can supply&mdash;a very great advance would be made.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister is aiming at getting an expert for each section of industry or manufacture, or whatever way he likes to put it.  The persons that he will get may be very eminent people but, if they do not attend a certain number of meetings, somebody ought to be appointed in their place.  There is an old saying that a live dog is better than a dead lion.  I think somebody who attends meetings would be a great deal more helpful than some eminent person who never attends.  I thoroughly approve of the Bill and I think the Dáil as a whole approves of the principles.  But, if the Minister is not very careful, we might be very sorry that we ever passed the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The presentation of this Bill to the House it seems to me will place a great many of our spokesmen for Irish industrialists in a very unhappy position.  Over a period they have been telling us that what they were suffering from was too much Government interference, that bureaucracy has got out of hand, and that, if we gave a free hand and implicit trust to these good-hearted industrialists, everything would be nice and happy in this country.  Now they have the problem of deciding whether, this Bill will be of benefit to them and of measuring up against that what undoubtedly will be increased Government interference by an addition to our existing bureaucracy.  It is, I think, worthy of comment that, when the <Col N="242" /> Minister speaks of the lack of sufficiently large enterprises in this country that by themselves would be capable of undertaking this research, he knows that that does not dispose of another side of the matter.  We have a number of organisations acting and speaking for industrialists and they could quite easily have combined together to provide this type of industrial research institute. That only seems to have occurred to them.  It is a happy thing that it is the community that has to take all this responsibility, because, by basing it on the community, we can take it out of the narrow fields of purely scientific application and the more selfish field of purely industrial application and in that way we can give some sort of value to the community. It is from that point of view we should welcome the Bill and the grounds on which the Minister recommends it.</P>
      <P>In so far as the main principles are concerned, I do not think we can have any great quarrel with the Minister. One suggestion that I would like to make has relation to the membership of the institute.  I am not speaking now of the research committee or the standards committee, but of the institute as a whole.  I should like the Minister not to confine the membership purely to persons who normally would be entitled to consideration on the basis of their scientific and, if you like, their industrial experience.  If we are to have some broad, social purpose served by the activities of the institute we should bear in mind that very often the social value of a scientific discovery or the application of some known scientific theory, or even a change in industrial technique, can often be more quickly appreciated by the ordinary citizen than by the scientists or the industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though it might mean that at the general meetings, possibily over a period of years, these non-scientific persons who merely represent the community will sit and provide the audience for their better-trained colleagues, still the fact that they are there would result in this, that there would be brought into the narrow scientific atmosphere the viewpoint of the average citizen and through him the viewpoint of the community.  That <Col N="243" /> would be valuable and we would find that on occasions they would make contributions of a useful nature and direct the attention of the more learned gentlemen to problems which might not be of immediate interest to scientists and industrialists, but which would be of great concern to the community.</P>
    <P>One of our difficulties in relation to our economy is that not only have we a small country, but we lack certain of the resources on which other countries have been able to build up a widespread economy.  In recent years there have been changes in the application of scientific knowledge and we might possibly foresee a bright future for our country in at least one field.  With regard to plastics, we have all the basic requirements for the establishment of a valuable industry.  There is, of course, the problem of deciding what particular type of plastic development would be of most value.  Then we could decide whether our energies should be applied to meet the internal demand or the export market.  We could also consider our requirements as regards electrical power and appliances and whether they are such as would be beyond our ability to supply.</P>
    <P>These are avenues which will provide alternatives as against the historic arguments of how much we have in the way of natural raw materials.  Here we have artificial raw materials, if you like to put it that way.  We have the main constituents and it would be interesting to see if this institute could find some line of development which will be of value to the community.  I doubt if any of our existing industries will be so interested in the problem as to take it upon themselves to urge the institute along that line.  If success is to be achieved, it will require such financial commitments that the community, acting through the State, will have to undertake the necessary exploitation.</P>
    <P>So far as our general standards of life are concerned, we know that the scientists have available wide fields of knowledge that would enable them to make drastic changes and improvements in the standards of life of the ordinary people.  Scientists, as such, <Col N="244" /> cannot see their way to apply that knowledge, but as citizens, and as part of a community conforming to certain economic and political laws, they find themselves hampered and confined in their activities.  We had one exceptional example in America of what scientists can do when given freedom of action.  I am thinking of the Tennessee Valley experiment, where a large tract of country, as big almost as our country, was handed over to scientists to solve a natural problem. In the solution of that problem they were able to develop a new standard of life for a large community.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be going outside the scope of the research institute's activities if it were suggested that it might be a valuable test of what we could do if we were to give a relatively small stretch of our country to the members of the institute and ask them to apply in that stretch such scientific knowledge as they think will be of value to the area and the people there.  The Government might give them financial support and encouragement so as to enable them to put their ideas into practical shape.  There we would have an example of what could be done on a small scale and it could be used as a measuring stick for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In so far as industrial research is concerned, it is not of immediate concern to the community that industry, as one branch of our economy, is provided with an institute to solve its own technical problems.  We are concerned to the extent that it will be assisted and facilitated in its work in serving the community.  That will be the main advantage of the institute.  That implies that it will be able at the beginning to remove itself from the narrow field of industrial application or pure scientific research.  It is essential that we should keep to the forefront the possible social value to the community, both of the research institute and the working out of national standards and specifications.</P>
    <P>I have the feeling that the institute will meet with difficulty in securing necessary funds.  It would be helpful if there was an expression from the <Col N="245" /> Dáil that in so far as the institute applies itself to work which has a communal and social value, the House will be prepared to support the Minister in seeking such financial aid as will allow the institute to carry on its work without being hampered and crippled in the way we know institutes have been hampered and crippled in the past.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a comparison made in regard to the amount expended in America and England on scientific research.  Even in England, a tremendously wealthy and powerful country, the comment was made that the amount of money was such that practically no value was obtained from the research institutes.  They were crippled through lack of funds. Although they were working on a national basis, they had proportionately less money than was made available to private institutes in America, operating on a competitive basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to dangers that might arise in regard to specifications and standard marks.  Again I think if the approach to this particular problem is not of a narrow character, we can avoid that danger. It is true that there are existing specifications that are not only an obstacle but are in fact a joke because they are more concerned with measurements which are not of any particular importance to the job in hand than with quality and fitness for the particular job in hand.  If the laying down of specifications proceeds more from the point of view of establishing certain standards of quality and fitness rather than from the point of view of laying down formal technical measurements which may be very important in themselves but are no indication of the ability of the particular materials to stand up to the particular strain involved, we will avoid some of the dangers Deputy Dockrell has referred to.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the work of the institute, so far as the fixation of standards is concerned, should also be extended to the retail field for the benefit of consumers.  There have been one or two instances in recent years <Col N="246" /> where the quality was not only such that it was an outrage to expect a consumer to purchase the particular product but did definite harm to the claims of Irish industry to provide consumers with properly manufactured goods at reasonable prices.  When one is aware, not only of the materials that went into the products that were to be sold to the Irish people but the conditions under which they were produced and the profits derived from them, one realises that the institute can serve a very practical and useful purpose on behalf of the Irish consumer.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be possible, but I suggest it for consideration, that if we are going to provide a standard mark which will be a guide to the consumer as well as a benefit to the manufacturer, we should have in mind also that a great body of the consumers desire, not merely to buy goods of sound quality at reasonable prices but also to be assured that they are manufactured under proper conditions from the point of view of hygiene and in relation to the workers engaged in their manufacture.  Whether we can tie up that particular matter to this or not I do not know.  I am aware that in other countries the practice has developed of employing, under licence, in the same way as is mentioned in the Bill, a mark which is an indication that the goods have been produced under fair conditions of employment. That is possibly going outside the range of the Bill but it is a second step that we might have in mind because, as the Minister is aware, there has been in recent years criticism of Irish-manufactured goods, not be- because of their quality or price but, very often, because of the conditions under which they were manufactured. If we set out to reset and to maintain a standard for Irish-manufactured goods in regard to quality and specifications, and also try to maintain equity in respect of the fixation of price, we should also bear in mind that good quality and fair price do not justify the purchase of particular goods if they are manufactured under objectionable conditions from the point of view of public health or of the welfare and claims of the workers engaged in the particular manufacture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all welcome this measure.  It is time that we should appreciate the fact that we have spent little or no money on research of any kind.  We are completely lacking in proper research institutions, not merely for industrial but for agricultural purposes. We have come to rely on the work of institutions in other countries. Sometimes, particularly in the sphere of agriculture, the results obtained at such institutions do not apply to conditions here.  Therefore, it is not in our interest to rely on outside institutions. I agree with the Minister that it is absolutely essential in this country that we should have an efficient research service of this sort.  The Minister is right in saying that we have not the type of corporation that can afford to pay substantial sums of money in this way.  In our circumstances then it is essential that the State should step in and provide the research organisations that we need.  In my opinion it is well to have an institution of this sort divorced to some extent from the work of the university.  Research is a very absorbing work, which claims the undivided attention of the scientist.  He should not be distracted at his work. I do not think it would be advisable to have a university professor, who may have to leave his research work in order to lecture.  If we can get the right type of research worker, we can hope for very substantial improvements.</P>
      <P>In particular, it is well that the Minister has combined the question of standards with research.  In our circumstances it is essential that standards should be laid down.  It is necessary to have protection of industry here so that it may escape the keen competition of older and better developed industries outside.  At the same time, the consumer must be protected.  Industry should be given a reasonable period for development and within which to reach a certain standard of efficiency.  It is right that certain standards should be set for manufacturers here.  In fact, I would be inclined to go further and to suggest that protection should not be afforded to an industry beyond a reasonable period, a period that is considered a fair period within which to reach a certain standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> There are opportunities here for the manufacture of considerable quantities of agricultural machinery.  If we are to modernise our methods, it is essential that our farms should be mechanised to a very considerable extent. Some of the attempts at producing machines here have been very crude and, so far as design is concerned, some of the machines in production at the present time are completely obsolete. I would be very anxious that an institution of this kind should concern itself with the quality and standardisation of equipment of that kind.  I believe that the mark which a machine would carry from this institute would be a hall-mark of quality, the acid test of quality, so that a purchaser purchasing that machine need not inquire any further but would be quite satisfied that he was buying an article of quality which would bear out the claims made by the manufacturer for it.  Too often, an individual purchases a machine, for the efficiency of which great things are claimed, and then finds that he is let down, that the machine is not all it was claimed to be. The cautious individual, of course, makes a considerable number of inquiries and discusses it with people who have used the machine in order to find out its performance.</P>
    <P>An institute of this sort would definitely help the consumer and should definitely help the producer as well, because it may substantially improve methods of production and the system in operation in a particular factory.  I am satisfied that it is possible to produce good agricultural machines here. Recently, attempts have been made to produce tractor ploughs which were not produced before the emergency. The attempt was made because of difficulties arising from the emergency and a very decent plough is being produced at the moment.  It is true that its design has been stolen from a number of other manufacturers' designs, but I expect that the best points of other such implements have been embodied in it and the result is quite a good article, so far as design is concerned. The quality of our metals, however, is rather poor and they break very easily, and in this respect again an institute <Col N="249" /> of this sort would be of definite help in regard to the provision of metallurgists and the putting into operation of the best processes for the production of metals.  It is a well-known fact that American metals and American malleable irons are superior to British.  I do not know why, but it is the case.</P>
    <P>With regard to agricultural tools, I have mentioned before that we have been manufacturing these tools here for a number of years, but that the quality, while it is to some extent good, is not up to the standard one would expect.  When we have decent, native ash for handles, I would expect that this institute would fix a standard in that respect which would secure a very substantial improvement in the quality of these articles.  I see this difficulty in relation to the proposals for constituting the institute, that, where the ordinary members are industrial representatives, they might be slow to co-operate in fixing a rather high standard.  A standard might be fixed which would be too high and which the beginner might find difficult to reach.  The Minister may be able to give us more information on that point, but he said that these standards would be fixed by the institute in consultation with Irish manufacturing interests.  Possibly, if an industry was rather inefficient in its methods and producing a rather poor article, the representative of that interest might be very slow to agree to the fixing of a high standard, and for that reason the suggestion made by Deputy Larkin might be very useful, that at least some of the 50 members might be representative of interests other than manufacturing interests.  They might be representative of consumer interests</P>
    <P>So far as agricultural machinery is concerned, some practical farmers who are anxious to see that machines of the right type, machines suited to our conditions, are produced, might be amongst the members.  The peculiar thing about the position here is that we are very often forced to buy machines which are designed for bigger farm units than we have here. We have no body which would go abroad to see what other countries have produced for dealing with conditions <Col N="250" /> somewhat similar to ours. This is a step in the right direction for that reason, in that an institute of this sort would concern itself with what was being done elsewhere, with the advances achieved elsewhere in the matter of design and the production of machinery for operation on small farm units.</P>
    <P>One example may be given.  With our very wet climate, we have a weed problem in arable farming, while most other arable farming countries have a drought problem, so that we are particularly interested in machinery which will deal with weeds at minimum cost. There is far too much cost involved on the farm in dealing manually with problems of that kind, and, when one takes that into account, one can understand the low output per man in this country compared with that in other countries.  It is due, first, to lack of technique, lack of proper technical knowledge, and, secondly, to lack of mechanical equipment to deal with problems peculiar to our circumstances. We have discussed on other occasions low agricultural wages here compared with wages in Great Britain. I believe wages are going to remain low until we can step-up man output, and the way to do that is to have the type of equipment we require, particularly in the small farms that we have in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give any idea of what the institute is going to cost. There is provision for a regular Vote of £15,000 a year, but over and above that some sections of the Bill provide for special expenses and special grants. I feel that we should not be cheeseparing about whatever State funds are put into an institute of this type.  I want to say now that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has started in the right way as far as industry is concerned.  I hope that will be followed by having a proper scientific institute for agriculture.  We should not have to take results achieved in other States, and to try to relate them to our circumstances, as very often they are not applicable here.  I should like the Minister to give some information as to the probable cost, and the capital that is likely to be invested in the institute.  According to Section 6, I <Col N="251" /> understand that the first appointments will be made by the Government and &ldquo;shall include every member of the industrial research council who is willing and able to act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister might tell us who the present members of the council are. I am not inclined to agree with the Minister that the director should have discretionary powers so far as carrying out independent research goes.  There ought to be one authority to direct research.  If you leave the director discretionary powers, apart from industrial research, there may be a clash between himself and the committee.</P>
    <P>At all events, he should have permission from the committee if he wants to pursue a certain course.  He may have a particular bent that he would want to pursue, but it might not be of advantage as far as the bureau is concerned. The bureau should concern itself with things which are going to be of most economic advantage to the State.  If you have an excellent director of research he might have hobbies of his own.  Very often a research worker is not concerned with economic advantages of his work at all.  He is an enthusiast and is anxious to pursue what is keenly interesting to himself. For that reason I think he ought not to be so free as the Minister proposes to make him.  At least, he ought to consult the committee before proceeding.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister, in Section 10, leaves it to the industrial research committee to fix its remuneration.  Section 30 (2) states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There may be paid to the institute, from time to time, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, grants of such amounts as the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may sanction towards defraying the whole or any part of the capital cost of land, buildings and equipment for the institute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister might also give some information on Section 34 (2).  Has he any estimate of the amount of capital that will be necessary for special investigations undertaken by the institute, including the cost of special <Col N="252" /> equipment?  Sub-section (3) of the same section reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of sub-section (2) of this section, the industrial research committee shall prepare and submit to the Minister, in each year, a programme and estimate of income and expenditure of the institute in connection with special investigations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears that that information will not be available to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Where they have to prepare a programme and present it to the Minister.  There is not very much in the Bill on which we can offer criticism.  When reading this measure I was very doubtful if it was wise to allow the director the discretion that the Minister felt that it was necessary to give him, allowing that he is going to be put in charge and will be responsible to the committee for the work of scientists.  I felt that whatever work he wanted to do should have the sanction of the committee beforehand. I do not anticipate any of the trouble that Deputy Dockrell anticipates, as to standard fixing becoming a nuisance.  The Deputy knows more than I do about that matter.  It may be that there are standards which are now obsolete.  I take it that part of the work under this Bill will be to get rid of obsolete standards.  I agree with Deputy Dockrell on the necessity of providing standards to deal with a good deal of equipment.  Anybody who reads about industry in other countries realises that they are up against the problem of having component parts of machines and trade standards.  Take a piston in a motor car or a certain type of wheel.  There should be a standard which would simplify the provision of spare parts. I feel that the institute should be concerned with standardising component parts and spares for industrial purposes. I would be hopeful that an institute of this sort, when provided with ample financial provisions, would be in a position to give almost invaluable service to the community.  I think the Minister is right, too, in his <Col N="253" /> suggestion that this institute should deal with food and the preparation of food in order to ensure that it is properly prepared and of good quality.  I think the same should be applied to animal feeding stuffs in order that the agricultural community would know that they were getting good feeding stuffs of good quality and prepared to a standard specification.  They should be in a position to know that the feeding stuffs which they purchase are properly balanced and that they are getting good value, provided such feeding stuffs carry the mark of the institute.  In that way the consumer would know that, as long as the mark is presented, no further inquiry is necessary and the mark in itself is a guarantee that the goods are up to standard, that they are reliable and that he can rest assured that he is getting good value for his money.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin started off this evening by tilting at manufacturers and producers generally, and suggesting that they might be opposed to the provisions of this Bill on the general ground that it constitutes an interference with their business.  It is true that producers in general have been objecting to State interference in their ordinary business.  I think, however, that Deputy Larkin himself, in the course of his own argument, arrived eventually at the conclusion that the type of interference envisaged in this Bill is such as is unavoidable. Perhaps I should say, rather, that the type of work which this Bill proposes to put in operation is such that the individual manufacturer or producer is unable to undertake himself or which it might be undesirable for him to undertake. I think as far as manufacturers are concerned, they have been advocating the setting up of some sort of institute to fix standards of quality, and I think the progressive producer will welcome the establishment of a recognised body whose decisions will be accepted as absolutely trustworthy and whose standards are reliable.  I feel that the two main functions of this institute are vitally essential and absolutely necessary.  At the same time, I think there is a third function which might properly be linked with <Col N="254" /> the other two, namely, investigation into and the estimation of costings in all branches of productive industry.  I think that a statutory body, enjoying the confidence of producer and consumer alike, would be ideal for the purposes of estimating the cost of production of any commodity produced in this country.  I think these three-fold functions&mdash;that is, the work of research, the fixing of standards of quality and the estimating of costings &mdash;should be linked together.  If that is done I think the State will be taking a big step towards assisting private enterprise in regard to production and will, at the same time, be undertaking a work which private enterprise itself cannot undertake.  If this work is undertaken by the State you will have, not only protection for the producer but also protection for the consumer, because such a body must consider the interests of the producer as well as those of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that the main function of such a body as this would be for the purpose of getting increased production and efficient production and to find out at the same time whether it is possible to open up new lines of production. One thing which strikes me forcibly in regard to this Bill, which has the almost unanimous approval of all Parties in this House, is that, while the main purpose of the Bill may be sound and while it may achieve good results, the human factor must always be considered. There is a danger that such an institute may fall down on its job because of lack of the dynamic force essential to carry out the work with which it is entrusted.  There is a very limited means through which the community or the House can judge as to whether an institute of this kind is delivering the goods or not.  A research institute may carry on the work of research for many months, or many years, and produce very little results. That may be due to the fact that it is not humanly possible to produce any very substantial results or, alternatively, to the fact that the institute is not working wholeheartedly.  It is very difficult for a layman or members of this House to judge whether such an institute is rendering service or not. It is, I think, recognised that the <Col N="255" /> Minister is a very dynamic person himself, but there are so many bodies and so many organisations to which he is expected to direct his energy that it would be absolutely impossible for him to apply any driving force to this new body unless the body itself is willing and ready to co-operate and to carry out the work entrusted to it.  In this connection I would like to know if it is possible to make any inquiry&mdash;a polite inquiry, if you like&mdash;into the methods applied in democratic countries during the war on war research and war production.  There is no doubt the democratic nations of the world, such as Great Britain and America, made tremendous drives in that direction and in the matter of research into war equipment.  I presume that their progress was due in large measure to the enthusiasm inspired by the urgent need and the driving force of that urgent need to make a success of their investigations and inquiries.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it will be possible to infuse into the organisation which it is proposed to set up the same spirit of enthusiasm which in all probability inspired the research workers in the nations which were at war.  But I think it ought to be recognised that the problems which research workers in this country have to cope with are perhaps even more urgent to this nation than the problems which the nations which were at war had to face. There is no doubt that if we fail to overcome all the obstacles in the way of increased productive effort, this nation will decline.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the Minister explained fully what method he will adopt in the selection of the members of this institute and of the two committees which he is setting up.  I assume that he will pick men of outstanding technical ability.  I would advise him, in addition to getting men of proved experience and tested ability, to get a certain sprinkling of youthful enthusiasts, young men who have perhaps come recently from the university, who have shown ability there, but who have still youth on their side and who are ambitious to do something of value, not only in their own interests or in the interests of science, but also <Col N="256" /> in the interests of the nation.  That, I think, is desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to many lines upon which research is desired. There is, of course, first the fundamental question of overcoming this nation's poverty in basic materials for industry, such as power and mineral resources.  Coal and the other valuable ores were the source of the industrial development of the great industrial nations.  It is possible that with the development of science we may be able to overcome our deficiencies in that respect.  It is possible that with the further development of electric power we may be able to secure driving power for industry as cheaply as the coal-producing countries.  It is possible also that the further development of plastics may give us the materials for many great and important manufacturing industries.  These are the most important of the very big lines along which research should go.</P>
    <P>It has been submitted to me that it is possible to produce petrol in large quantities from peat.  That may be absolutely fantastic, it may be foolish, but it is a matter which requires investigation. Another matter which requires investigation and research, and I think it is a matter in regard to which research will certainly yield useful results, is the conversion of town waste into artificial fertilisers.  There is no doubt that agriculture is our most important productive industry. The most valuable asset we have is the few feet of soil that covers the face of our country.  The matter of preserving our soil in the highest possible state of fertility is one of the biggest and most urgent problems which scientists should be facing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to our climatic difficulties in regard to agriculture as compared with many other agricultural countries.  We have a very wet climate which has many disadvantages for the agricultural producer.  It produces a more than adequate supply of weeds in our crops which foul the soil and prevent profitable production. Then, when we come to the harvest, we have an excess of moisture in all our cereal crops.  These are two matters which have to be inquired into.  We <Col N="257" /> have to see how to provide the best possible methods of eliminating weeds and the best possible methods of reducing the moisture content of our grain crops and also of preventing them from being completely ruined by the weather.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the fixing of standards of quality, I think there was no need for Deputy Larkin to tilt at the producers in this country because, as far as manufacturers are concerned, they have been advocating the setting up of some sort of institute or committee for the fixation of proper standards, and I think every progressive and efficient manufacturer will welcome the establishment of such a body which will ensure that his products will bear an official stamp of high quality.  During the emergency a great deal of inferior substitute goods were manufactured here.  For example, there were certain agricultural implements and tools produced here of very inferior quality.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the price was much lower in some cases than the price of the imported article, the imported article was found to be of better value.  That may have been partly due to emergency conditions which made it impossible to get the proper materials for manufacture, and it may be possible to overcome that. But it is absolutely essential, not only if the consumer is to be protected, but also if confidence is to be established in the ability of our manufacturers to turn out good stuff, that a recognised body should be able to pass such goods and fix upon them an official mark which the consumer can recognise as proving their quality.  I hope that the research committee will not rush too quickly into the study of atomic energy. I do not think that this country can afford experiments of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might do a lot of harm if we had too much of it.  I think that it is not so much in the bigger scientific developments that this research committee will prove itself.  There are many small improvements which can be made in the technique of the <Col N="258" /> manufacture of goods and of agricultural production and matters of that kind which might yield great dividends to the State&mdash;something that will help the farmer to eliminate weeds, to dry his grain quickly and something that might help in saving turf.  Those are things which would go a long way towards assisting production here and they might go perhaps much further than the atomic energy about which Deputy Walsh is so enthusiastic.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the suggestion which I have already made to the Minister, and that is, above all things, to make sure that when those bodies are established they will not sit down fiddling for years and fail to get on with the work with the same energy, vigour and enthusiasm as research workers displayed in belligerent countries during the war.  I make a last appeal to the Minister to set up an efficient body on the lines outlined in the Bill for the purpose of making a thorough investigation of costings.  It is absolutely essential, in the interest of the consumer and the producer, that we should know with certainty the actual cost of production, both in agriculture and in industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to preface any remarks I have to make on this Bill with some observations on the statements made by Deputy Larkin.  Deputy Larkin has quite rightly put before us the interests of the consumers.  The answer to him is that this body is conceived primarily to see that research work is done; it is not there primarily to advise on what problems should be undertaken from the point of view of the general benefit to the community.  For that reason probably the Minister intends, and I think the Bill seems to indicate that the intention is, to cater for industrial research and standards from the practical end, on the assumption that necessary problems will be referred to the institute in general terms.  That, in turn, has some bearing on what Deputy Dockrell said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of the Bill is sufficiently wide and elastic to be worked on the right lines, but it is also so elastic as to be rather undefined.  For that <Col N="259" /> reason I might be in order in analysing some of the things in the Bill in detail. I regret that in attempting to do that we have not had an opportunity of seeing the report of the Emergency Research Bureau.  It would have been well, too, if we could have seen a report from the Industrial Research Council, if such were available.  It would at least help us to contribute adequately to a debate like this, where everybody is unanimously behind the Minister; it would have helped towards a more informed discussion of the matters at issue.  But, we have not got these reports, and every Deputy must go on his own intuition, so to speak.  There is hardly any likelihood that the reports will be available before the Committee Stage is reached.  So we have the Bill with nothing more than a White Paper supporting it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister's introductory remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  The Minister will not misunderstand what I meant by that statement.  The Minister's remarks merely amplify the general terms of what is in the Bill. There are three things, I take it, that this Bill caters for, and we have to grasp clearly what these three things are.  We have, first, research which, in the Bill, is called industrial research. We have, secondly, the question of standards and, lastly, there is the question of analysis.  If reference is made to the function of the institute&mdash;to test and analyse commodities&mdash;it has for me somewhat rather wide and possibly starting implications.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister is he concerned there merely with testing for what I might call standards of measure, what would more properly be called physical standards, or is he concerned with testing the conformity of goods to specification, because there is a vast difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fixing of physical standards is a relatively narrow, highly-specialised, scientific job of relatively small scope; the testing of goods for specification is likely in future to be a huge matter. We have only to think of what is provided <Col N="260" /> for in the Public Health Bill alone.  Therefore, I would like to know if there is envisaged a whole system of analyses which would largely duplicate the services of a public analyst; or is the Bill simply directed to the question of conformity to physical standards of length, capacity and so forth&mdash;of wavelengths, the calibration of wireless sets, and things of that nature?  That question has a big bearing on the size of the institute.  In one case it would be relatively small; in the other it means a whole analytical institution.</P>
    <P>Very little need be said about the question of standards, at least of standards in the physical standard sense.  There, if it is merely the setting of standards, of physical constance and the determination for ourselves of a standard metre or a standard yard or whatever you have in the form of standard units in other ways, while that is a highly specialised job, it is relatively a narrow one.  On the other hand, if the Department of Standards, for want of a better name, are to be engaged on the standardisation of commodities and specifications, a different situation arises.  For instance, there are certain provisions in the Public Health Bill under which the Minister for Local Government may or may not arrange certain things in regard to food and drugs.  Is this bureau of standards to be the body to fix the standard specification?</P>
    <P>My opinion is that if it is visualised that the question of standards and the question of analysis are to be taken in the broad sense of dealing with commodities for sale in addition to physical standards, then the Minister should seriously consider the setting up of an almost completely separate institution, because of the volume of work that would be there at the moment and the volume that is likely to exist from what we can see of prospective legislation.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, it is the more narrow thing that is contemplated, that public analysis would cater for the problems arising under the Public Health Bill and that, say, the State Laboratory would continue its regular work, then of course, standards in the narrow sense are very closely linked with research, and I think the Minister's <Col N="261" /> scheme is quite sound in that respect. I mention this point at some length because, I think, we should realise what is involved.  It is very easy for us to come in here to the Minister and congratulate him on his intentions, with which we all agree and in respect of which he has the wholehearted support of the House, but we give him very little assistance if we do not examine the matter and we are doing him, or his successor, a bad turn, because if the thing does not work afterwards, because of some matter of that nature, people will be only too ready to criticise.  So, since we can handle the thing in a completely co-operative way on this measure, I think this is the time to talk about it.</P>
    <P>On the question of research&mdash; again on what would seem to be a small point &mdash;I jib a bit at the word &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; research.  There is an implication in that which, on analysis, is very shortsighted, that industrial research is completely divorced from what is called pure research and there is the implication that was almost given voice to in the House, that the university man, the professor, is an academic gentleman in a glass cage, and that the practical industrialist, the practical research technician is radically different.  I would like to point out that that is a complete fallacy and that in fact, when it comes to research, we have to go back to our university professors.  Where did we find, for instance, either our Industrial Research Council or Emergency Research Bureau?  The majority were our university men, and that was not a matter of accident.  It was simply this, that in a question of research there is the practical job of pressing ahead with the problem, the limits of which are very often unknown and that requires a very big fund of general knowledge and what is called &ldquo;pure&rdquo; training behind it in order to guess your way and to push it forward and that most problems of so-called &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; research depend on the prior solution of some problem in pure physics, chemistry, whatever it is, and, right through the whole progress of the work there will be constantly cropping up problems that are broadly problems <Col N="262" /> of the so-called pure or fundamental research or problems that are so vague that necessitate the coming back to the research standpoint so that you can take stock and see where you are going and get on with your research.</P>
    <P>To make that more specific, you may get to the stage where you have a pilot plant experiment, a whole plant filled in miniature, operating with a staff having technical skill.  You meet some problem and have to go right back to the laboratory with your small batteries and test tubes and back to your purely academic literature to solve that problem before you can get ahead.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I think it is a mistake&mdash;I am not suggesting that the Minister is making this mistake but I think the mistake was apparent in some of the remarks made in the debate&mdash;I think it is a mistake for us to consider that what is called pure research and industrial research are completely separable things.  The two must go together.  This is a corollary: as regards the workers involved, there is no difference between the research worker whether he be a pure research worker working on a purely academic problem or for the moment academic problem in a college laboratory or whether he is working on a problem to develop a new fuel in an industrial laboratory.  There is, however, a big difference between that research worker and what is merely a skilled technician.  You may have an expert on a job on a particular plant.  He may know more about the details of a process and the details of this particular plant than perhaps anybody else available but he has not the breadth of knowledge or the general training to enable him to do research because research in its nature is the exploration of what for the moment is unknown and the only person fitted for that is a person who has got sufficient training to be able to feel his way around the particular problem.  I cannot in conscience detain the House rather longer along that point but I will say, therefore, that this question of divorcing the practical or industrial research from pure research is a fallacy and that on our last resort we shall be thrown back on reliance on our universities. <Col N="263" /> It is from our universities that our research workers will come or will have to come, or they will not come at all, and it is their very training in the wider and so-called academic fields in the universities that will enable them to tackle a research problem in contrast to the most highly skilled technicians, say, trained in a technical school, who may be in a sense better immediately on a plant job.  That distinction is definitely there and must be appreciated.</P>
    <P>These considerations bring one logically to a question of the consideration of the organisation of matters proposed in this Bill and, in order to take them seriatim, as they appear in the Bill, I must for the moment break my sequence and leave the question of the organisation of research in its proper order there.  With regard to the set-up proposed by the Minister in this Bill, the objects of the council as defined in Part II of the Bill are adequate enough and wide enough.  The only trouble is, as I have said already, that they might be too wide; to try to put them through in their widest sense would involve an organisation that would be too big, really, for the purpose of one institute.  With regard to the Minister's decision to constitute an advisory council, there, I think, he is to be congratulated.  He is to be congratulated on a point of view that lies a good deal beyond his Department. He is prepared to consult and have the benefit of the advice of people who are best equipped and the idea of an advisory council like that is, I think, a very fine one.</P>

      <P>We are merely concerned in this Bill&mdash;I should like to tell the Deputy&mdash;for the moment, with research.  It is a fine idea and I think we are all agreed on that. The Minister's practical turn of mind then shows itself&mdash;he puts in an organisation to make the Bill work, which is as necessary as the first is desirable, but in this respect I find a certain difficulty just as Deputy Hughes found a difficulty. I am rather worried about the <Col N="264" /> position of the director.  It is obviously desirable to have a research committee and a standards committee, and the Minister is perfectly correct in having these separate, but I would suggest to him that, from the point of view of practical working and from the experience of most people of committees, he might very profitably reduce the number in the industrial research committee from nine to five or six.  If it is to be a working committee and it is overloaded, we all know what happens. Everybody has to express his views; hours elapse; the meeting finishes; and the matter is adjourned, to be reconsidered at the next meeting.  That is the fate of all big committees, and I suggest to the Minister that it might be well to reduce the size of the working committee, especially as he has this advisory council with which this committee can be in touch.</P>
      <P>This brings in the question of director and, frankly, I am worried about two things in relation to the director.  He is apparently to be a director of research and he is in some way undefined to be responsible to the committee; in other words, responsible to the research committee for research directed by them and he is responsible to the standards committee for their particular end.  At the same time, he has certain wide liberty.  Frankly, I think there is some point in Deputy Hughes's fear in this respect, and I make the suggestion to the Minister that the director should be either the chairman of the committee, the executive committee, or he should be subject to the direction of that committee&mdash;one or the other&mdash;in the interests of smooth working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible to argue both ways. Perhaps somebody on the opposite side may say: &ldquo;Appoint the chairman of the executive committee and let that committee direct all the functions, except the standard functions of the institute; in other words, constitute them a board of directors, with a chairman, and leave the technical director as the executive officer of that board.&rdquo; That is one possible solution.  If for some reason&mdash;and the Minister has examined this matter more thoroughly than any of us&mdash;such a procedure is not acceptable, the director could be <Col N="265" /> considered as the chairman of that committee.  I would, however, like to see that particular point tightened up and made definite, because there is a fear of friction, and, apart from that, there is the question of getting work done.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill is a little optimistic in that, having said that the director will carry out the proper functions for the standards committee and the proper functions for the research committee, it adds that he may do research on his own.  He would be rather a marvellous director who would do any research after doing all the research for the others.  But there is another more serious objection to the complete autonomy of a director of that nature.  With the development of modern technical knowledge, no one man can be such a complete expert in the various matters that will arise that he can deal with any sizable problem on his own.</P>
    <P>The experiences of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau were very informative in that regard.  On that body, there were five very eminent people in the scientific world here, with varying and complementary specialities.  The chairman, Professor Dowling, was an expert on physics and applied physics, and his qualifications ideally fitted him for the position of chairman, and then there were an electro-chemist, a chemist, an engineer and a physicist.  Whoever picked the team&mdash;and I suspect it was picked on technical recommendations &mdash; appreciated that point.  The chairman had seen to it, and there was in that body a balanced team, and when a problem came up, such as a problem in respect of research on some plant, the team combined to solve them.  Certain plants were developed, a phosphorus plant being one&mdash;and there were chemical problems, engineering problems, problems of physics and electro-chemistry involved.</P>
    <P>No one person, even if he were a super-scientist, could, on his own, have been able to solve all such problems. In effect, if he were appointed a director and let loose, he would have to consult others, and I therefore suggest that we realise that point at the <Col N="266" /> start and that one or other of the solutions I have proposed be adopted, so that, in constituting that executive committee&mdash;in the Bill, called the industrial research committee&mdash;a balanced team of that nature will be appointed which will, in effect, be the directing power, the directors of the research, with the director either the chairman or their executive.  The research should be all under their control. That is a view which I should like to press on the Minister, but, as the Minister said, it is very difficult to arrive at a completely satisfactory solution of the problem.  He very straightforwardly said that there are different views on the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to how that body is to initiate work and get work done, a good deal of criticism was levelled against the old industrial research council because of want of results.  The Minister pointed out in his opening speech that one of the great difficulties was that the old industrial research council was so hampered by administrative and financial restrictions that it was not the success it was hoped it would be.</P>
    <P>The emergency enabled us to gain some experience with the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, but if, apart from the personnel of that bureau, I were to be asked what were the principal factors which contributed towards the relative success of that bureau, I should be inclined to give two general answers.  The first would be that definite concrete problems were formulated to them and this gets back to Deputy Larkin's point.  It is rather asking too much of a research committee to ask it, on top of everything else, to sit down and propound their own problems for solution. Matters should be referred to them&mdash; it makes for good work and good organisation.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that the Minister was desirous of having a certain commodity produced here.  In the case of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, the problem was referred in concrete form to them.  The problem of producing phosphorus, chlorate, or anything else was given to them and they were asked: &ldquo;Can that be done? <Col N="267" /> If so, do it.&rdquo;  Thereafter, the administrative facilities were available.  The chairman was able to organise things. There was none of these terrible hampering delays.  Nothing kills research when you want to get a drive on like the administrative delays, and of course under pressure of the emergency financial facilities were afforded.  Administrative facilities and financial facilities made all the difference in the working out of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau.  That should be borne in mind when the Bill is put into operation.  I think it will.  The Minister has given us every hope that it will.  We must follow it a little bit further.  We have got this far.  Let us assume that we have a body as competent and as enthusiastic as the late Emergency Scientific Bureau sitting in a room.  What are they going to do next?  Are they going to have to set up elaborate laboratories and are they going to have that room packed with so many research chemists all ready, so that you press button A and in walks B?  Is that what is visualised because the first step of the problem will be a relatively pure research stage.  It will be what is called the laboratory stage, a preliminary investigation.</P>
    <P>That will tell whether you can go on with your final stage or will indicate the line you should take.  That investigation will involve normal preliminary work in the laboratory together with research in literature, and in many cases academic literature at that.  The question arises, are you going to have an organisation on tap that is going to be ready to handle at that stage any possible problem referred to it by the Minister or by the Department?  If you are, let me warn you that there is going to be very substantial expense and a very substantial permanent staff involved.  On the other hand, I throw out a suggestion, what about our universities?  During the emergency our universities gave very excellent service to the bureau in that regard.  I can think of a number of researches offhand where the bureau having considered problems referred to them referred them to the professor of chemistry in one of the colleges to work out the problem.  I mentioned <Col N="268" /> the question of phosphorus.  The problem in phosphorus was referred to the late professor of chemistry and to the State Laboratory.  That was the chemical end.  Later the final part of the laboratory stage was solved in the precincts of University College engineering department.  The preliminary researches on chlorate by the Scientific Research Bureau were conducted in Trinity College.  If these facilities had not been there and had not been used it would have been necessary to equip&mdash;and it could not be done during the emergency&mdash;a complete laboratory and staff.  Let us face up to the problem from the point of view of actual practical working on the laboratory stage of any research. I think that should be considered carefully because from the point of view of general economics it may not be such good business to build more laboratories if your present facilities are capable of catering for your needs.</P>
    <P>Let us pass from the laboratory stage.  What is the next phase?  The next phase, the pilot stage.  That is an installation built not quite on a full scale but duplicating full scale as far as possible with the idea of finding out how it will work.  That again involves space, materials, facilities, personnel and organisation.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister going to consider the maintenance of permanent organisation to cater for such a matter or will he attempt to use some existing machinery?  In other words, the same problem is going to arise on this stage as arose on the first stage.  It is perhaps a little more difficult because there will be more unskilled people brought in there, so to speak, than in the other stage.  In other words, you want more general labourers, foremen and carpenters, etc.  Are you going to maintain a huge staff of that nature which will be only intermittently employed?  I do not think a bureau of this nature is likely to be occupied on pilot research all the time.  It may have no pilot research going on for periods.  Are you going to keep an organisation of that kind or are you going to use some other organisation? I know that somebody will say &ldquo;all right, what organisation could you <Col N="269" /> use?&rdquo;  I can only make another suggestion which concerns another Minister, but I think I had better make it.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that at this particular phase the Government might be able to find some very useful work for the technical departments of the Army.  I must digress to this extent to explain. One of the problems in the Army has been during normal peace time to keep the technical branches going, the corps of engineers and the army ordnance corps.  They fall into the routine of peace time.  It is very, very difficult to keep them alive, especially the professional men like trained chemists, qualified engineers and people like that, because there is no practical problem before them.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that he might consider that here the Army might be of considerable assistance and reciprocally they might be of considerable help to the Army. We have actually had a little experience of that.  When the emergency scientific bureau was up against this pilot problem of research for the Department of Defence the experiment was tried of using Army technical officers, chemists and engineers and Army personnel to do this work.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Army was put on the pilot plant stage working under the direction of the bureau.  I think the experiment was a very great success.  There was no friction of any kind.  The Army carried out the orders of the bureau and put its advice into effect.  There was no difficulty as regards control.  The bureau did not interfere with Army administration and the Army officers merely took the technical advice of the bureau, put it into effect, and did it remarkably well. I throw that out merely as a suggestion to the Minister so that, when he is building a chemical plant and some research work has to be done on the pilot plant scale, it might be a good idea to use the ordnance and engineer sections of the Army to carry out the work of experimentation, erection, and operation.  In that way, it would be possible to keep alive in the Army scientific interest and would, at the same time, provide it with a substantial <Col N="270" /> training ground which would fit them for a war which, please God, we shall avoid as we did the last one.  I made some criticisms and I think it is incumbent on me now to make some constructive suggestions and, therefore, I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to deal with the last stage because, once that stage is reached, the plant is in full operation and in actual process of production.</P>
    <P>On these other questions, one comes immediately up against finance and administration.  There will be great need for clear thinking in regard to these matters and a proper appreciation of the fact that, when you come down to bedrock, it will be upon your university graduates and on university trained research workers you will be dependent for the carrying out of the work.  More surprisingly still, it will be the academically distinguished university graduate who will give you your best results in industrial work.  In the new problems which will emanate from industrial research in the future it will be through the university graduates that you will find your solution to those, rather than from any other source.  It should be remembered, too, that we need not go beyond the limits of this country for our personnel. All we have to do is to give our universities a chance to train that personnel and they will do the job better than any imported expert will do it.</P>
    <P>I can remember one very difficult engineering job which had to be carried out here during the emergency.  Experts from other places maintained that for us the particular problem was incapable of solution.  But it was solved. It was solved by a young Electricity Supply Board engineer, who was a temporary Army officer, working under the direction of the Professor of Engineering in University College.  Not only did he solve that problem, but he solved a number of others.  The reason for that is not far to seek, and it is as well that we should realise it.</P>
    <P>In the past we have often imported expert technicians to advise us on the setting up and operation of new industry. I think we have learned by now <Col N="271" /> that that was a mistake.  I wonder do we appreciate why it was a mistake? The reason is, if I bring in an expert from Central Europe in glass making, or anything else&mdash;I am not now making any specific reference to anybody&mdash; that expert is experienced in the production of glass in some town in Central Europe.  His expert knowledge is limited by a number of factors&mdash;the raw material available to him, the proximity of the source of supply, the type of clays available, the power supply, its cost and so forth, the particular type of plant evolved in his factory, the standard of the work, and, possibly, the nearness of some other industry.  He has worked so long in those surroundings that he has become an expert in a very narrow sphere and in a very limited sense.  Bring him over here and establish a similar industry under his control and direction.  What is the result?  His immediate reaction is that he tries to duplicate completely the conditions in his home town in Central Europe or he simply says that the work cannot be done at all.  In other words, he cannot accommodate himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them accommodated themselves very successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them did but, in the main, there were difficulties. I am not now making any specific references. I am merely expressing the inherent psychological difficulty of their accommodating themselves to new conditions.  Our own people are not suffering from that particular type of inhibition.  Given the proper basic training, they will make a better job of it.  That is perhaps a small point, but I think we have learned now by our experience in the past.  We need not go beyond our own people but the <i>sine qua non</i> is that they must be properly trained.  That brings me back again to our colleges.  Let us not be narrow when it comes to a question of pure research.  It may be that some particular section of a college is at the moment dealing with something that appears to be purely academic.  If the <Col N="272" /> director of such a college is training students in physics and chemistry&mdash;he is doing a good job of work.  Quite often, if local interests develop he is the man who will help in the solution of the practical problems that arise.  Do not stint him.  I would ask the Minister not to consider so much little scholarships to individual workers as the making available of sufficient sums for the purchase of substantial apparatus and the provision of such facilities as are vitally essential in our research work.  I make that plea because I believe that that in itself would be a substantial contribution to industrial research.</P>
      <P>We have not here in this country, as far as I know, any school of electro-chemistry. I imagine electro-chemistry has a very important bearing on modern industrial research.  I would appeal to the Minister to help in the establishment of some school for research students in electro-chemistry in one of our colleges.  In that respect it is essential that this new institute committee should be consulted with regard to the facilities that should be provided.  As a natural corollary to that, it will be our college professors in the main who will provide the background and the driving force behind the scientific part of this work.  I will go so far as to say that I would defy anybody to set up such a body and omit our university professors from its personnel. I would ask the Minister to consult them in regard to the link up with their colleges.  I think that is sufficient comment from me on a Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer.  I think it was mentioned by another Deputy to-day.  I think it would be easier if the question of the remuneration of the executive committee were decided apart from themselves and the question of the director <i>vis-à-vis</i> the others should be considered separately.  The Minister will get every bit as good service and as loyal co-operation from the committee with their chairman as their executive officer as he will by this rather hybrid arrangement of a director, subordinate, and semi-independent at the same time.  The administration <Col N="273" /> of the institute calls for no further comment except that it must be realised that normal Civil Service procedure will have to be abrogated to some extent here.  Now it is unfair to say this to the Minister whose Department above all other Departments of State has shown such an appreciation of practical difficulties in the solution of problems without being unduly tied by administrative routine and in saying this I should like to congratulate the Minister's Department on their achievements there.  But I think they will have to tackle the question of the relationships of this bureau very much in the same way as they tackled the relationships of the air transport problems and so on; that they must be prepared to realise that this is something which will have to run itself or not run at all, that delays resulting from administrative routine will kill any constructive project.</P>
    <P>Just imagine yourself a research worker engaged in a problem.  You are all keyed up and need a piece of apparatus.  If you have to get the sanction of the Department of Finance, if it has to go through routine channels, it will take months, and by the time the thing comes back, you have forgotten what you wanted.  As I say, it is hardly fair to the Minister to raise it in connection with his Department which is conspicuous by its efficiency and its attempt to act in a practical manner.  I know his officers will co-operate in every way they can in the problem, but I think it is a danger inherent in the system and I think that some steps should be taken to guard against it.  It all depends on what the Minister decides with regard to the director.  There may be the question of status.</P>
    <P>But let us not make the director of research subordinate to a principal officer in the Department of Finance. Let us not do that or anything like it. This man should&mdash;if he is the chairman of the committee&mdash;have direct access to the Minister and the Secretary of the Department.  If not, then the chairman of that committee should have direct access to them.  An arrangement something like the State <Col N="274" /> laboratory would not be in any way suitable for this.</P>
    <P>I think we should look at this matter clearly and analyse it down.  I should like to know what the Minister visualises most specifically in regard to the functions and in regard to the building.  I suggest that by the time he comes to the Committee Stage he should have a very clear idea as to what is involved, because there is no use in setting up an institute like this with the most grandiose notions and general terms of reference without making any proper provision for efficient working.  On the other hand, if proper provision is to be made for its efficient working, let us realise that it will have to be worked in a business-like manner.  After all, research is a question largely of organisation and business and that, in turn, will involve the selection of proper personnel.  Once selected, give them their general problem to work upon, not hampering them, but giving them a free hand to do the job without undue administrative restrictions and without interference in the conduct of their work in a way that would prejudice it.</P>

      <P>I will tell the Deputy a story connected with the employment of pure scientists for the resolution of an industrial research problem.  I invested <Col N="275" /> my money at one time in a company which was going to extract a mineral from the bosom of mother earth and which we proposed to sell for export abroad.  In the course of operations we discovered that there was, running through the commodity we were proposing to export, an impurity. Our industrial problem was to get the impurity out of it.  We did not care what the impurity was.  All we wanted was to get it out.  If we could get it out, we could sell the commodity. If we could not, the commodity was virtually so much dross.  If we had gone to a firm like Baker, Perkins and Co., Ltd., one of the industrial research enterprises in Great Britain, and dumped our problem in their lap, they would have put their technicians on it and either provided a solution or charged no fee.  We did not do that. We consulted very able scientists of the purest possible kind who were scientists <i>pur sang.</i>  They went to work on it and we waited; the equipment and the building and the machinery grew, and grew and grew, and the impurity steadfastly and resolutely remained. When we would up the company in insolvency, with all our capital gone, the scientists, in perfect good faith, told us that an expenditure of another £2,500 and a further 18 months of time would probably bring them to the solution of the problem with which they were confronted.  But by that time we had no money left, nor had the company.  As the Minister knows, our enterprise reached an inglorious end.  That was largely due to the fact that there was not a proper understanding of the fundamental difference between pure research and industrial research.  Therefore, I want to say to the Minister that I very much doubt if a body of this kind will serve the purpose that he has in mind.  So far as I know, if I understand the term &ldquo;industrial research&rdquo; correctly, it means the resolution of particular and peculiar problems of industrial enterprise in this country which their own resources are not adequate to resolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in existence in every industrial country in the world a group of firms, of which Baker, Perkins and Company Limited, is one.  They are <Col N="276" /> engaged in the manufacture of bakers' ovens and bakehouse equipment, but they have a subsidiary that undertakes to resolve the industrial problems of a particularly small group of industries.  If you are operating an industry within the ambit of that small group and come up against some such problem as confronted us, instead of rambling round laboratories in order to get well-intentioned scientists, you simply go to one of the best firms, like Baker, Perkins and Company, dump your problem in their lap and say: &ldquo;Can you resolve that difficulty for us?&rdquo;  I understand the terms are that they will undertake to solve it.  If they succeed, you have to pay a very stiff fee, but the understanding is that if they do not succeed they make no charge.  So far as I can recall, there is no firm in any industrial country in the world which will hold itself out as being prepared to tackle the industrial problems of any industry.  It may be that I am wrong, but I never heard of such a one.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing to set up in this country is a body of persons with virtually no industrial experience, because we have not very much industrial experience in this country to draw upon, together with a group of scientists.  We are going to charge them with the responsibility of accepting an assignment from any industry in this country to investigate any problem that may be dumped into their laps.  I do not believe that you can constitute such a body at all.  I think it is an altogether wrong approach.  There are, I think, Deputies who imagine that, if we set up a body of this kind, great and epoch-making discoveries will be made under its patronage by Irish brains.  I do not believe for a moment that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has any intention of proceeding along those lines.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what the procedure is.  If you want to facilitate a scientist who is conducting what we may describe as research at large, you must have some prospect at the end of his operations that he will get somewhere, that there will be some concrete result of his work.  Now, in the <Col N="277" /> capitalist countries, as I understand it, the prime examples are du Pont in America and the I.C.I. in England.</P>
    <P>If their talent scouts locate in any university a young chemist of particular brilliance in a particular branch of chemistry, they are prepared to go to that fellow and say: &ldquo;We will give you £600 a year for ten or 15 years, a laboratory and unlimited resources to go in and follow your particular bent on the condition that whatever turns up in the course of your experiments will be the property of the firm that employs you.&rdquo;  It is in that way that most of the great revolutionary discoveries in the world of science were actually made.  Sulphonamide drugs were discovered by a gentleman who was speculating with dyes in the Fahrben Industrie of Germany.  It was the German equivalent of I.C.I.</P>
    <P>Is it suggested that this body will set up a laboratory for a brilliant student of one of our universities, give him a long contract and an unlimited endowment, and tell him to get to work to see if anything will turn up?  I can picture the face of the Minister for Finance if any such proposal is pressed upon him. In any case, even if the attempt were made I do not believe it would work, because if you put a fellow in an isolated laboratory of that kind, outside any great organisation such as the Imperial Chemicals Institute or du Point or the German Fahrben Industrie, that measure of isolation cuts him off in a way which will render his activities sterile and ineffective.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I come back to the query, what is this research body intended to do?  I very much doubt if any Deputy, or even the Minister, has any clear view of what is intended.  But it is a lovely idea, setting up an industrial research council and any of its discoveries will become the property of the Minister.  You could imagine somebody discovering the counterpart of the safety pin, the Minister for Industry and Commerce patenting it, and the Irish Exchequer making millions out of it.  But, it is just not going to happen, and so I am rather inclined to believe that this is just another bit of Fianna Fáil window-dressing.</P>
    <P>It is like the Institute of Higher <Col N="278" /> Studies, a home for scholars, set up by our scholarly Taoiseach, and it ultimately becomes a repository for all the broken-down old duds in the country, a mighty citadel from whose portals nothing will emerge but thrice ten thousand times checked manuscripts of unprecedented precision and perfection. Some of these publications would disgrace a well-run national school. But, of course, nobody gives a damn.</P>
    <P>There is nobody in this House competent to read them, whether they were well or ill-written, and anyone daring to criticise them would be described as an acrimonious and contentious politician who was trying to make little of the Taoiseach, while anybody who declares them to be the most perfect production of learning since the dawn of time, is invited to the next tea party given in Dublin Castle as a man who has given ample evidence of his high cultural equipment and his capacity to appreciate the products of the Institute of Higher Studies, which is now a decrepit and rapidly declining damp squib.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a pity if we set up a counterpart here and have another dud of that character upon our hands. I do not deny that it may be desirable to have a body which would have at its disposal funds to endow a specific research proposition that might be submitted to it by a duly accredited student or professor of any university in the country.  It is quite true many excellent students and savants in this country have been prevented from pursuing very desirable research because they had not the money with which to finance it.  If the Minister sets up a body which would, on occasion, if they were satisfied that a specific piece of work was worth having done and there was a competent man prepared to deal with it, he might recommend to the Treasury the issue of an adequate grant to enable him to do the work, much might be said for a proposition of that kind.  If the Research Council is to take that form, I think it is something the House should favourably consider.</P>
    <P>The next point I come to is this.  If, despite my warning, an attempt is made to establish a Research Council which proposes to undertake the work <Col N="279" /> of a research department, such as Imperial Chemicals and du Pont, to solve any problems that are thrust upon them by the industrialists of the country and to endow individual pieces of research, Section 37 is suicidal, and if we pass Section 37 there is no use abusing the higher officers of the Department of Finance for being bureaucrats.  If you make the accounts of the industrial research tribunal, or whatever you call it, susceptible to examination and control by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that imposes on the officers of the Department of Finance certain statutory duties which they will have to discharge and the odium for the clog that they must be on the work of a body of this character will rest, not on the officers of the Department of Finance, who do their duty, but on this House, which imposes that duty on them.</P>
    <P>If you want a body of that kind, then your only hope to give it any chance of survival is to treat it on the same basis as the Congested Districts Board was treated in the old days, and that is to give them an annual grant and let them make the best use they can of it and let us judge at the end of the financial year from their report whether, by and large, we got good value for the money we gave them. If we did we should not be harrying them with the necessary regulations that must be imposed if you require the Comptroller and Auditor-General to account to this House for public money.  It is perfectly proper to give a body such as this a Grant-in-Aid and make each year's appropriation depend on whether this House is prepared to grant it or not, having considered the value for money represented by the previous year's report of progress.  But, once you give it to them, let them use it to the best advantage they can and let us judge by the results, not by a report made to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I say that as a Deputy of this House more solicitous, I imagine, than any other Deputy for the maintenance of the authority of the Comptroller and Auditor-General over the expenditure of public funds.  It is a great mistake to allow a mistaken solicitude in that regard to delude us into bringing the <Col N="280" /> Comptroller and Auditor-General into matters where he cannot function efficiently without preventing the enterprise we have set up from functioning at all&mdash;and no one would be quicker to tell Deputies that than the Comptroller and Auditor-General himself.</P>
    <P>The next thing I want to mention is a matter which I consider to be of vital importance, not only to the plans envisaged by this Bill, but to the country.  If we are going to embark on a policy of experimentation and research, let that be segregated from other current operations that are now in hands and have for many years been in successful progress in this country.  There is one glaring case and that is the experimentations that are being conducted by the Turf Development Board in the use of turf for the purpose of generating electricity. It is quite possible that that will be passed over to this new research body.</P>
    <P>What has happened there?  The Turf Development Board is concerned to justify its own existence, as this body will be concerned to justify its own existence.  They marched in and informed the Electricity Supply Board, whose primary function is to supply the power, light and heat that our people require, when they require it and where they require it, that they must abandon their development programme in order to adopt the fantastic, daft schemes at present sponsored by the Turf Development Board for the generation of electricity by turf.  Does this House realise that the Electricity Supply Board, having been set up in this country and having achieved such a degree of success, achieved that success largely because at a very early stage of their development they said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A body of our character must plan not only for next year but, with the statistical information available to us, must plan as precisely as we can for a ten-year period ahead.  We must anticipate the demand, where it is going to be and its volume, and we must have a ten-year programme of development all the time in front of us so that we will be in a position <Col N="281" /> to be always one jump ahead of the effective demand, never in a position of having our machinery or resources labouring under what consumers actually require.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As a result of that look at what the Electricity Supply Board has done for this country.  Look at the phenomenon of service and efficiency and informed foresight that it has been.</P>
    <P>Into that whole complex scheme of planning and foresight and devising to ensure that our people would always have, not only enough, but the economical minimum surplus to ensure a full supply of power, light and heat at every stage, the Turf Development Board come prancing and they say: &ldquo;Tear all that up because we want to build a power station in a bog in West Mayo.  Your plan of development provides for a station here, a station there, a hydro-electric scheme somewhere else, a careful marshalling of resources so as to bear the load effectively without over-burdening any of your equipment.  Tear all that up. It does not matter that, in your plan, development should be located near Cork and Dublin so as to ease the load on the Shannon or on the Erne or on Poulaphouca.  We are going to put a station in Ballycastle, in North Mayo, because there is a bog there.</P>
    <P>We are not interested in the fact that the size of the station we have planned will consume the whole bog in 25 years and that there are not enough people within 100 miles of the station to consume one-quarter of the energy we propose to produce there.  So, you must put down your plant beside a fuel supply which we reckon will last 25 years, which will be costing countless thousands to dry and carry it to the furnaces to produce the electricity, and you must then carry the electricity clear across the country, losing a large percentage of it on the way in dissipation in the air.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that kind of draft, crazy, political rackets are going to be run in this country let the bodies responsible for them bear the responsibility.  Let them get technical help and advice from the Electricity Supply Board, but let the Turf Development Board or the Research <Col N="282" /> Council operate their own crackport turf station and, when it collapses and is revealed for the rotten fraud it is, let the blame be borne by those who foisted it upon us.  Let it not be concealed in the accounts of the Electricity Supply Board and justified by the reputation of men who accept the responsibility for these crazy, draft enterprises because they are too loyal to speak in public the views which I have very little doubt they communicated to the Minister under the seal of official secrecy.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House.  It is bad enough to have the Turf Board as a blister on the Electricity Supply Board but I can envisage a day when some of this industrial research business might be planted as a blister on industries in this country that are standing on their own feet and ask no help but demand that they shall not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>If the experience of the Electricity Supply Board is anything to go by, I do not envy the prospects of industrialists who come in contact with this creation, but I take this opportunity of directing the attention of the House to the real, to the grievous injury which is at this moment being done to one of the best things we have created since an Irish Government was set up here in the name of the rotten, draft, political racket of turf.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies know that you cannot get from the Electricity Supply Board permission to heat any premises at the present and that you will not get it for the next five or ten years because the Electricity Supply Board will not be allowed to carry out the development requisite to undertake the load that would exist were heating facilities made available to the public?  Do Deputies know that if you want to put in a heating installation to-morrow you will not be allowed to do so?  You must use another fuel because the Electricity Supply Board have not got, and will not be allowed to get, the means of supplying electric power for heating purposes.</P>

I am perfectly entitled to submit the analogy in relation to the Turf Development Board.  That board began for the purpose of developing the hand-winning of turf. Deputies will remember the bags and the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling us that he solemnly declared that hand-won turf would yet be the greatest industry in this country, save only the agricultural industry, and that he looked forward to the day when 75,000 able-bodied men would be earning a good living on the bogs of Ireland cutting turf for their neighbours. That was the genesis of that plan.  The bags went down the drain&mdash; they vanished&mdash;and the hand-won turf went down the drain.</P>

I am warning this House of what is happening under its own eyes. I challenge members of the Fianna Fáil Party to say how many of them know the consequences to the Electricity Supply Board of having turf planted on it.  If this proposal passes <Col N="287" /> into law how long will it be before this House wakes up to the position?</P>
      <P>As to standard value, I think it has a certain value, in so far as it authorises a standard for specific commodities which will be allowed in to be stamped with the mark described in the Bill.  To anyone familiar with trade that is, in fact, of little consequence. I remember how it was due to this device that one of the most delicious deceptions&mdash;not to use any stronger word&mdash;I ever witnessed was perpetrated.</P>
      <P>I remember when the Cement Bill was before this House that, at the time, the Danish cartel wished to establish themselves inside our tariff wall.  At that time the Danes wanted to come into the industry with a guarantee against competition from the Polish and Spanish cement industries. One of the recommendations that the Minister for Industry and Commerce advanced for the Cement Bill was that this Danish cartel had undertaken to produce in Ireland Portland cement, under standard British specification, and I remember Fianna Fáil Deputies getting up and asking, who wanted anything better than standard British specification. We never thought we would get that here.  But they were quite oblivious of the fact that the standard specification referred to was fixed in 1902, had not been revised, and that there was no cement merchant in the four corners of the earth, no builder, no contractor and no architect, who would use cement of British standard specification.  All the cement now used is British standard specification, plus 60 per cent.  As a matter of fact, two years before the war there was a new British standard specification.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  Is not this body going to set up a standard specification for Ireland?  Do Deputies understand the position at all, or do they know what they are doing?  That is the tragedy of it, Deputies do not know what they are doing.  If that is the only use this Bill is going to be put to, in practice it will be found <Col N="288" /> that standard specifications mean nothing, because they are no sooner made than they get out of date.  The ordinary commercial specification far outstrips any rigid specification.  You may create the illusion in the mind of the average consumer that an article which, in commercial practice, is marked &ldquo;standard specification&rdquo; is perfection.  Deputies were fooled in that way.  The obligation imposed under the Cement Act on the cement company was to produce cement of British standard specification.  If they ever produced or attempted to sell it they would have gone out of business long ago.  Instead of that, they are selling a very fine quality cement, which is 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. better than the British standard specification referred to in the Act under which it was set up.  If that is the only purpose here I suggest that the House should think twice about it.</P>
      <P>There is another function for the bureau, and that is, that if we invest it with authority to examine medicinal and other proprietary preparations put upon the market, with the right to buy commercial samples of such commodities and to examine them, and having done so to determine whether the claims made by the proprietors in respect to them are true or false, and so declare to the public, then that bureau will serve some purpose.  In America the Bureau of Standards has a right to come down on the makers of preparations which claim to do that which their constituents manifestly cannot do.  Deputies will remember that four or five years before the war a firm was set up to sell cattle food which was supposed to perform miracles, on the grounds of its vitamin qualities, and it was found that there was very little that could be done about it.  If the bureau was there it could have bought a package of that stuff, examined the claim of its manufacturers, side by side with the scientific analysis of the laboratory, and then published notice that the preparation was fraudulent, and that persons were warned not to touch it. I am not surprised that I cannot find in the Bill any such power.</P>

      <P>The Minister can correct me when he is winding up.  If this body has power to do that, and has effective means of enforcing its decisions, then I think that is well.  Do not expect more than it is right and reasonable to demand.  I think you could put a proviso in the Bill to restrain the research department of the bureau from passing the baby to somebody else.  You could put that obligation upon them to carry them out until they fall to pieces, like some of the experiments we have seen here below.  Subject to those precautions I am thoroughly in favour of the establishment of some kind of bureau.  Let us remember, however, when we are asked for the money to pay for it the true nature of what we may hope to get and let us take effective precautions to ensure that it does not become a dumping ground for the Fianna Fáil crocks, as so many analogous institutions of this character have been made in the past.</P>

      <P>A characteristic of a democratic Assembly is the right of a member to talk nonsense, if he wants to, subject to relevancy.  The Chair is the arbiter on relevancy.  Deputy Dillon has just demonstrated the democratic character of this institution by talking utter nonsense.  That is his right, and every Deputy in the House will protect his right to talk nonsense. They may think it a shame that at this late hour in the day time should be wasted by Deputy Dillon in talking irrelevant nonsense on a Bill he has not read and treating us to a fandango of misrepresentations and grotesque inventions which have no relation to the matter under discussion here and which were reiterated by him merely for the purpose of wasting the time of the House.

      <P>I am stating something which every Deputy in the House <Col N="290" /> already knows and understands.  In case anybody in this House was misled by Deputy Dillon's statements in relation to the Electricity Board and the Turf Board, I want to repeat that his statements were utter nonsense.  There is not a scintilla of truth in them.  They are the product of his own imagination, or of the imagination of somebody who has been pulling Deputy Dillon's leg, a pastime of which most of us in this House have become a little wearied. This discussion was proceeding in a rational and common-sense way until Deputy Dillon arrived.  We had listened to a number of useful contributions to the debate, practical speeches on the issues involved in this Bill.  I had hoped that the discussion would have continued upon that note and it would, in fact, have concluded on that note had not Deputy Dillon arrived, a little bored with whatever he had been doing previously, to listen to the discussion, find out what it is about, and to make a long speech without having given the matter any previous thought or study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proposing here to establish an industrial research institute and a standards institute combined.  It is quite true that we could have decided to establish two separate organisations to discharge both the functions given to this institute.  In most other countries there are separate institutions for industrial research and for standards. Having regard to our limited resources in personnel I think it is desirable to utilise the one organisation for both purposes.  It is clear we must have two supervising authorities and the Bill provides for separate authorities in relation to industrial research and in relation to standards.  These authorities, however, will work in the same institute, utilise the same equipment and the same staff.  I think that such an arrangement will be not merely economic from the financial point of view but it will be also economic as far as our resources in staff and equipment are concerned.  I do not fear, as Deputy de Valera seems to fear, that the standards work falling upon the institute will be so heavy that the staff will necessarily be occupied with it to the exclusion of the industrial research work.  I shall deal <Col N="291" /> more fully later with the question of standards, but it is contemplated that the resources which will be given to the institute will be sufficiently adequate to enable it properly to discharge its functions as set out under the Bill.  It is not necessary to draw any distinction between pure research and industrial research for the purposes of understanding how this institute will work. The functions of the institute are clearly stated in Section 5.  It is not concerned so much with scientific research as with the application of scientific knowledge to industrial problems. Its purpose is to undertake and foster scientific research with the object of promoting the utilisation of the natural resources of the State, improving the technical processes and methods used in the industries of the State, and discovering technical processes and methods which may promote or facilitate the expansion of existing or the development of new industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The best illustration I can give to the House of the type of problem contemplated for investigation by the industrial research committee is that dealt with by the existing Industrial Research Council. Deputy de Valera made some references, which I could not understand, to the reports of the Industrial Research Council.  The annual reports of the Industrial Research Council have been published and are available to the Deputy in the Library of the House.  That council was given specific tasks to perform and specific subjects to investigate.  It was, for instance, known that peat contained wax.  They were asked to carry out experiments in the extraction of wax from peat with a view to utilising commercially the process of extraction thereby discovered.  Their report on that subject was eventually prepared and published.  It is known that certain industrial materials can be obtained from seaweed.  The Industrial Research Council was asked to investigate whether the types of seaweed utilised in industry were available on the Irish coast and, if not, whether it would be possible to <Col N="292" /> cultivate them around the Irish coast. That investigation is still proceeding. It is known that turf will burn.  The council were asked to investigate the most suitable type of equipment for the burning of turf and a report on that subject was published which led to the commercial manufacture of the Taylor range and other types of turf burning apparatus.  I mention these matters merely for the purpose of illustration and to indicate the practical basis upon which the institute will carry out the functions given to it under Section 5.  It is quite clear that, while as a result of the activities of the industrial research committee, the technical possibilities of various industrial processes will be established, the economic potentialities of these processes must be further examined. Deputy de Valera referred to electro-chemical industries.  So far as I can discover, most electro-chemical industries are practicable in this country from the scientific point of view, but are impracticable from the economic point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that there are considerations which would justify some development of these industries other than economic considerations; but, having regard to the existing state of industrial development here and the cost of electricity, the size of our market and other problems, there are economic difficulties which may militate against the development of this type of industry long after the industrial research committee has demonstrated their scientific practicability. In that connection I would like to explain that this industrial research institute will have no responsibility for demonstrating the economic possibility of any industrial process.  The economic possibilities of industrial processes will be primarily a matter for examination by private enterprise.  We have here, I think, a deficiency in our organisation in so far as it is not at present possible to do more than undertake scientific investigation of industrial processes, which will be done by the new industrial research institute. I may, at some stage, bring to the Dáil proposals to give powers to some existing organisation to investigate and report on the economic possibilities of <Col N="293" /> such developments where it is obvious the developments will not be undertaken in the near future or on an adequate scale by private industrial firms. Deputy de Valera considers it would be wiser for the industrial research committee to work through the laboratories of the existing universities.  I do not agree.  It is intended that the institute will have its own laboratory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to state my point of view on some of the matters raised by Deputies who might have in contemplation amendments for consideration on the Report Stage. I want to make it clear that I contemplate an institute which will control its own laboratories and its own staff.  They may assist financially in the undertaking of individual researches in the laboratories of universities; but, primarily, they will work independently of the universities. It should be understood that this Bill is not intended to be a device by which public funds can be made available to provide equipment or develop the research resources of university colleges, nor is it intended to be a means by which useful occupation can be found for the technical department of the Army.  As a general principle, I am against trying to kill two birds with one stone.  I have <Col N="295" /> always found in my life that it is a foolish thing to attempt to do.  We are setting up this institute primarily with the intention of having industrial research work carried out.  If, incidentally, assistance can be given to universities or work provided for the technical department of the Army, well and good.  But it should be understood that the responsibilities of the committees of this institute will be to undertake the functions set out in the Bill and no other function.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes stated that we have not spent and are not proposing to spend enough on industrial research and that it is undesirable to rely for scientific knowledge and information on institutes in other countries. While there is a great deal to be said for that point of view, we must approach this matter in a practical way.  It would be foolish to ignore scientific work that is being done in the institutes of other countries and that is available to us.  One of the most important services undertaken by the Industrial Research Council was through its library and information bureau which made available to industrialists and the Emergency Research Bureau an accumulation of information on scientific matters and industrial problems secared through the activities of research institutes elsewhere.  I feel that a large part of the work of this committee on industrial research must be devoted to adapting to the particular circumstances of this country the conclusions which industrial research institutes elsewhere have arrived at in relation to other circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell, I think, need not be concerned at the prospect of the standards committee producing a number of impracticable standards which will be a handicap to industry.  It is my intention to ensure that the committee will endeavour to work in the preparation of standards in close consultation with the manufacturing and trading interests concerned.  The preparation of a standard specification can serve many purposes.  It facilitates business contracts.  Reference was made to the standard specification for <Col N="296" /> cement.  The existence of such a standard specification facilitates contracts between persons for construction work involving cement, because they need merely specify cement of the prescribed standard without having to enter into elaborate details to ensure that the work to be done will be of the quality they require.  The publication of a standard specification, therefore, facilitates commercial contracts and it helps to promote industrial production by the reduction of the number of types of goods in commercial use and by adapting the requirements of commerce to the productive capacity of Irish manufacturing concerns.  The standardisation of component parts should also be an aim to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Over and above these economic conditions, there are social aims which must not be lost sight of.  I refer to the development of a standard specification for workers' boots.  That would not mean that a boot would be described in the specification which would be so perfect that it would be impossible for any existing manufacturing concern to produce it and too dear for any worker to buy.  Clearly, such a specification would be prepared in consultation with the manufacturing interests and would have to be related not merely to the requirements of the market, but also to the productive capacity of existing Irish concerns.  By means of such a standard specification not merely can the manufacturing industry of the country be facilitated, but the public can also be helped to protect themselves against inferior quality by reason of the fact that articles conforming to the standard specification will bear a standard mark.</P>
    <P>It should be made clear that the institute will not be concerned with the efficiency of industry.  It will have no responsibility either in relation to the efficiency with which industries concerned are carried on or the cost of production.  We may have to have some other organisation to meet public requirements in that regard.  The function of this institute is to facilitate industrial production and raise the standard of commercial practice by means of its standard specifications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Reference was made to interference with industry.  There can be no misunderstanding the provisions of the Bill.  There is no question of interference unless where articles which do not conform to the standard specification are falsely described as being of that character.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, apparently not having read the Bill, naturally did not realise that one of the main functions given to this institute is to take articles offered for sale and analyse them and publish the result of such tests and analyses.  It is intended that the protection of the public against false descriptions of goods and other undesirable commercial practices will be assisted in that way.  By one of the sections of the Bill the committee is protected against any action for damages by reason of the publication of the results of such tests and analyses.  Reference was made&mdash;and this will illustrate the point&mdash;to an attempt made recently to put on sale as a cattle medicine a material which, on analysis, proved to be only iron filings.  The Minister for Agriculture published that fact and took full responsibility. The person concerned started, but did not continue, an action for damages.  If this Bill had been in operation, such an analysis would have been carried out by the institute and the result would have been published by the institute and an action for damages would not arise.</P>
    <P>There is in America a body which publishes a very interesting publication which goes under the name of <i>One Hundred Million Suckers.</i>  It sets out to give an analysis of proprietary goods sold under proprietary names in America.  That book is published and widely circulated.  The body responsible for its publication proceeds on the assumption that its facts are so well founded and easily demonstrable that no action for damages will be taken against it.  I understand that no successful action has been taken against it.  This institute will have the responsibility of protecting the public against goods of inferior quality by the simple process of analysing the goods offered for sale and publishing the result of its analysis without risk of action in the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> I think the arrangement contemplated by this Bill for the establishment of a director with functions independent of the committee for industrial research is the wiser method.  We can discuss that matter in Committee, but I should like to point out that even if the director has an independent status, the control of the finances of the institute will rest firmly in the hands of the industrial research committee.</P>
    <P>The funds of the institute will be made up in three different ways.  First of all, there will be a grant for the erection of buildings and the provision of equipment.  The amount cannot be specified now, because the committee will have to be established and will have to prepare its plans and get an estimate of the cost of the works which it contemplates undertaking and the equipment it requires before a definite sum can be mentioned.  When that estimate is received from the committee a Vote of the Dáil, will be required to provide the money.  In addition, it will have £15,000 a year, over the expenditure of which it will have absolute discretion.  That money will be given to the committee to spend as they think best in the discharge of their functions and it is not required that they should obtain prior sanction from anybody for the use of that money in connection with industrial research or any other matter.</P>
    <P>In addition to that £15,000 annual grant, it may get special grants voted by the Dáil to cover the cost of special investigations approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Apart from fees that might come in from private persons, all its finances will be from public funds and all will have to be voted by the Dáil so that the Dáil at all times will be in control of the situation.  The scheme of giving an annual subvention of £15,000 ensures that the institute will be able to operate without danger of being tied up in red tape, as Deputy de Valera fears.  There are other matters with which I would like to deal, but in view of the time at my disposal I will not do so now.</P>
