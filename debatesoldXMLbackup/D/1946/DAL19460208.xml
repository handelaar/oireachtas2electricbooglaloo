    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>31a.  To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following subsections:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  If, at any time after the rate in the pound of the rate for a local financial year has been determined by a rating authority, it appears to the Minister that such rate at such rate in the pound is likely to be insufficient to meet the part defrayable out of rates of the expenses to be incurred by the rating authority in that financial year in&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  maintaining at a reasonable standard the public services for the maintenance of which the <Col N="720" /> rating authority is responsible, and</P>
    <P>(b)  paying to any other body any sums which the rating authority are bound to supply to that body,</P>
    <P>the Minister, after holding a local inquiry into the sufficiency of such rate, may require the rating authority either to revoke such determination and determine a new rate in the pound for such rate or (if by reason of any steps already taken for the making, levying or collecting of such rate, such a course is more convenient) determine a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate for that local financial year.</P>
    <P>(2)  Within 14 days after the date of the receipt by the secretary or clerk of a rating authority of notification that a requirement has been made under sub-section (1) of this section, the rating authority shall comply with such requirement.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a rating authority determine pursuant to a requirement under sub-section (1) of this section a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate, it shall be the duty of the rating authority to make, levy, collect and recover such supplementary rate.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a rating authority in relation to whom a requirement is made under sub-section (1) of this section determine and make pursuant to the direction either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a new rate in the pound of a rate, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate,</P>
    <P>which in the opinion of the Minister is insufficient, the Minister may by Order remove from office the members of the rating authority.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of Part IV of the Act of 1941, an Order under sub-section (4) of this section shall be deemed to be an order under Section 44 of that Act and the removal from office of the members of the rating authority concerned shall be deemed to be a removal from office under that section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> (6)  Where a person or persons has or have been appointed under Part IV of the Act of 1941 to be a commissioner or commissioners for a rating authority whose members have been removed from office, such person or persons may revoke any determination by the rating authority of a rate in the pound of a rate for the current or the next local financial year as had been made before his or their appointment (whether it is the first determination of a rate in the pound, the determination of the rate in the pound of a new rate or the determination of the rate in the pound of a supplementary rate) and may determine the rate in the pound of such rate as if no earlier determination had been made or may determine a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate for such local financial year and make, levy, collect and recover such supplementary rate.&rdquo;&mdash;(Aire Rialtais Aitiúil agus Sláinte Poiblí.)</P>

      <P>This is an extraordinary amendment introduced in a very extraordinary way, and if I may say so, at a rather extraordinary time.  We had the Parliamentary Secretary warning us the other day, when certain small increases were asked for employees of local authorities, that, in view of the fact that there were likely to be very large increases in rates during the coming year, local authorities had to be very careful in regard to what they did.  They could not, for instance, dream of raising the wages for road workers, say in South Tipperary, by more than 5/- over the pre-war level. On top of that warning, we have grandiose schemes suggested with regard to road-making in one way or another and we have the expenditure contemplated by the Public Health Bill.  These are the things that are foreshadowed just at the moment. When this Bill was ordered to be printed and circulated in October, 1945, Section 23 considered that circumstances might arise in which it might appear to a local authority having struck a rate, that it was really insufficient to meet the expenditure of the coming year and the section, as then drafted, gave powers to the local <Col N="722" /> authority to strike a supplementary rate.  Now we find in an amendment handed to us in the last few days a complete change of attitude as a result of which the Minister takes power finally and completely to control local authorities.</P>
      <P>We have under amendment 31 a really a proposal completely to wipe out local government because the amendment provides that &ldquo;if, at any time after the rate in the pound of the rates for a local financial year has been determined by a rating authority, it appears to the Minister that such rate at such rate in the pound is likely to be insufficient to meet the part defrayable out of rates of the expenses to be incurred by the rating authority in that financial year in, (a) maintaining at a reasonable standard the public services for the maintenance of which the rating authority is responsible, and (b) paying to any other body any sums which the rating authority is bound to supply to that body, the Minister, after holding a local inquiry into the sufficiency of such rate,&rdquo; may require the rating authority to make an adequate rate. Then within fourteen days after the date of the receipt by the secretary or clerk of a rating authority of notification that a requirement has been made under sub-section (1), the Minister can wipe out the local body and his commissioner can proceed to mark any particular rate that the Minister dictates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This comes on top of a situation in which, apart from any further addition to the burdens of the ratepayers, very substantial additions have already been made both between 1932 and 1939 and since the war began.  For instance, the total amount collected in rates in the year ended March, 1932, was £4,677,000.  By March, 1939, that had risen to £6,270,000 and by 1942, the last year for which figures have been issued in the Department's publications, the total amount of rates collected in the country was £7,500,000, an increase of nearly £3,000,000 over 1932.  When we consider the 1932 level and examine how much money has been taken out of the ratepayers' pockets over the 1932 level for the first seven years of the Government's administration up to <Col N="723" /> March, 1939 before the war situation created any difficulties here, we find that £13,317,000 were paid by the ratepayers of this country more than they would have had to pay if the 1932 level had been maintained.  The total amount of rates taken from the people had gone up, on an average over six years, by 29 per cent.  For the three years from March, 1939 to March, 1942, the last three years for which we have information, there was an additional £6,700,000 taken from the ratepayers, over the 1932 level.  I said that the rates collected in 1942 were nearly £3,000,000 more than in the year 1932. Since the Government came into office and up to March of last year about £28,800,000 more were collected in rates alone than if the rates had been maintained at the 1932 level.  When we turn to taxation, we find that the same thing has gone on.</P>

      <P>Section 23 gives power to the local authority, when it appears to them that the rates are not sufficient, to take steps to strike a sufficient rate.  The Minister now, in his amendment, wipes that out, and arranges that when that appears to the Minister he can wipe out the local authority; he can send down his commissioner, and can make his commissioner strike any rate that the Minister thinks right.  That was not introduced on the Second Reading of this Bill, and, if we cannot thoroughly argue it here now, I shall be constrained to make a point of order that this amendment is <Col N="724" /> out of order because it radically and completely changes the proposal that is in the Bill already.</P>

      <P>It was discussed for an hour yesterday, and it would be rather late to raise the matter now.  What the Chair is concerned with is that the increase in rates over 15 years is not relevant to this amendment, which gives power possibly to strike a second rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am declining to give power to the Minister for Local Government completely to take the power of the purse out of the hands of local authorities.  I am declining on the ground that&mdash;if you will allow me just to put it in round figures&mdash;if you take the position of rates alone, and go back to 1932, and ask how many million pounds were taken out of the ratepayers' pockets from March, 1932, to March, 1945, more than would have been taken if the rates had been maintained at the 1932 level, the answer is £28,000,000.  You also find that the total amount of rates collected in 1932 was £4,677,000, and that the total amount collected in the year ended March, 1942, was £7,500,000.  It is, at any rate, not less now.  In taxation, by March, 1939, the Government which had promised to reduce taxation by £2,000,000 had taken £25,000,000 out of the pockets of the taxpayers more than was taken in the year in which they came in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If rates are relevant, how is taxation relevant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, Sir, the reason why the Minister threw all that additional burden over on the rates was that he had piled taxation so high on <Col N="725" /> the taxpayer that he had to do it.  That is why the Parliamentary Secretary the other day said that local authorities will have very heavy financial additions this year, and why the costs of public health and all those other things that are apparently being planned are to go over on the ratepayers.  The taxpayer cannot bear any more.  I do not want to try your patience too much, or to strain the situation too much, so I will not go into the dilapidated and weakened economy of the country from which, by 1939, all this additional money had been taken, but the facts are there.  Here we are getting to the position where we are asked to pass things in a light-hearted, broad and general way.  We are presented to us White Papers that are supposed to have on us the effect of the rising sun, to brighten our lives and stir our hearts.  Then all the cost goes on to the unfortunate ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment is defeated, we will at least have the local representatives of the country and the responsible local government mind of the people standing between themselves and robbery.  If we accept this amendment, there is not a local authority in the country into whose affairs there cannot simply be an inquiry, then a telegram telling them to strike a proper rate, and then inside 14 days another message saying that they are sacked; that a commissioner is going down, and that the commissioner had the Minister's instructions in his pocket as to how much is to be levied off the ratepayers of that local body for the maintenance of the services that he considers should be maintained. Because of what has passed&mdash; and so much has passed that the Parliamentary Secretary had to issue a warning the other day&mdash;and because of what is coming, and because of the opinion that Ministers have with regard to the economic conditions of this country, we find that in the case of one of our vital services, our roads, about which we have such grandiose schemes and which are such a real necessity, the Minister has told us that this country cannot pay more than 45/- a week to the permanent workers who are doing that work throughout the country, and who, if we had any <Col N="726" /> conscience or outlook on the social situation at all, should be able to keep a wife and family on the moneys they are paid for the maintenance of this vital service.  I challenge the Minister that he is completely taking power over local authorities, and taking it in a most suspicious way.  I ask him what is meant or what will be meant by that provision in the Second Schedule to the County Management Act, 1940, which says that the making of a rate is a reserved function of a local authority?  The Minister is stepping in here and taking complete power over the fundamentally reserved powers that a local authority has.  It is wiping out local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much, Sir, that Deputy Allen is not here to-day. When we adjourned last night, Deputy Allen was making a vigorous attack on this amendment.  It rained very hard during the night, and I hope that the rain has not damped Deputy Allen's ardour, because I would have been very happy to march behind him into the Lobby to vote against this amendment. We frequently hear complaints that young men are not taking part in public life in this country.  Now, the first step, and practically the only step, that a young man can take in order to take part in public life, is to get elected on a local council.  What incentive or encouragement is there to a young man, who takes his responsibility in public life seriously, and who becomes a member of a local council, when he finds that a power that is supposed to be vested in him&mdash;the power to control the finances of a local area&mdash;is wantonly taken from him?  He may, while still a young man, have the slur cast upon him of being a member of a local authority that was dissolved for incompetence and inefficiency.  As Deputy Sheldon pointed out last night, these local councils are elected on as broad a franchise as that on which this House is elected.  They are elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage, and the authority they obtain is as great as the authority which this House is given by the electorate.</P>

      <P>I quite agree that the National Assembly should have authority over a local assembly; that is to say, a local council, elected for a local area, should not have the right to defy the National Assembly; but since the local council is elected on as democratic a basis as this House is elected on, the only authority which should have the power to dissolve a local council is this House, by direct vote. The Minister, who is simply an official of this House, should not have the right to say that a local authority should be dissolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of replying later.  I say that we are bringing democracy into disrepute if we allow a section such as this to become part of our law; a section under which all power to decide what is an adequate rate is taken out of the hands of the local representatives, and under which a Minister here in Dublin, who may conscientiously believe that he is right, takes upon himself to decide what is in the best interests of a local area. Surely, the people who elect representatives <Col N="728" /> in any county ought to be recognised as having a certain amount of intelligence, and surely the freely elected members of the people ought to be credited with a certain amount of knowledge of their own requirements. They ought to be able to decide what is best for their county, and what are the particular finances that are required to run the services of their county.  The clash of opinion that might arise between the Minister and a county council is merely a difference of opinion, and either side might be right or wrong.  There is one way to settle the question, and that is to bring it before this House by motion&mdash;not to leave it to a Minister, at his discretion or indiscretion, to act in a manner which probably would be feasible in Russia or some other totalitarian State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen, last night, I think, raised the torch of freedom and democracy in this House.  He asserted the right of the locally elected representatives to discharge their duty with out having their rights infringed upon and without being treated in a tyrannical manner.  A locally elected council is a council of a number of individuals. There are many minds grouped together in considering the problems which face them.  The Minister is only one mind.  His mind may be a very broad mind, a very high mind, and a very noble mind, but on the other hand his mind may be a very narrow mind, a very low mind, and a very ignoble mind; but still his is only one mind, and one mind should not be allowed to dominate a democratic assembly in a county which has local knowledge&mdash;knowledge not only of what is required in the local services, but knowledge of the capacity of the local people to pay.  I think that the Minister should withdraw this amendment. Personally, I am not only against this amendment, but against the section as it stands, because the section is also open to very considerable objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that the change which has been made by the Minister in Section 23 by the amendment he now submits is unquestionably <Col N="729" /> a violent change, and that he is not correct when he suggests that the amendment really gives effect to the suggestions which were made originally on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I think that Deputies who were present on that occasion will agree that the burden of the complaints in regard to this section was that, as it stood, it would lead to slipshod estimating and that further, it would lead to confusion; that once the rate was struck it was possible to have a supplementary estimate, and the ratepayers would not know where they stood.  I say that this change is a violent one, because Section 23 at least gives power to the local authority to settle its own affairs, whereas the amendment proposed by the Minister takes that authority away completely from the local authority and prescribes certain penalties if certain instructions are not carried out.  I suggest that the rights of these people are amply preserved and catered for under the existing law, and particularly by the County Management Act of 1940, Section 25 (1) of which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The council of a county or an elective body may, at any time after they have adopted under this Act an estimate of expenses for any local financial year, consent by resolution to the expenditure of money or the incurring of a liability in excess of the expenditure for any particular purpose specified in such estimate....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggest that in practice that is precisely what has been taking place in the councils.  If they found that a mistake had been made in their estimating and that an increased expenditure was necessary they arranged for that by getting an overdraft or some such means, and that was met in the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the following year, yes.  I suggest that what the Minister is doing, despite what he states on particular occasions, is that he is taking from the borough councils and county councils the one really supreme power that they are supposed <Col N="730" /> to have on the day of striking the rates, that that power is completely taken away from them by the effect of this amendment, because they have a threat hanging over them that, if they do not do particular things on that date, certain things will happen. It is quite possible&mdash;instances can be quoted&mdash;that on the date of the striking of the rate a communication will be received from the Minister for Local Government asking for the inclusion in the estimate of certain amounts. Very often, the local authority, on consideration, do not see the wisdom of including the amounts, which may be comparatively minor matters.  Under the amendment, if they decline to include such an amount when ordered by the Minister on an occasion of that kind, they are liable to be suspended.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the amendment implies a feeling of distrust so far as local aúthorities are concerned which is certainly not justified.  My experience, and I think it is the experience generally of members of local authorities, is that on an occasion of that kind local authorities approach the question with prudence and certainly with consideration of their responsibility, which, by the way, is conditioned very largely by the fact that they are in close touch with their constituents who will see to it that they will establish the local services that are required.  As I say, general experience has proved that the councils as a whole have a sense of responsibility and that they exercise their responsibility in a prudent way.  That being so, I say that this feeling of distrust which is exemplified by the amendment is not justified and I join in the request that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment is Hitlerism in its most blatant form.  The Minister wants to sit in state in the Custom House and dictate to the local authorities and to the people as to what they should pay.  The people of the country are good enough to elect the Minister, but not good enough to conduct their own affairs. I was amused by the reference to the Constitution made by the Minister. <Col N="731" /> I do not know how he can relate this amendment to the Constitution.  The amendment is an outrage on the Constitution and I should like to hear the Minister relating it to the Constitution. If we are to have any respect for the rights of the people and for the authority of the people, this House should not allow any dictators in any Department in this country.  We are not going to permit the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to sit in state in the Custom House and tell the people what they are to pay, whether they are able to pay it or not, because he does not give a damn whether they are able to pay it or not.  He is not concerned with that. He is going to dictate to them what they should pay.  He is going to make the local authority a mere pretence, a sham, and a fraud and he is going to filch, if the House permits him, the one function that is reserved to a local authority, the one control that a local authority can exercise over the manager.</P>
      <P>If we are to be honest about it, the sooner we clear out local authorities the better if we are to have local government methods dictated to the people of the country from the Custom House.  If the Fianna Fáil Party believe in that sort of government, they should realise where it is taking us.  We are travelling the road to totalitarianism pure and simple and are going to have a small group of men in this city dictating to the people as to what they should do and what they should pay.  Whether they are able to pay or not, does not matter.  The iron heel will be there and the force of the law will be used against them.  We should wake up and realise the implications behind the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the temerity to suggest that, because the House complained of Section 23, he brought in this amendment to meet the wishes of the House.  It is an insult.  Whatever was in Section 23, bad and all as it was, it gave a local authority the right to bring in a supplementary estimate. They cannot even do that under this amendment until the Minister decides that it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that this amendment will be <Col N="732" /> resisted from every side of the House. Deputy Allen has given the lead to his own Party.  He has a great deal of experience of local affairs in his own County of Wexford.  He indicated last night that he objected strongly to the amendment.  But the dictator Minister, who wants to dictate to the whole country from the Custom House, is going to ignore the advice of members of his own Party, I presume, and is going to force the amendment.  If the Minister is wise, he will withdraw the amendment and forget about this type of legislation.  We must have democratic government and democratic institutions in this country.  We are not going to allow the Minister to steam-roll whatever semblance of democracy is left under the County Management Act.  The one thing which the Minister has been stressing in defence of that Act is that local authorities have a reserved function, because they control the local purse, and that by giving them that reserved function and that control they can control the manager, no matter what his executive functions may be.  But the Minister is going to sweep aside all that, and from the Custom House he will sit back in dignity and dictate to every local authority what the rate should be.  He resented the suggestion about the franchise made by Deputy Cogan, but it is true.  The Minister is very charming with the people when an election comes along.  The people are then quite fit to exercise their right or their authority to elect him.  But the moment he is put into office, he takes power to dictate to them and to treat them with contempt.  He tells them that they are not fit to elect a local authority or that the local authority they elect is not capable of looking after local affairs.</P>
    <P>If we believe in democracy, and if the Minister at any time thinks that the rates struck by a local authority are not sufficient to run the local services, the period of office of a local body is very short, and the Minister can indicate that the local affairs are not being properly and efficiently run by the particular body, and then leave it to the people to decide whether or not they will kick out that local authority and put in a different body. <Col N="733" /> But we will not have dictatorship in this country.  I hope the people will waken up to the realisation of the road we are travelling by the type of legislation we are asked to swallow in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that this amendment had been introduced to meet certain of the objections raised against Section 23 in its original form. The principal ground of objection has been stated by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, that if the section went through, it would lead to slipshod estimating, that local authorities would, perhaps, be influenced, by reason of this section, to make provision at the outset of the year which would be inadequate to maintain the county services on a reasonable standard, and that they would come along in the course of the year and try to make good the deficiency by striking an additional rate, or, indeed, a number of additional or supplemental rates.  That was the principal ground of objection to the section as it stood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realised the force of those objections. If we are to maintain the local authorities here as efficient bodies, we must make certain that their financial conduct will be above criticism, that is to say, that if they have obligations they will take the necessary steps&mdash; sometimes unpleasant steps&mdash;to raise <Col N="734" /> the revenues required to enable them to fulfil those obligations.  That is the principle upon which this State proceeds in relation to its Budgets, and I do not think that I am asking the local authorities to do too much when I am asking them to conform to those financial standards which we have enforced here upon ourselves.  It is the invariable practice of every Minister for Finance to try to provide, in the one Budget of the year, for all the expenses of the year.  It may happen, by reason of the wide scope of affairs with which this House is concerned, that abnormal circumstances may arise for which the ordinary Budget may be insufficient, so on one or two occasions we have had Supplementary Budgets, introduced naturally by the Government of its own volition, to meet the particular circumstances which had arisen.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is nothing novel in the idea of making supplementary provision, if the original provision, by experience, has been found to be insufficient. I will concede there is a danger that an exceptional practice may become the habitual custom, that the tendency may grow to look upon these supplementary budgets and supplemental rates as a normal expedient and to rely on them to an extent which would not be justified as a normal course of procedure.  That was the kernel of the objections to Section 23 as it stood in its original form.  In the amendment I put down, I tried to meet those objections, while at the same time ensuring that the purpose we had in view when the original section was included in the Bill would be secured.</P>
    <P>I have listened to most extraordinary pronouncements in this House as to the function and status of the local authorities.  Some Deputies have said here that because they are elected on the same basis as members of the Dáil they are of comparable status with comparable prerogatives, that, in fact, each of them in its own area is a petty soviet, with all the functions and all the responsibilities attached to a sovereign legislative body.  That is the burden of the speeches of Deputies Keyes and Cogan&mdash;that the subordinate bodies, set up by the Legislature <Col N="735" /> and the State for a definite and circumscribed purpose, have the same prestige, the same sovereign power and the same control over their own actions and procedure as has the sovereign Assembly of the State.  Of course, that is ridiculous: the local authorities are not set up as independent self-governing bodies, but are constituted under the statutes of the Oireachtas for the purpose of providing prescribed public services.  Some of those services are essential for the maintenance of the social and economic life of the community and some of them are essential for the preservation of the health of the individual and the community.  The maintenance of those services is mandatory upon the local authority.  That is the purpose for which those local authorities have been established&mdash;to provide those services and to maintain them at a reasonable standard.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will turn to the amendment, they will find that the whole procedure outlined in it is operative only when the Minister is satisfied, after having held a local inquiry, that the local authority has not made sufficient provision to maintain at a reasonable standard the public services for which it is responsible, or has failed to make its just contribution to another local authority which, under its institution, is bound to maintain certain other public services.  It is only when the Minister has satisfied himself that a <i>prima facie</i> case exists that the local authority is failing to do its duty in regard to these provisions (a) and (b) that he may hold a local inquiry, for the purpose of proving conclusively to his satisfaction that, in fact, the local authority is not fulfilling its duty in this regard.  The Minister then has power to require them to strike a supplemental rate or make a supplementary provision which will be sufficient to enable them to make good the deficiency which the inquiry had shown to exist.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House again that these local authorities have not been brought into existence as subordinate legislatures.  With regard to these essential services, it is mandatory upon the local authorities to maintain them. <Col N="736" /> It is the sole reason why these bodies have been brought into being, and it is an obligation which has been imposed upon these local authorities by the statutes of the Oireachtas, by the law of the land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan had something to say about the Minister for Local Government and the qualities of his mind and of his character; but the fact remains that the Minister for Local Government happens to be the instrument chosen by the Oireachtas for the purpose of seeing that the law of the land is enforced, and that it is given effect to by these local authorities.</P>

      <P>Whatever his defects may be, he is the person upon whom that responsibility has been placed by this House, by the Assembly which passed this law, and I suggest the House would be stultifying itself if, having imposed that responsibility on the Minister of seeing that these services, which are essential for the maintenance of the social and economic activities of the State, and for the preservation of the health of individuals in the community, it were to leave the Minister powerless to ensure that these local authorities, for whom he carries responsibility to this House, are fulfilling their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, no local authority can maintain these public services unless it provides revenue which will be sufficient for the purpose, and the refusal of a public authority to provide such revenue is a clear and unmistakable indication that it has decided that it will not discharge the functions for which it has been brought into existence.  You cannot maintain hospitals, you cannot maintain mental hospitals, you cannot maintain roads, you cannot maintain public assistance and other essential services unless the local authority concerned takes the ordinary steps which are open to it by striking a rate, a sufficient rate, to ensure that that portion of the cost which falls upon it will be met and, therefore, when a local authority refuses to raise these moneys in the <Col N="737" /> way appointed by law, that is a clear indication that it has made up its mind that it will not maintain these services, that it will defy the law and the authority of this House which has imposed that obligation upon it and which has brought it into existence for the purpose of maintaining these services.</P>
    <P>We are not discussing this purely upon a hypothetical basis because, within the past five or six years, some local authorities have refused, for reasons of their own, mainly political ones, mainly to secure a little political capital for groups throughout the country, to provide the necessary services.</P>

      <P>When that happened, these authorities were dissolved.  They were dissolved because it was necessary, if they were not going to do the work for which they were elected, that someone would be found who would. When they were dissolved, that did not end the matter, because, having struck a rate which was insufficient, the power of the local authority under the ordinary law to strike a further rate to raise money had been exhausted, unless they were to have recourse to borrowing&mdash;temporary borrowing.  Now, what <Col N="738" /> did that mean?  It meant that in order to repair the damage which this recalcitrant body had done to the local services and to the local finances, the finances of that local authority in the future had to be very seriously disorganised, because the deficiency in the county fund had to be raised, as I have said, by borrowing, and had to be made good either in the following year or in the following two or three years, thereby imposing upon future ratepayers expenditures which ought to have been met in the year in which they fell due.  Not only that, but the mere fact that the county council had to borrow&mdash;or the commissioner administering the affairs of the county council had to borrow&mdash;resulted in an increased charge, a quite unnecessary charge, upon the ratepayers because not merely had the original sum to be provided, but the interest charges had to be met as well, interest charges which, in these circumstances, were likely to be onerous.</P>
      <P>It is to ensure that that condition of affairs will not exist in the future that this amendment it put down.  It is designed, first of all, to see that every local authority discharges the obligations which have been placed upon it by this House.  If this House wants these local services, if it wants mental hospitals, if it wants good roads, and if it wants local authorities to provide employment, then it must insist that the local authorities will raise the moneys necessary to give effect to the policy of the House in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I am asking the House to do is this, that if it appears to the Minister that the local authority is not making sufficient provision to maintain these local services upon a reasonable standard, or is not making the provision which it is bound to make for another body responsible for maintaining certain services, he will have power to order an inquiry to satisfy himself as to whether, in fact, the provision made is sufficient to maintain these services, or to make these obligatory contributions.  If the inquiry shows that, in fact, the moneys proposed to be raised are insufficient for the purpose, he has power to <Col N="739" /> require the local authority to mend its hand&mdash;it is given a chance; it is not abolished&mdash;and to provide the moneys necessary.  If, however, the local authority fails to do that, the Minister has power to dissolve it and to replace it by a commissioner.  When that commissioner goes in, instead of finding himself in the position in which the commissioner administering the affairs of the Kerry County Council found himself at the outset, he will have power immediately to strike the full amount of the rate necessary.  That rate will be collected in that year and no burdens will be transferred to future years, either to make good deficiencies or for interest charges.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose.  The purpose of the amendment is to see that local authorities will maintain their services at a reasonable standard and will make the proper provision in each year to enable them to do that.  If a local authority refuses to maintain these services at a reasonable standard, by refusing to provide the necessary moneys, then I say, and I put it to the House which has established these local authorities, that the justification for the existence of that elected body has disappeared, because it is not fulfilling the functions for which it was established, and that the Minister, acting on behalf of the House for the enforcement of the law, is quite entitled to dissolve them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed by the Minister's statement. I think we should have got a little information as to the necessity for the insertion in the Bill of this authority. We had a case in County Roscommon of a body refusing to make adequate provision for the maintenance of the main roads, but, at the next local election, the people refused to give those responsible a majority.  Although I am a member of the Government Party, and presume that, if I have to vote, I will vote for it, I think we should be very careful about the way we move in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a feeling in the local bodies &mdash;and those composing them are not irresponsible men &mdash; that these things can be carried too far.  I am a member <Col N="740" /> of a local body and have been chairman for a very long time, and I do not agree with the Minister that we have a lot of authority.  We have very little authority as a matter of fact.  I do not complain of that&mdash;I did complain at one time&mdash;because it is a great relief to me personally; but we really have not got much authority at all.  There might be unreasonable demands by a Government &mdash; not necessarily the Fianna Fáil Government, but any Government&mdash;and I think that local authorities should have some little say in these matters.  I thought the Minister would have cited many examples. Our own case is one example, and it was not terribly serious, but I suggest it would be well to step carefully in a matter of this sort.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement has been generally reasonable, I admit, but we in local bodies do feel that authority has largely been filched from us, and I do not think it is good for the State. I have had, as I say, long experience, and I find that the vast majority of those on local bodies are very sensible men, anxious to live up to their obligations. There is not the least doubt about that, but there may be certain matters in respect of which a local body may think that it is right and it possibly may be just as correct as the Minister.  I presume that the Minister will have his way in this matter, but I would give this warning, that these powers should be used very sparingly.</P>
    <P>This power to strike a supplementary rate is very wrong and is going to cause terrible confusion.  We will have a second rate and a different set of documents.  We had something like it in County Roscommon recently and it created untold confusion.  I believe there should not be any supplementary rate, except in extraordinary circumstances. There is provision for overdrafts, and, in the case of most local bodies, not a very large overdraft is required to tide them over the period to the end of the financial year. I am entirely opposed on principle to the idea of supplementary rates.  I hope that when the Act is being administered there will be reasonable and responsible thinking on the part of the Department.  The matter is becoming serious, as I know from my own <Col N="741" /> experience, and members not merely of the Opposition Parties but of Fianna Fáil think that this control by the Custom House is going rather far. Personally, I think it is.</P>

The Minister talks of his having been chosen by this House as the instrument to look after local affairs, whatever his mental capacity, but did this House ever intend to give or did it give power to the Minister to dictate?  I suggest that his own Party never intended, when he was chosen as the instrument and placed in his exalted position in the Custom House, that he or any Minister should have power to dictate, or should have the power he is now seeking in this amendment. Now is the time for members of the Fianna Fáil Party to see the danger, to see the writing on the wall and to realise that the road we are travelling is the road to absolutism and totalitarianism, to realise that a few men have become ambitious and are seeking to travel the road which other countries have travelled.  We know the result of ambition in Germany and Italy.  Will that be a warning to the people of this country?  Do we intend to allow any small group of men to wield absolute and complete power over the lives of the people?</P>

      <P>The Minister ought to take his medicine and face up to the situation.  I want to say to every Deputy who is to decide this matter one way or another that he should pause before giving power to any individual to dictate in this fashion.</P>
      <P>There was exception taken, and properly taken, to the section.  As Deputy O'Rourke has pointed out, we have said that we expect the manager to make a proper estimate, and that when he puts it before the local authority it ought to be properly drawn.  What is going to be the attitude of any manager under the section as it was drafted?  He can say to the county secretary: &ldquo;It does not matter very much whether the estimate is accurate or not because we have the power to go back and ask for a supplementary estimate.&rdquo;  It was suggested that that would lead to slip-shod work and a slip-shod estimate. We do not stand for that.  We expect that if the manager is doing his job properly and efficiently he will give the local authority a close estimate.  It was argued, and properly argued, that that was the objection.  But the Minister comes in now and asks for the power to dictate.  He will not even permit the local authority to mend their hand.  Whatever is done must be dictated by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about local inquiries, but what are they worth?  We know what happened in the case of the Cork Street Hospital.  The Minister was not prepared to justify to the people the action that he took in that particular case.  We know what will happen.  He wants to exercise the power of a dictator under this amendment. He will have a sham local inquiry to do whatever he likes afterwards. The inquiry will be a mere pretence, because he will have made up his mind long before he sends down an inspector to hold the inquiry.  This is designed to see that the local authority will provide services.  The Minister feels that he is capable of deciding what the rate should be and what the <Col N="743" /> services ought to be that the local people can afford: that he is capable of deciding what the people are able to pay.  Is the position to be that a man sitting in the Custom House, ambitious of wielding the power of a dictator, can force and compel the local people to pay, whether they are able to pay or not?  There is no use in giving lip service to democracy in this House.  If we believe in democracy, or if we are going to be a democracy, then let us cut out this sort of stuff, and let this House deny and refuse, emphatically refuse, the ambitions of a man who wants to be all-powerful now.</P>
    <P>I must say I am very glad that there are some Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who are waking up to a realisation of the dangers on the road that we are travelling.  This whole thing is a marked characteristic of recent legislation, culminating in this, the worst of all.  The Minister in this wants to dictate from the Custom House to the local bodies.  I suggest that if, during their short period of office, the members of local bodies are not fulfilling their functions properly, the people are the proper court to decide it.  They can decide it at the end of their short period of office and can kick out a county council and put in a new one.  Deputy O'Rourke told us that they did that in Roscommon. That is the proper procedure where you have a democracy.  We do not want a dictatorship.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Minister will listen to the prudent advice given to him by Deputy O'Rourke, a Deputy with long experience of local administration, and one who is in touch with democracy in action so far as local affairs are concerned.  Now, democracy is like peace.  It is indivisible. You cannot kick democracy in the pants down in Roscommon, Clare or Kerry and expect that it is going to flourish in Leinster House.  If you humiliate democracy, if you humiliate the people and the people's representatives in one part of Ireland, you are going to humiliate democracy throughout the length and breadth of this <Col N="744" /> country.  I do not suggest that a county council elected for an area is equal to this Parliament, which is elected for the entire State.  I, as a matter of fact, stated that this Parliament is supreme, but that, having regard to the importance of preserving the dignity of democracy and the authority of democracy throughout the State, if it becomes necessary, in a very extreme case in the Minister's opinion, to dissolve a county council, he should not have the power to do it without obtaining authority from this House by direct resolution passed here.</P>
      <P>That is the type of legislation which I would advocate, if it was considered necessary in an extreme case to dissolve a county council.  But I think, as Deputy O'Rourke has pointed out, that there should be very little need to dissolve a county council, having regard to the short period for which it is elected, and having regard to the fact that the people of this State are intelligent and educated electors and can decide, and will decide, whether a county council is acting efficiently and effectively or not.  The people have the power to remove them at the end of three years.  In view of the advice which has been given to him by the members of his own Party who have spoken, I think the Minister should hesitate before asking for the extreme powers which are set out in his amendment. The issue raised here is democracy versus totalitarianism, Deputy Allen versus Stalin.</P>

      <P>As far as I can see this amendment is designed to deal with a situation likely to arise in the case of a county council that is not performing the functions for which a county council is elected.  If a county council strikes an insufficient rate to provide, within the local authority area, the social services that the people demand from the local authority and from the central authority, the Minister is taking the necessary power in this amendment, with the approval and authority of this democratically elected legislative assembly, to enable him to make sure that the local rate is adequate to provide <Col N="745" /> the social services that are necessary for the maintenance of our people.  I see nothing wrong in that.  It means a strengthening so far as our democratic institutions are concerned. I believe that Deputies who sit on these benches are as much interested in the maintenance of our democratic institutions as Deputy Hughes is or any other Deputy.  The majority of the men on these benches, and the women too, gave earnest of their desire to see that the democratic institutions of this country should be maintained for all time.  The members of the Government Party are not totalitarian, but the members of the Party opposite are the very people who tried to shove the totalitarian idea down the throats of the people of this country.</P>

      <P>I am opposing this amendment, principally on the grounds which Deputy Hughes has stated.  I am glad that certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party have realised the significance of the powers contained in it.  Deputy Hilliard has said that he is in favour of the amendment because it means a strengthening of the power of the Minister.  On the other hand, Deputy O'Rourke, who, I am sure, has longer experience in local affairs, has said that the Local Government Act as at present in operation and the County Management Act have considerably diminished the existing powers and that he considers that any further diminution will have serious consequences.  I take the same view. As I understand the arguments in favour of the County Management Act, the one strong argument the Minister has always adduced is the fact that it has always left power of the purse and control over financial matters in the hands of the local representatives. Once this amendment is accepted, no matter what the arguments in its favour are, no matter what duties local representatives carry out or fail to carry out, the power of the purse will no longer rest absolutely in their hands.  I sympathise with Deputy O'Rourke when he says that not alone are their powers being limited but that, if this amendment goes through as it is framed, serious consequences may follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> While he says that in all sincerity, I am sure he has some misgivings about his ultimate decision on this matter.  I think possibly Deputy Hughes did not exaggerate when he said the Party Whip was cracking over their heads.  Deputy O'Rourke says it has not cracked yet.  I am afraid it never ceases to crack and that while Deputies opposite feel they should vote a particular way the Whip is always giving them a little tip on the ear, saying, &ldquo;You must join the pack&rdquo;.  It is like a recalcitrant hound who may go after a hare instead of keeping with the pack after the fox.</P>
    <P>In this case, whatever merits the County Management Act may have in so far as it allows the elected local representatives full control of the purse, this section takes that control entirely out of their hands.  The Minister says in favour of it that local representatives may fail to do their duty, may fail to make adequate provision for roads or other essential services.  Surely, ultimately, subject to the proper working of the County Management Act, the responsibility of establishing, maintaining and continuing these services in whatever form the local representatives believe to be in the best interests of their area, devolves on the local representatives. Surely the local representatives have the responsibility.  It may be that they exercise it in a different way in various parts of the country.  As Deputy O'Rourke says, if, after a particular local election, a group are elected that do not maintain these services in an adequate way, then the responsibility is on the electorate to make a change.</P>
    <P>What is the position here?  The Minister has ample power, under the County Management Act as it stands, to abolish a local authority after an inquiry.  In addition to that, he now seeks to take power, not where he in his absolute discretion thinks fit, but &ldquo;where it appears to the Minister,&rdquo; et cetera.  As this section is framed it appears to me that the Minister, if he is of the opinion even to the slightest degree that a local authority is failing, or is not taking sufficient steps, to collect a rate sufficient to defray the expenses of that local authority, can <Col N="747" /> hold a local inquiry and, of course, as Deputy Hughes has said, once you hold a local inquiry it is a foregone conclusion what will happen.  I think it was Dooley and Hennessy who said, in discussing elections, &ldquo;You can vote for whom you like if you leave the counting to me.&rdquo;  It is the same here. You can make whatever representations you like before that local inquiry but the Minister has the last word.</P>
    <P>Deputies and the public generally should consider seriously and carefully the trend of legislation in this country which is giving absolute power to the Custom House, which deposits power entirely in the hands of the Minister and his advisers.  I have no doubt that these advisers act according to their best judgment, but they are a long way removed from the realities of the situation in a local area.  They are immersed in their own work and they have, possibly, little experience of the needs of an area down the country.  If local representatives are not imbued with a sense of the responsibility of their office, if they are not sufficiently devoted to that office, if they are not prepared carefully to consider the needs of the area which they represent, then I believe the responsibility of changing the representatives rests with the electorate.  There is every indication of a decreasing interest in national and local affairs and, as long as public representatives are going to have their powers whittled down, so long will that trend continue.  I suggest to Deputies of all Parties to consider carefully and seriously the ultimate effect of an extension of the powers which give absolute and entire discretion to the Minister in this matter before they accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>I am reminded by this section of the warning given by the Minister down the country, a few years ago, against dictators, when he used that famous expression, &ldquo;Herr von So-and-So&rdquo;.  If I were to say to the Minister, &ldquo;Herr von MacEntee&rdquo;, I should regret it.  Certainly, if ever there was dictation, it appears in this section.  As a member of a local authority, elected by Sinn Féin in 1917, <Col N="748" /> I was delighted to hear one of the old school, Deputy O'Rourke, say that we should be careful and try not to take power completely out of the hands of these local authorities, so that they would count for nothing at all.  The Minister has stated that local authorities are elected for the purpose of carrying out certain functions.  Now their powers are completely gone.  In my opinion, in the near future, you will not get a decent citizen to allow his name to go forward for election to a local authority in this country.</P>
      <P>How is it that the Minister would know better than the local authorities. what should be done?  The Minister has suggested in his statement on this Bill, that the power given in respect of the striking of the rate would give an opportunity to local authorities to clear up the mess so that the burden would not be carried forward from year to year.  Does not the Minister agree that it may be a hardship that such a thing should be done?  Who knows better than the local authorities? I would ask the Minister to take the advice of Deputy O'Rourke.  There was another Minister here last night who said that people were speaking with two voices but I listened to two members of the Fianna Fáil Party speaking to-day and such direct opposites I never heard in all my life.  I am glad that a member of the old school stood out for a little control by local authorities elected by the people. Of course if the Minister could get over the matter by a certain amount of abuse, and if he thought that talking about Blue Shirtism or anything like that is going to let him get away with this type of section, he is making a great mistake.  The sooner we try to forget these things the better.  As one who, of course, never had any association with them &mdash; I need not tell the Minister that &mdash;it would be much better if we discussed the Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that Section 25 of the Local Government Act, 1925, be amended to empower local authorities to repair and maintain from local funds any road which ordinarily is of service to two or more tenants.</P>
      <P>I feel that there are few Deputies who would not be relieved if the Minister could see his way to accept the proposals in this motion.  I am sure that many Deputies, like myself, are inundated with requests from various parts of the country to have steps taken so that these roads could be repaired by local authorities.  There is a demand for the repair and maintenance of these roads but, as the law stands, they do not come within the category of roads that can be maintained by local authorities.  Prior to 1942, owing to the elasticity of the expression &ldquo;public utility&rdquo;, such roads were, in many cases, maintained by funds provided by local authorities, but whether it was through generosity on the part of auditors or ignorance on the part of the councillors concerned, in a few cases surcharges took place.  Now that we have installed in each county a county manager we find that many roads which came within the category of roads controlled by local authorities cannot be repaired or maintained by them.  I am wondering what case the Minister can put up for legislation as it stands.  For instance, for the upkeep of a road of a width of 11 feet, connecting two main roads, a local authority has absolute power to give a grant out of its funds, whereas roads, which might be classified as culs-de-sac, on which ratepayers, who pay much larger amounts than others living on communicating roads, are deprived of any funds for their repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That class of people have had for years to plough through mud and slush in order to attend to their farming duties.  In many cases, they are prevented carrying out their work in a proper way owing to lack of accommodation. <Col N="750" /> They have been deprived in many cases of facilities for attendance at Divine worship.  At the same time those living on these roads, being large contributors to local rates, have had to provide roads for motorists and others.  They have also to provide high-class roads for the convenience of that monopolistic body, Córas Iompair Eireann, the making of which, in the aggregate, cost about £1,500 per mile.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it is fair or right that these people should be asked to contribute to the upkeep of roads from which they derive no benefit.  The legislation which prevents the maintenance of these roads was, I believe, more or less substantiated in the courts in years gone by, but to maintain such legislation is to perpetuate the memory of chief Baron Palles, who decided that the roads with which I am concerned could not be legally maintained by local authorities. We know that he was a person of perverted mentality and had an oblique sense of justice as far as this country is concerned.  There is even a greater absurdity regarding the position of by-roads.  In many cases, what were known as Grand Jury roads, if used only by one family, or by one man, could be legally maintained at the expense of a local authority, while a cul-de-sac, which might accommodate ten families, could not be maintained. I ask every Deputy to consider the position fairly and dispassionately, particularly Deputies who are members of local authorities.  They will certainly agree with me that there is a clamant demand for the repair of the roads with which this motion is concerned.  I know that Deputies have been inundated with requests of that kind from day-to-day.  No political issues are involved in the motion, and the acceptance of it by Deputies on all sides will not involve any sacrifices of political principles.  I expect every Deputy to favour the motion.</P>
    <P>Even at this late hour I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give consideration to a section of the community which is paying taxes but getting no benefit.  I also ask the Parliamentary Secretary who, I am <Col N="751" /> aware, has a good idea of rural conditions, but may not be acquainted with this particular position, to discuss this matter with his Party.  In particular, I advise him to discuss it with my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, who has time and again raised it at Roscommon County Council.  It has been raised not only at Roscommon County Council but at every county council in the Twenty-Six Counties.  The Parliamentary Secretary will find that I am not exaggerating or misrepresenting the situation.  With these facts before him, I earnestly hope that the legislation will be altered in such a way as to meet the demand of the people for whom I speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Deputy Beirne, in introducing this motion, has made a well-reasoned case in its support.  All citizens are equal in the eyes of the law and it seems rather a cruel thing that, while the overwhelming majority have roadways or thoroughfares leading right to their doors, a minority have to flounder through a mile or two miles of mud to reach the main road.  What adds to their sense of grievance and injustice is that, when they reach the main road with their horse or other animal, it is so surfaced that the animal is unable to keep its feet.  Those of us who are familiar with the layout of housing accommodation in remote rural districts are aware that farms are so situated that some farmers have to travel a mile or two miles to reach the main road.  Under the existing law, there is no legal means by which their grievance can be met.  There is no statutory obligation on anybody to provide them with means of access to the roadway.  It is pleasing and gratifying to note that, in all our housing schemes during recent years, one of the first things considered in developing the sites was the provision of a good roadway to the houses. Where we find a piece of land being developed in the vicinity of towns or cities for housing purposes, we always see that a concrete or other permanent road is being laid down so as to give easy access to the occupants of the <Col N="752" /> houses.  When a Deputy goes to the rural areas to visit somebody who has communicated with him about some matter, he finds he has to travel across fields and bogs for a distance of a mile or two miles to reach the house.  We all feel that it is a grave hardship on those people to have to live under such conditions.  It is a grave hardship on the women folk who reside in those rural houses that they cannot get to the nearest town or to chapel, and that their children cannot go to school without ploughing through mud. When the children reach school, their feet are wet.  Even though they may be well shod, the water gets in over the tops of their boots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local councils are, in most cases, sympathetic to those people.  They understand the conditions under which they live and they are anxious to do something to meet the cases of more extreme hardship.  I do not say that a county council would decide to repair every road for which a demand was made, but they would be prepared to meet cases of extreme hardship. When we come down to the principles involved, we cannot find any valid reason for refusal to meet those requests.  If it is right that county roads should be made even in thinly-populated rural areas&mdash;we find good county roads in some such areas&mdash; surely it is right, in the case of a long laneway along which five or six families may be living, that the councils should have, at least, the power to meet the demand for repair of such laneways.  I do not know &mdash; and I am rather at a disadvantage in not knowing&mdash;what the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary will be to this motion.  He may take the stand that, if we are to repair roads which two or three persons are using, there is no reason why we should not repair the laneway leading to every house. He may say that the individual farmer who is solely utilising a laneway has as good a case for having that laneway put into repair as others to whom we have been referring.  There is, however, a definite distinction between accommodation roads used by one person and such roads used by more than one.  There is the difference that <Col N="753" /> the person who suffers the most grievous hardship by reason of the roadway not being repaired may not be the person who utilises the road to the greatest extent.  He may not be the person who does the most heavy carting and causes the greatest damage to the road.</P>
    <P>There are cases in which it is difficult to apportion the cost when a road is being used by two persons.  Where only one person is using a road, it is usually built entirely on his own land. If his house is situated at the extreme end of his farm, so that it is a long distance to the road, he may be able to change his residence at some future time and get nearer to the road.  In a case in which four or five other farms intervene between the individual and the roadway, it is almost impossible for him to improve his position.  Therefore, I think it is a case in which the State should intervene.  We all admit that a great deal has been done in recent years in this connection.  We have had minor relief schemes which covered roadways of this kind and under which a certain amount of reconstruction was done.  These minor relief schemes were subject to certain conditions which made it difficult for many persons who are suffering hardship to obtain the grants.  If a roadway were situated in an electoral division in which there was very little unemployment, a minor relief grant could not be obtained.</P>
    <P>We have had also in recent years a scheme of rural development, which is, likewise, a very good scheme.  Here, again, you have the difficulty that perhaps some of those affected are not willing to co-operate in carrying through such schemes.  In addition, you have the position in which it is necessary to make application at certain times to get such a scheme carried through and it is not a permanent function of any authority to provide permanent maintenance for that roadway.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme outlined in this motion, the local authority would take over the maintenance of such roadways and would yearly provide for their upkeep.  The cost in each case <Col N="754" /> would not be very high because of course the traffic would not be exceptionally heavy.  I think there is a principle which in justice ought to be met, that the citizen who lives in a remote rural area is entitled at least to accommodation which would compare in some way with that which the citizen of an urban area or living adjacent to a county roadway is already enjoying.  I think in justice to those people who suffer severe hardship we should endeavour to meet their case.  We know that there is a growing tendency on the part of young people to get away from these remote rural areas, to get nearer to towns or into towns if possible.  Anybody who travels through our rural areas, who is interested in minor relief works or in rural improvement schemes, in travelling over some of these rural laneways or accommodation roads will note derelict houses, the occupants having left the district.  The ruins of the houses are to be seen in many places.  I find in my county&mdash;it may not be the same in the West&mdash;that what really happens is that the farms alongside these laneways becomes out-farms to some other bigger farms in the district and they are neglected to some extent.  They may be utilised for grazing.  The little homesteads are allowed to fall and the lane is allowed to deteriorate.  That happened mainly because there were no decent facilities for getting to these farms through a roadway.  I think that is one aspect of the matter that should appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have great sympathy with this motion if it were properly outlined but then if it were, I do not think there would be any need for it at all because under the 1925 Act, as I understand it, the local authority is empowered to spend money on any existing road that is not a cul-de-sac, if it can be used for general public utility.  I understand according to the existing law, although it is being severely criticised at present, particularly in our county by the county surveyor, money can be spent on such a road if it has a carriageway of 11 feet in width.  The only point at issue in this motion is whether the road is a <Col N="755" /> stop-end road.  The motion calls on the Minister for Local Government to amend the law to enable local authorities to repair and maintain roads that benefit two or more persons.  I think if the Minister accepts that, the burden that will be placed on the rates in every county will be intolerable. I cannot understand this motion coming from a Party who, during the past week, moved another motion here calling for what was tantamount to complete derating.  I think it is most inconsistent to bring forward another motion now which tends to increase expenditure which they claim at the moment is an intolerable burden.  I cannot subscribe to this motion because of that, though in my own County of Galway I have been all out to help people who live along these roads leading from one road to another where the roads were not in a proper condition of repair.</P>
      <P>In County Galway&mdash;and there was no reason why they could not have done the same thing in County Roscommon &mdash;from 1930 to 1944, we increased the road mileage by almost 400 miles.  In 1930 the road mileage in County Galway was 1,830 miles and in 1944, the last year for which I have the figures, the road mileage was 2,180, almost 2,200 miles.  The cost of maintenance per mile in 1944 was exactly the same figure as in 1930&mdash;£20 per mile.  At the same time with that increase in mileage, we have, by way of councillors' notices of motion at what is known as the roads meeting every year, increased the burden on the rates by something like £8,000 per annum.  In addition to that, in putting these roads into proper repair we have spent from 1930 to 1944, an average of £12,000 per year.  There was nothing to prevent the Roscommon County Council from doing that also.  We have spent a considerable amount on new works which has also increased the mileage in the county.  I think the county council in Roscommon took a very different attitude a few years ago.  When motions were down for the carrying out of such works, they refused to put even a penny in the £ on the rates for roads.</P>

      <P>Well, even on main roads they have not spent anything like what we have spent in the County Galway during that period.  If this motion is adopted it will certainly add a burden to the other heavy burdens the ratepayers already have to bear.  While, as I say, I would be in sympathy with any motion which had for its object the repair and maintenance of roads which serve a large number of people residing in villages, I think at the present time it would be unwise to add to them the type of road envisaged in this motion, particularly in view of the fact that we have numerous schemes which provide for that and which, mind you, in a certain way&mdash;in an indirect way, if you like&mdash;give relief in rates.  I refer to the rural improvement schemes whereby the people concerned on any of these culs-de-sac or stop-end roads can, if they put up one-fourth of the estimated expenditure, get the remaining three-fourths. This scheme is working very well in my county.  At the time, I did not hail it at all as strongly as did Deputy Donnellan, but it has proved that his outlook on it and on the manner in which it would work was sounder than mine, because there is hardly a village in Galway from which applications are not sent to the Office of Public Works under this scheme, and very great satisfaction is given.  The work is well carried out, and, except in places where there are men on the dole, the people who contribute one-fourth of the money are given first preference on the work.  They earn back that one-fourth, as well as a considerable amount of the remaining three-fourths.  I know that some people who originally refused to put up the money have since put up sums to the extent of £20 or £25 because of the fact that they are getting that preference, and as a result of the very fine work which has been done.  Deputy Cogan mentioned that we should do something even in the case of laneways leading to one house.  A good deal has been done in that way where the farm improvements scheme has <Col N="757" /> been availed of. 50 per cent. of the estimated cost is being provided.</P>
      <P>I do not think I could support this motion, although I have been as sympathetic as anybody in the case of the type of roads I have mentioned&mdash;roads leading from one road to another, which serve a large number of people &mdash;but when it comes down to a question of serving two or more people, and to the case of a cul-de-sac road of no public utility other than the accommodation it provides for those people, just the same as the avenue to any of the big mansions in the country, I think the people concerned are getting a very fine offer from the taxpayers when they are being provided with three-fourths of the money to repair those roads, and have to put up only the remaining one-fourth.  I want to say again that I think those who are so anxious to reduce the rates or to wipe them out altogether should be very hesitant about putting down a motion of this kind and bringing it before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to tell the mover and the seconder of this motion that, on pure theory, I have every sympathy with the idea underlying what might be described as a unified system of road repair throughout the country.  I should like very much to see a system set up whereby, with the aid of Government grants and from road moneys, it would be possible to have an administration which would cover every type of road, to which there would be contributions from the unemployment fund, from the road fund, and as I have said already, from the local authority. I agree also with the mover and seconder of this motion that there has been a clamorous demand for the repair of these cul-de-sac roads, and to a certain degree for the repair of link roads.  I myself, as representing Athlone-Longford, am fully aware of that demand.  I am aware too that people's standards of what a road should be have very greatly improved in the last ten years.  People are no longer content to live at the end of muddy lanes, under impossible conditions, <Col N="758" /> where it is difficult for children to get to school, for people to go to Mass, and for the doctor and the priest to visit the sick.  I am aware of all those conditions.  I am also aware of the fact that there has been a considerable demand by local authorities in the past few years for an alteration of the present law with regard to the type of road that can be repaired by the expenditure of a county rate, largely in the Local Government Act of 1925, under which roads which have some public utility adjoining other public roads which are not less than 11 feet in width can be taken over by the county council.  But the Act makes it quite clear, as has already been stated, that cul-de-sac roads are not included among the roads which can be so taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read a good deal of correspondence from county councils in regard to this matter, and it is quite obvious that in a great many cases the members of the county council were influenced, quite naturally, by what might be described as localised pressure.  Every county councillor was impressed by the fact that his own electors were requesting the repair of a particular cul-de-sac road, and so he combined with others in a demand to the Government to alter the law. But it is equally obvious from studying the discussions that took place that those county councillors were not aware of the implications underlying any change of the law, implications as regards costs and administration, and therein lies my difficulty&mdash;that much as I should like to alter the present administration and to have a unified system of repair for every class of road, I see no hope of doing it at least for the present.  I want further to make it quite clear to Deputy Beirne and Deputy Cogan that it is only through relentlessly facing facts that I cannot accept their resolution.  In this country there are 15 miles of road per 1,000 of the population, as compared with ten in Northern Ireland and four and a half in Great Britain, but of course, as Deputies well know, those roads are subject to severe climatic conditions, and the fact that there are <Col N="759" /> only 1,000 people using them per 15 miles does not mean that their rate of deterioration is not very serious.  The aid that we can obtain from taxation arising from the use of motor vehicles is again very limited as compared with countries adjoining us.  The number of mechanically-propelled vehicles per main road mile in this country is 6.5 as compared with 19 in Northern Ireland and 65 in Great Britain, so that we have a special problem to try to keep up a reasonable standard of maintenance for roads which suffer all the effects of our climate and which are used, shall we say, less densely&mdash; our roads have less considerable density of traffic than in other countries.</P>
    <P>I find it is absolutely essential that we should maintain public responsibility for the repair of our existing mileage of roads for which the county rate is struck, and for which the Road Fund is available.  It is even more necessary to catch up on arrears of maintenance which have arisen partly through faulty administration in certain counties, partly through the war, and the necessity for agricultural and turf work during the season when roads are best repaired, and any hope I might have of what might be described as increasing the road mileage controlled by a county council on a speculative basis seems to diminish when I examine the Road Fund position. I find, too, that any hope we have of carrying out major reconstruction of roads depends, first of all, on carrying out urgent repairs on our existing road surfaces.  I think the House may be aware that our main roads have stood up fairly well to the lack of attention they have suffered during the war owing to scarcity of materials and owing to the diversion of labour in some months to turf production. A serious position, however, is just beginning to arise.  The surface or the skin&mdash;the waterproof skin&mdash;of many of our main roads is beginning to deteriorate at a quicker rate than before, and once that deterioration commences, the cost of resurfacing the road grows immeasurably.  Now, it is the responsibility of the local authorities, <Col N="760" /> aided by the Road Fund, or by whatever contribution can be made from the Road Fund or the rural improvements scheme for the special resurfacing of these roads, to carry out those arrears of maintenance which are so urgently desired.  Accordingly, aside from what might be described as the normal situation, I cannot visualise anything being done by the Government which would increase the total mileage of roads for which the county councils are responsible.</P>
    <P>I have also noticed a desire on the part of local authorities to take over bog roads leading to bogs within the area.  That has to be discouraged, because it is anticipated that those bogs will either revert to their original owners or be divided by the Land Commission, and it would be quite impossible for us to allow local councils to take over these bogs.  Now, apart from emergency conditions, I think it would be well to give some figures relating to the difficulties that exist.  We have about 48,000 miles of roads, of which some 10,000 miles are main roads, and some 38,000 miles are county roads.  So far as county roads are concerned, there are 32,000 miles which are still unrolled, and that have never yet been rolled, and about 2,700 miles which have been rolled, but have not yet been surface-dressed.  That indicates that we have not yet achieved the standard for county roads which are at present under the control of county councils, and I think that anybody going around the country will realise that a lot has been left undone with regard to the maintenance of these roads, quite apart from cul-de-sac and link roads.</P>
    <P>To take a particular example: Deputy Beegan spoke of the Galway roads and said, quite rightly, that the maintenance of the Galway road system had deteriorated, at least, to some degree, in that 700 miles of link roads had been taken over by the Galway County Council since 1925 and some 400 miles between 1930 and 1944, and that the 400 miles of road had only resulted in less money being spent per mile on the existing mileage.  In 1930, the amount spent was £20 per mile, and in 1944, the amount spent per mile was still <Col N="761" /> £20, despite the increase in wages and so on.  So far as Galway is concerned, therefore, the repair work carried out has resulted in a disadvantage.  Quite obviously, if you spent £20, in 1930, per mile, and if, in 1944, the amount is still £20, in view of the general increases in wages and so on, you cannot get proper results.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, we have had to warn some of these councils that if they arrange to increase the mileage controlled by them, and do not take care of the maintenance of the main roads, we shall have to reconsider the whole position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Dillon was here when Deputy Beegan was speaking.  I am referring to the question of the Government endeavouring to solve the problem of these cul-de-sac and link roads.  I am not quite sure of what the mileage of such roads would amount to.  One of the officials of the Department suggested that it would be 40,000 miles, but I think it would be safe to leave it between 20,000 and 30,000 miles. Deputy Cogan says that we should only take over roads where the position is serious.  I think, however, that anybody should know that if one cul-de-sac road, which was in a shocking condition, and which had only six houses on it, were repaired, then the pressure would grow to repair another such road, not in such a shocking condition, which had eight houses upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the position in regard to county councils in this matter is not one which would encourage any large increase, particularly as we have got to make up large arrears.  A heavy rate was struck for roads in Galway, and I cannot envisage maintaining the <Col N="762" /> present roads there and, at the same time, going in for the provision of other roads.  I do not think the ratepayers would stand for it, and I do not think it would be possible for us to allow such a thing to occur.  The proposal has been made from time to time that we should have an area charge for such cul-de-sac or stop-end roads, but I think Deputies are aware that it would be quite impossible to administer such a charge.  It would be impossible, from the point of view of administration, to make a levy that would suit the different types of people who would use such roads.  We find also that if we were to take the risk and allow these cul-de-sac roads to be repaired out of the general rates of the county, we would have great difficulty in doing the proper kind of work on such roads. The most that the county rate could bear would be repairs of just a patching character&mdash;repairs which would be of quite a different kind from that of ordinary road maintenance.  I do not believe that there would be contentment amongst the users of such roads if we adopted a system of just patching cul-de-sac roads and making use of the general rate for the purpose.  Having faced all these difficulties, we instituted the rural improvements scheme.  I do. not know whether Deputies are aware of the position in regard to that scheme, but so far as I can gather from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, the demand for grants under that scheme is growing constantly.</P>
    <P>I think that at any one time there are between 1,500 and 2,000 applications. I know that my own experience has been a mixed one.  In many cases, even where farmers have small holdings and where you would imagine there would be some misgiving about paying a contribution in advance and some difficulty in finding the cash, the scheme succeeded admirably.  In other cases, it has failed because of the refusal of a minority of persons to take part in it, or because a large farmer who is using the road less than others has been unwilling to give the necessary contribution.  But the scheme is succeeding and it has a number of advantages.  First of all, it gives a <Col N="763" /> chance to small farmers to discharge their contribution by work instead of by cash.  In County Roscommon, for instance, for every £100 of expenditure, the sum that comes back to a family who take part in a scheme by working on it amounts to some 35 per cent.  So that, in the case of every family where some one can work on the scheme, they get back the contribution and a little more besides.</P>
    <P>Another advantage in the scheme is the fact that it makes a distinction between the liability of the users of the road in regard to the cost.  It is possible, where a great number of people are using a road which is repaired, that some poor widow who is living in a house on it cannot afford a contribution. She is not asked to pay a contribution as people know well that she cannot afford it.  On the other hand, there may be people living on the road who are well able to pay a contribution and, even though they employ labour for the purpose, they can, if they have the co-operative spirit, contribute a larger share of the cost.  Another advantage in the scheme lies in the fact that the inspector will, if necessary, make two proposals for the repair of a road.  He comes down from the Board of Works and the sponsor of the scheme is sent a statement of the total cost and the contribution required.  There are occasions when it is possible to reduce the cost if the contribution appears excessive.  That is not possible in every case, but on a number of occasions I know that a modified offer has been made.  Then there is also the advantage that when farmers contribute to a work of this kind there is some encouragement to them to maintain the road once it has been repaired.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that in scattered areas throughout the country I have had instances given to me of cul-de-sac roads which have been repaired by the voluntary co-operation of the farmers living on them without any reference to any Government Department.  I know it does not take place very often, but I know of one case actually in Galway, close to <Col N="764" /> Ballinasloe, where people have always repaired their cul-de-sac road.  They come together to arrange about it. One man gets the sand and the gravel and they repair the road at almost no labour to themselves because they do it every year. When these roads are repaired under a rural improvement scheme, if a little attention were given to them every year on a voluntary basis by the farmers living on them, they could save the cost of having the work done later under another rural improvement scheme.  In fact, it would be wrong not to state that in the case of many cul-de-sac roads the roads were on part of the lands vested in the tenants under old Land Acts.  The roads actually belonged to the people and were part of their property.  In a considerable number of cases, in the deeds which they signed at the time they expressed their responsibility for maintaining the roads.  I know that a lot of water has gone under the bridges since then and I know that the granting of a land title to people under these circumstances would not presume that the next generation of people would regard themselves as necessarily responsible for maintaining the roads. The fact is, however, that these roads were included in the Land Commission scheme and the responsibility for their repair was the responsibility of the tenants&mdash;not in every case, but in a considerable number of cases.</P>
    <P>The Government regard the rural improvement scheme as a good test of local initiative and as an experiment in overcoming this problem of the cul-de-sac roads.  We have never stated that the scheme will remain in its present form or that it is incapable of amendment. We inaugurated it to cover the cases of cul-de-sac roads which could not be repaired under the minor relief scheme, because there was an insufficient number of unemployed persons in the electoral division.  The scheme has not been sufficiently advertised by certain Deputies.  I should like to ask all Deputies to encourage its utilisation, to encourage people to come together and to overcome the difficulties arising from its operation. One difficulty that arises is when the <Col N="765" /> great majority of the people are willing to take part in a scheme and there is a very small minority that refuses.  I managed to persuade the majority in certain cases of the kind, particularly when they were people who themselves would take part in the work and recover the contribution, to go ahead and pay the contribution and ignore the small minority of selfish people, and I mean by that people who could afford to pay.  That is one way in which Deputies, county councillors and other people interested can help the scheme.  Another way they can help is by overcoming difficulties arising from the varying responsibility of users of a road.  There is the difficulty of the man with the big farm at the end of the road nearest to the public road who does not use the road much, as he has only 100 yards to go from his gate to the public road.  There is always a difficulty there that can only be ironed out by co-operation and patience, and people of influence in the district can help in making a scheme possible which would otherwise be likely to fail.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can say very much more on this motion except to repeat that until the end of the emergency it will certainly be impossible to accept the motion; that when we have caught up on the arrears of maintenance we shall have time to watch the working of the rural improvement scheme, to see how far it is really and genuinely successful, and time, therefore, to see what other measures can be taken in order that every mile of road used by people in this country can be placed in a state of proper repair.  As I said, it is with very great reluctance that I find it impossible to have a unified system of road administration, but I see no possibility of it at present.</P>
