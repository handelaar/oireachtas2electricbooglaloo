      <P>Legislation to establish a Department of Public Health and a Department to administer what have been described as the income maintenance services is being prepared and I hope that the Bill for that purpose will be ready for introduction within the next couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>As to the nature of the services to be administered by the two new Departments, this will be defined in the Bill. In the meantime, I would refer the Deputy to the general statements which I have previously made in this regard, for example, to my speech in the Dáil on the 30th January last (columns 168 to 173).</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether, in view of the trial and condemnation of Monsignor Stepinac, Archbishop of Zagreb and Primate of Yugo-Slavia, he will state if he has any information or has caused any request to be addressed to the Governments of Great Britain or the United States or any other member of the United Nations Organisation seeking information as to the reasons for the religious persecution at present taking place in some European countries and of which the case of the Archbishop is an outstanding example, and inquiring whether anything is being done or can be done to prevent this persecution: and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state what steps, if any, he intends to take to express on behalf of the Irish people their abhorrence of the laws under which the Catholic Bishops, priests and people of Croatia are liable to be arrested, interned and put to death, and in particular of the conviction and sentence of the Primate, the Most Rev. Dr. Stepinac, Archbishop of Zagreb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take Questions 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I have no official reports, nor have I any special information, which would enable me to make an authoritative statement on this matter.</P>
      <P>I have, of course, seen the reports which have been published in the Press of almost every country and have been widely interpreted as indicating the commencement of an era of religious persecution&mdash;a general attack upon religion, and upon Christianity in particular, under cover of the bitter animosities which remain in every country occupied by a foreign Power during the recent war as the most hateful legacy of the occupation.</P>
      <P>Freedom of conscience and the right to practise one's religion is rightly regarded as the most necessary and most fundamental human freedom, and any attack upon it in these days excites feelings of indignation and resentment in the minds of all people who love liberty and are conscious that to interfere with the right to give private and public homage to the Creator is to interfere with the ends of life itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of religious persecution is particularly hateful to the people of this country, whose forebears had to endure such persecution for centuries. I know how they feel at any indication of a recrudescence of it anywhere, and the Dáil can feel assured that, should <Col N="4" /> any practical way present itself in which we can be of any help in bringing effective influence to bear on the situation, the opportunity will not be neglected.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach say, in view of the express desire of the Dáil to take its full share in world co-operation to bring about order, to bring about peace and to avoid things disturbing to peace, whether he proposes to take any formal steps to secure full information on these matters so that Parliament here may be fully informed in an official way of the things that our Government are able to observe and obtain information about through formal channels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy thinks I can get or what formal steps I can take to get information on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach suggest that we have no means of getting information as to what is happening in these countries, in an official way through our representatives abroad or through any of the other countries that are taking formal part in the United Nations Organisation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as it is common knowledge that the sentence on Monsignor Stepinac, Archbishop of Zagreb and Primate of Yugo-Slavia, is one of many moves in an international Communist conspiracy to defame Christianity in general and the Catholic Church in particular, does not the Taoiseach think that it would be right and proper for the Legislature of this country publicly to express the detestation of our people by formal resolution, or such other method as he may think well and the Government may think well, to stigmatise this incident as an incident in a general Communist conspiracy and not as an isolated attempt <Col N="5" /> at the persecution of religion in one particular part of Europe?  Should we as a Christian country remain silent while there is a general international conspiracy among people here, there and everywhere all over the world, which pretends that each incident is disassociated from the other, while we know they are all part of the one common Communist conspiracy?  Should we not say so now and perhaps give courage to other nations to follow our example?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise that Parliament here should get the greatest possible information as to what is happening in the world disturbing to order and to peace?  For what purpose have we Ambassadors and Ministers and representatives of various kinds in the United States, in Great Britain, at the Vatican, and in other countries throughout the world if the Taoiseach simply tells us here that he has no information, that he has no way of getting it and, apparently, does not intend to attempt to get in any way formal information as to these terrible things which are apparently happening in the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach really mean that <Col N="6" /> our Parliament and our people, in the circumstances that are reflected in these questions, are just to wait and read the newspapers and get no formal guidance and no information from the Government as to what exactly, in so far as they can find it out, is happening in this respect in the world?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said already that I have no special information which would enable me to make an authoritative statement, and I do not think that I can secure for the Dáil information which would enable the Dáil to make an authoritative pronouncement either.  The information which I get through our ambassadors, our representatives abroad-this information is often of a confidential character, and before it could be used here as the basis for authoritative statements permission would have to be formally got for its use in this way, and I doubt if I could get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that it has been prominently stated that the struggle that has begun between the Soviet and the Catholic Church in Europe is at the bottom of the unrest and disturbance that exists in the world, and no country, no party and no class of people can afford to ignore it?  Are we, in this country, to be placed in the position that in following events we are just to read the papers and make up our minds as to what the case is and speak in our own way on the facts and develop public opinion, unguided by any such information, however meagre and however partial, the Government should be <Col N="7" /> able to collect?  Surely the Taoiseach realises that in a world situation such as exists we deserve some guidance from the Government and that we are entitled to have whatever information is available to the Government, through the channels through which it usually collects such information?  I suggest that should be given us, with whatever advice the Government may care to impart to Parliament while passing on that information.</P>

      <P>An invitation to attend the conference referred to in the Deputy's question was received on the 23rd August, 1946.  The purpose of the conference was to exchange views and remove doubts about the &ldquo;Proposals for Expansion of World Trade and Employment&rdquo; published by the Department of State of the U.S.A. but no decisions were to be taken or commitments entered into.  It was considered that the opinions of organised bodies in this country regarding the proposals could more usefully be sought after the general exchange of views at this conference and arrangements have been made to consult various organised bodies which may be interested in the proposals.</P>

      <P>In considering it, will the Minister realise that in Great Britain, as early as March and April of this year, the British Government found it necessary and desirable, in order to inform itself of the opinions of the various productive and trade bodies in the country, to put them a big questionnaire and, in the beginning of the year, the Prime Ministers of the countries with whom we sat in conference the other day came together and it was announced that they had decided on certain financial and commercial principles to guide them in their future discussions?  Will the Minister say whether he will convey to the bodies with whom he is communicating, or intends to communicate, the commercial and financial principles decided on by the Prime Ministers of the various countries in their discussions at the beginning of the year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the prices charged towards the end of September for potatoes in Dublin were the result of a temporary scarcity which developed in the County Dublin area due to the urgency of the harvesting operations.  As the position has already improved and potatoes are again available at reasonable prices, I consider that it is not necessary to institute control of the price of potatoes in Dublin, at least for the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that, in selling beer to traders in the Midlands, Messrs.  Arthur Guinness and Son, Limited, will only quote a carriage-paid rate, and will <Col N="9" /> not permit purchasers to remove the goods in their own lorries, but instead, forward the goods either by rail or canal; that, similarly, millers selling mill offals will only quote carriage-paid rates, and will only forward goods by rail or canal; if he will state the circumstances under which this arrangement is operated by the firms concerned; and whether, in view of the considerable hardships occasioned to traders, and to the unemployment among lorry drivers and helpers, arising from its enforcement, he will take immediate steps to have this arrangement cancelled, and to ensure that consignees will be permitted to take delivery of goods, consigned to them, by using their own vehicles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

The company are free to make such arrangements for the delivery of their products and I see no reason to intervene.</P>
      <P>The millers' price of offals is uniform for the whole country and includes an average charge for freight. I do not consider it desirable that these arrangements, which facilitate the fair distribution of commodities at a uniform price, should be disturbed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Information in the precise form requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  The position is that supplies of bricks, cement and slates are sufficient for the amount of building work that can be undertaken with the limited supplies of timber which are reaching the market.</P>
      <P>Since imports of timber were resumed the quantities for the purchase of which contracts have been placed abroad amount to something more than 13,000 Petrograd Standards. *This quantity, together with the much smaller quantity which can be obtained from the native woodlands, is sufficient to keep building activity for the present at somewhere about pre-war level.</P>
      <P>The priority to be given to housing schemes of local authorities and the rate at which work on such schemes should progress are set out in the White Paper published by the Government in February, 1945, entitled <i>The Post-War Building Programme.</i> In the administration of the Control of Building Order the programme announced in the White Paper is being followed.  When a licence under the Order is issued in respect of a housing scheme promoted by any local authority it may be assumed that the building materials needed for completion of the scheme will be available.</P>

      <P>There has been delay in the delivery of kerosene to certain areas because of the irregularity in the arrival of supplies from abroad and of the need, when supplies did arrive, for giving priority to the requirements for harvesting operations over the requirements for domestic purposes.

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there was considerable controversy in the local Press with reference to this complaint-that it was impossible to obtain timber in quantities of less than six tons.  That was the gist of the controversy in the Press.  The individual timber merchant concerned said, when pressed on that matter, that he had not refused to sell timber in quantities of less than six tons and that, as late as a few weeks previously, he had sold quantities of four tons.  The fact remains that poor people in Thomastown cannot <Col N="15" /> get timber in quantities of less than a ton, at least.  Would the Minister consider, in these circumstances, bringing in some Order to compel fuel merchants to sell in reasonably small quantities to poor persons-quantities to which their purse will reach?</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to the reply given to Deputy Dockrell on the 14th May last on this subject. As I pointed out, the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1946, provides for the continuance up to the 31st March next of the provisions of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, which enable grants to be paid to private <Col N="16" /> persons in rural areas and public utility societies in all areas for the erection of new houses.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to supplies of building materials is being kept under close examination in my Department, and, as soon as I am satisfied that the supply position warrants, consideration will be given to the question of affording assistance to private persons and public utility societies for the provision of houses, due regard being had to the need for conserving supplies for local authorities' housing schemes, which, in the main, will be devoted to the rehousing of persons in slum clearance areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that an £80 or £40 grant, as given pre-war, is not sufficient to meet the present high cost of materials?  An £80 grant pre-war would now be valued for only about £40 while a £40 grant would be equivalent to about £20. What could be done with £20 today in the reconstruction of a house?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, loans are ordinarily made available by the Minister for Finance from the Local Loans Fund for the provision of houses under the Housing of the Working Classes and Labourers Acts.  As was announced in the Budget statement, the Minister for Finance has fixed the present rate of interest at which advances are being made from the fund at 2½ per cent. and the maximum repayment period has been extended to 50 years. Applications for loans from the fund will be considered from all local authorities, but the larger municipalities will be expected to endeavour to raise from sources other than the Local Loans Fund such capital sums as they may require for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contributions to annual loan charges will be made at the appropriate rates under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932. I propose to ask the Oireachtas to amend the Act so as to enable contributions to be made for a period not exceeding 50 years. In addition to the assistance <Col N="18" /> given under the Act, the Government have given an assurance that grants out of the Transition Development Fund will be available towards bridging the gap between the subsidisable limits under the Act and present building costs.  Pending the submission of particulars as to (1) all-in costs, and (2) rents to be charged, it is not possible to determine the amount of the grant in any particular case, but the grant will be sufficient to allow of the houses being let at reasonable rents, having regard to current wage levels, provided that the tenders for their erection are reasonable.</P>

In the course of that statement he pointed out, as I have said, that each particular scheme would be considered in relation (1) to the rents it was proposed to charge, (2) to the cost of the houses, and (3) to the contributions that were going to be made by the rates.  All these circumstances will vary in each particular case, and therefore as long as the present transition period lasts, it is not proposed to announce any fixed grant which would be generally applicable.</P>

    <P>At the end of September, 1946, 1,521 houses were in course of erection by local bodies and of this number it is estimated that 270 will have been completed at 31st December, 1946.</P>
    <P>At the 30th September there were 1,536 houses for erection by private persons and public utility societies in respect of which certificates of approval had been issued but final payments had not been made.  It is expected that 100 of these houses will be completed in the period ending 31st December, 1946.</P>
    <P>Note.-The houses erected and in course of erection by private persons and public utility societies refer only to houses in respect of which grants are payable under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932-1946.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what steps his Department have taken to combat the recent increase in the prevalence of gastro-enteritis in children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1943 onwards, as the incidence of, and the mortality amongst infants from, gastro-enteritis began to increase abnormally, and particularly in Dublin County Borough, I have had every special measure that could be devised taken to combat the disease and to investigate the causes of its spread.  Special investigations have been made in consultation with medical and scientific experts, bacteriologists and paediatricians.  A special hospital to treat cases of the disease was opened by the Dublin Board of Assistance on my recommendation and <Col N="25" /> much useful work has been accomplished in that institution.</P>
      <P>At the same time, according as it became apparent that the Maternity and Child Welfare Section of the Dublin Corporation was not adequate to cope with this abnormal epidemic, my Department had repeated contacts with the corporation with a view to their taking the initiative in the institution of preventive measures in pursuance of their functions as the responsible public health authority.  Eventually, in March of this year, I recommended the corporation to adopt a scheme of liaison between the corporation's administration and the lying-in hospitals which, amongst other things, would include provision for better attention to sick infants.  I reported the position as regards this scheme to the Dáil in introducing the Estimate for my Department last June.  I regret to say that it has not yet been found possible to put that scheme into operation and that further time must elapse before the necessary accommodation required for it can be provided.</P>
      <P>I also recommended the corporation to institute an extended investigation of the effect of the use of dried milk for the feeding of infants.  This scheme also had not been undertaken by the time that I again intervened on the 21st August last to suggest the establishment of a special section in the corporation to review all aspects of the prevention and treatment of gastro-enteritis and associated conditions in infants.  On the 25th September I received a very representative deputation from the corporation and we discussed the general problem and the details of this latest scheme.  The corporation has now agreed to act on my recommendations and I have approved proposals for the appointment of a medical director, two senior medical officers, a bacteriologist and a staff of ten nurses.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I propose to appoint a special advisory body, composed of experts in infant welfare and children's diseases, to maintain close contact with the work to be performed by the corporation and all other agencies, to advise me thereon and to promote and co-ordinate research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> In view of the valuable properties of blood serum in the treatment of gastro-enteritis and for special midwifery and other cases I have invited the authorities of the Rotunda Hospital to undertake a service for the supply of serum for these purposes, pending the establishment of a more comprehensive and permanent general blood transfusion service.</P>
    <P>Special attention is being paid to this problem in Dublin County Borough because the incidence of the disease is so much worse there than in any other part of the country.  The benefits of any progress which will be made in combating the disease in Dublin, or arising out of research, will immediately be made available to the county medical officers of health in other areas.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the full statement on this matter which I made in the Dáil on the 25th July last.  As a result of the negotiations referred to in that statement, the British Ministry of Food have given an increase of 1d. per lb. in the price schedule for fat cattle and beef carcases, with effect from 1st October.</P>
      <P>Facilities for an export trade in dressed beef are already available, but the volume of such trade depends on whether the registered exporters find the business economic.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state, with reference to the recent Food Mission to London: (a) what proposals were made by the British Ministry of Food to secure increased imports from this country; (b) whether such proposals were acceptable to our delegation; (c) whether the British Ministry was specially interested in any particular class of food; (d) what efforts were made by himself and his officials to secure a more equitable scale of livestock prices when compared with British home prices; (e) whether the offer of ld. a pound increase in the price of beef was accepted by our representatives in the form of an agreement, and (f) why he considered it necessary to have the personnel of the mission exclusively drawn from the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Conversations took place recently between the British Ministry of Food and my Department in regard to certain matters, which subsequently were discussed by me with the Minister of Food.  These matters were fat cattle prices and a long-term contract <Col N="33" /> for the sale of eggs.  The discussions in regard to eggs resulted in agreement being reached on the terms of a contract for a period of three years commencing in February next, which will be the subject of a formal agreement. In the case of cattle prices, the best offer that could be obtained was an increase of 1d. per lb. in the current price schedule for fat cattle and beef carcases.  No formal agreement was entered into in respect of this increase, which became effective from the 1st October, 1946.</P>
      <P>With regard to the final part of the question, before the negotiations referred to were undertaken, the matters to be dealt with were fully discussed by my Department with representatives of the trade interests concerned.  There was no food mission, as that term is generally understood, and negotiations were confined to the two subjects I have mentioned&mdash;eggs and fat cattle prices.</P>

    <P>Retentions generally beyond 65 years in the period covered by the question, except of officers in subordinate grades, were due to the necessity of retaining trained staff to deal with the abnormal increase of work arising from Emergency conditions.  Members of the subordinate grades were retained on representations from the officers concerned that retirement in the conditions then prevailing would have involved undue hardship.</P>

So far as the second part of the question is concerned, I have been considering the various aspects of the matter for some time, but I have no present intention of introducing legislation.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that old age pensioners, the weakest and poorest section of the community, are suffering considerable hardship and injustice, due firstly to the smallness of the allowance granted and secondly  the operation of the means test? Does the Minister not think it right and proper that he should consider granting an increase to this section of the community, seeing that, across the Border, the same class of people have got a considerable increase within the past month?  Has the Minister anything to say with regard to that?</P>
      <P>In view of the very unsatisfactory nature of the reply given to me by the Minister and his failure to reply to my supplementary questions, I propose with the permission of the Chair to raise this question on the Adjournment this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies will remember that the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939, was framed and passed before experience was gained of the nature of air attacks on the scale reached in the war. To meet the situation as it developed the Act was amended and extended by emergency powers.  The amending and extending Orders remaining in force at the date of the expiry of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, have all been revoked.  The object of the Bill is to amend the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939, so as to include in permanent legislation certain provisions in relation to air raid precautions which were heretofore secured by emergency powers Orders and which it is considered essential to retain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> The Bill covers six matters as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Supplementary powers and duties of local authorities, their officers and servants in connection with arrangements for evacuation of the civil population and provisions for the accommodation, maintenance and welfare of evacuees.  Existing powers cover only assistance by local authorities to the extent of collecting and furnishing information for the purpose of the preparation of plans for the transference of the civil population.  These powers were found to be insufficient and under an emergency powers Order wider authority had to be obtained, i.e., covering transport, accommodation, billeting and the appointment of billeting officers, the purchase of equipment and the recoupment of expenses incurred by local authorities.  It is not intended to continue all these powers now, but to retain a general provision requiring local authorities to perform duties in connection with evacuation arrangements to such extent as the Minister may direct after consultation with the Minister for Local Government; to authorise local authorities to incur expenditure for this purpose and to enable the Minister to refund the expenditure so incurred.</P>
    <P>(ii)  To continue a textual amendment to the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939, which became necessary as a result of a typographical mistake in that Act where in sub-section (4) of Section 34 the words &ldquo;of any borough&rdquo; appeared instead of &ldquo;off any borough&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(iii)  To enable the State to recoup local authorities in full (rather than on the partial basis laid down in the Act of 1939) any approved expenditure incurred by the local authorities on the provision of food and rest centres where temporary accommodation and feeding could be provided for persons who might be bombed out of their houses.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Supplementary powers to cover the payment of State compensation to members of A.R.P. services injured in the course of duty in peace-time, for example, in incidents such as those which during the recent emergency occurred at Dún Laoghaire, the North Strand, South Circular Road and other <Col N="171" /> places.  The powers in the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939, were limited to the payment of compensation to persons injured in the course of training or exercises in peace-time and did not envisage hostile acts against the State by any of the belligerents while the State was not engaged in war.  Provision is also necessary to secure that any such compensation would not be reckoned as public moneys for the purposes of abatement of any military service pensions.</P>
    <P>(v)  In order to secure the availability of an adequate supply of drugs and dressings and hospital equipment to provide against the possibility of a large number of casualties, the Department of Defence purchased stocks of the necessary supplies to the value of approximately £60,000.  The stocks were not held centrally but were distributed to hospitals throughout the country selected primarily for their strategic position and also having regard to the storage accommodation available. Some, if not a major portion, of these supplies are still difficult to obtain and arrangements are being made to retain as much of the supplies and equipment as possible having regard to the keeping qualities of the various items and the rates at which they can be consumed and replaced.  A scheme has been worked out in consultation with the Department of Local Government and Public Health for the redistribution of the supplies to various hospitals that can consume and replace them.  In this manner it is hoped to maintain in the country indefinitely an adequate reserve supply of medical and surgical supplies and requisites.</P>
    <P>Powers are required to cover the acceptance of the supplies by hospitals, both as regards the powers of the hospital authorities to accept them and the ability of the Minister to enforce this acceptance.  Provisions are also necessary to enable the Minister to secure that reasonable arrangements are made for the proper maintenance and storage of the supplies and for the recoupment of reasonable expenses incurred by the hospital in making provision for proper storage and maintenance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> In order to protect the patients and staffs of hospitals certain measures, e.g., shelter accommodation, anti-blast measures and protection from the effects of glass breakage due to bombing were considered advisable in the hospitals situated in or near the areas in which intensive A.R.P. measures were considered necessary, i.e., the four county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and the six urban areas scheduled in the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939, i.e., Drogheda, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Bray, Wexford and Cóbh.  Measures recommended by the Department of Defence were undertaken in many of these hospitals and arrangements were made for the recoupment of portion of the expenditure (not exceeding one-third) from State funds together with an equal recoupment from the funds of the local authorities in whose areas the hospitals were situated.  The necessary powers for the recoupment of the expenses were secured under emergency powers Order and provision is made in the Bill for the continuance of these powers to enable outstanding claims to be dealt with to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are designed to meet existing requirements only.  For example, while provision is included to require local authorities to perform duties in connection with evacuation arrangements the most recent of these duties has been the winding up of the arrangements already made and the settlement of any matters outstanding in consequence of the organisation which was established and has since been broken down.  Prudence requires that we should still maintain the powers necessary to organise A.R.P. and that as far as possible we should ensure that the maximum equipment necessary should be maintained in the country where this can be effected without waste or loss.  In this connection, it may be mentioned that apart from an endeavour to ensure the maintenance of medical and surgical equipment, arrangements have been made on the advice of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for the redistribution of the fire-fighting equipment for A.R.P. purposes to areas where the equipment <Col N="173" /> will be of use and can be maintained. The Bill merely incorporates the various emergency powers Orders which were in operation during the emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will naturally be regarded as non-controversial in every respect.  I was interested in the Minister's statement that, in certain eventualities, 100 per cent. recoupment would be made to local authorities, and, in that connection, I want to direct his attention to Section 2 which imposes certain obligations on a local authority.  Under the old Bill, it was competent for the Minister to make a grant to a local authority up to 75 per cent. of the entire expenditure, but in point of fact the only grant allowed, so far as the Dublin Corporation was concerned, was a maximum of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>As this Bill, in effect, merely provides for the shell of an organisation&mdash;quite a prudent step&mdash;and as it largely centres around the retention of certain stores, particularly those relating to the Auxiliary Fire Service and the Casualty and Rescue Service, and as all the saleable stores are, so to speak, on the market at present, it might be a suitable occasion to ask the Minister if he is prepared to devote the proceeds of the sale of these stores to the municipal exchequer, so far as Dublin is concerned, in view of the fact that the Department gave to the city authority only a maximum grant of 50 per cent. when the Act permitted a grant of up to 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister also, as a matter of interest, what the position with regard to the respirators is?  At the conclusion of the emergency, there was a good deal of speculation as to what was to become of these respirators. May they be regarded now as the personal property of individuals, if they still exist?  It would appear to me that their collection would involve too large an organisation.  I understand further from the Minister's statement that he proposes to retain a certain amount of drugs.  These obviously will be drugs of a character which might be regarded as non-perishable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In sub-section (2) of <Col N="174" /> Section 5, provision is made for continuing the provisions of certain emergency powers Orders.  That is a very unsatisfactory way of introducing legislation, and I suggest that a way out of the difficulty would be to incorporate in the Bill the actual provisions of these Orders.  This, of course, is the simplest way of doing it.  It is easy enough for Civil Service Departments to keep an accurate account of these Orders and amendments of them, but, with the exception of the Library here and of certain Departments, I do not think it is possible for anyone to find accurately, at short notice, all the matters dealing with air-raid precautions as contained in these emergency powers Orders.  In the event of litigation or any other reason requiring a person to look up particular provisions, the individual is placed in great difficulty, and I suggest that the Minister should consider the advisability of introducing an amended form of this section on Committee Stage incorporating the actual provisions.</P>
      <P>If these Orders are to be incorporated in permanent legislation, why not put them all in one Act?  We have had discussion here time and again on the desirability of codification.  The Taoiseach has expressed verbal agreement with that suggestion and, in fact, a committee has been appointed by the House for the purpose of codifying existing statutes.  Now, as late as 1946, we are introducing a system of legislation by reference to existing Orders. In a few years, these Orders will not be available and great difficulty will be caused to anyone who desires to know the text of particular Orders or the actual matters dealt with therein.  I suggest the Minister should consider introducing an amended form which will incorporate in the Bill the actual provisions of these Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Cosgrave's appeal to the Minister.  It is a very difficult matter to construe law at present, having regard to the multiplicity of emergency powers Orders of all kinds which have to be consulted. Many of these have not been printed; some are only typed.  I cannot say if that applies to the Orders mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 5 but it would <Col N="175" /> make for simplicity of reference and ease of reference if we had incorporated in the Bill the substance of the various Orders.  I do not think it would be a very big job.  Very many of these Orders, while they may appear at first sight to be long, have only one or two paragraphs of real substance in them, and I suggest that the Minister should consider embodying the substance of these various Orders in the form of the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not given us any indication of the expenditure likely to be imposed upon local authorities, on hospital boards or committees or on local authorities in charge of hospitals, under the Bill, and I should like to hear something from him in that regard.  I should also like to know whether the Government contemplate a continuance of the emergency situation.  Are we living in a war atmosphere?  Are we to continue to live indefinitely in a war atmosphere?  This Bill, so far as I can see, is to become a permanent statute. There is no limit of time to the operation of the Bill.  I suggest that the Minister might consider giving this Bill a duration of, say, five years.  That would put us past the present emergency and perhaps bring us into the new one, if it is likely to arise.  I do not think that a Bill of this kind should form a permanent feature of our legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan, I am afraid that is more or less outside my power.  As to the point he raised in regard to respirators, some time ago we notified the public through the Press as to what we thought they should do in regard to the respirators in their possession.  So far as I can remember at this stage, we asked the public to retain the respirators and to preserve them.  It is, of course, true to say that the rubber and certain other material in the respirators are perishable to a certain extent; but, nevertheless, it is desirable that they should be retained until the extreme limit of their usefulness.  After that, we will just have to write them off, because the expense which would be incurred in collecting them would be such that it would not warrant the collection <Col N="176" /> of them in the manner in which they would be required to be collected. In regard to the point raised by Deputies Cosgrave and Coogan, this is, in effect, a form of the codification for which they are looking.  A general order in regard to codification generally has been issued to all Departments of State and I understand that this is being undertaken.  That, of course, is a colossal job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very negation of codification because it presents the difficulty that it is not alone in Acts you have to find the matters referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have taken Deputy Coogan up correctly, but to my mind he suggested that there would still be a necessity to refer to former emergency powers Orders.  That would not be necessary in this case, because these amendments are, in fact, emergency powers Orders which we are incorporating in this amending Bill. Therefore, if there is any reference required, it will be to this particular amending Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 5, sub-section (2), you will have to refer to at least four Orders if you want to understand that section.  My point is that, instead of legislating by reference, the substance of these Orders should be embodied in the sub-section.  I do not think that that would entail any great difficulty in drafting and it would make for brevity and easy reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can have that examined. We are getting the effect that we require in the amending Bill as it is.  I am no more anxious, I can assure Deputy Coogan, to continue a war atmosphere than he is.  This is a necessity which has been forced upon us.  If we did not perform this duty, I am sure Deputy Coogan himself would bring us to task for it.  Even at the end of five years, I do not know <Col N="177" /> what the situation will be, but whoever is in this position, if the necessity should arrive for removing the requirements which we at this stage deem necessary, it is always possible to do that.  This is not the last word on air raid precautions.  Like Deputy Coogan, I hope the day is coming when we will be paying attention to things other than the protection of our people against war damage, and so on.</P>

    <Title>Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1946&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is the intention, as Deputies will see from the provisions of this Bill, to enable Bord na Móna to provide facilities for the sale of intoxicating liquor at their camps.  It is intended to permit the board to sell beer and stout to their workers at such of their camps as may be situated at a distance from a suitable licensed premises.  As Deputies are aware, most of the bogs to be developed under the ten years' scheme which was outlined in the White Paper and discussed by the Dáil, and indeed many of those already developed, are in isolated areas and the camps must necessarily adjoin the bogs in all cases.  It has been found already that the lack of facilities normally available in more populous localities imposes a hardship on the men living in the camps and that position will be considerably intensified as development proceeds into more remote localities. The community life of the camps is in itself irksome to most workers and it is felt that anything that can be done to provide for their ordinary needs should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies know well, the work of turf production is arduous, and during the harvesting season it entails long hours which makes it hard on the men who have to travel considerable distances, distances in excess of three or four miles, for a drink at the end of their day's work.  The facilities which <Col N="178" /> this measure will provide will be a considerable contribution towards the general contentment of the workers concerned.  It is, perhaps, desirable to make it clear that the permission to the board to provide facilities for the sale of liquor at their camps will not be given at random.  It will be a necessary condition that the camp at which the facilities are to be provided is not situated at a reasonable distance from suitable licensed premises already existing.  I should, perhaps, indicate that I would regard a reasonable distance as a distance of about two miles from the camp.  Such a condition will ensure that there will be no undue conflict, because of the passage of this Bill, with local trading interests.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the licensee will probably be the camp superintendent or the bog manager in each case and the recommendation as to the person to whom the licence is to be given will be made by Bord na Móna.  Arrangements will be made to ensure that the licensing hours applicable to the district will be enforced and it will be the duty of the licensee, the camp superintendent or the bog manager, to ensure that any rules and regulations which may be drawn up by the board for the proper working of the canteens will be strictly adhered to.  The Bill is a simple measure and I do not think it is necessary to give any elaborate explanation of its provisions.  It has for its purpose that one aim to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how many of these premises are likely to be licensed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that straightaway.  The Deputy will have seen a list of the bogs which it is proposed to develop.  I could not say straightaway whether there are now suitable licensed premises within a reasonable distance of the places where the camps will be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather strange to find the Minister for Industry and Commerce introducing an Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  That in itself, of course, indicates that this is a departure from the ordinary licensing <Col N="179" /> legislation that has been put before the House from time to time that there are powers being taken under this Bill that do not obtain under any existing licensing legislation, and that licences are to be given and to be renewed by a machinery completely different from the machinery which ordinarily operates for the granting, the withdrawal or the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences in the country.  That is not quite so simple a departure as the Minister would seem to indicate.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear a case being made by the Minister as to why those licences are sought in this way.  I am not now suggesting that in certain cases it might not be desirable to have a licensed premises of the kind indicated in a bog.  I agree entirely with the Minister that the work in the bog is irksome, and that the conditions, with the best will in the world, in a camp of that sort, cannot be all we would like to have.  I agree it is unfair to expect men after a day's heavy work to travel three, four or five miles in order to get a drink.  I should like to hear a case made as to why those licences will not be sought for through the usual channels; in other words, through the courts.</P>
      <P>I should like to be assured, further, as to who will be responsible.  The Minister said that the licence might be in the name of the bog manager or the camp superintendent.  Will Bord na Móna be responsible for the exercise of the licence?  Will Bord na Móna be free to farm out the licence by way of contract or otherwise?  The Minister also stressed that the licence would be applied for unless there is a suitable licensed premises within a reasonable distance.  In that connection, he has in mind something like two miles.  Who is to determine the suitability of the existing licensed premises in the area? Will that be determined by the Gárda, by Bord na Móna or by the Minister's Department?  Who is to say whether an existing licensed premises in close proximity to the bog is or is not a suitable licensed premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Minister that the hours of opening and closing applicable to the district will apply to <Col N="180" /> any of those licences which may be granted; in other words, that the hours for the sale of drink in those premises will not differ from the hours in any of the other licensed houses in the area.  I would like to know whether there will be any difference in the prices charged there; whether the prices to be charged for drink in those establishments will be the prices normally charged in the licensed houses in the district.  To what purpose will the profits be put?  I am speaking on the assumption that the board will be responsible for those licensed premises. I assume that there should be a profit if the normal prices are charged and perhaps the Minister will indicate what will become of the profits &mdash;in what way will they be disbursed, and to whom will they be paid?  These are a few of the points that occur to me and I hope the Minister will endeavour to clear them up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I also wish to join with Deputy Morrisey in welcoming the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his new role in introducing intoxicating liquor legislation.  I regret that this Bill is so circumscribed in its title.  It deals only with certain bog areas, but, being an Act to amend and extend the licensing laws, I wonder if it would be possible for the Minister, in this his first effort at introducing licensing legislation, to remove the bit of bog that has been created in the licensing legislation that was passed in 1943.  It has caused considerable difficulty to the Minister for Justice and to people interested throughout the country.  I do not know if the title of this measure will enable the Minister to include the matter which I have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister could see his way to introduce a section which will remove an anomaly in existing legislation which precludes a licensed vintner who wishes to improve his premises from doing so.  For instance, he might wish to build a new premises and take his licence, as it were, across the road.  If he happens to reside in any of the boroughs he cannot do any such thing.  The transfer of a licence is impossible inside a borough.  I am <Col N="181" /> not so much concerned with that, but a serious impasse has been created where urban authorities are engaged in slum clearance work.  Where a large slum area has to be cleared, there may be four, five or six public houses carrying on business.  Those public houses may have been there for 50 or 60 or more years, and when the tenants are removed from them the licences have to be extinguished.  The owners may be compensated, but they will not be allowed to transfer the licences to other premises.  I was wondering if the Minister would be good enough to include a section relating to slum clearance in cities, so that this anomaly would be removed.  The welcome to the Bill would then be intensified and the Minister would get kudos from everybody concerned in this vital matter.  Deputations went to the Minister for Justice about the matter but he found himself unable to do anything because the Bill in question had been passed.  Now that amending legislation is being dealt with, this would be a suitable time to include a section to remove that anomaly and to make it possible for a licensed vintner to transfer his licence in the case of slum areas cleared by urban authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read this Bill, I felt that it was another piece of evidence of the Government's policy of creating patronage but the Minister's explanation has, to a certain extent, relieved my mind of that suspicion.  He says that Bord na Móna will be responsible for implementing this Bill but, strange to say, the words: &ldquo;Bord na Móna&rdquo; do not appear anywhere in the Bill.  The Minister may, whenever he thinks it expedient, grant a licence or renew a licence or transfer a licence. Evidently, he may do these things on his own initiative and of his own volition. The whole framework of the old legislation pertaining to licences is swept to one side.  The licensing jurisdiction of the courts is completely usurped.  Nowhere in the Bill can I find any provision to enable persons to give vent to their opposition to applications for such licences.  Bodies such as temperance organisations may have rooted objections to the granting of those licences and they may want to <Col N="182" /> voice those grievances in public.  We know that those organisations come into court from time to time and oppose the grant and renewal of licences. Under this Bill, those people are debarred from giving vent to their opinions in these matters.  Moreover, there is no way by which the licensed trade in a particular locality can bring their objections to bear with any force upon applications of this kind. As everybody knows, in the case of ordinary licences, under the existing code the Gárda may go into court and object to the grant, renewal or transfer of a licence.  So also may any citizen or interested body of citizens.  This Bill is very sweeping having regard to the fact that it brushes aside all the old procedure under the licensing laws. From that point of view, I see considerable objection to the principle involved in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the court, heretofore the Revenue Commissioners could grant a licence only on the certificate of the District Court.  The district justice would have had before him the applicant, the Gárda and the people opposing the application.  He would have had before him evidence of the desirability or otherwise of granting the application.  Those were considered necessary precautions and I maintain that precautions of that type should be preserved in this Bill.  The Minister has not given us any reason for departing from that procedure and transferring to himself&mdash;which, in practice, as I always hold, means the Department which he controls or the Civil Service&mdash;power in regard to the grant, renewal and transfer of those licences.  That is a grave objection and I imagine that other bodies will have something to say on these matters in due course.  Not only does the Minister propose to give himself all those powers but he proposes to touch upon what has been a very tricky legal problem&mdash; the transfer of licences to adjoining premises or the transfer of licences to reconstructed premises or to premises to which additions have been made. All those things were, up to now, thrashed out in open court.  The applicant had to satisfy the court of the necessity for the transfer&mdash;that the <Col N="183" /> premises were altered or enlarged or reconstructed.  What Deputy Keyes had in mind was, I think, that, where premises are destroyed in a slum area, the licensee should have a right to transfer his licence elsewhere.  That is a point worth consideration because there have been grave cases of hardship in the City of Dublin in cases in which premises had to be pulled down under demolition orders.  That was, perhaps, known for a number of years before the actual demolition took place.  The value of the licensed premises diminished according as the date of the operation of the demolition order approached.  In practice, the premises for years had no selling value.  In a case of that kind, there might be grave hardship to a family and it would be desirable that, in those circumstances, a person should have the right to transfer his licence to some other premises.</P>
    <P>My objection is to the procedure set up under the Bill.  It removes entirely the licensing jurisdiction of the courts and transfers that jurisdiction holusbolus to the Minister.  That introduces a bad principle into licensing legislation. I think that the old procedure whereby these matters were disposed of by the courts, in the first instance, and then by the Revenue Commissioners, on the certificate of the courts, was safer and more advantageous.  The Minister has not stated why he wants to get rid of the jurisdiction of the courts. Nowhere in the Bill is there any indication that he proposes to follow the procedure which would obtain in the case of an ordinary application for a new licence or a renewal or transfer of an existing licence.  As the Minister is aware, the grant of a licence may be opposed by various people, including the police.  Similarly, the renewal or transfer of a licence may be opposed. In the case of the death of a licensee it is usual for the courts to grant an interim transfer to his family.  That cannot arise in this Bill by reason of the particular persons who are to become licensees.  I want to impress upon the Minister that the mere recommendation of Bord na Móna may not be sufficient to warrant the grant of a licence to a particular person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> It would be desirable to have the police investigate the character and antecedents of the proposed licensee. In all ordinary cases these matters are considered by the police and if the police have any objection either as to the character of the person or his past history, or in any other respect, the matter is thrashed out in open court. It is not clear from the Bill that the Minister, before acting on the recommendation of the board, would have any police report as to the character of the proposed licensee and it is quite conceivable that the wrong type of person could be appointed and that, particularly in an isolated area, a serious condition of things might arise.  If the wrong type of person were appointed you could have a little republic in regard to the licensing laws set up in a particular bog and the police would find themselves in a very serious position in trying to enforce the licensing laws.  If there are 200, 300 or 500 men congregated in a bog it will be a difficult matter for the police to enforce the law in relation to prohibited hours but if the wrong type of person should become a licensee and if abuses creep in and if the supervision by the board is defective, I can see a very serious state of affairs arising in remote localities. The State may be faced with the problem of having to increase the strength of the nearest Gárda station. The Minister should have regard to the proximity of the nearest Gárda station when granting a licence of this kind. Men will be drawn from all over the country to these camps and they will be a problem to the local police.  It may be that in time you will have to provide a police station on the bog to maintain law and order.</P>
    <P>These are matters as to which the ordinary procedure in respect of licensing laws, if operated, would give a certain amount of check but under this Bill, as far as I can see, you will have no check on these things and the Minister will simply act on the recommendation of the board.  If that is to be the position, I would seriously advise the Minister to reconsider this matter in the light of what I say.  These bogs are situated in remote localities.  The camps will be spread all over the country, and I am <Col N="185" /> not saying they will, but it is quite conceivable that they may become a serious police problem.  Camps that were established in war-time conditions elsewhere proved a very serious problem to the military and civil police and I have no reason to believe that the men congregated in our bogs will prove any different from those in camps anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I would particularly like the Minister to consider giving some opportunity to the licensed trade in the particular area where they propose to grant licences of this kind to provide the amenities in the first instance or to voice their opposition to the granting of these licences.  The Minister, I think, said that reasonable distance would be something like two miles.  That is not too far to go for a drink and where there are 400 or 500 men concentrated in a camp, the further they may have to go for a drink the easier, very often, it would be for the police to supervise. Apart from that, I think it is only fair and reasonable that the licensed trade in the particular localities where these camps are likely to be established should have some means of catering themselves for the bog workers or, alternatively, some means by which they could openly oppose the grant of the licence.  I see no means of doing that under this Bill unless the Minister is prepared to revert to the ordinary procedure applicable to licences, that is, to transfer the jurisdiction which he is taking to himself to the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my regret that any extension or change of the licensing laws that is being made does not carry with it a withdrawal of the penal enactments under the present licensing laws against the rural community.  The present licensing laws are repugnant to the Constitution and bad in law.  Any law that deprives the citizens of equal rights is a bad law. Deputy Coogan alluded to the licensing laws being broken.  I find that wherever reasonable facilities are given there is less likelihood of abuse.  The law is that in Dublin City and Cork City the citizens can go into the local public houses for four hours on Sunday but outside the boundaries of those cities a citizen who exercises the same <Col N="186" /> right is liable to be fined and the publican is liable to have his licence withdrawn.  That law is bad.  I suggest to the Minister that he should amend the Bill to give equal rights to every citizen so that the rural community and the licensed vintners in the rural community will have their four hours on Sunday.  There is definitely grave hardship.  The city people in general have plenty of freedom.  Generally they are finished work on Saturday at 1 o'clock and return to work on Monday morning.  The man living at 40 Grand Parade, Cork, can walk into No. 41 Grand Parade at 1 o'clock on Sunday and sit down for two hours and drink enough and he can come back again at 5 o'clock and spend another two hours there and be within the law.  The agricultural labourer and the farmer and the man in the bog, for whom we have all the sympathy under this Bill, who exercises a similar right, is immediately fined.  He has to walk three miles before he can enjoy a drink on a Sunday. Yet these are the hardest worked members of the community. During recent months unfortunate farmers and labourers and their helpers who, after working on Sunday, went to the local village, found the Guards marching up and down to see that they would not get a drink in the village.  I regard that law as repugnant to the Constitution which gives equal rights to all citizens.  The licensing laws are bad in that respect and I do not believe they could be upheld in law.  The Minister should take this opportunity to remove that penal enactment against the rural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of this Bill which, as is apparent to everybody, are urgently needed.  As we are amending the licensing laws at all I would ask the Minister to take this opportunity to correct them in respect of matters in which they have been found wanting, even since the passage of recent legislation.  We had, for instance, the matter that Deputy Corry has referred to.  Various public bodies in County Mayo have protested and have passed resolutions condemning the position that people in rural areas and country towns are not entitled to the same facilities on Sunday <Col N="187" /> as are provided for the people in the cities.  There does not appear to be any reason why the people in the country should not be entitled to the same facilities as are provided in the towns.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, a much better argument can be put forward for the country dweller, inasmuch as Sunday is his only day off.  In the case of the farm labourer or the small farmer in the West of Ireland, it is the only day he gets to meet his friends in the local town.  As everyone knows, it is much easier to provide for the enforcement of the law if the law is reasonable, as when the people feel that this law will not be enforced in some towns and that in the cities the citizens are normally entitled to go into a public house for a couple of hours on a Sunday, they have no respect for the provisions of the licensing laws and there is a temptation to break them.  There is always a great temptation to country publicans, when people come into the town on Sunday&mdash;the only day of the week on which they can enjoy a couple of hours' leisure&mdash;and try to prevail on them to let them in for a drink.  If the provisions suggested here were inserted, to legalise the opening in country towns just the same as in the cities, for a couple of hours on Sunday, it would remove a lot of the Gárda difficulties.  It would create greater respect for the law and greater respect in the minds of individual country people for the enforcement of the licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the previous Licensing Acts were passed here, it has been found that we made a bad mess of the question of occasional licences.  For instance, in regard to the town of Westport, in County Mayo, where the famous Croagh Patrick pilgrimage takes place each year, the people in that town from time immemorial have kept open on the night previous to the pilgrimage, as pilgrims were coming in from all over the country and travelling long distances, so that they might cater for those pilgrims.  It has been found that, under the recent legislation, the courts had no power to grant <Col N="188" /> licences to cover that occasion and as a result those people, who have been catering from time immemorial for such pilgrims, were forced to close down completely.  The pilgrims who had travelled from all parts of this country &mdash;and who, in normal times, travel from various parts of the world&mdash;find that in the only town close to Croagh Patrick where they used to get facilities in the way of meals, sandwiches and drinks, the shops&mdash;and particularly the public houses&mdash;have had to close down, since no provision is made at law under which the traders could apply for occasional licences to meet the situation. That is one instance in my own county and I am sure there are various other instances in connection with other fixtures in different counties where the same difficulties have been encountered. I would like that power be given to district justices to meet special occasions of that kind, by putting in a section in this Bill.</P>
    <P>At present there is no provision for transferring a licence from a particular house to some other house some distance away, even though it is extinguishing the original licence.  Reference has been made here, in the discussion on the Bill, to licensed premises, possibly in a slum area, the owner of which wants to build elsewhere. That provision is not there now, but it was suggested that we should legislate for it.  I think the provision could be stretched even further, to enable somebody even outside a town or outside the location of the public house altogether, to transfer that licence&mdash;providing it is extinguished in the house to which it applies&mdash;to a completely different house in a different area.  I have one special case in mind where such a provision would be necessary.  We have a very ancient system of distilling which has not been referred to here very much, that is, the poteen industry, from the ravages of which we suffered quite a lot in the West of Ireland over a great number of years.  It has been held by very many people that the best method of combating illicit distillation would be to provide reasonable public house or drinking facilities in those areas.  Like every other traffic, it is the consumer who provides the prosperity <Col N="189" /> for the poteen maker.  Although at the moment the poteen has suffered an almost fatal blow during the emergency, owing to the lack of supplies and lack of sugar, we all look forward to the time when we will have these articles in normal supply again and, no doubt, the old poteen industry will flourish as it has flourished throughout the centuries, irrespective of the very heavy penalties laid down by law to eradicate it.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a provision in this Bill whereby licences could be transferred outside even the town they are in.  We know that, since 1902, we cannot have new public house licences, unless the licence existed then, except in the case of hotels.  The number of licences would not be increased by this suggestion and possibly they would be distributed more equitably and there would also be the possibility of combating the traffic to which I have referred, which is a very serious problem in the West of Ireland.  By the suggested provisions, it would be possible to establish licensed premises in one of those areas and that might be the most effective way of combating the traffic.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the argument of Deputy Coogan in connection with the proximity of Gárda stations to the premises envisaged under this particular Bill.  I have listened to this argument both here and in the courts over a long number of years and I have failed to understand the logic behind it, in the case of public houses, dance halls or any other form of licensed premises. I do not see why, in considering the grant of a licence, the proximity to the Gárda station should be taken into account at all.  The natural and logical conclusion one has to come to is to build all the public houses round about the Gárda station.  Surely the Gárda are there to administer the law, while the licensed premises under this Bill are to be provided for the accommodation of the people in the particular area in which they are required?  It might be a very good thing that notice should be served on the Gárdaí in connection with these licences, as they may be useful in giving evidence as to the character of the applicant or his or her suitability as a licensee; but I <Col N="190" /> do not think the position of the barracks in relation to the new licensed premises should be taken into account at all.  Where you have these turf development workers, there are bound to be new districts and, if facilities for drinking are to be provided for those workers in those isolated areas, one of the first considerations should be the workers' comforts. I would not like it to be suggested that these men, after their hard day's work in the bogs, would be compelled to travel several miles, in order that the local Gárda might have only a couple of hundred yards to go.  I think that if we are establishing these premises at all, the main consideration should be the facilities to be provided for the people for whom we are catering. I have no doubt that if there are abuses the nearest Gárda station will be in a position to take care of them. I do not think that is a matter that should be considered when dealing with the principle of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that we have had so many changes in the licensing laws of the country, I urge on the Minister that, when we are making this particular change, he should try to put right some things that have gone wrong under previous licensing legislation, and in particular he should abolish the hurtful discrimination there is between country dweller and town dweller under the present licensing laws.  By doing so, he would be contributing towards better respect for the licensing laws in this State.  By many people they are regarded as very much of a farce.  This country is much too small to have one licensing law for one city or county and another licensing law for another city or county.</P>

      <P>With regard to the observations of Deputy Keyes, Deputy Corry and Deputy Moran, I can only say that I am not in a position to discuss with them the provisions of the Licensing Acts in general or the particular amendments to these Acts which they propose.  The introduction of this Bill by me does not imply that the administration of the licensing laws has been transfered from the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In fact, it is intended to make it clear that the sole purpose of this Bill is to make the legal changes which are necessary to permit of the sale of beer and stout at turf camps. It is certainly not intended to extend the scope of the Bill further than that.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Coogan misunderstood to a considerable extent what is intended here.  On the bogs developed by Bord na Móna there will be residential camps, and at these camps there will be canteens at which the workers employed on the bogs will be fed and at which they can purchase cigarettes and other commodities of that kind. The intention of this Bill is to permit, through the device proposed here, of the sale of beer and stout at these canteens. It is not intended that there should be separate premises for the sale of intoxicating liquors established, or that there should be any proprietary interest in the licence that will be issued in consequence of the granting of a certificate by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under this Bill.  This certificate will be issued to the camp superintendent, to the person who is employed by Bord na Móna to administer the camp.  He will hold the licence issued by the Revenue Commissioners on the strength of that certificate only so long as he holds his office. If he ceases to hold this office the licence will be transferred from him to his successor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure with regard to the position of Army canteens. I can say that this procedure is not without precedent because the sale of intoxicating liquor at airport restaurants is carried on under a licence issued in a similar manner by the Revenue Commissioners following the granting of a certificate by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the individual responsible for the management of these restaurants.  The holder of the licence will, therefore, be an officer of the Turf Board.  He will have to carry out his functions as camp superintendent or bog manager in accordance with the regulations made by the board and they will lay down specific instructions governing the conduct of the canteens to which the manager will have to conform.  It would not be practicable, in view of what I have said, to follow the normal course of procedure.  It is not intended that the individual who gets the licence will get a licence which will represent a property to him, either the right to sell intoxicating liquor on his own behalf at specified premises on the bog or in any other premises.  The sole purpose of this Bill is to permit Bord na Móna through its camp superintendents to sell at the canteens in the camps, beer and stout.  I understand that it is the intention to confine the sale of intoxicating liquors to beer and stout.  The board will, of course, be responsible for the management of the camps and of the canteens as well as for the conduct of the camp superintendent, and will give whatever instructions they think are necessary to ensure that the camp is properly run and for regulating the sale of liquor at the canteens.  I do not wish to be taken as saying that in no circumstances will any liquor be sold in the camps to persons other than those resident in the camps.  The intention would be that no person other than those resident in the camp would ordinarily be served, but exception might be made in the case of officials of the board going to the camp for supervisory purposes or of other persons attending at the camp in company <Col N="193" /> with officials of the board.  Ordinarily, however, sales will be permitted only to persons resident in the camp.  With regard to possible objections from licensed traders in an area I tried to make it clear that a certificate will be issued under this Bill only in cases where there are no other licensed traders in the area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will understand that it is necessary to use some such word as that.  One can conceive circumstances in which 300 or 400 persons in a camp could not possibly be accommodated at whatever licensed premises might be within two miles radius of a camp.  I think that a two miles radius would represent a reasonable area.  If there were suitable licensed premises within a two miles radius of a camp then a certificate would not be issued, but I would regard it as a hardship on workers who had been engaged on turf work all day if they had to walk more than two miles in order to get a drink at the end of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I understand that the intention is to sell drink at the normal prices prevailing.  Deputies will understand that there is no official control of such prices in normal circumstances. Occasionally, prices vary from one district to another or from one type of premises to another in the same locality, but it is certainly not intended that the board should endeavour to <Col N="194" /> attract trade from other licensed premises in the locality.  As I have explained, it will be the normal, if not the exclusive, practice to confine the sale of liquor in these canteens to persons resident in the camp.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Whatever profits may be derived from the sale of drink will be amalgamated with whatever profits may result from the sale of meals and cigarettes in canteens and will normally appear in the accounts of the board.  It will be the responsibility of the board so to regulate their charges in the canteens as to make a minimum profit to cover their expenses because the intention is to make it possible for workers residing in these camps to save a substantial portion of their earnings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board would be at liberty to do that and possibly may have some such device in mind but the experience of the board in the administration of the turf camps established under the emergency hand-won schemes has been that they make a substantial loss arising out of the fact that they are selling accommodation at less than economic cost, thereby increasing the net earnings of the workers who are employed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also the intention, as I explained, to observe in regard to the sale of drink the licensing hours prevailing in the locality.  There will be no sale outside these hours.  In the case of the airport restaurants to which I have referred, that practice was not observed. The licences issued to these restaurants empower them to sell drink any time passengers are awaiting transportation but in the case of <Col N="195" /> the residential camps normal licensing hours will prevail.  I think what I have said explains precisely what is in mind here.  We are not establishing a new class of licensed trader.  We are merely proposing to facilitate this organisation in the sale of liquor at their canteens.  There will be no property in the licence, which will be issued from time to time.  It will be always subject to renewal and subject to transfer at the decision of the Minister and will, in fact, be transferred, in so far as the holder will be the licensee, <i>ex officio</i>, because of his office as bog manager or camp superintendent.  He will normally cease to be the licensee when he ceases to hold that office.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies will no doubt be aware that the Principal Act which it is proposed to amend by this Bill, the Statistics Act of 1926, enabled the Minister for Industry and Commerce to collect, compile and publish statistics relating to any matter affecting the general economic and other activities of the State.  In the Act of 1926 certain matters were particularised. Deputies are no doubt familiar with the matters concerning which statistics procured under the Act have been published.  Section 5 of the 1926 Act provided that the Minister for Industry and Commerce could arrange for the collection of statistics by civil servants.  Every officer of the Civil Service performing duties under that section was deemed to be an officer of statistics.  Under Section 13 of the Act, however, no individual or other forms furnished by any person under the Act could be shown to any person other than the officers of statistics concerned therewith, in the course of their duty as such officers.  The only exception to that absolute prohibition of the disclosure of individual forms to any other person other than an officer of statistics was in the case of a prosecution under the Act.  It has been found that considerable administrative inconvenience has been caused by that absolute prohibition.  On many occasions during the course of the emergency when it was desired to get information from traders concerning stocks, sales and other matters of that kind, it was necessary to go to these traders and ask that they furnish a second time information which they had already furnished under the <Col N="197" /> Statistics Act because we could not avail for the purposes of administration of the information furnished under the Statistics Act, even if the trader were quite willing that the information should be available for general administrative purposes.</P>
      <P>The amendment which we are proposing to make in the Act, to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to authorise the disclosure of that information to any specified officer of a State Department requiring it for the purposes of his official duties, is in accordance with the provisions of similar legislation in other countries. A similar change in the British Act, the Census of Production Act, 1906, was made recently.  The effect of the amendment will be to authorise the Minister for Industry and Commerce to sanction the disclosure of statistical information furnished in returns obtained under the Principal Act to specified persons who must be officers of a State authority or members or officers of a committee, commission or tribunal of inquiry set up by the Government or by a State authority.  It is intended that the disclosure of the statistical information procured in that way can be made only to specified persons and any disclosure by a specified person to another person would involve him in substantial penalties.  From the viewpoint of the concerns or the persons furnishing particulars, the effect of the change is merely to widen the classes of persons who can be described as officers of statistics in accordance with the meaning given to that term under the Principal Act of 1926.  It is unnecessary to stress that the powers given by this amending Bill will be used only in circumstances in which it is considered essential for the proper performance of public duties to do so.  They will be used with due regard to the natural desire of business concerns and private individuals that their affairs, as revealed in the returns made under the Statistics Act, will not be disclosed otherwise than to official persons and under the usual conditions of secrecy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change is a minor one.  The need for the change was emphasised by experience during the emergency, but I think the fact that a similar change has been effected in the law of other <Col N="198" /> countries, and particularly in the law of Great Britain, would have brought to attention the need for effecting the change here also.  The persons who give information in returns made under the Statistics Act required for the preparation of the census of production or some other similar statistical abstract will be convenienced by the change, in so far as they may not be in future approached twice by the same Department for the same information.  That has been the position in the past and it has caused a great deal of misunderstanding and some annoyance, as Deputies will readily understand. When a firm was asked to give certain information by the statistics branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce and gave it, they could not understand the Department of Industry and Commerce asking, a week or a month later, for the same information to be furnished to another section of the Department which could not, however, get that information from the statistics branch as will be possible in future, provided the Minister is satisfied that it is required for the performance of official duties and makes the necessary order specifying the persons to whom the information is to be disclosed.</P>

      <P>That is right.  The information required from private firms would relate, for the purpose of the census production, to the total value of their sales, the quantities of raw materials purchased, the number of persons employed and the total amount paid in wages by them.  All that information is tabulated for particular trades and published in the census of production, but it could conceivably happen that the returns of an individual firm might be of information to an officer of the industries branch considering proposals for the extension of a particular industry or the establishment of a new concern in that industry.  In the past, that officer could not get that information, except by direct approach to the firms concerned, even though the information was available in the statistics branch next door.  In future, the Minister can ask the statistics branch to give that information to the specified officer dealing with the official matter in the other section.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the confidence of these firms from whom this information is required will not be broken?  Has he consulted business people with regard to the matter?  The accuracy of the returns furnished to the statistics branch in the past was due to the fact that they were regarded as strictly confidential. Now this is a wiping out of that system.  Is the Minister satisfied that he will get as accurate returns as he got in the past, in view of this change?  I also want to say that the fact that the change has been made in the law in Britain is no reason why it should be made here.  The Minister has other sufficiently good reasons without putting up that argument.  If we are to adopt that as a policy, if the new line is to be one of following them in everything else, well and good.</P>

      <P>I mentioned that fact to show that we were not attempting to do anything revolutionary, anything that had not been found necessary elsewhere. <Col N="200" /> There is little danger that firms will lose confidence in the secrecy of their returns.  All the penalties for disclosure of this information to unauthorised persons will continue in the future as in the past.  The class of persons within the official circle to whom the information can be made available is being widened.  I have found, however, that the firms concerned rarely objected to giving that information to another section of the Department which requested it, and in fact most of them did assume that, when they made a return to the statistics branch, the return was also available to the Department generally. That was not so in law, and they had to give the same information separately to enable it to be available to other branches of the Department or to other Departments.  The effect of the change is to widen the class of persons within the official circle to whom the information may be made available, if it is required and if the Minister decides that it is needed by these persons for the discharge of their public duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is the sixth Telephone Capital Bill since the transfer of services in 1922.  Funds for the development of the telephone service, that is, for extension of the <Col N="201" /> system, as distinct from its operation and maintenance, are provided by Telephone Capital Acts.  These Acts authorise the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund from time to time such sums not exceeding a stipulated amount as may be required for development of the telephone service.  Funds provided by Telephone Capital Acts represent an investment by the State in the telephone service.  The security to the State for the capital investment is represented by the assets of the service, consisting of plant, apparatus, and property generally forming the telephone system.  The annual capital charges in the way of interest and depreciation are a charge against the earnings of the service.</P>
      <P>The last Telephone Capital Act, 1938, provided a sum of £1,000,000, which is now almost entirely spent.  The sum provided was expected to be expended within about five years, but the very difficult supply position which arose owing to the emergency prevented the execution within that time of the development programme contemplated. The development work done has, therefore, been quite inadequate to meet the growing demands on the service, much less to provide for future growth.</P>
      <P>During the last six or seven years the service has been carried on under most difficult conditions and only by the exercise of the utmost ingenuity on the part of our engineering staff has it been possible to prolong the life of much plant which had far outlived its normal period of efficiency.  As in other countries throughout the world we had to impose certain restrictions on the connection of new subscribers but we have been able to meet all really essential demands for service by public authorities, doctors, etc., as well as a substantial proportion of applications for business lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the restrictions on acceptance of new subscribers &mdash; which in the last year or two involved refusal of almost all applications for telephones required for personal or social use and for less essential businesses &mdash; traffic on the telephone system has continued to grow at a remarkable rate.  Trunk calls increased from 3,300,000 in 1938 to <Col N="202" /> 7,118,000 in 1945 and local calls in the same period increased from 30,000,000 to 48,000,000.  The figures so far this year show a further advance.  These huge increases, occurring at a time when the expansion which could be effected in our exchanges and trunk circuits was limited by the emergency supply conditions, strained the capacity of the system to the limit, and sometimes beyond the limit.  Under these conditions the standard of service inevitably has suffered.</P>
    <P>The equipment in the principal Dublin automatic exchanges serving mainly the business community has been heavily overtaxed for several years past.  The equipment of the Dublin trunk exchange likewise is insufficient to cope satisfactorily with traffic at the busiest periods.  Numerous other exchanges throughout the country need to be replaced or extended. Additional circuits are needed on almost every telephone trunk route to enable trunk traffic to be dealt with expeditiously.  Underground cables containing subscribers' circuits must be laid extensively before all the existing demands for telephone service to new subscribers can be met.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these conditions as indicating the volume of arrears of construction work which requires to be done in order to cater satisfactorily for present traffic and to meet current demands.  This work by itself would be very costly and would take a long time to execute.  But in addition to clearing arrears and meeting present demands much more is needed in order to provide for development of the service in the future.</P>
    <P>The possibility of expanding the telephone service on a very large scale has been closely examined and I am satisfied that the time is opportune to prepare for such expansion.  Plans are being completed and work is proceeding on a scheme having for its object the trebling of the present number of telephones in use.  In order to attract new subscribers in the numbers contemplated it will be necessary to make the service as efficient, as attractive and as cheap as possible.  At present the hours of service at many exchanges are from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on week-days and 9 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. on Sundays <Col N="203" /> and bank holidays.  At any more, the hours of service extend only to 10 p.m. with the addition of the hours 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Sundays.  I fully recognise that the telephone loses much of its attractiveness when the hours of service are restricted; for many people its availability in any domestic emergency is one of its greatest benefits.  I am satisfied that the telephone service could not be extensively developed in rural areas and small towns unless continuous service were given.  Our plans provide, therefore, for giving continuous service at all but the very smallest exchanges (those with less than about five subscribers). In order to give this service it will be necessary to instal automatic equipment in lieu of the present equipment at the great majority of exchanges. In conjunction with the automatic system it will be necessary to have central manual exchanges (i.e., exchanges staffed by operators) at selected points throughout the country to deal with trunk calls, inquiries, etc.</P>
    <P>We aim also at giving virtually a &ldquo;no delay&rdquo; service on trunk traffic, that is, all calls, except an occasional one at the busiest traffic period, from any point in the country to any other point will be connected without the caller leaving the telephone.</P>
    <P>As I have already announced on a previous occasion it is proposed within the next five years to instal a telephone call office at every post office which is at present without one.</P>
    <P>The programme of construction work involved in raising the standard of service on these lines and catering for the increase in subscribers which we expect is an enormous one.  It will be very costly and will take many years to complete. New underground cable containing subscribers' circuits will have to be laid in every city and town in the country.</P>
    <P>More than 600 new automatic and semi-automatic exchanges and about 50 central manual exchanges must be installed.  To house the larger automatic exchanges about 130 new buildings will be needed and accommodation for the manual exchanges will involve either the extensive alteration of existing <Col N="204" /> premises, the acquisition of additional premises, or the erection of new buildings.</P>
    <P>To cater for estimated growth of trunk traffic, plans are being made to increase the trunk network six to eightfold.  The position has now been reached on some of our main routes that no additional circuits can be erected overhead, and underground trunk cables must be laid to provide the circuits required.  Such cables are extremely costly and take a long time to manufacture and lay, but they enable all possible demands for the future to be adequately met.  To give a satisfactory service on cross-Channel calls a new submarine cable will be laid.  It is also intended to erect telephone kiosks on a very generous scale in cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The full programme of development contemplated will cost not less than £10,000,000 in capital expenditure, but this Bill, following previous practice, provides only for the amount &mdash; £6,000,000&mdash;which is likely to be spent in the next four or five years.  The sum of £6,000,000 includes provision for new automatic and trunk exchanges at Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and 30 other main centres; installation of 100 automatic exchanges in smaller towns and 500 semi-automatic exchanges in rural areas; main underground trunk cables and overhead trunk circuits; subscribers' circuits; and the installation of call offices at post offices. The expenditure under the main headings is estimated to be as follows:&mdash; New exchanges and buildings, £2,072,000; trunk circuits, £2,400,000; subscribers' circuits, £1,360,000; kiosks and call offices, £275,000; other works, £245,000; giving a total of £6,352,000, which has been rounded down to £6,000,000.</P>
    <P>The annual charges on this capital expenditure will, of course, impose a heavy burden on telephone revenue for many years ahead.  But the profit earned in the last few years has been so high (about £250,000 per annum) that a substantial margin is available for development and I am satisfied that while the heavy charges for interest and depreciation which will be incurred may temporarily convert that <Col N="205" /> profit into a loss, any such loss will quickly be overtaken as plant becomes revenue-earning.  While generous provision of equipment, lines, etc., will be made, we shall guard against providing plant too far in advance of its being required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will get his opportunity when I have finished my statement.  I must emphasise that, before a thoroughly satisfactory service can be given to subscribers and new subscribers can be taken on in unlimited numbers, a large part of the programme which I have outlined must be completed and this work will occupy some years.  For example, I may mention that the design, manufacture and installation of a major automatic exchange takes, under the most favourable conditions, about 18 months; and it would take from two to three years to lay an underground trunk cable from Dublin to Cork. Although improvements will become effective within a comparatively short time in certain areas, it will be some few years before the position is satisfactory everywhere.  We hope in due course to arrange a major campaign to attract new subscribers, but I regard it as most important that it should not be launched until we are in a position to meet demands satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Everything possible is being and will continue to be done to hasten the execution of the construction programme. Additional engineering staff are being recruited and according as they are trained more are taken on. Contracts have already been placed for new automatic and trunk exchanges in Cork and Waterford and for equipment to extend the Dublin Trunk Exchange.  Twenty automatic exchanges are on order for other towns; 18 large manual exchanges have been extended and arrangements have been made for the extension of others pending conversion to the automatic system.  The capacity of numerous smaller exchanges has also been enlarged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To relieve the congestion in the Dublin automatic system and enable additional subscribers to be taken on a <Col N="206" /> contract has been placed for the extension of all the automatic exchanges. Work is proceeding on the main extension at Crown Alley and it is hoped that this work will be completed by next summer.</P>
    <P>Underground cables containing subscribers' circuits are being laid extensively and the work of clearing arrears of waiting applications for telephone service is already proceeding in some places.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the British Administration arrangements have been made for the manufacture and laying of the new cross-Channel cable to which I have already referred and we hope that it will be laid by the end of next year.  This will give initially 60 extra circuits with an ultimate capacity for 144 and will enable a &ldquo;no delay&rdquo; service to be given on cross-Channel calls.  Pending more permanent relief measures on the Dublin-Cork route, on which there is heavy delay to calls, we have been able to provide three additional circuits and work is proceeding on the provision of a further 12 circuits which I hope will become available early in the new year. Recently 30 three-channel &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; systems have been obtained which, when certain additional lines are erected, will enable additional circuits to be provided extensively on numerous routes.  Delivery of a further 30 systems is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>The money asked for in this Bill will enable us to proceed with the development planned and to give, as the work progresses, a steadily improving standard service to subscribers.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to express my thanks for the patience which subscribers have shown with the unavoidable defects of the service in recent years.  I fully appreciate how irritating it is to experience delay in gaining the attention of an exchange or to have to wait a long time to make a trunk call on an urgent matter.  The public generally have recognised that the deterioration of service is an inevitable outcome of the emergency and have accepted it in a reasonable spirit.  Deputies can rest assured that every possible step will be taken to bring about a substantial and sustained <Col N="207" /> improvement in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>I should like, also, to pay tribute to the excellent manner in which telephone operators have carried out their duties under very difficult conditions in recent years.  I am afraid that they are sometimes wrongly blamed by subscribers for deficiencies of the service which are outside their control.  In many exchanges they are operating inadequate or outworn equipment and great credit is due to them for the way in which they have helped to give the public the best service possible within the limits imposed by lack of lines and equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion, which stands in my name and that of Deputy McGilligan:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the long-continued closing of schools in the City of Dublin is a grave source of moral danger and educational loss to the children, and thus creates distracting problems for parents, and therefore calls upon the Government to set up at once a conciliation committee consisting of representatives of the Government, the managers, the teachers, and of the Dublin School Attendance Committee, to consider and make recommendations with a view to terminating the present dispute <Col N="208" /> and bringing about the immediate reopening of the schools.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves at a very critical stage in our social, economic and even political development and in a very critical stage in world affairs.  The whole foundation of our national unity, the strength of our national character and the capacity of our people to deal with any aspect of their affairs in the future is very seriously undermined by a strike as a result of which the whole of the lay body of national teachers in the City of Dublin are away from their work and are supported in their protest by the whole of the body of national teachers throughout the country.  The effects of that on the future may be very serious.  To-day it is undermining our confidence and our will to sit down to discuss anything of an important nature with regard to world affairs.  I recall, when we were in the beginnings of the movement after the war ended in 1918, when the country was setting itself to gather strength and to set out determinedly to secure legislative freedom to manage its own affairs &mdash; I recall Terence MacSwiney, when talking about the possible strength and determination of the country to face that situation, saying that we should have taken the Councils Bill which would, at least, have given us control of our own education.  So clearly did he realise, as an educationist, that in education lay the power of unifying our strength, that he looked back to the despised and spurned Councils Bill of 1908 and felt that it was a pity the Irish nation had not agreed to accept even that measure so as to get control of its education. Twenty-five years after setting up our Legislature, we find ourselves in more critical and difficult times than we were in at the close of the 1918 war.  We have had command of our own education for more than 20 years.  We have had the task of moulding the machine and settling the programme and objectives. And we find ourselves now in the astonishing position that the whole body of our national teachers are on strike against the general conditions under which they work.  This motion has been put down for the purpose of helping us to clear up the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> I ask that the Dáil bring the pressure of its opinion upon the Government to get the Government to assemble the committee mentioned in the motion so that when they have discussed the matter &mdash; and a very detailed and intricate matter such as that can best be discussed inside the walls of the council chamber &mdash; we shall have a situation in which the teachers will go back to their work with relations between themselves and the Government so restored and so harmonious that we can rely upon their carrying on the work of the schools and a situation in which any difficulties that may require to be settled &mdash; and there will be difficulties &mdash; will be suitably adjusted. Either that or we shall know that we shall have to face the future with a continuing strike of the teachers or with the strike broken by the Government and the teachers driven back to their schools.  We shall know exactly what the issues are because we shall have them clearly stated by the four bodies mentioned in the motion, whose representatives will have examined them in the quiet atmosphere of the council chamber.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Government to be fair to themselves, to be fair to us and to be fair to the country.  We have had sufficient experience during the recent war to realise what has happened to countries where various groups have spurned the council chamber and gone into the battlefield. We know that the people in whose interest, apparently, the council chamber was spurned and the battlefield chosen have been brought to ruin and destruction.  In our own country in the past 25 years, in matters connected with the civil war and with the economic war, the council chamber was spurned on various occasions. Looking back over that period, there is nobody who would not make sacrifice to undo the years of damage and the years of loss that resulted from the spurning of the council chamber. To-day, we are dealing with a body of men and women whose services and loyalty to this country are unquestioned. Then, we have the Government, whose interest in the country cannot be questioned either.  They are <Col N="210" /> interested in every aspect of the country's life.  They have been standing outside the council chamber and they have presented the Parliament and the people with a very difficult situation which ought to be argued in detail in the clearest possible way.  At the present moment there is a situation in Dublin in which 124 schools are closed.  The remainder are open.  But, out of a total school population of something like 75,900, 44,000 children are absent and have been absent for the last seven months.  In the schools that are open, the normal number of children on rolls is 43,900.  At present the attendance is 31,000.  The normal attendance in these schools has fallen by about one in seven and the children that have left these schools as a result of the strike together with the children belonging to the schools that are closed total 44,000 or 58 per cent. of the school population.</P>
    <P>It is suggested in much that has been said during the last seven months that the teachers are demanding control of the public purse, that they are demanding rights in relation to the public purse that cannot be admitted with regard to anybody who is paid directly out of State funds.  It has been suggested that this is a strike against the State.  It may be that later on these things will have to be argued but I do not think it is advisable that they should be argued until all the questions are again referred to the four bodies that I speak of and have been discussed inside the walls of the council chamber.  I do not admit that this is a strike against the State.  I do not admit, that this is a demand on the part of the teachers that they shall dictate in any way, that they shall have particular command over the public purse but, if these things have to be argued, they ought to be argued after the matter has been fully and carefully considered and when Parliament can get a more reasoned statement as to the things that are at issue from these four bodies I speak about.  For six years out of the last seven I have moved back the Education Estimate here as an expression of the general dissatisfaction of the people and our general dissatisfaction with the condition <Col N="211" /> of education in the country.  I have criticised the position from the point of view of the size of classes, from the point of view of the Irish language, the lack of results with regard to the Irish language, the lack of confidence on the part of the teachers in the inspectorate, the ignoring by the Department of the opinions of the teachers on vital matters, the general condition of poverty of some of the classes of the teachers.  Year after year, over quite a large number of questions, we have expressed here the dissatisfaction of the people and our dissatisfaction with the work of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Strikes arise over many things.  One particular item may be the matter that will detonate the gathering discontent of a group of people, but any of us who has been discussing educational matters or endeavouring to keep in touch with the educational system or with the schools or the conditions in the schools for some years past knows that there is more behind this strike than mere dissatisfaction with pay; that you have a position in which no conscientious teacher could be satisfied that the work that he is endeavouring to carry out in the schools is being properly carried out, that he has the right contact with the Department or that he is getting any real help or recognition from the Department for the work that is being carried out.  Therefore, I ask that the question be referred to a body such as this.</P>
    <P>What types of questions are likely to arise between the groups of representatives that I speak about?  The question of pay will be discussed, not in relation to the teachers alone, but in relation to the effect the present system of payment has on the children.  Inside these walls there will be discussed the size of classes at the present time, the number of pupils a teacher has to teach, the multiplicity of classes teachers have to teach in some cases, particularly in small schools, the position with regard to the teaching of the Irish language and the teaching of other subjects, the position with regard to the inspectorial approach to the assessment of the teacher's work in the school and the <Col N="212" /> settling of the teacher's remuneration. There will be quite a large number of matters discussed and, of necessity, discussed there, and I submit that in face of what the strike of teachers means, these matters have to be fully and thoroughly examined by people who are competent to examine them before here in Parliament we can satisfactorily discuss them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said from time to time that here in this Chamber is the place to discuss educational matters, and he has retreated from a position in which he stood years ago, when he was of the opinion that any Minister for Education carrying on education in a country in which the position of the Minister for Education is what it is in this country ought to have an advisory committee around him.  We could quote the Taoiseach on that.</P>

      <P>In spite of the fact that it is now said that this is the place to discuss educational matters, my complaint when I was moving, for the sixth time in seven years, that the Estimate be referred back, was that it was a very tiresome thing year after year to have to stand up after the Minister for Education had spoken and move that his Estimate be referred back for reconsideration, and to be putting to him the general thirst in the country for some confidence in the Department of Education, on the one hand, and the general thirst for some knowledge as to the broad lines of the Department's approach to an educational syllabus or programme in the country and to be meeting just the same dumb kind of reluctance to discuss the educational problems in the country to-day.  I mention that as showing that I feel and know that there is more than matters of pay concerning the teachers in their present attitude and that it was not a mere matter of pay that brought a body such as the national school teachers into a position of being on strike in the way in which they are to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child is affected in this matter. You have in the various numbers of categories of pay and of rating the <Col N="213" /> position that nobody with any quality as a teacher can be expected to stay in either a slum area or a rural area. The system of pay, when you take the rating system that is involved in it and the category system that is involved in it for principals, has the effect of leaving us in a situation in which the slum child is denied the teacher of quality and the people in our glens and hills and remote districts are denied the teacher of quality also.  What is the position under the rates that have been recently published?  An unmarried man in a slum area after 18 years can hope to rise to a salary of £380 which, at the 1938 figure, was valued £223.  The teacher in a slum is teaching a large class, teaching in circumstances in which he cannot hope to make a decent show when the inspector comes on the occasional visit to decide whether he is a person to be marked highly efficient or not.  The teacher cannot attain the rating of highly efficient until he gets a certain mark by an inspector.  What is the test that the inspector applies?  It is the kind of answer he gets to a particular question or questions put on a particular section of a particular subject on a particular day.  Is the teacher there simply to impart information to the child or is he there to develop the character, the imagination, the personality of the child?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Education to look back over his description of what was expected of the teacher, when he spoke at the I.N.T.O. Congress in 1943. It has been recorded already, in column 2647 of the Official Debates for the 27th April, 1945.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the war was over, however it ended, nothing could be as it was before.  There would be an era of new creation, new planning, new building.  In this great scheme teachers everywhere must take an essential part.  Small nations will have their own special problems, too, and not the least of ours will be the preservation of our language and our individuality as a nation.  We must equip ourselves to meet postwar trade competition and, at the same time, not only maintain our present standards but raise them progressively in every sphere of <Col N="214" /> national life: education, social service, agriculture, industry and commerce.  To accomplish this, we must plan carefully and methodically and, in particular, must train the youth to take their place in the nation's advance.  Education and training of over 70 per cent. &mdash; the Taoiseach would say 90 per cent. &mdash; of those whose work would be carried out on the farms, factories, shops and offices would, in the future, be either mainly or entirely in the teachers' hands &mdash; that is, in the primary teachers' hands &mdash; and the work of all other schools would depend on them, since their task was the basic one, the laying of a solid foundation, without which no specialist superstructure could be built or maintained. It is not too much to say, therefore, that the future development of our country will depend on your leadership more than on that of any other body.  What was the essential task of such leadership? The giving to the coming generation of a keen sense of social service, such a feeling for the community, such knowledge of it, such grasp of its continuity, its profound values, its inherited obligations as would enable that generation which now look to the teachers for inspiration to face the tremendous task of shaping the new Ireland.  No greater duty has been laid on any body of men and women than the one laid on you &mdash; a heavier task than is laid on the shoulders of any other teachers in the world in that, in addition to the great task of education you have been asked to perform, another equally heavy task has been given to you such as no other body of primary teachers has been asked to carry, the rescue of the greatest heritage of our race, our native language.  It is a terrific task, a task one might say for supermen, that we have undertaken.  Many have not grasped its magnitude clearly and some few showed signs of discouragement, because they expected results too easily.  Those who have borne the brunt and burden of the work are not discouraged, because they knew the task was a hard one, which had to be faced <Col N="215" /> with determination and not with any idea that difficulties could be solved otherwise than by application and hard work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the work and that is the type of person which the Minister appreciates the national teacher should be, the type of person he thinks he can be made to be and the type of work that he, above all teachers in the world and above all classes in this country, has to take on himself.</P>
    <P>Yet the organisation of the pay is so arranged that good teachers are denied to the slums and to the poorer districts, because the rating and the grading is so arranged that a man who gets himself into a slum area wants to get out of it at the earliest possible moment, so that he will not be prejudiced in the matter of being marked &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;.  The man working on an Irish mountain or in an Irish glen wants to get out of it to an Irish town or to Dublin or to the suburbs here, because he cannot maintain himself where he is.  He cannot do the work that is required and bring himself and his children up to the standard required by the Minister for this great work of building up Ireland.  At any rate, he is offered more in the towns and in the city.  He is in a worse position, in that he knows he will bear the brand of not being &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; as long as he stays in the slum or in the glen, since the manipulation, in the interests of economy, is such that only one-third of the whole of his class &mdash; and not even one-third of the whole of the class &mdash; can be marked out before the pupils, before the country and before his own colleagues as &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the interests of the children, that type of grading cannot stand.  The child in the slum has his place in the Ireland of the future and is entitled to equally generous treatment and equal opportunity with anybody else in the land.  The child in a backward rural district, in the glens or on the hillside, is entitled to the same equality of opportunity as any other child.  The country hill or glen can produce a Davitt or a Collins, just as the more crowded area in the City of Dublin can produce a Griffith or a <Col N="216" /> Pearse.  If we are to leave the Irish glenside or the crowded areas in the cities without our best teachers, then we are undermining the opportunities and the prospects of our country and we are dealing unfairly with certain sections of our people.</P>
    <P>When this question of rating and of categories arose, it was not a case of a group of people seeking merely after benefit for themselves, but of a group of people standing up for the profession in which they are and standing up for the people they are expected to defend.</P>
    <P>The question of women teachers and their pay will naturally arise.  Owing to the unsatisfactory conditions of service, men are moving out of the teaching profession and women are becoming more and more the teachers of a larger number of children.  The woman teacher in the slum area or in the out of the way rural district has the same qualifications, the same capacity, the same work with her children as elsewhere. Very often, it is greater, because in her one working day she is handling four or five different classes of children in different grades and they call on her activities and her energy, so as to make the mental strain much greater than if she were dealing with just one particular class of child.  When the women seek for equality with men there is something to be said on their side, something to be, at any rate, more thoroughly argued out in consultation between the teachers and the managers, the Department and people like the school attendance committee, who know something of the objectives and results of education, before we are asked finally to argue it out here, or to argue it in circumstances in which we are arguing at the same time the conditions of a strike.</P>
    <P>There are many things in the circumstances the teachers have had to put up with in the past when they might almost have despaired of their being able to carry out the work imposed on them.  In any representations which have been made in this matter, the Department have been either utterly heedless or utterly incapable of doing anything for one reason or another to help.  One of the questions which would arise for discussion in such <Col N="217" /> a conference as we speak about is the question of the size of the classes.  It is a matter that I have dealt with year after year for a number of years.  I have appealed to the Department that we ought to realise that in our schools, where we have a second language to deal with, we ought at least make every attempt to see that children get as fair a chance of being instructed as the children in Great Britain get where they have only one language to deal with.  I have pointed out that it was accepted in Great Britain in 1929 that a cardinal point in national education policy was that large classes should be eliminated, and that all classes should be brought down lower than 50 children on the roll.  Such a determined effort was made in Great Britain between 1929 and 1938 that in their boroughs and urban districts, where there were 22,000 classes, with over 50 on the roll, in 7.9 of their classes that figure was reduced to 1.9.  In the county boroughs where there were more than 46,000 classes with 10.9 of these classes having more than 50 children on the roll, the percentage by 1938 was reduced to 2.4.  In the City of London, where there were 15,000 classes, 10.6 per cent. of them had over 60 children on the roll and that was reduced to 4.4 in a period of ten years.  Of the total of all these publicly administered classes in which in 1929 7.2 had more than 50 pupils on the roll the figure was reduced to 1.4.</P>
    <P>In 1941 I discussed this matter here. I drew the attention of the House to the conditions existing in 12 schools taken at random in North-East Dublin. In one school there were 13 boys' classes.  Three of the classes had over 50 on the roll.  In the second school there were nine classes, five of which had more than 50 on the roll.  In the third school there were 13 classes, with eight classes having more than 50 on the roll.  In the fourth school there were 28 classes, 20 of which had more than 50 on the roll.  In the fifth school there were 19 classes, with 12 having more than 50 on the roll.  In the sixth school there were 14 classes, ten of which had more than 50 on the roll.  In the seventh school there were nine classes, five of which had more than 50 <Col N="218" /> on the roll.  In the eighth school there were seven classes, with four having more than 50 on the roll.  In the ninth school, there were ten classes, four of which had more than 50 on the roll. In the tenth school there were eight classes, five of which had more than 50 on the roll.  In the eleventh school there were 15 classes, four of which had more than 50 on the roll, and in the twelfth there were five classes, two of which had more than 50 on the roll.</P>
    <P>What is the position to-day?  I asked for certain information, but owing to the strike I only got it for four schools. In the first of these schools, with nine classes, there are six with more than 50 on the roll.  If all the children in the school were divided amongst the teachers there would be 51 in each class.  In the second school, with 23 classes, 18 of these have more than 50 on the roll.  In the third school with 19 classes 12 of them have more than 50 on the roll.  In the fourth school with 15 classes there are seven classes with more than 50 on the roll.  Over a school period of something like eight years the teachers who are dealing with these children have to educate them, to develop their personality and their characters, to give them an appreciation of citizenship and of what their work in the future will mean to their country.  They have to prepare them to face their after-school life.  It has to be remembered that they are dealing with the infants and with the first and second classes entirely through Irish, a language which the children do not speak at home.  The teachers are doing their work conscientiously in this matter.  Since this State was set up at least three generations of school children have passed through the schools.  A generation of school children had passed through the schools at the time that we left Office.  The children who passed through the schools during those eight years passed through them at a time when something was being done to revive the Irish language. An estimate might have been made at the end of that period as to what the results were.  Another eight years had passed by 1939 or 1940, and a third generation of children will soon be coming to the end of their period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> The teachers are looking around to see what the result of all that work has been.  Some of them, representing the organisation as a whole, made a report on the general situation with regard to that.  The fact is that while inspectors of the Department discussed on behalf of the Minister that report which the teachers had put together the Minister himself refused to do so.  The Minister, in his statement on the Department of Education on the 3rd May, 1943, speaking in Irish said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ní féidir linn an Ghaedhilg do shlánú gan sár-iarracht do dhéanamh i gcoinnibh Béarla agus uaireanta i gcoinnibh an náduir dhaonna féin, i dtreó go mairfeadh an teanga.  Ní féidir cogadh mí-chuíbheasach teangan den tsórt san do choimeád ar siúl gan íbirt, agus gan iarrachtaí diana, buan-tseasmhacha &mdash; agus níil a mhalairt sin do rogha againn muna mian linn leigint don Ghaedhilg bás d'fháil mar theangain labhartha.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say they are working under the kind of Ministerial direction which is embodied in that statement.  The statement translated reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot save Irish without waging a most intense war against English and against human nature itself for the life of the language. Such desparate linguistic war cannot be carried on without sacrifice and persistent effort and struggle, but we have no choice unless we intend to let Irish die as a living language.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The teachers who are on strike to-day are looking around to see what will be the result of their years of labour. They have been years of great labour. That labour was given willingly by the teachers.  It involved much struggle, and much suffering if you like, because what the Minister said is perhaps true, that the work of the teachers in giving instruction through Irish to infants and the first and second classes had to go against human nature.  Any teacher with a vision of what his work was intended to do must know and must feel that in that he was working against human nature.  But the teachers who have been doing that work as part of the national education policy have been looking for results and have been <Col N="220" /> pained by the little results that there have been.  When the teachers put their judgment, arising out of their experiences into a report and did so in considerable detail, the Minister was not prepared to discuss the report with them.</P>
    <P>These are some of the things that are behind the general atmosphere of dissatisfaction and of depression that has brought the teachers into the position of being on strike to-day.</P>
    <P>I think that in fairness to the people as a whole, the questions which are at issue should now, at the end of a seven months' strike, be submitted to people experienced in the various branches of education in some place where people with responsibilities of various kinds can sit down and calmly discuss what it is that has really brought about the unfortunate situation which we have in the City of Dublin at present.  We have before us very difficult times and the various problems which confront us call for a clear examination, not only by everybody in this House, but by everybody in the country.  Much has been said during the last seven months which divided the people in one way or another, for or against the teachers or for or against the Government without any critical examination of what is at stake in the strike and in the general work of education in the country in which we should be so interested. There are very many discreditable elements in the disastrous situation which exists at the present moment.  I submit to the Minister that if the Government see any reason in the situation why they should stand out resolutely, unimpressed and stubborn, against any of the demands of the teachers, that in their own interests they should sit down in council with them, the managers and the school attendance committees, so that they can restate their case clearly in the atmosphere of the council chamber and be all the more ready then to stand by what they think should be done when these discussions are over.</P>
    <P>I am quite convinced, knowing the things that are at issue, having seen them brought out in debate year after year and brushed aside, knowing the shock that this dispute has given everybody, that if this matter could be <Col N="221" /> brought inside the council chamber, not only would you end the strike but you would harmonise the whole atmosphere in which education is being carried out. You would give us what we all want&mdash;a chance of looking objectively at the various problems involved and a chance of correcting things that are wrong at present.  In my opinion, you cannot continue, after what has happened, with the discrimination in pay and rating against poor city areas or outlying country districts.  You cannot educate children in classes of 50, 60, 70 and 80.  You cannot continue to judge the ability of teachers to carry out the work of their profession by a casual visit of an inspector, who bases his judgment on some particular type of question on some type of subject at a particular day.  What we want is a system by which the general work of the teacher will be so judged that the Department will be able to say whether he is carrying out the functions that the Minister sees to be the functions of a teacher in this world of ours, whether, to quote him again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The task of the teachers is the basic one of laying a solid foundation without which no specialist superstructure could be built or maintained. The future development of the country depends on their leadership, more than on that of any other body.  What was the essential task of such leadership?  The giving to the coming generation of a keen sense of social service, such a feeling for the community, such a knowledge of it, such grasp of its continuity, its profound values, its inherited obligations, as would enable that generation which now look to the teachers for inspiration to face the tremendous task of shaping the new Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When a teacher is being judged for his category or for his rating why is he not judged on how he carries out his task?  Why is he judged on how some particular piece of information is retained by the child?  I ask the Minister and every member of the Government Party, would it not be better now, after seven months have passed, if this difficulty were referred to the council chamber, to see whether it cannot be solved or cannot be eased <Col N="222" /> a bit, rather than continue the situation that exists at present, which cannot lead to anything but a very disastrous state of affairs in the whole Education Department?</P>
    <P>There are other questions that will arise for discussion.  The bodies referred to here know themselves what these questions are.  To attempt to argue the merits of the strike in this House and to deal with every aspect of the details of the issues that might have affected the strike would bring us to a position that would lead us nowhere.  I ask the Government to accept the proposal to refer this question to the bodies I have set out there. If it is a question of a strike against the State, let us hear about it in calmer discussion.  If it is to be a question of the teachers collaring from the public purse more than they should collar from it, let us hear that also in calmer discussion.  As to the question of conciliation, why should the teachers be the only body of people in the country who are refused a conciliation board? The Labour Court has been welcomed by every section of the community as a substantial contribution to industrial harmony and peace.  Civil servants are being offered their own particular type of arbitration.  The only group of people left outside that scheme of things are the teachers.  I do not want to have discussed even now the question of whether the teachers should be provided with arbitration machinery.  I only ask that all the things that are at issue should be referred to this particular group in an <i>ad hoc</i> way, to discuss the strike that exists at present&mdash; the things which have arisen and the things that can and ought to be done in future to give us a harmonious atmosphere in which the teachers and the Department can work in the interests of the children, the people and the future of this nation.</P>

      <P>I want to direct my remarks to what I think is the most important aspect of this dispute, namely, the question of devising ways and means of bringing the strike to a mutually satisfactory conclusion.  I, <Col N="223" /> therefore, do not want to travel over the wide domain of education in general, but rather to confine my remarks to suggestions whereby this unfortunate dispute can be brought to an end in circumstances which would leave no bitterness, no discord, and might in another respect open up a new vista, a better one than many which we have had so far as educational development in this country is concerned.  No matter what my personal feelings may be in respect of the merits of this dispute&mdash;and I think there is no doubt where my personal sympathy lies: with the teachers&mdash;I do not want to impart into this debate any bitterness or any acrimony, and I only hope that if this debate does not lead to a settlement of the dispute, at least nothing will be said to embitter the position and leave the situation worse at the end of the debate.</P>
      <P>On all sides of the House and outside the House, there is widespread and sincere regret that the present position has been reached, a regret based upon the fact that all sections of the community realise that the children who expect to receive their quota of education in our national schools are unfortunately not receiving the limited quota of education which they receive under our national school system.  Having in mind the very serious sacrifices which the children are making, sacrifices which they may carry with them for many years, through adolescence and manhood and womanhood, it seems to me that the paramount issue to-day is to settle the strike, and to settle it not merely in the interests of education, but in the interests of the child and in the interests of the teacher, recognising all the time that between education, the child and the teacher there is what should be a common bond of sympathy and comradeship, the purpose of which ought to be to equip the child, the weak and helpless child, and especially the child who attends the national school, for the stern battle of life and perhaps the sterner battle of life which will have to be faced in the years to come by many of those attending our national schools to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I plead in this matter especially for <Col N="224" /> the poor child, for the child of the working-class parents, for the child who goes to the primary school knowing that that school is not only a primary school but a secondary school, and a university, so far as he or she is concerned.  It represents, in the main, all the education which 90 per cent. of the school-going children of this country receive, so far as our educational system is concerned.  If, therefore, the national schools are the primary schools, the secondary schools and the universities for the poor children of the country, we ought to recognise, as flowing from that, that we must give to these children the best possible education within the compass of our national school system.  It is because the primary school plays such an important part in the education of 90 per cent. of our children that I think the obvious educational programme, so far as the national schools are concerned, is one which attracts the best teachers, and, having attracted the best teachers, pays them the best scales and extends to them the best possible conditions of service in these schools.</P>
    <P>One has only to reflect for a few moments on the position which has been created by the seven months old strike to realise the havoc which has been wrought on the minds, on the sense of citizenship and the character of the children who have been away from school continuously for the past seven months.  If any child were away for a period of seven months from school, it is easy to imagine and easy to measure the educational loss to that child; but we are dealing here with a problem which is a much bigger and a much wider problem than that of a single child being away from school for seven months.  Not only have we 40,000 children away from school, each individually losing the education associated with seven months' attendance at school, but we have 40,000 children in a mass away from school for seven months, mingling with each other during the day, with all the evils which flow from the mass association of people who have nothing to do.</P>
    <P>If you had a dozen children away from school for a long time, you could see the effect on their character.  One has only to go to the working-class <Col N="225" /> districts of this city&mdash;and I know the city well&mdash;to realise what is happening in our city to-day as a result of having approximately 40,000 children running wild for the past seven months&mdash;a challenge to education itself, a challenge to our intelligence and a challenge at once to any sense of statesmanship that may exist in this country.  Every day in the week, I see these children playing on the sidewalks, many of them importuning strangers for coppers, running wild, climbing lamp-standards, electricity pylons and telephone poles, racing after lorries, trying to climb on turf lorries, jumping on drays and exposing themselves to every possible risk of life and limb.  All that has been going on for seven months and yet we cannot find a means of settling a dispute which one day will have to be settled, whether we like it or not.  I put it to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Education&mdash;and I put it to them in the friendliest possible way&mdash;that the fact that this strike has continued for seven months is no tribute to education in the abstract. What we have to do is to realise that this strike has to be settled and that the sooner it is settled, the better for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>I have read with interest the Taoiseach's statement at the Árd Fheis and the statements he made in this House in which he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has said its last word and the best thing the teachers can do is to go back to work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach realises that a statement of that kind from him or any other member of the Government really means that the Government desires to beat the teachers and to get them to surrender unconditionally.  I want to put this consideration to the Taoiseach: does the Government think it can afford to beat the teachers? Does the Government think it is good policy to beat the teachers in this matter?  Does the Government want to regard the teachers as a defeated foe and is our standard of education such that we can view with equanimity the prospect of defeating and humiliating the teachers, with all that it implies? If that situation is brought about the <Col N="226" /> worst day's work for education in this country has been done.</P>
    <P>If you beat and defeat the teacher, what do you achieve?  You merely establish the fact that the State in this matter is all-powerful, a fact which is not challenged, so far as the strength of the State is concerned.  But is that all you do?  Do you not do something else?  Do you not do something worse? Do you not create in the mind of the teacher a feeling of humiliation, a feeling of despair, a feeling of bitterness and a feeling of frustration?  If you do create these evil influences, directing and controlling the teacher's mind, are you really producing the best class of teacher by injecting into him these qualities which are the very negation of enthusiasm, these qualities which education itself ought to eradicate?</P>
    <P>Look at the thing from another point of view.  Many of the children in this city go to school up to 13 or 14 years of age, and, while they are young in years, they nevertheless, as folk who know the city well appreciate, are pretty well informed on many aspects of life&mdash;perhaps too well informed in some respects on many aspects of life. Suppose the Government beats the teachers.  Suppose you send the teacher back to the school defeated and humiliated, do you think you will do well for the teacher?  Do you enhance his authority with the children or improve his standing in the eyes of the children by sending him back to the school in circumstances in which the more grown-up children realise: &ldquo;Ah, the teacher got it this time&rdquo;?  Is that the best way to inculcate respect for the teacher in the children?  Is that the best way to get the children to recognise that the teacher is the dispenser of knowledge, citizenship and character?  Does the Government not realise the very serious dangers which are inseparable from a situation in which they can manage to defeat the teachers, humble them before the nation and humble them before their own pupils?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that one of the things they ought to take special care about in this dispute is not to humilitate the teachers and not to <Col N="227" /> make this a test of power between the teachers on the one hand and the Government on the other hand.  I suggest that when all the speeches have been made by both sides, when the element of starchiness has been removed from this dispute, and when people come to look at the dispute in a calm and dispassionate way, they will recognise that some positive steps must be taken towards effecting a settlement.  But there must be some effort made towards effecting a settlement.  No matter how right the Taoiseach may think the Government is, I suggest to him that there is some obligation on the Government to stand back and look at this problem in a detached way and that the Government ought not to be victims of the environment which surrounds this whole dispute.  They should rise above that environment and they should realise&mdash;and the nation would appreciate the realisation by them of the fact&mdash;that the main concern in this matter is to settle the dispute on terms which will be honourable to both sides and, as far as possible, satisfactory to both sides.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that this dispute can be settled in either of two ways.  The first is that the matter can be submitted to arbitration or to conciliatory methods.  I see no reason in the world why an <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration tribunal could not be set up to deal with this matter, to deal with the merits of this dispute, and to make a report to the Government on the merits of the dispute, the Government and the teachers beforehand pledging themselves to accept the report of the independent arbitration tribunal, subject to the overriding authority of this House.  That at least would ensure a fair and dispassionate examination of the matters in dispute.  It would ensure a sifting of the merits of the dispute and it would, at the same time, preserve the supremacy of Parliament over the public purse by making the recommendations of the arbitration tribunal subject to the overriding authority of this House.</P>
    <P>It is not so many years ago since the Government decided to submit the very vexed question of the payment of <Col N="228" /> land annuities to Britain to the adjudication of an international arbitration court.  If we submitted to an outside arbitration tribunal the question as to whether this country should or should not pay the land annuities to Britain, surely there is every reason in the world why we ought to say to Irish teachers, our own kith and kin: &ldquo;What we are willing to do in respect of an outside tribunal so far as the land annuities are concerned, we are willing to do with you so far as your dispute with the State in this matter is concerned.&rdquo; But if because of statements which have been made by the Government, and if because it is not now easy for people who made statements to retrace their footsteps, and if because of these considerations it is not possible now to consent even to an <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration tribunal to settle the matters in dispute, I suggest to the Government that there is another way. That other way is for the Government to recognise, as I am sure the teachers on their part will recognise, that this dispute has gone on too long and that the way in which it can best be settled is by the Government agreeing to see the executive of the teachers' organisation and discussing the matters at issue with the teachers' organisation in the hope that in that way a friendly settlement of the matters in dispute can be arranged.</P>
    <P>If one is to judge from the utterances of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education, one would be led to believe that they are actuated by sympathy and understanding so far as the teachers are concerned.  One would imagine from these statements that the teachers can be assured that in the future they will get sympathetic consideration of the matters in dispute. The real difficulty about this, of course, is that the teachers do not believe they will get a sympathetic understanding of their problems in the future, in the same way as they complained they did not get a sympathetic understanding in the past.  But I am convinced, knowing how easily nerves can be frayed and how easily tempers can become ragged in an industrial dispute, that if the Government on the one hand and the teachers on the other hand were to <Col N="229" /> meet in an atmosphere in which the teachers will state their case and the Government will make a serious effort to convince the teachers that what they stated in this House and at the Árd Fheis really represents the feelings of the Government, then it may be possible to create&mdash;and I believe it is possible to create&mdash;an atmosphere around the conference table which will very speedily bring this strike to an end.</P>
    <P>I think the one thing for the Government to do is to recognise that in this matter they cannot afford to be the enemies of the teachers.  They ought to recognise that the teacher and the child and the State in this matter are locked as it were in an organisation, the purpose of which is to impart to the children the maximum of education under our national school scheme.  I believe that if the Government, recognising that the dispute has now continued for far too long, were to take steps to meet the executive of the teachers' organisation and to import into the discussion the friendliness of the conference table and were to make an effort to convince the teachers of their desire to ensure that justice will be done to the teachers in respect of any outstanding matter which is at present a bone of contention between the Government and the teachers' organisation, it would be easily possible to change the whole atmosphere of this dispute and to get a settlement on terms which would not leave a victor and vanquished, but would leave both sides still recognising that they had many things in common and that when the dispute was over both of them had in many respects the same goal.</P>
    <P>As I said, the difficulty at the moment is that the teachers do not feel that in the future their grievances will be treated with understanding and sympathy.  It may be that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education will say that the teachers are not justified in that feeling.  Maybe that is true.  But the best way in which you can overcome that atmosphere of distrust and bitterness and resentment is for both sides to come together to have a heart-to-heart talk.  I believe that if the Government can convince the teachers&mdash;and they ought to be able <Col N="230" /> to do so&mdash;that they are actuated by motives of sympathy and goodwill towards the teachers, the atmosphere is there for a satisfactory settlement of this seven months old strike.</P>
    <P>I want to finish by saying this to the Government, and to the Taoiseach and Minister for Education in particular.  It is sometimes very much harder to be weak than to be strong, and in circumstances such as these it is probably easier for the Government to dig in their heels and to enshroud themselves in a kind of corrugated stubbornness and say: &ldquo;We will not listen; we have been saying &lsquo;no&rsquo; for seven months and we are not going to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; at the end of it.&rdquo;  I appeal to the Government not to allow that attitude to influence their outlook in this matter. It is often harder to be weak than strong, and this is one of the occasions on which the Government ought to recognise that there is nobody challenging their authority to be the Government of this country, that there is no question of their constitutional right to be the Government, that this is a dispute between the teachers, on the one hand, and the Government, on the other.</P>
    <P>I think the Government ought not to allow this dispute to continue for another day, if, by even appearing to be weak, they could bring it to a satisfactory settlement.  I plead with the Taoiseach and the Government to recognise that this dispute has gone on far too long and that at this stage they ought to display sympathy, understanding and a sense of statesmanship, which alone can bring the dispute to a satisfactory end.  I believe if the Government were to invite the teachers tomorrow morning to a discussion around a conference table, where the respective points of view can be stated, it should be possible to evolve a formula which could get this strike settled before the end of the week.  With that possibility within our grasp, I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education to avail of this debate so as to endeavour to get a settlement of this unfortunate dispute.  That settlement may well bring about a new sense of direction so far as our whole educational policy is concerned and, in any <Col N="231" /> case, it will end the corroding influence of having 40,000 young children running wild around this city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton has described the great evil resulting from having 40,000 children without schools to go to.  Deputy Norton has described the calamity to the community that this strike has been.  I do not think he has exaggerated that.  I believe the teachers who precipitated that calamity on the question of wages and conditions alone, in my opinion, did wrong.  I believe the magnitude and gravity of the disaster to the community is far greater than any grievance the teachers might have had to endure had they continued to teach in their schools while maintaining their agitation to get such other advantages as they deem themselves entitled to.</P>
      <P>One of the foundations of liberty is the right of men to strike, and I think it is right that the right to strike should not be abridged in respect of anybody by legislation.  But having the legal right to do a thing is something very different from being right in availing of that right.  I believe the teachers belong to so exalted a profession that they have a sacred duty to the children committed to their care, and that to abandon that duty by going on strike cannot be defended unless the teachers feel that they are being called upon to do something which they could only do in violation of their consciences. I admit that if they were asked to teach children that which they believed to be morally wrong, or to withhold from children that which they believed they have a moral duty to impart to them in the course of education, then they would have to strike, because the evil of remaining at work would be greater than the evil of giving children no education at all.  I believe that in order to get more wages or more acceptable conditions is no ground on which to found so grave an action as has been taken in this case, no ground on which to throw 40,000 children on the streets of Dublin for seven months without education.  I do not expect that allocation to get me many votes in the next election.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless, I believe it to be true, and let those who do not like it, lump it.  That said, I want to add this.  When you find yourself in the position we are in now I do not think it is expedient to embark upon a detailed examination of the merits of the dispute which is at present in progress.  What we want to do is to get the schools open, the teachers back at their desks without any sense of having been victimised or trampled upon, and the children in their desks, realising that the teachers are entitled to their respect and that parents of this country will support the teachers in exacting from the pupils that measure of respect which persons in a teacher's position are entitled to receive.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, renew to-night a proposal for the settlement of this strike which I made before the recess.  I believe this strike could be settled now, with the rights of all parties preserved intact, if this procedure were accepted. We established by law, the last thing we did before the summer recess, an Industrial Court and the basis of that court's jurisdiction is that the two parties to an industrial dispute must come before it, set out their respective cases, and that court will then declare what, in its judgment, would be a fair and equitable settlement of the difference joined between the parties. But once that declaration is made for the clarification of the public mind, then most parties to the dispute resume their independence of action and can do what they please&mdash;strike or lock-out. But the public knows, much better than it did before, the true merits of the issues joined between the parties, and public opinion can operate in an informed way in reference to the parties in the dispute so as to hasten its conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Norton that a democratic Government can delegate to any arbitration tribunal the duty of determining the salaries, wages and conditions of employment of State servants whose salaries and wages are charged upon the Exchequer.  I do not believe that any democratic Government can divest itself of the <Col N="233" /> responsibility for making the final recommendation in regard to that matter.  They cannot bind themselves in advance to burden the Exchequer with what three persons, who have no direct responsibility to the electors, choose to say should be put upon them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Into that I am not going to go at the present moment, for I believe brevity and simplicity are the surest instruments for resolving our present difficulties.  I do not believe that a Government in any way compromises its duties or its right by saying: &ldquo;We have examined this problem so far as we are able and, in the light of that examination, have made proposals that approximate as near as possible to what we believe to be just.  The teachers cannot see that.  Very well; we shall send our Treasury officials, our Department of Education officials and the Minister himself, if need be, before the existing Industrial Court, or an analogous body, and we shall put clearly before it the case on which we founded our offer.  Let the teachers go before that court and meet that case and we shall await the finding of that tribunal.  If we are of opinion that the resources of the State will permit the full implementation of the recommendation of that tribunal, we shall favourably consider adopting it as it stands, but if, on considering every interest in the State, it appears to us that it threatens to impose upon the Exchequer obligations which the Exchequer cannot contemplate &mdash; remember that whatever settlement is arrived at is not going to end with the teachers; it is going to be a precedent and headline for a great many other settlements which await the making&mdash; we shall come before Dáil Éireann, tell Dáil Éireann the details of the tribunal's findings and show Dáil Éireann how far short our proposals fall of the conditions recommended as ideal by the tribunal.  If Dáil Éireann thinks we are not doing what is right, it can put us out and the people can put in some body who see their way to finance the ideal recommendations of the tribunal, which has heard the <Col N="234" /> representations of both sides.&rdquo;  If the Government will make that offer to-night, I think I can say that the teachers will go back to work tomorrow morning and this whole deplorable business will be over.  Far from having lost face or compromised its authority, the Government will have shown a statesmanlike and rational approach to a difficult problem.  I suppose the teachers will not lose very much sleep because I think they did wrong, but whether they have done right or wrong, I have no doubt they share more anxiously than we ourselves do solicitude for the children committed to their care and will welcome action which will enable them to get back to their duties which I cannot but think they regard as something more than just a means of earning their living.</P>
      <P>There is a method of settling this dispute. The Taoiseach is too tactful a man to announce the acceptance of that settlement with the Minister for Education beside him.  The Minister for Education could settle this dispute in ten minutes.  If he announced his readiness to do what I have suggested every school in Dublin would be open next Monday and we should have forgotten all about this discreditable interlude in three months' time.  Where is the use of haggling and higgling and getting cross with one another?  Let us set up the tribunal, get back the teachers and deal with the matter, when the tribunal will have reported, in a constitutional and sensible way. If we talk much more about it here, somebody is going to get mad and, if a row occurs across the floor of Dáil Éireann to-day, God knows when the strike will end.  I believe that that is the key of the situation.  If anybody has a better one, the keyhole is wide open to receive it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">

      <P>I need scarcely assure the House that the Government is seriously concerned with the fact that so large a number of Dublin children have had their education interrupted for so prolonged a period.  I need hardly say that we are aware of the anxieties and inconveniences which parents are suffering as a result of the continuance of this <Col N="235" /> strike and that we sympathise with the parents.  As I have already said, the Government is quite ready to do whatever it might fairly and reasonably be expected to do, having regard to its responsibilities and to the general interest, in order to bring this situation to an end and enable the children to resume their school work.  But we cannot examine this matter apart from all the other issues which it raises.  The Government has not gone out of its way to campaign the country on this issue.  I do not think that it is necessary to do so.  I think that the country understands the Government's attitude fairly well and has an idea of the issues that are at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An attempt has been made to create an agitation against the Government and to suggest that they are not interested in the welfare of the children, that they do not desire to bring this situation to an end and that they are letting matters drift.  That is an entirely false view.  It is an entire misrepresentation of the position and of the Government's attitude.  I have heard references, since the debate commenced, to &ldquo;beating the teachers&rdquo; and &ldquo;trampling&rdquo; upon them.  When one is in a contest of this kind, it seems to me that, if one does not get a settlement or find some way out, one side must inevitably be beaten.  If it is a question of one side or the other being beaten in this case, perhaps Deputies would advert to the position that would arise if the Government were beaten.  No member of the teachers' organisation was more anxious than I was to avoid the results that I felt would accrue to the teachers and their organisation if this strike were embarked upon.  I could see that it was going to damage the prestige and standing of the teachers' profession in the eyes of the country.  Looking at it from that standpoint, apart from the other issues, I did everything I could to avoid a strike.  I do not know whether or not the teachers had the same feeling or whether they thought that teachers are in the same position as other employees and that their strike would be just the same as a strike in any other employment.  I <Col N="236" /> never had any desire, and no member of the Government had any desire, to &ldquo;trample upon the teachers&rdquo; or to present them with a <i>fait accompli</i> or anything of that sort.  I think the trend of events and an examination of what took place reveal that that was not the position.  The teachers were met with courtesy and consideration and understanding and I challenge anybody in this debate to show otherwise. Deputy Mulcahy suggested here in the debate on the Education Estimate that the teachers were treated with a lack of consideration but when the debate was finished there was very little question about that and the House, as far as I could see, was satisfied that there was no position that the Government could take up other than the position that it did take up.</P>
    <P>So far as the Government is concerned it is not a question of defeating the teachers.  It is not a question of victimising the teachers or humiliating their organisation.  No one questions the right of the teachers to have their organisation.  The Taoiseach has publicly declared his belief that they, like every other section, must have their organisation in order to protect their interests.  The position as it stands is, of course, very difficult.  It is much easier to get into a contest of this kind&mdash;which raises far bigger issues than those who precipitated it may have considered possible&mdash;than to get out of it in such a way that we will get back to where we started with the minimum amount of damage done and I think that most people, aye, and most trade unionists, will agree with the view which was expressed upon this strike by one of our trade union representatives, a man of long experience, when he stated that the strike weapon should only be used in the last resort. &ldquo;My firm conviction,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after a quarter of a century's experience, is that when a body of workers go on strike they have fired their last shot. Some people believe that when workers go on strike they fire the first shot but my experience as a trade unionist is that you have fired your last shot when you go on strike.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Experienced trade union leaders with a sense of responsibility know that <Col N="237" /> strikes are a costly and hazardous weapon and I believe that they would be the last to encourage the view among the members of their unions that the strike weapon is likely to achieve better results for them than discussion and negotiation between the parties.  Such leaders will not call out their men if there is any worth-while alternative and if they are faced with the position that a strike has been called they will do their utmost to end it as quickly as possible, particularly if they are faced with the situation that they see very little prospect of success and that they are going to embark upon a prolonged struggle, a struggle of attrition or of exhaustion. It is one thing to hold the strike weapon in reserve and as a bargaining factor in negotiations but it is quite another matter to plunge into a struggle which is likely to be prolonged as this one has been and to involve all the resources of the party which has undertaken it.  I think it must be quite clear that when this strike takes the aspect of a strike directed against the Government it becomes from this point of view nothing less than a sheer gamble, a reckless gamble one might call it, because a strike against the Government is a strike against the community.  The Government represents the interests of the community. It is the guardian of those interests. The Government is the supreme authority set up by the people in the State.  It is quite obvious that a strike of that nature must take on an entirely different aspect from the ordinary industrial dispute.  If the Government when thus challenged were to submit to the strikers' demands, can anyone have the slightest doubt as to the ill consequences that would be bound to follow?  Would not the Government's authority be weakened?  Would not public confidence be shaken if not shattered?  Would not the public interest have suffered material damage?</P>
    <P>Let us address ourselves to the question of what is going to happen if any organisation of public employees is successful in forcing the Government through strike action and against the Government's better judgment to accede to its demands.  If, in effect, we <Col N="238" /> have the position that such an organisation can dictate terms, what is going to be the Government's position then?</P>

It must inevitably be driven further and further along the road under renewed pressure and the only question is, where is it going to stop?  The Government, therefore, that permits itself to be so driven under any such pressure or by such an organisation, its very continuance as a Government, I suggest, may very well be detrimental to the public interest.</P>

      <P>We are asked, if the private employer is ready to submit his case to arbitration, why should not the Government do likewise?  But the Government is not in the position of the private employer whose only concern when faced with a situation of this kind is whether it will pay him better as an employer and a business man to come to terms with his employees or whether he may find himself driven to the conclusion that rather than attempt to come to terms, rather than impose upon himself a burden that he knows he cannot bear, he will have seriously to consider closing down his business altogether.

      <P>The Government has no such alternative, no such choice, as the private employer.  The Government is responsible for maintaining the public services and it must protect the public interest.  It would be a matter of the gravest concern if its authority were seriously weakened in the administration of these services.  When a hold-up of any essential public service is deliberately undertaken by a powerful and nation-wide organisation to secure its ends, the gravity of such action is greatly aggravated.  No one can have the slightest doubt about that and we <Col N="239" /> have seen what can happen in such circumstances elsewhere.  We have seen it on the Continent.  People express grave fears as to the danger of State interference in this, that or the other, in private and personal rights.  However, if the Government is no longer to be an effective authority in its own area and master in its own house, what is the position to be?</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of this matter.  Subject to the authority of the Dáil, the Government is primarily responsible for the State financial policy and the appropriation of moneys by Dáil Éireann is made on its recommendation. The Government has the ultimate responsibility.  It has been conceded, and must be conceded by every responsible Deputy, that the Government must have the final say, must be the final judge in these matters &mdash;subject, of course, to the sanction of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>This motion does not prescribe any limit whatever, nor is there any restriction upon the amount of money that might be recommended to be spent upon whatever proposals would come from the committee; but whether there were such a limit or restriction or not does not really matter &mdash;except, perhaps, to show that it was not intended by those who proposed it, that the motion should be taken seriously; and that seems to have been supported by the speeches we have heard.</P>

      <P>If the Government is not prepared in the ordinary case to submit such cases&mdash;without any limit and without any restriction&mdash;to such an outside body, why should it do so now? What is the case for doing it in this particular instance?  The sole reason seems to be that there is a strike, a dispute, from which the public and the children are suffering and because of that the Government must do something it would not do otherwise. Something it has refused to do so far in an ordinary case, it is going to do now and going to allow itself to be compelled to do because of strike action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that nobody has suggested&mdash;but I suppose it will be suggested before the debate ends&mdash;that this tyrannical and dictatorial Government does not wish to listen to anyone or consult with anybody in these matters, that it has taken up the attitude that what it says goes and that nothing else counts.  May I say that the Government is responsible to the Dáil and to the country and if the Dáil and the country are not satisfied with its policy in this or any other matter, they have their remedy?  The fact is, <Col N="242" /> as my discussions with the teachers show, that we have been at all times ready to meet our employees, either those directly in the employment of the State or those paid by the State.  We have been prepared always to meet them to discuss their grievances and try to find remedies.  I met the teachers in a genuine spirit of goodwill. It was the Government's desire to offer them terms in keeping with the dignity and importance of their profession. I explained to them that we were bound to have regard to our general circumstances and that, while endeavouring to meet them as fairly and as generously as possible, there was obviously a limit beyond which we were not prepared to go.  We could only give them terms, in other words, which would be within our capacity, having regard to the commitments and the demands upon us from other directions and the ultimate charge that that would necessitate upon the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The teachers pressed me for the Government's final offer and they got that offer.  It represented an addition of £1,250,000 to the corresponding expenditure upon teachers' salaries in 1938 or an increase of something over 40 per cent. in the case of the lay teachers.  That such an offer was made is surely sufficient proof that the Government tried to approach this problem of arranging new scales for teachers in a sympathetic spirit.  The Government did have regard to the teachers' claim that they were underpaid before the war and that for a long period of years they had been treacherously treated by our predecessors in office when they imposed a heavy cut upon them a short time after they were in receipt of new scales granted to them in 1920 by the British Government.</P>

      <P>The new scales were considerably better than the 1920 scales&mdash; the scales which the teachers' organisation had held up for a good many years as being their desire and what they required in the way of remuneration. The Government's proposal was reached as a result of long discussions and correspondence between myself and the teachers.  We were not prepared to accept the Northern Ireland scales as a basis in these negotiations, but if we were prepared to accept them I am sure everybody would wonder why we should not accept the Northern Ireland or the British standards for every other class as well.  We could not accept, and we are not prepared to accept, the principle that we must necessarily adopt as our standard what has been done elsewhere.  Our attitude was and is that we must have regard to our own needs and circumstances, and in endeavouring to be fair to every section the Government must have regard to the interests of the people as a whole and to what is possible&mdash;not what we would desire, what the Government would desire, or what I would desire or what the teachers would desire, but what is possible&mdash;having regard to the public interest and the whole circumstances with which we are confronted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, if Deputies will look at the revised scales of salary which I offered the teachers and examine them they will see that, making allowance for income-tax and pension contribution which is payable in the North, they compare favourably, particularly in the case of married men, with the scales in operation there.  The Northern scales are somewhat better at certain points, but not a great deal better, and at a great many other points our scales are equal or better and certainly compare favourably with them.  I need not go into the figures in detail.  I will simply say that, as far as our women teachers, for example, are concerned&mdash;deducting pension contributions and the appropriate income-tax in the North and making allowance for the income-tax down here&mdash;our women teachers would <Col N="244" /> only have £13 less on entry and £21 less at the efficiency maximum.  If they were highly efficient teachers, their maximum would be £5 greater in the North.  That is the position in net cash evaluation.  As far as single men are concerned, our teachers would be getting £22 less at the minimum and £56 less at the maximum for efficient and £29 less at the maximum for highly efficient, but it must not be overlooked, when referring to the pay offered to single men and comparing it with the scales elsewhere, that these scales represent a scale for men both married and single.  We instituted a system of rent allowance in connection with these scales.  There is no such rent allowance in the Six Counties, and if we compare the married Dublin teacher with the teacher in the North, each having two children, we shall get a fair idea of the Government's offer.  The net income for the Northerner at the maximum is £469.  Our teacher would receive £512 if efficient&mdash;that is in the City of Dublin.  A married man with two children would be receiving £43 more than his Northern colleague, and if he were highly efficient he would be receiving £544, or £75 more.  Again, the rural teacher with two children would receive, if efficient, £486 or £23 more than the Northern figure, and £521 if highly efficient&mdash;that is £52 more than his colleague. We tried to meet the special case of the Dublin teachers with a scheme of rent allowance.  The rates that I have given for married men show that we gave generous recognition to family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>What was the Government's position when I met the teachers 12 months ago almost?  We had gone successfully through a very difficult emergency period.  Thanks to the wisdom and good sense and discipline of our people we did not suffer a great deal, but in economic affairs what would have been our position if it were not for the Government's policy of stabilising wages, prices and profits?  Fault has been found with that policy, but at any rate I think nobody can quarrel with it as being the best at the time, particularly if we are to have regard to the alternative with all its consequences of inflation, of robbery and exploitation of <Col N="245" /> the poorer section of the community. Those who are of the opinion that the Government ought to have allowed matters to drift and have taken no steps to stabilise wages, profits and prices, have not considered fully what the alternatives would have been.</P>
    <P>Then, again, when I met the teachers, the post-war position was most uncertain.  No one could say definitely whether price levels were going to fall, whether they were going to fall to a considerable extent and whether, if such a fall took place, it would be sooner or later, nor could we exclude the possibility that if goods came into normal supply in a comparatively short time that there might be a very substantial fall indeed in the cost of living, such as we experienced after the last war.  The factors determining future trends in world prices are beyond our control.  It is quite impossible to prophesy, but in so far as we could make any assumption as to the future we had to try to make such assumption because the teachers' remuneration was not based upon a basic salary plus a cost of living bonus.  It would have been impossible to institute it upon that basis at this time.  It was not done originally in 1920 and we found that we had to adhere to the system of permanent scales.  In examining how we were going to frame these permanent scales we had these difficulties as to what the future trend was likely to be.  Does anybody contend that it was not reasonable to assume that, after some time, be it long or short, goods would come in in plentiful supply, and that the cost of living would fall?</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government's attitude in this matter was not unreasonable or ungenerous either in regard to the terms they offered or in regard to the provision that they made for a review of the situation in three years' time.  Having regard to the difficulty of fixing permanent scales in a transition period, we considered it reasonable that there should be such a review.  We hoped that by the time we would have reached fairly stable conditions and that the whole matter could be re-examined in the light of fairly normal circumstances&mdash;the new scales <Col N="246" /> were to come into operation on the 1st September&mdash;as to whether the scales gave sufficient compensation for the increased cost of living which, undoubtedly, bore very severely upon the salaried classes.  Nobody is more cognisant of that or of the burdens that it has imposed on that particular class than the Government is, and nobody is more anxious to alleviate the situation or to remedy the difficulties under which these classes are suffering than the Government, in so far as we can do it.  Therefore we agreed to this review, when the whole matter could have been re-examined in the light of the prevailing circumstances.  I believe that if the cost of living position had not improved, and if there had not been a fall of consequence in the meantime, the Government would have approached such a review of the position in a sympathetic spirit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy suggests that this strike is about a great many other matters, that it is not about finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, it is quite clear because the teachers themselves have stated frequently that additional sums of money made available now would settle the question so far as they are concerned.  If anybody has any doubt as to whether it was not in connection with the new scales offer that we made to them, I would refer him to the circular which was issued by the teachers' organisation and he will see it laid down very clearly:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You will find herewith (1) a copy of the Minister's final offer with an explanation of some points which may arise if the scales come into operation, and (2) a ballot paper on which you are to vote for or against the acceptance of the offer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Further down it says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" />&ldquo;Should there be a majority of the members against acceptance it would become the duty of the executive to call the Dublin teachers out on strike as soon as possible after the result is declared.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have always expressed my willingness to meet the teachers about these other questions to which Deputy Mulcahy has referred and that have been referred to in the course of the strike. Therefore, if it is not a question of getting large additional sums of money from the Government, if it is a question of remedying other grievances, there is no reason why the strike should continue, as Deputy Dillon has said, for another 24 hours.  Take this question of the highly efficient rating, for example.  A good deal of attention has been given to it and Deputy Mulcahy has referred to it.  I should like to say that the teachers themselves were a party to the introduction of this very favourable or very satisfactory service rating, later described as highly efficient service, as a condition for added benefits and remuneration.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will permit me, I did not interrupt the Deputy, a Leas-Chinn Chomhairle, when he was speaking.  The inspection system was exhaustively inquired into by a committee appointed by the then Minister for Education in 1926, called the McKenna Committee.  This committee, representing the school managers and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation as well as the Minister for Education, made a unanimous report.  The report, signed by Mr. O'Connell, the present secretary of the organisation, and other members of the organisation, approved of the system of rating and of additional remuneration for highly satisfactory service.  It stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We consider that for various reasons unnecessary to go into that the teachers' rating of highly efficient, efficient and non-efficient, must be retained.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The recommendations of this committee were accepted by the Ministry of which Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy McGilligan were members and an appeal board was set up to hear the appeals of teachers against the inspectors' reports.  The other findings of the committee were implemented subsequently in circulars and regulations published officially by the Department governing the inspection system. The changes laid down in these official documents which became the official policy safeguarded the teacher in so far as it was humanly possible to do so against injustice from the inspectors and a procedure was laid down to which the inspector must very strictly adhere.</P>
      <P>From time to time we hear uninformed and very ill-founded reports with regard to inspectors and the inspectorial system.  According to the McKenna Report, the general inspection should, as we have said, be more searching and, therefore, more satisfying and decisive for the teacher than it has been in the past.  We give as a good description of what we think should be the character of such inspection in the document sent in to us by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation. Then follows an extract from the document sent in by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" />&ldquo;The general inspection should be very thorough and fair for every class and every subject should be fully tested.  The teacher should not only be given an opportunity but he should be invited to show what the children have actually done and if they display their knowledge and acquirements to the best of their ability.  Before any testing of the pupils' work takes place the inspector should examine carefully the schemes of work, the weekly syllabus, the preparation of work, etc.  In observing the teacher's methods and handling the teacher's class, allowance should be made for the fact that a teacher possibly will be working under a strained atmosphere due to the presence of the inspector.  In testing children, needless to say, the whole object of the inspector should be to discover how much they know and how, in general, they have benefited by the instruction they have received.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These suggestions like the other recommendations of the committee, were as I have said, implemented by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The percentage of teachers who have the highly efficient rating has steadily increased and is now 32.7 of the total teaching body.  This percentage will, I believe, be admitted to compare favourably with the numbers who have reached front rank in other professions. The majority in other professions get no further than a satisfactory level of efficiency entitles them but is that any special reason for clamping down those who are specially gifted and ready and anxious to exercise their gifts?  The teacher has ample safeguards in the procedure with regard to the appeal board and with regard to the method of making reports, the notice the inspector must give and so on.  He must take full cognisance of the factors operating against the teacher, and, having been a teacher himself, it would be extraordinary if the national school inspector were not able to put himself and did not put himself, in the position of the teacher and ask himself what the teacher's difficulties were, what were the obstacles in the way of his performing better work when trying <Col N="250" /> to assess his work and to give him a proper rating.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy made some very extraordinary statements with regard to the Dublin schools.  He referred to the &ldquo;effect of the paying system upon the children.&rdquo;  I am not quite clear as to what that means.  It seemed to mean, judging by his other remarks, that, through this system, we were depriving the Dublin children of the opportunity of getting better teachers than they have at present.  He said that &ldquo;slum children were denied teaching quality,&rdquo; that &ldquo;good teachers were denied to the slums.&rdquo;  Teachers, he said, wanted to get out of these areas. My experience is that teachers want to come to Dublin, whether it be to a slum area or any other area in which they may find employment, and one of the difficulties in dealing with the problem of the Dublin teachers, the special problem, was: were we going to give further inducements to the best teachers to leave the country areas and come to Dublin, where, according to the country teachers themselves, the opportunities for education are much more widespread and much more satisfactory?</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy cannot have gone to very much trouble to probe into this question, because, if he had, he would have discovered that, while the percentage for the country as a whole is in the neighbourhood of 33, in the Dublin area, the percentage of highly efficient teachers is 47½.  Therefore, 47½ per cent. of the Dublin lay teachers would be receiving the maximum scales and the teachers giving this highly satisfactory service are not confined to the better-off areas and we are not starving the slum areas, as Deputy Mulcahy suggests, of the best teachers. The contrary is the position.  In ten schools nearest to the Irish national teachers' headquarters and not including the Model Schools in Marlborough Street, schools serving some of the very poorest areas in Dublin, I find that 44 teachers out of 69 have secured the highly efficient rating and no doubt some of the other 25 will eventually obtain it.  Some of them must be younger teachers and a teacher is not granted this rating in the first few <Col N="251" /> years.  Of the 28 teachers in the infant schools in what might be described as the slum areas in question, 18 enjoy this highly efficient rating at present. So much for Deputy Mulcahy's charges and innuendoes about the way the Department of Education is ill-treating the children in these areas and not giving them the kind of education they should receive.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it is assumed, but apparently the assumption is, that if there were no highly efficient rating, all the teachers would be paid at the rate appropriate to the highly efficient teachers' scale.  Surely this assumption has no foundation.  If we were to take the moneys given to roughly one-third of the teachers who are on the special scale appropriate to the highly efficient rating and divided them amongst the whole teaching body, it would not improve the general scales very perceptibly. Had there been only the ordinary normal scale for efficient work, with no highly efficient rating in question, would anybody have claimed, as seems to be the claim now, that all teachers, including those who are barely efficient and just carry out their work to the bare satisfaction of the inspectors, should be remunerated exactly the same as those who are doing the most meritorious work and who are the most gifted and highly skilled members of their profession?</P>
    <P>If we are to have any system of assessing the work of the schools and reporting upon that work through the inspectors, must not the inspectors state whether the work is, roughly speaking, bad, good or very good? Otherwise, what will the inspectors report upon?  Are managers to have no guidance when filling vacancies for principals of their schools?  When candidates apply to them, are they to have no method by which they will be able to assess the teaching capacity of the applicants for the post?  The avenues of promotion open to teachers are limited.  I sympathise with the teachers in that.  They have not got the same avenues of promotion as exist in the Civil Service, for example, but we cannot help that.  Surely this system of highly efficient rating, with <Col N="252" /> additional pay for meritorious work, is an alternative method of promotion.  It provides recognition for superior ability and industry and is an incentive to the teacher.</P>
    <P>As regards the difficulty of determining whether a teacher is highly efficient or not, if it is suggested that an inspector cannot evaluate that, that he would not be in a position to determine whether a teacher was efficient or non-efficient &mdash; and yet upon his judgement in that matter might depend the teacher's continued recognition or continued employment as a teacher&mdash;the fact is that the inspectors, having been teachers themselves, understand these difficulties and appreciate them.  They know very well that it is the borderline cases that have to have special attention paid to them.  Special attention is given to them through the system of appeals and inspection by superior officers and the inspectors are expected to give, and, I believe, do give, the benefit of the doubt, where there is any reasonable doubt in these matters, to the teacher.</P>
    <P>I have gone into this matter at some little length because I want to show the House that this question of &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; is not as simple as is suggested, that it is a matter which requires a good deal of attention if one is to add anything of value to our present knowledge on the subject.  I believe the abolition of the highly efficient rating would tend to discourage the ambitious teacher, the teacher who wants to get on and who knows he has it in him to get on and reach the top of his profession.  I believe that if it were abolished it might have the unfortunate result of reducing the best among the teachers to the level of those who can barely satisfy the inspectors and barely maintain their efficiency.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is another side to the question.  The teachers can argue their own case.  They have every opportunity of arguing it, but they have not raised this matter with the Department of Education in any definite manner. Despite all the topics to which Deputy Mulcahy has referred year after year in connection with the Education Estimates, <Col N="253" /> I doubt if he has raised this specifically.  There has been, for a few years past, a campaign against the highly efficient rating.  Before that there was a campaign against the inspection system.  We do not know whether these campaigns have the backing of the teaching body as a whole.  But, so far as I know officially, they have not expressed dissatisfaction with the system of awarding highly efficient rates.</P>
    <P>If the position is that the teachers can show that there are anomalies, inequalities or injustices in the procedure or in the method of determining the highly efficient rating, I am quite prepared to discuss these matters with them.  I am quite prepared to try to find a solution.  I think that the Government and I myself would be failing in our duty if, when it was shown to us that there are certain defects, certain anomalies, and certain ways in which the teachers are suffering, if they are suffering where they ought not to be, we did not examine into these matters.  I am quite satisfied in connection with the matter of the determination of the highly-efficient rating, the method of determining the rating, to examine the question and to go into it closely&mdash;the inspectors and the representatives of the teachers to examine the question from that point of view. If it lies in my power, I am most anxious also to remove any other legitimate grievance to which they might call attention.  But I am convinced that if we are to try to set about remedying these grievances there is only one reasonable course that we can follow, and that is, as in the past, to proceed by way of consultation and discussion as to what exactly the case is, to examine the case which is made and to try to find remedies, to examine the suggestions which are put forward for remedying the case, if there be a case. But I cannot see any hope whatever of progress along the present line of trying to compel the Government, through this action, to do something which they are not convinced is right or proper and in the public interests.</P>
    <P>The teachers themselves must surely be by this time in the most advantageous position to judge this situation for <Col N="254" /> themselves.  Can they not see that the method of reason and argument is likely to lead to better results for them than merely following in their present course of action and persisting in it in the belief that they will ultimately defeat the Government?  If they felt that in order to influence public opinion, to call public attention to their grievances, this protest was necessary, I suggest to them that the protest has surely gone far enough. Sufficient sacrifices have been demanded from the children who are the victims, and the teachers themselves have also had severe demands made upon them.  Is it necessary that there should be further sacrifices?  If there are, what will the result be?  Will it not be the same in the long run, except that in the meantime we shall have more embitterment and we shall have more annoyance and more irritation for everyone concerned, particularly those immediately concerned in this unfortunate dispute, and those who are suffering?</P>
    <P>The leaders of the Irish teachers should be a body to whom we can look up as responsible men and women.  If they re-examine the position and reconsider it, I think they will have to agree that the present line of action is not leading anywhere; that it has already lasted too long, and that there is no hope whatever of getting the Government to alter their decision in that way.  Of course, I know that teachers feel that their organisation is in question; that if they are not loyal to their organisation there is danger that they will have no organisation in future.  But surely the organisation must have regard to the other aspects of the situation to which I referred earlier?  Surely the organisation must have regard to the interests of the children?  Surely the teaching body must consider the welfare of these children?  I do not believe, if the teachers' executive as a responsible body reconsider this matter, that they can have any feeling that they are in any way endangering their organisation or doing it damage in the public eye by viewing the situation more realistically than they have done up to the present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> I should like to add my voice to that of the Taoiseach in asking the teachers to return to work.  I am quite convinced that if they do so return they will lose nothing by such action in the long run.  On the other hand, nothing will be gained by continuing the strike. The poorest of the Dublin children are in the worst possible position to suffer this deprivation of their education.  If they are affected by the consequences of the strike, as I think the great body of the teachers must be, they should reconsider the position and they should make their voices heard in trying to bring it to an end before further unnecessary damage is done.  I am more anxious than any one of the teachers or anyone who has spoken here this evening to see this unfortunate situation terminated and the teachers back at work.  I am interested in any efforts that are made to that end.  I would say again that everyone that has influence over the teachers and who wants to bring us back as soon as possible to normal conditions and normal relations ought to ask them to return to work.  We cannot carry on our educational work satisfactorily while this situation continues.  Not alone are the children being deprived of something which it may be difficult to restore to them later on&mdash;some of them have lost the precious last year of their schooling, the only schooling which they are likely to receive&mdash;but we cannot co-operate, we cannot take counsel together in the way that we should with regard to future plans or future reforms of education while that situation continues.</P>
    <P>If we are to resume the old position of partnership between the managers, the teachers, and the Department of Education, and if we are to make progress in meeting the problems that confront us, then I say that the only way in which that situation can be quickly restored is by the teachers returning to work.  So far as I am concerned, and I can speak for the Government, there will be no question of victors or vanquished. There will be, as I have said, more of a question of partnership in co-operation, more of a desire to understand, perhaps more than we had done in the past, one another's point <Col N="256" /> of view and to get to understand one another's difficulties.  Given the necessary goodwill on both sides, and there is no lack of such goodwill on our part, I am convinced that we can remove difficulties and misunderstandings and, through co-operation and mutual help, accomplish great work in future for Irish education.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  I think he has come some considerable distance in his concluding remarks.  In order that they may not be wasted and that some good may flow from this debate, will the Minister agree to see the executive of the teachers' organisation and discuss with them the sentiments which he has now expressed in the hope of bringing this matter to a satisfactory conclusion?  I think that is all that is necessary in order to get the matter on right lines.  Will the Minister complete what he said by saying that he will see them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every member of the House, regardless of Party, is very anxious to see the dispute in this city coming to an end.  There is a very dangerous situation in the making.  We have 40,000 children in the city who have been without education for seven months.  That has created a gap in their education that cannot possibly be bridged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be the very last to introduce anything that would bring about heat in this debate.  I rise merely to offer a suggestion that might, perhaps, have a good effect.  I was very glad to observe three points in the speech of the Minister for Education.  One of his points is that he does not exactly close the door; the door is still open.  He has mentioned that on a few occasions. Another point is that he does not want <Col N="258" /> a situation to arise in which there will be the victors and the vanquished.  He does not want to humiliate the teachers if they go back.  Such a thing would be disastrous and the Minister does not want that situation.  I am glad that the Minister is open to conciliation or mediation. He says the Government are the guardians of the taxpayer, and rightly so.  We are behind him in that.</P>
    <P>Early in the dispute&mdash;and this is a fact that no speaker has mentioned&mdash; His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin very kindly offered to intervene in order to bring about a settlement.  That offer was rather discourteously refused. I cannot understand why it was refused. I think if he were allowed to act as arbitrator between the teachers' executive on the one hand and the Minister on the other, his ruling would be fair. I do not see what the Minister has to fear from his intervention.  The Minister need not fear that it will be partial to the teachers' organisation; he need not fear that he will make a ruling that would embarrass the Government in this or in future matters.</P>
    <P>At this late hour I ask the Minister to reopen that door.  He said on two occasions that the door is open to a settlement.  That is one proposal that will be acceptable to the teachers, to the members of this House and to the people generally, regardless of whether it may be thought the teachers are already underpaid or overpaid.  That is one way out of the difficulty.  The Minister has gone almost so far as to say&mdash;if I have not misunderstood his words&mdash;that he would extend the present offer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, the whole tone of the Minister's speech has been that he is anxious to see an end of the dispute.  I believe he is perfectly genuine in that.  We are all anxious for a settlement, and the parents and even the children themselves are anxious.  If the strike continues, as it may&mdash;God forbid that it will continue much longer&mdash;it will, I believe, lead to an increase in crime in this city that it might not be easy to deal with four, five or six years from now, when the children who are now deprived of <Col N="259" /> education will reach manhood or womanhood.</P>
      <P>I believe that the teachers did wrong in going out on strike.  I believe they dragged down their profession very much.  It is an exalted profession. Rather than say anything that might, perhaps, injure any attempt at a settlement, I ask the Minister again to approach His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin and ask him to act as mediator. I am sure the Archbishop's ruling will be acceptable.  If it is suggested that the teachers will be sufficiently paid with the Government's offer, I have no doubt the teachers will accept that.  I am sure he would not make a ruling that would not be acceptable to all the parties concerned.  That is one way out of this difficulty.  The Minister need not be afraid that His Grace will be partial.  He would not be so un-Irish as to make any ruling that would embarrass the Government either in this matter or any other matter that might arise in the future. That is my contribution to the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Metaphors are dangerous things and I want right at the start to try to get my own mind clear as to what the Minister has said, if he has said anything which I did not understand of a conciliatory type towards the teachers.  I have been listening to the last speaker.  He said that the Minister on two occasions indicated that the door is open.  So it is, but I interpreted the Minister as saying that the door is open for the teachers to go back to work on the old terms.  Is that any advance?  Is there any advance other than that from the Minister?  I want to be clear on this so that I may not later be accused of misquoting or misunderstanding the Minister.  As I understand it, that is the situation&mdash;the door is open so that the teachers may return to their schools on the terms that obtained before they went out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that what is offered in the way of conciliation?  In any event, I know one door has been slammed, the door I approached in this motion, in suppliant mood, asking the Government not to give in to the teachers, not even to <Col N="260" /> have a board of arbitration, but to have something in the nature of conciliation and mediation.  Those are the terms of the motion before the House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the long-continued closing of schools in the City of Dublin is a grave source of moral danger and educational loss to the children...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will anybody deny that that is the fact?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...a grave source of moral danger and educational loss to the children...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Have distracting problems been created for parents?  That, in any event, was the foundation of the motion that I put my name to for discussion in the House to-night.  I am asking the Dáil to accept those two things indicated in the motion.  I am asking the Dáil to vote that a conciliation committee be set up, consisting of representatives of the Government, the managers, the teachers, and of the Dublin School Attendance Committee. To do what?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...to consider and make recommendations with a view to terminating the present dispute and bringing about the immediate reopening of the schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is not one word about money in that motion; there is nothing in it which would mean that the Government had committed themselves to give more money to the teachers if they accepted the motion.  They are asked to indulge in what is now so internationally favoured, mediation and conciliation, instead of battling things out.  I must say that I find myself annoyed to-night by the temperraising and somewhat humiliating experience suffered by a person when he approaches a door as I have approached it, and finds the door slammed in his face.  It is not a pleasant experience to stand on a doorstep when you are in such a mood and be treated in such a way.  I find myself not as lonely on that doorstep as one might otherwise find oneself when a door has been slammed in one's face. When I look around the same doorstep, I find myself rubbing shoulders with His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, on whom the door was also slammed. <Col N="261" /> and the representatives of many Church bodies who have appealed in a suppliant way to the Government to do something to end this conflict which is working so much harm in the City of Dublin.  I find myself in company with many persons in all sorts of prominent positions who have publicly committed themselves in favour of the teachers in letters to the Press, speeches at different societies and by proposing resolutions at gatherings of all sorts, representative of many conditions of the populace.  When I find myself amongst so many eminent people who have come out into the open in support of the teachers, I wonder why it is they have not been swayed by the arguments of the reactionary paper which the Minister read here to-night in defence of his point of view in this matter.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has so good a case as he would have the Dáil believe by his speech to-night, why should he not welcome a conciliation committee? Where better could he parade his arguments than before a group of people selected by this House for the purpose of bringing about mediation and with the main objective of ending this strike and getting the schools reopened? If his arguments are good, let the Minister repeat them to a select body.  From the room from which I have been excluded by the slamming of the door, I hear only a sort of echo of two or three phrases&mdash;&ldquo;the last word&rdquo;, &ldquo;master in our own house&rdquo;&ldquo;effective authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;a government must govern&rdquo;.  These words ring with a funny echo through the House as if there were very few in the room from which the phrases are being so loudly shouted.  On the doorstep, somebody amongst that eminent body must have a constitution.  In the preamble to the Constitution, we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of prudence, justice and charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country restored, and concord established with other nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Prudence, justice and charity.  Are they present in the Minister in his attitude <Col N="262" /> towards the parents of the children who are suffering in this case?  I pass to Article 45, where the preamble is taken up again in the directive principles of social policy which were to guide all our endeavours in this House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In face of that, why do we persist in mouthing those phrases about the Government's power, about being masters in our own house, and about the last word?  Why must the Government tie themselves by their dignity or by what they think their dignity is or by what their dignity forces them to do? If the last word has been said to the teachers, even on the sordid matter of money, can we be informed in this House to-night who advised the Government when this &ldquo;last word&rdquo; was spoken or if the Government, and particularly the Minister for Education, dealt with the matter, as if education were a sort of nationalistic enterprise, in the way the Minister for Industry and Commerce would deal with a strike in the industrial alcohol factories? Was the last word spoken in the light of what the State could afford in relation to what, for example, it was paying to other people?  Did no consideration arise as to education being something social, something which removes those who engage in it to a level somewhat above even that of the ordinary industrial worker, with his rights and dignity as a human being? Who advised the Government?  Did any theologian instruct them?  Did anybody who knows the principles and philosophy of education tell them how these considerations should be weighed in the balance?  Did anybody instruct them on the question of the dignity of the human individual, the human individual in this case being the teacher, with the peculiarly important function which he has to play in the State?  Did anybody instruct them even in the economics of the whole situation?  Did anybody tell the Government that&mdash;if <Col N="263" /> they have not realised it, everybody else has&mdash;as a result of the impact of rising prices and the close-down on wages, people are being paid nominally in pounds but actually in half-sovereigns? When the last word was being spoken were all these things brought into review?  If they were not, should they not be reviewed now?  If they were, why should we not be told that they were?  Why should we not hear the weight of the argument along all these lines, so that we should know that it is not a case of the Government sticking to its pride and dignity but that there is something solid and real in the offer the Government made?</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government would consider the matter from this point of view.  Apparently, they will not have conciliation; they will not have any minds but their own brought to bear on this problem.  Is it right that that should be done?  Suppose some public-spirited citizen summoned a meeting of a group of the type suggested in this motion.  Suppose that group met, considered this problem and pronounced upon the matter.  Would the Government feel in any way shaken by the fact that people who had given the matter serious consideration thought that the teachers' position was such they deserved greater emoluments than they were getting?  Suppose I ask the Government to have, not a committee got together haphazard outside, but a committee packed by the Government. Let the Government see that the group who will discuss this matter will be people who will have prominently before their minds the sort of consideration which they feel should be very definitely emphasised in any decision in this matter.  Let us get some body from amongst the more depressed classes of this community&mdash;some body which would represent, say, the agricultural labourer's mind, the man who, because he has been so far depressed, may, possibly, envy the teachers in their pre-strike position.  Let them get some body which is not only conscious of but paralysed by the thought of the impact upon the public mind of any further grant to the teachers.</P>
    <P>Put that man on your committee as a second man.  Load your committee <Col N="264" /> any way you like with the people who will have foremost in their thoughts the viewpoints that you will want to have emphasised and put on one man, like His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, who will know what a just wage is, who will know what Catholic principles are on this matter of payment, who will bear in his mind, when coming to a decision, the impact of anything he may do upon the public finances, who will be a responsible citizen able to give full weight to all those antagonistic considerations that have so weighed with the Government. Give the teachers that committee and let that committee pronounce and I believe they will be satisfied.  I believe the teachers would require for their satisfaction that there should be one man who could listen to, appreciate and, if he found it possible to do, beat down the arguments of the type the Minister has put before us.  But the Government are in this dilemma.  If they believe what the Minister has said here to-night, which is a mere recapitulation of all that has been said over the seven months, why not get that argument sanctioned and finished for ever by the word of such a conciliation committee as we seek to set up?  If they do not, is then their only excuse: &ldquo;We believe that justice to the teachers demands more pay but justice, (1) will set a bad example to other depressed people in this community, and (2) no matter what justice demands, we cannot afford to pay.&rdquo;  If it is the first&mdash;and I believe that is the thing that weighs with the Government&mdash;I suggest to them a just verdict on a meritorious case can never be a bad example.  If it is the second, that their attitude just simply is, &ldquo;Whether justice demands or not, we cannot pay; we cannot ask the citizens to bear more,&rdquo; then at that point the question of priority will arise.</P>
    <P>One thinks of the Army, the drive there was for recruits, the failure to get them and then, suddenly, several months ago we were told that no more money could be found for all the matters that the Government said so definitely engaged their interests&mdash; increase in old age pensions, payments to pensioners of different types, increased wages to agricultural labourers, <Col N="265" /> more money for the teachers.  There was not a penny more to be exacted from the community, but when the recruits failed to come in, we found the money.  Where is the priority from the point of view of justice?  Do we think so little of education and so much of the armed forces of this country in time of peace that we can find for the Army what we say it is impossible to find for the teachers?</P>
    <P>Finally, have we not advanced any distance from the year 1891?  In that year the earliest one of a great number of Encyclicals was written, the Encyclical which had for its theme the reconstruction of the social order, the Encyclical whose objective was that in a chaotic sort of world&mdash;nothing like as chaotic as the present situation&mdash;men should seek and should strive to attain a better situation by mediation, by conciliation, and not by two parties fighting it out, locked in a grip, where one must be the victor and one must lose.  Forty years later that was rewritten and reconstructed a little to meet the difficulties that had arisen in the 40 years.  Here are we, in 1946, and the only thing the Minister for Education can tell us is that he has said his last word and we do not know the foundation, we do not know the reasons, that moved him to say what he puts forward as his last word, but there it is.  The authority of the Government, apparently, is going to be weakened.  By what?  By a group of men meeting and listening to the Minister's arguments and telling the teachers afterwards: &ldquo;The Minister has convinced us his reasons are good and you must return to your schools.&rdquo; The Government will not even have that.  They will not run that risk because, of course, the chance is that the committee listening to the Minister might think as little of his arguments as the populace in the last seven months have thought of them and it would be awkward if the Government found itself faced with a report from such a body as we ask to have set up saying that the teachers were entitled to more than they have got even though it might not be the full amount of their demands.</P>
    <P>I do ask the Government in a suppliant <Col N="266" /> way to let a conciliation group meet.  It may be that they will say that the teachers are too well paid in the new offer that was made to them.  It may be that they will say that they are at least as well paid as the State can afford at this time.  They may say: &ldquo;We think the teachers have a claim but it is better to postpone it for two years until we can see if the happy optimism of the Minister is justified and that prices will be lower and the money we are getting at the moment will have a greater purchasing power than what it is thought it will have.&rdquo; They may say any number of these things but they will at least have, either openly before the public or behind closed doors, deliberated over what the Government have to say in defence of their offer and what the teachers have to say against it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, is there any loss of dignity in their asking that a body should meet to consider their wisdom, their justice and their charity in the way in which they have met the teachers?  I think this House would promise&mdash;it could be promised certainly on behalf of this Party&mdash;that if that group asked the Government to make further efforts for the teachers even though it meant further taxation, there would be no clamour against the necessity for taxation.  I think the promise could be made by all Parties in this House that this matter would not be allowed to enter into politics and that no political capital would be made out of the fact that the Government, after holding out so long, yielded to reason when reason was put before them by a group such as I suggest.  I cannot see why this motion should not be met in a sympathetic way.  I see no reason why it should be turned down and I ask the Government, if the Minister did pretend to hold the door open, to hold it open to those who moved this resolution and to set up the little committee we ask for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to say only a few words.  I am in a rather peculiar position, perhaps.  I am a national teacher, a member of the teachers' organisation and at the same time a Deputy of the Government Party.  Anything I say is intended rather to throw <Col N="267" /> oil on the troubled water than otherwise. I have been for a very long time a teacher, and I quite agree with Deputy Mulcahy and other speakers that we have had very grave grievances. For almost a century the teachers were in a position of slavery, on slave wages. The first sign of dawn that we saw was in the new scale of salaries in 1920. There were perhaps odious conditions attached to those salaries as, some people say, there are attached to the present scale of salaries, but I should like to remind some of the Deputies who have spoken that these salaries were in operation only two or three years when a cut of 10 per cent. was imposed.  At that time, unless I gravely mistake, some of the very men who have spoken were in office as the Government or in the Government Party. I cannot very well understand how it is that they are now so anxious or why when they first imposed those cuts they did not seek that mediation and conciliation which they are so anxious to get now.  I am quite cognisant of the many grievances that even yet the teachers suffer from.  Before this strike took place I did whatever I could as a mediator between the teachers' organisation and members of the Government. I think I met with a little success and I thought at one stage that the claims of the teachers in the main were being met and I had very strong hopes at one stage that at least as far as the financial considerations were concerned we were arriving at a settlement. However, things took a different turn and as the Minister has pointed out, a certain line of action was taken by the teachers' organisation and a strike took place.  I speak now as one who voted against the strike and I have no apology for that.  I believe I was right then and I believe I am right yet.  However, I am a member of the teachers' organisation and I have acted as one loyal to the obligations.  It gives me no pleasure as a member of the Government Party to see the strike continuing and I do hope that as a result of this discussion we will come nearer to a settlement.  The Minister has gone a good distance.  I may say that I met him on various occasions in conjunction with other members of this <Col N="268" /> Party and members of the teachers' organisation and I found him indeed most sympathetic.  On several occasions the offer to the teachers was increased, but there were some points, apart altogether from the sum involved, where the Minister did not agree with the points put up by the teachers.</P>
      <P>My main object in speaking here this evening is to ask both the teachers and the Government to try to arrive at a settlement.  I do not think the Government is inclined to accept outside mediation and I think they are probably right, as that would not meet the situation.  They have responsibility as a Government and I do not see how they could accept outside mediation, but surely there is no reason why both teachers and Government could not meet?  Assuming that the teachers go back and the Government give an undertaking to discuss all possible aspects of the teachers' grievances, there does not seem to be any reason why a solution cannot be reached.  I have met quite a good number of teachers recently and they point out a number of grievances, apart altogether from the question of finance.  With some of these points I have sympathy but in other cases I have not.  We have had different points of view, but whatever differences there might be between the teachers and the Government they could be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to speak at length, but I speak here just as one who would like to see this dispute settled.  I do not think the Government will accept the motion before the House and I do not think they could, to be candid.  The proposed body would be cumbersome and would relieve them of responsibility. However, in the near future, if not to-night, the Government can give some undertaking to the teachers to discuss all outstanding matters with them.  If they do that, I have not the least doubt that these things will be settled all right.  I know that the teachers who are on strike and teachers in the country are fairly well tried of the strike.  They do not want it, nor do the parents or the children.  No one wants this strike and, therefore, I suggest that, assuming this motion is disposed <Col N="269" /> of, the Government and the teachers can make a move in the direction I suggest and resume the negotiations they have had in the past.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the teachers.  I have met a number of individual Cabinet Ministers and find a great deal of sympathy amongst them. They do not want the strike, but they consider their authority is being challenged. Assuming that the teachers go back, I feel they will get sympathetic treatment; and as far as I can&mdash;I do not say I can move the Government very much&mdash;I am always prepared, as a member of that body and as a representative, to help towards an amicable settlement&mdash;which will be brought about soon, please God.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether what I am going to say will be helpful or the reverse.  When I saw this motion, I did not have much hope that it would help matters, and I felt it was quite possible that the contrary would be the effect.  Deputy Dillon gave us a very valuable warning and I hope I will keep his words in my mind as well as I can.  There is grave danger, in a case like this, that tempers may become frayed.  It is very hard to be in the position of &ldquo;dogs tied, stones loose&rdquo; all the time.  We have tried over the whole period to say little about this dispute and to point out strongly the aspects of it as seen by the Government.  We did that deliberately. We suffered all sorts of misrepresentations, precisely because we did not want to disturb what I hope may be the future relations between the teachers and the Department responsible for education.  Deputy Dillon's words of warning are rather important.  Perhaps we could add to them the words spoken recently by Mr. Gandhi, who pointed out that we lose some years of our lives if we allow our tempers to become frayed unduly.</P>

    <P>The position in regard to this matter is that we have refrained from putting to the public the case as the Government <Col N="270" /> sees it, for the reasons I have stated, whereas the other party to the dispute has been quite at liberty to put the case from their angle.  As usually happens in any case, the Government is a fair butt; it can be attacked; we can be held responsible for the strike, for the harm done to the children; and the public&mdash;at least the vocal public&mdash; never thinks of turning the other way and asking: &ldquo;What about the other party to the dispute?&rdquo; It was not we who caused the strike; we did not shut out the teachers; we did not say: &ldquo;There is to be an end to negotiations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was the other way round.  The Minister went to the teachers in the first instance, after discussion with the Government and considering the whole financial situation.  We had to consider the national position as a whole, the situation we would be faced with in the future, with the cost of living having gone up during the war and salaries having been pegged down.  We came to the conclusion that £1,000,000, representing over a 30 per cent. increase, was a fair beginning in dealing with this complex problem, of which that was only going to be the first step.  There were even more pressing cases than that of the teachers.  I am quite willing to admit that the case of all those on middle-scaled salaries is a pressing one, as they had to suffer very severely during the war.  However, they have had one thing, together with the teachers, in that they have been able to retain their positions and get what was going, when many other people have been put out of employment and have had to seek a livelihood outside the country altogether.  They managed to exist under the conditions which prevailed and managed to keep body and soul together, but other people had to go out of this country in order to do that.</P>
    <P>We realised that those on the middle-scale salaries were badly hit during the war and that a very critical situation would arise in the adjustment period; but we realised also that there were people still worse off.  It was not simply a question of an addition of £1,000,000 to the £3,250,000, which is over 30 per cent.  We would have to <Col N="271" /> deal with the old age pensioners' grievances, with the Civil Service and a large body of public servants, where there was considerable complaint about their position.  They could even claim that they had suffered more, because on account of the extraordinary situation in which we found ourselves the State had to deal with the position by checking the automatic rise in their salaries which would have taken place.  We realised that it was not going to be a case of £1,000,000 but of several millions.  If you take the Supply Services and calculate what a 30 per cent. increase would mean in the case of all these you will soon see what a sum of money would have to be got from the public in the way of taxation.  We in the Government could not deal with this as an isolated problem.  We came to the conclusion that in all probability prices would settle down.  We hope they will settle down at something less than a 50 per cent. increase, but we do not know.  In the case of salaries of this kind you cannot depress them, so that we had to move cautiously.  In the case of the teachers we gave them priority and we thought that a 30 per cent. increase&mdash;by giving them £1,000,000&mdash;was a very fair offer.  We said to them that the proposal would be open for reconsideration when things got a bit normal.</P>

That was the period that it took after the last war to get things into shape.  In any case, to give a definite date we said three years.  We thought that was fair, having looked at the situation as a whole.  I suggest to <Col N="272" /> the Dáil that you cannot give an outside body the right to decide these things for you: that it is not fair to give an outside body the right to put you in the position in which you cannot use your judgment freely in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, having consulted the Government, went and met the teachers. He made this proposal to them and they turned it down flat.  He discussed this matter with them for a few months.  They made some proposals. He came back to the Government and asked for another £150,000.  I must say that, about that period, I myself&mdash;and I am speaking for myself&mdash;lost heart in the possibility of getting any agreement with the teachers because the word &ldquo;strike&rdquo; was in the air.  The word &ldquo;strike&rdquo; was actually in a communication. It was taken out afterwards, but I was convinced myself at that particular period that the word &ldquo;strike&rdquo; being in the air strike action was going to follow unless we gave the whole of their demands.  However, we gave way in the Cabinet, and the Minister got another £150,000.  He went back and talked to them again, and again they turned it down flat.  He came back a third time although the Cabinet in the first offer made what they considered to be as generous an offer as the situation warranted them in making.  Deputy McGilligan talked about some of these things.  One would imagine that he had the same view as that which was expressed at our Árd-Fheis when he said that the pressure on the pen would be the same in writing £1,500,000 as in writing £1,000,000. That sort of thing gets us nowhere.  It ought not appeal to sensible men.  It is obvious, in all these cases, that the moment you put taxation of a certain sort on the community it is going to have reactions of various kinds, and in the interests of the community you ought not to be driven beyond your own judgment.  At any rate the Minister went back again to the teachers with a further offer of £100,000.  That is, that after this discussion £250,000 had been added to the £1,000,000.  In other words, the offer was to be increased by no less than 25 per cent.  The £1,250,000 represents an increase on the existing scales they had in 1938 of <Col N="273" /> something like 40 per cent.  That was not a bad beginning&mdash;to say to those who had fixed salaries that they were going to get a step up towards meeting the situation which represented an increase of 40 per cent.  I think that if 40 per cent. was added straight off to the salaries of everyone in the country they would not regard themselves as having been unfairly met.</P>
    <P>At this stage I became more convinced than ever that the word &ldquo;strike&rdquo; was going to mean strike action. I told the Minister at the time that he need not come back for any more, that the £1¼ million was all that we were going to give.  As I say, it represented an increase of 40 per cent.  In view of the situation as a whole, I told the Minister that naturally every other section could look for similar increases&mdash;what was done in the case of the teachers was also going to be demanded by other sections of public servants.  The Minister was told, quite independent of that imperative demand, to go back with that final offer and get done with it.  We told the Minister and told the teachers, therefore, that they had got their final offer, and it was on that monetary offer, dealing with salaries and emoluments, that the strike took place.</P>
    <P>Now, we did not cause the strike.  I am not going to say, and have not ever heard, that the strike is not a legitimate weapon in the sense that, if a person feels sufficiently strong and that his interests demand it, he shall not use it.  But remember, there must be some counter to that because if not it is quite obvious that every section of the community is going to get its demands&mdash;unless, as I say, there is something to counter the strike.  What is to counter the strike?  The resistance of the party opposite who is going to be adversely affected.  In this case the resistance was coming from the Government as representing the community. We had to represent the community interest as against the sectional interest, and that is the part that this Parliament and the Government will always have to play.  The greater the organisation of the section the more necessary is it that there should be a supreme authority that will act for the <Col N="274" /> community as a whole.  Deputy Dillon has given an example of where the strike could be legitimately used, where it would be necessarily used, but unless there was a reaction to it the whole thing would become absurd. You get action from one section and the reaction from the section that would be adversely affected.  That occurs in ordinary commerce, in ordinary business.  There is the private interest of the individual who is concerned, the owner or proprietor of the business, and the action, we will say, of the employees.</P>
    <P>A stage is reached in which the employer can say to himself: &ldquo;Very well, I cannot carry on the business; I would be carrying on at a loss and I cannot do it; I shall close down.&rdquo;  That course, obviously, is not possible for a Government.  The public service must be carried on somehow.  Naturally, we have our duty to the public and to the children.  If trade unionism were not organised as it is at the moment&mdash;and I understand why it has to be organised&mdash;what we would do would be immediately to advertise for teachers at the rates which we are paying and we would put them into the schools.  That would be the natural reaction, to carry out our duty to the children because in this case what is happening is that the children are being held up to ransom. If there is a strike in the public service what is the point at issue?  It is whether the public are to be denied these services or not.  Those who want to have a successful strike, go out at what they believe to be the most successful time.  You have a strike, for instance, in the public conveyance system at a time when the public can be hit most severely.  That is ordinary strategy and the strategy in this case is obvious to anybody who looks at it. The principal point was: &ldquo;We have got this £1,250,000; we believe we should get more.&rdquo;  Obviously, anyone who is allowed to estimate what his own services are worth, is going to rate them at a very high figure indeed.</P>
    <P>If there were to be conciliation in this case, the conciliation committee, who would have no responsibility, would take the easiest course, that is, give way to the demand, quite ignoring the consequences from the <Col N="275" /> public point of view of what may ensue from giving way in a case like this.  It is the simplest thing in the world to suggest that you should have some outside committee to negotiate and recommend. Then, of course, we are told that you can refuse to implement their recommendations.  You have the nominal right to refuse but why should you set up a committee to pass judgment on a question of this kind when obviously you are competent, with the assistance of your officials, to examine the question throughly yourself?</P>
    <P>You will naturally say: &ldquo;Have we not examined it ourselves?&rdquo; If there is anybody who should be interested from the point of view of, let us say, <i>esprit de corps</i> or association with teachers, the Minister for Education and myself would naturally be inclined to deal lightly with them&mdash;that is why the Minister for Finance came in here to watch us.  Why should we say to other people who would not have anything like the knowledge the Minister for Education and his Department could have of the working of the system and who would have no responsibility for the finances: &ldquo;You can come in here and decide this matter for us&rdquo;?  I think that that would be an obvious surrender of our duty and I do not think that anybody should ordinarily even suggest such a thing.</P>

      <P>In any case, that is the history of the strike as we saw it.  With regard to a number of other matters which Deputy Mulcahy raised, I thought we were dealing with a specific question and not with the whole question of education and a repetition of what was said here on former occasions such as the debates on the Estimates.</P>
      <P>A number of things were mentioned, again with the object of trying to bring blame on the Government, for which the Government cannot accept blame. Take the question of large classes.  The Government would not stand for one moment by a policy of large classes but you cannot suddenly create the accommodation for them.  It takes time to do it.  Nobody has said, neither the Minister nor anybody else, that it is Government policy.  I say it is not Government policy.  The Government policy in regard to it would be to have as small classes as we possibly could, keeping a reasonable view on what the total cost is going to be.  Nobody has any interest in keeping children in classes consisting of 80 or 90 children. You might have these large classes when the children are very young, when it is only a question of keeping them together and not a question of teaching them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>You are teaching them Irish in a simple way.  I know when I was down in the Education Office this matter did not arise.  If it came to my notice, I would have tried to get a remedy for the situation as quickly as I could.  I know the Minister is trying to do that.  With regard to a number of other matters which were mentioned, when I was at the <Col N="277" /> Education Office these things never came up.  One thing which did come up I settled in a few days.  That was the way in which salaries were to be paid. If some of the questions raised during this strike had been brought to my attention then I would have tried to settle them as quickly as possible, and the present Minister has the same attitude.  There is, for instance, the question of grading.  Is there anybody in the House who will not agree that a teacher who is particularly good ought to get a particular reward?  I do not think there is.  I think everybody will agree that in a profession like this, that is the only way in which you can give a reward for efficiency.  It is objected that that rating applies to about only 30 per cent.  Take any profession or group of workers of any kind, professional or otherwise.  If you want to have a reward for a highly efficient worker, few professions have a higher percentage than 30 per cent. of highly efficient workers.  Remember it is not fixed.  That is the impression that is being created, but that is not right. Each person is judged on a certain standard and we find that it works out all over the country at about 30 or 40 per cent. of the total membership.  Is a great fault to be found with it if it is, in fact, a reward for being highly efficient?  You cannot admit everybody is highly efficient.  As in the case of a number of other professions, teaching is not now so much a vocation as it used to be; it is a way of earning a livelihood.</P>

      <P>It is the same for them as for every other profession. People who go into it do so because they feel that it offers them a living.

I have been in a training college and I have as much admiration for the people who are turned out of a training college as anybody.  I was at a training college for ten years and during that time I saw that there were some persons going for the teaching profession whom I was sorry to see going for it because I felt that they had not that particular gift <Col N="278" /> which would be very valuable for them as teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We stand our examinations, our inspections and all the rest of it.  However, with the large number of teachers we have and in the circumstances in which they are recruited, you cannot say that every person who is a teacher is highly efficient. You have them rated in regard to efficiency on inspection and those who are not efficient should not be there and they are ultimately removed. But is there anything wrong in principle with having a highly efficient rating and giving a special reward for it?  What happens is that if 30 or 40 per cent., or 50 per cent., as it is in Dublin, get a highly efficient rating, the 50 per cent. who do not get it naturally want to get the same salary, if they can and, if they cannot get it by coming up to the required standard, they will try to get it by getting rid of all the standards and having a general levelling up.  There is never any suggestion of getting rid of &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; and keeping the normal scale.  It is always a question of getting rid of the highly efficient rating but giving everybody the highly efficient salary.  Let us be realists in this matter and approach it from the point of view of people dealing with other human beings who are in a position <Col N="279" /> to understand other human beings and have a fair idea of how their minds work.  We are dealing with human beings in this matter.</P>
      <P>The question of women teachers has been raised.  I expressed an opinion on that matter at the Árd-Fheis and I do not mind expressing that opinion here again.  It is that the woman teacher teaching mixed children up to the ages of eight or ten, if she is a good teacher, is doing as good work for the community as any man could do, and if there is to be any question at all of equal pay for equal work, she deserves to get equal pay with any man. That is my view, but remember that you cannot adopt that principle overnight and think that you will not have large social consequences if you adopt it all round.  From the point of view of the woman seeking employment, it is very doubtful in the long run whether it is going to be good for women in regard to their being able to earn a livelihood outside.</P>
      <P>My own view is that if you adopt that general principle, the social consequences, in the main, would be that wherever you have an employer who says: &ldquo;I have to pay a woman the same as a man&rdquo;, the woman will not get equal chances.  I am speaking now in general.  There will be special activities&mdash;and I would say that teaching is one&mdash;for which women's faculties are particularly adapted and in this case she will at least compete with men and get the same pay.  There is probably no social question which would need such careful examination before action is taken as that of complete equality in that matter.  I cannot argue against it on the basis of ordinary justice between individuals.  I believe that a woman, as an individual, has just as much right to get reward for her services as a man, but you cannot take that simply in isolation.  Therefore, what we have to say is that if we adopt that principle in the case of teachers, we could not stop there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the Minister's offer was to reduce considerably the gap&mdash;and my hope was that the gap would be quietly closed and that they would be treated ultimately on a level&mdash;between the single man and the woman teacher. <Col N="280" /> That would be my hope and that brings to my mind the thought of comparison with the North which has been used so much.  I have here a table which I studied at the time these proposals were being made, that is, before the Budgets.  I will trouble the House with a few figures which they may like to write down as they will help the House to understand the position. In order to make little of our offer, the teachers held up the scales being offered in the North.  As the Minister said, our position here will have to be examined from the point of view of our own circumstances as a whole, but, merely for comparison purposes, here is how it seems to work out, so far as I can find out.</P>
    <P>Taking into account income-tax and the question of pension towards which they have to make a certain contribution, as they stood before the Budget, at the time when this strike was taking place the minimum amount for an unmarried man, an efficient teacher, was £214 both in the case of the North and here.  In the case of the efficient teacher maximum, our offer was £330 and in the North £356&mdash;a difference of £26 in the case of the unmarried man.  In the case of &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;, the maximum on our scale worked out at £355, the amount in the North being £356.  In the list I have so far given, the only advantage over our scale is in the case of the unmarried man at his maximum of £356 as compared with £330.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to deal with the matter of &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;. I am giving the figures as I have them and there is no question of gliding over anything.  In the case of the highly efficient teacher, the figures were £355 here and £356 in the North.  In that class, the only advantage is in respect of the maximum of the efficient teacher who, in the North, would get £26 more than the same teacher here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> Let us now come to the women.  A woman, efficient, coming in at the normal scale, would get £194 net in the North, whereas in our case the figure would work out at £201.  We were actually better in that case.  In the case of the efficient teacher at the maximum, in the North a woman would get £304; here she was getting £308.  It was actually better here.  In the highly efficient grade she was getting £304 in the North and here £334, actually £30 more.  Therefore, the women's scale was actually better here.  She would have more here than in the North to buy the things she wanted, although the claim at that time was quite the reverse.</P>

I am only giving these to show the figures at the time at which a decision had to be come to. The minimum in the North was £194 and with us £201.  That shows that the women's scale is better with us, that from the point of view of the net money coming from the State to enable the teachers to buy the things they want to buy, our scale was better than they had in the North.  Let us now come to the married men.  In the North, in the case of efficient or highly efficient the sum was £436.  With us there is a difference between Dublin and elsewhere on account of the extra amount we were giving.  With us the Dublin efficient teacher at the maximum was getting £510.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position as we saw it.  I put it to the House that, in view of the situation we have to face in passing over from the position in which we have been to the future, that was not an unfair or an ungenerous offer.  It was an offer that was prompted by the desire to go as far as we felt our responsibilities for the whole of the public service would allow us to go.  I believe that if it had not been for the prior idea operating in their minds of having a strike in any case that would have been accepted and the negotiations would be continued.  I do believe that any of our people who are acquainted with the facts will think that we have not acted unfairly to the teachers in that proposal.  I am firmly convinced that the ordinary taxpayer will feel that he has done his duty when he contributes the amount that is necessary for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say to the House that they ought not to encourage extravagant demands at a time like the present when the consequences would be very serious.  If we can get over this time of adjustment, as we can get over it by a reasonable desire to co-operate on the part of the various sections, we will be able to say that we have passed through this war period and have got out of it well.  In this period of transition we <Col N="283" /> can lose the advantages we have gained up to the present by inconsiderate action on the part of various sections if they act selfishly.  By that I mean if they close their eyes to the reactions on the rest of the community.  That is the position as we see it.</P>
    <P>With regard to all those other matters, I have indicated my own attitude towards the women's question.  I did not hesitate to indicate my attitude with regard to teachers in small schools.  These are things which were never brought to my notice when I was Minister for Education.  In the case of the small schools there is what I call a sub-normal rate given.  That is a matter which will have to be remedied.</P>

A lot of these things have happened as a result of various conditions.  There are various reactions from interfering with things of that sort until you see where you are going.  These are questions which the Minister for Education in the execution of his ordinary administrative duty would naturally meet the teachers to discuss.  If there were good reasons why they should not be changed at the moment, he would point out the reasons, if he were going to be met in a reasonable spirit on the opposite side. I met the teachers on a few occasions and I had no trouble with them.  We were not up against this question of more salary or a demand which would mean a 40 per cent. increase on a £3,250,000 bill with the possibility of a 40 per cent. increase on a whole lot of other millions that have to be dealt with.</P>

So far as the amount of money which we have given is concerned, it was considered so carefully we are not going to have some outside body who had no responsibility at all saying: &ldquo;Oh yes, you can add another couple of hundred thousand&rdquo;.  It would be an encouragement to strikes if this thing of having extravagant demands and bringing pressure to bear were to go on.  Soft-hearted people would come along and press very hard and the Opposition would press the Government to leave it to some outside body to make a recommendation.  Nominally the Government would not have to accept the findings, but in practice it would probably be difficult not to do so and they would get the extra quarter of a million or whatever they wanted.  That is what we are coming to and I ask the House very seriously not to encourage action of this sort.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, first of all, to congratulate Deputy O'Rourke for having established the record in this House of a Deputy who is a national teacher having the courage of his convictions. It is the first time that I heard, in this House, any national teacher advocating the claims of the teachers here.  On every occasion they voted against the interests of their parent body.</P>
      <P>The position created by this strike of the national teachers is undoubtedly a very delicate one and I think that any solution of the problem, if there is to be a solution, must be by an approach different from that suggested by other speakers.  I could quote figures from public statements by members of the National Teachers' Organisation which would refute, to some extent at any rate, the figures read out by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education. There is a conflict of opinion as to the accuracy of some of those figures. Therefore I do not propose to occupy the time of the House in reading whole lists of figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a solution to offer which I feel should be acceptable to the Minister for Education and the Government generally.  It may not appear to be in strict conformity with the usual trade <Col N="286" /> union practice on questions such as this where a strike exists.  I can speak with some authority as an Independent Deputy for many years and also as a trade unionist for many years.  I can speak possibly with a greater and more varied experience of trade union matters than any other Deputy here, whether he sits on the Government Benches, the Fine Gael Benches or on any section of the Labour Benches.  It is an experience which has been gained not alone here but on the other side of the Channel.  I hope it will not be said that this suggestion departs in any way from the spirit behind the trade union movement. I am prepared to accept any kind of adverse criticism that may be offered to me.  I will take all the brickbats that are flying around; possibly I will not be presented with many bouquets.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is one that differs in some respects from the suggestion made by Deputy O'Rourke, that the teachers should be asked to resume duty in view of the terrible tragedy&mdash;I can call it by no other name&mdash;that we are witnessing in the City of Dublin, where there are 40,000 boys and girls of tender years running about the streets half-wild, as was described by some Dublin Deputies this evening.  I suggest the teachers should go back.  I know it will be a severe ordeal for them to go back, but they will not go back defeated.  Victory or defeat should not enter into the minds of the teachers or the Government.  I think that view has been expressed by the Taoiseach and the Minister.  There will be no such thing as victory or defeat.  I think the teachers can go back with honour, on one condition.  Now, it is not a very difficult condition for the Taoiseach or the Minister to accept. Perhaps the Taoiseach or the Minister for Education will indicate to us that he is prepared to discuss with the teachers their various problems, problems which have arisen and that are still there, problems that have been the cause of this strike.</P>
    <P>I am not authorised by any section in this House or by the teachers, with whom I have had no contact whatsoever, to take up the attitude I am taking up.  I have not been authorised <Col N="287" /> by any teacher, by any Deputy, or by any member of the Government Party, but I feel somebody must do something in this dispute between the teachers and the Government.  I ask the Minister, if the teachers resume duty on this day week, will he be prepared to meet them, as he almost indicated in his peroration this evening?  His statement gave me a little hope and that is why I put this suggestion to him.  He said he was prepared to discuss anything that he was reasonably and fairly asked to do.  I am now asking him fairly and reasonably to do something. I am suggesting something on my own behalf, not authorised to do so by anybody. Will the Minister consider the suggestion I have made and intimate to the teachers to-morrow or the day after that he will be prepared, if they resume duty, to discuss with them the problems which brought about this strike?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise not to take up too much of the time allocated to Deputy O'Higgins, but I would like to have an opportunity of expressing my views in this matter.  When the very valuable intervention of Deputy Norton was about to bear fruit and when it was decided that the discussion should continue, I feared that the atmosphere which that intervention had created would be entirely destroyed by subsequent discussion.  I am glad to say that has not been so; not even the intervention of the Taoiseach has damaged the position in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a prolonged discussion on this particular question, on every aspect of it, last May.  There is practically no aspect of the situation that was not then touched upon.  I am bound to say that the atmosphere in which we are discussing the position to-night is entirely different.  I feel that there is something in the atmosphere to-night which suggests conciliation. Advantage should be taken of that to stop the tragedy which we have been witnessing for the past seven months in the City of Dublin.  The fact has been stressed that 40,000 children are roaming the streets.  Unless something is definitely done here to-night, is <Col N="288" /> that picture likely to be altered?  A couple of aspects of the position must, in the light of statements made, particularly by the Minister for Education, be adverted to in coming to the conclusion to which I shall later refer. The Minister advanced the proposition that, simply because the teachers were State servants, strike action was completely outside their right.  I should like to refer to the position of the State servant and it is about time that his position was understood both in this House and throughout the country.  If you take a person into the employment of the State and shut him out from all conciliation and arbitration, then he may be subjected to the most tyrannical form of employment it is possible to envisage.  Hence, it is that the Government is engaged in devising machinery for conciliation or arbitration so far as State servants themselves are concerned.  In my judgment, this situation would never have arisen if the machinery now contemplated for the Civil Service had been in operation in the case of the teachers last March. That is the fundamental cause of all the trouble.  There was a break between the Minister and the teachers and, human nature being what it is, they drifted apart and the gulf got wider.  The argument by the Minister regarding State servants does not hold so far as teachers are concerned, having regard to the setting up of a labour court and to the proposed introduction of conciliation machinery for the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>A good deal of play has been made regarding the grading &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach has advanced appreciably to-night.  I feel certain that the teachers will appreciate that advance.  There are three main lines of division between the teachers and the Government.  These questions refer to the category &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;, the question of women teachers as against unmarried male teachers and the question of the classification of the different schools.  These are the three burning questions.  I was more than interested to hear the remarks of the Taoiseach to-night.  I hope I have not misunderstood him and that I shall not misquote him.  He made a pronouncement which will be received with particular <Col N="289" /> pleasure by the lady teachers&mdash;that he stands for fair treatment so far as they are concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point was that he paid tribute to the type of work they were doing and could see no difference between it and that carried out by the unmarried male teachers.  As regards the categories, there is only one outstanding major question and that is the question of &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;.  No matter what figures may be adduced to show the necessity for maintaining that distinction, the fact remains that it has been abolished in Northern Ireland.  It is not in operation in England either.  It must be admitted that there is a constant factor in the number with that classification and that it remains around 30 per cent. The inherent difficulty in the approach to his whole question on the part of the Government is that too much emphasis has been laid on the contention that the teachers have got to accept what is known as their &ldquo;scales of salary&rdquo;, as set out in the final offer.  The Government have said: &ldquo;There are your scales of salary and you will not get a penny more; you have got to accept them.&rdquo;  On the other hand, you have the readiness of the Government, as expressed here to-night, to negotiate on major questions of controversy which mean so much to the teachers&mdash;the highly efficient grading, the position of the woman teacher and the question of the classifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not fool the teachers, the public or this House.  If the Government are prepared to discuss these questions with the teachers, unless a pre-determined decision has been reached that nothing will be done, there will be additional outlay.  If the Government are open to reasonable argument on any of these three points, then the implementation of the resulting decision will involve extra expenditure.  The Government have tied themselves up in this position: they say to the teachers: &ldquo;There are your scales and there will be no increase.&rdquo;  On the other hand, they say that they are prepared to deal with these outstanding <Col N="290" /> problems.  I suggest that the Government should be prepared to act on the suggestion of Deputy Norton.  There is a feeling of goodwill and understanding to-night that was not in evidence on previous occasions.  I suggest that negotiations be opened up in a broad and generous way.  Given understanding, good feeling and goodwill, I venture to say that not many days, not to speak of weeks, would pass, if this were done, until our schools would be in full operation again.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to take up much of the time allotted to Deputy O'Higgins nor do I wish to take up the time of the House.  I merely wish to join with Deputy Anthony in the plea he has made to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education.  I was encouraged when the Minister for Education gave us to understand that he was prepared to discuss with the teachers at any time the question of &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; and the categories of which they are complaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, I was encouraged by the statement of the Taoiseach that, when the salaries were offered, that offer, and the general conditions, were open to discussion at a future date.  Perhaps my interruption was not fully appreciated when I said &ldquo;three years&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach may not know that, attached to the present offer to the teachers, was the condition that this provision <Col N="291" /> regarding &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; and the categories was to last for three years. The teachers were, therefore, required to accept all these things for three years without any possibility of the matter being considered within that period.  To-night he has led us to believe that he was prepared to consider that and I believe by the Taoiseach's statement that when he said the matter could be considered at any period, he did not intend that they were to wait three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be either misunderstood or misrepresented. I was speaking about the matter when the Deputy interrupted, making some point about a shorter period.  The period was three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely making a further appeal, with Deputy Anthony, that the definite period of three years should be withdrawn and that in the ordinary way, when the Budget comes before the House or when the Education Estimates are under discussion, we should get an opportunity of considering it.  I also interrupted in connection with junior assistant mistresses.  Is it true that there are upwards of 500 junior assistant mistresses in the City of Dublin in receipt of salaries of £3 a week, paying £2 a week for lodging and trying to dress and keep themselves on £1?  When the Taoiseach was comparing Northern Ireland with Southern Ireland from the point of view of pension rates and when he said that we pay the pension contribution, he did not say that the teachers in Northern Ireland get a gratuity of 18 months' salary and that in more than one case the gratuity is as much as £800.  If all these things were taken into consideration and if the Minister were to give Deputy Anthony a word of encouragement and would promise to consider these matters, I believe the teachers, with all possible goodwill, would resume duty and give the 40,000 children in Dublin the rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, concluding this debate, give expression to a mild protest against the way the debate has <Col N="292" /> been handled by Government speakers as against the manner in which it has been handled by the rest of the House? Deputies from every other section of this House, right through the course of this debate, were particularly careful not to dwell in any detailed way on the issues which were in dispute, not to use the debate this evening to misrepresent the Government's attitude, or the Government's offer or the Government's suggested scales but, in view of the very appalling situation that exists in the City of Dublin, to concentrate exclusively on the necessity for reopening the schools, no matter who was wrong or who was right.  There is no use in this quibbling as to who fired the first shot.  The only big man in a situation like this is not the man who begins the row but the man who is big enough to end it.  We had from the Taoiseach as clever a bit of special pleading as ever was heard. It struck me when I was listening to him&mdash;and I say it with no personal disrespect&mdash;that it was easily seen why politicians using figures attract the disrespect of the ordinary plain, simple, honest man.  We had the old special presentation of the position here <i>vis-á-vis</i> the position in the North of Ireland.  We had the Taoiseach introducing that particular argument by saying that you could not in the issue in question take into account the appallingly high cost of living, because that was purely temporary, that was purely a war situation, and that consequently it was not relevant and should not be taken into account.  The cost of living having been dealt with by a wave of the Taoiseach's arm, because it was only a war situation and only temporary, we then had this old misrepresentation, the old bit of special pleading that was tried previously by the Minister for Finance in order to blacken the teachers' case, to make them appear to be unreasonable.  We had salaries here and salaries in the North compared, but compared according to what scale?  According to the scale of income-tax paid in the North and paid in Great Britain, as if that war income-tax were a normal and permanent feature of life in the North and in Great Britain.  That war income-tax is far less permanent than the excessively <Col N="293" /> high cost of living here but there must always be two heads on the coin the Taoiseach tosses.  &ldquo;On the scales that were fixed 22 years ago, are we told that it is unreasonable to give a 30 per cent. increase now?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That would be a fair argument if the rates were reasonable and the rates were fair and just in 1938.  There was as much discontent in 1938 as there is in 1946 but loyalty and patriotism and a spirit of sacrifice kept all that silenced and smothered during the war but the teachers, if they got a 30 per cent. increase in 1946, on rates fixed in 1922, are setting an unreasonable headline to the nation.</P>
      <P>The teachers are not the only people whose circumstances and whose views changed over such a long period.  In 1931 the Taoiseach and his colleagues considered that £1,000 a year was more than sufficient for the work they were doing as Government Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And a few years later they did not take an increase of 30 per cent., or 40 per cent., or 50 per cent., but an increase of 75 per cent. with a pension for themselves, their widows, and children under a certain age.  What capital sum would that represent? I am pointing out these things in order to bring back a sense of balance.  There are two sides to every question but the side that should be present before all our minds is the necessity for ending this thoroughly tragic and unfortunate state of affairs. Listening to the Minister, one would say that the voice of Gandhi received more attention than the voices of the parents of Dublin.  There were arguments about figures, there was quibbling about who fired the first shot, there was an attempt to put the blame on those who went on strike.  Is it a fair principle, that whoever goes on strike at any time is wholly and entirely responsible? Are not there conditions now and again so appalling, so unjust, that men who have looked to themselves, to their profession, to their trade, to their family and have any respect for those things must go on strike?  The responsibility is on those that bring about and want to make permanent the conditions that drive them on strike.  The <Col N="294" /> contribution of the Minister for Education to this debate on education, when our Army is rejecting 20 per cent. of young, able-bodied recruits because of illiteracy&mdash;the percentage swings between 10 and 20&mdash;after 20 years of compulsory school attendance, is that he always received the teachers with courtesy.</P>
      <P>Courtesy never fills stomachs, but when I heard him panting like a raving fury and protesting that he had always received the teachers with courtesy, what occurred to my mind was what we all saw in the papers last week&mdash; that the officers and staff in charge of the Nuremberg executions were particularly courteous to the doomed men. Courtesy to the doomed teachers, courtesy to the uneducated children, courtesy to the parents whose children may be going completely wild.  What does it mean to any of us as parents if even one child of ours loses a year's education, through illness or something of that kind&mdash;in just one year that could be made up easily at the other end, where we could afford it and could keep them on to 16, 18 or 19?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What consideration do we see given by the Taoiseach or by the Minister to the parents of those 40,000 children who have lost one year's education out of a maximum of about eight?  Nothing but this: &ldquo;Let the teachers go back to work; then we will discuss a number of things with them, but we will not discuss finance.&rdquo;  That came from the lips of a man who entered Geneva to preach to the whole world that strikes and disputes should not be settled by the strong conquering the weak, by the strong dictating terms to the weak. The man who laid down that principle is the Head of a Government who, only a couple of months ago, laid down as a State principle that, in all disputes, arbitration and conciliation should be tried, rather than the strong beating the weak.  Yet, when we come here to home affairs and he is called upon to settle a dispute in which he himself has a one-sided interest, all the claptrap uttered from high places in Geneva is discarded as so much tosh. It is just a case of Jekyll talking over there and Hyde here&mdash;there must be a different law, a different rule and a <Col N="295" /> different principle when it comes to a dispute of our own.</P>
    <P>Let the teachers walk back and then we will talk to them; but, even then, we will not talk to them about finance, about the conditions in their homes. Let them go back humiliated.  Are you all proud of that, 25 years after we got control of our own State?  What would schoolmaster Pearse think of the lot of you over there, with your old flags ready to cheer for victory&mdash;over whom?  Victory over what?  Victory over simple Irish teachers who merely asked&mdash;not demanded, but asked&mdash;for an opportunity to discuss with an Irish Government the conditions within their schools and the conditions applying to themselves.  I say: &ldquo;Shame on the whole lot of you, shame on you for your contempt for the high principles that stimulated all of us to make an effort to obtain an Irish Parliament with an Irish Government on top; shame on you who forgot that one of the most valuable things an Irish Government can control is the education of Irish youth; shame on you for your dull, determined and callous indifference to the conditions that exist outside.&rdquo; If you will not listen to the voice of parents, if you will not listen to the voice of Deputies, if you will not listen to the appeals of the Church, surely you can listen to the voices of the children?  Discipline going completely, education that was bad now in danger of being lost absolutely&mdash;and all for what?  Because the Taoiseach says: &ldquo;We cannot pass over responsibility for the public purse&rdquo; and, having raised that up as a principle, he quibbles about a motion which asks that people who best understand all the figures he has been presenting <Col N="296" /> from one side would sit down in private, discuss the merits of the case and make recommendations to the Government.</P>
    <P>If the case is all so simple, if the figures are as simple as the Taoiseach would have us believe, are we to take it that the delegates of the school managers and the School Attendance Committee on such an arbitration court are such thoroughly corrupt rogues that they would vote against the Government, in spite of the justice of their claim, so as to bolster up a bogus claim put up by the teachers?  If the figures and the facts are so simple, why be afraid to put them before the clerical managers of this country, in private?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach not know he will be dealing with honourable men, with upright and fairminded men, men who will appreciate the taxpayers' position as well as the call for the education of youth?  Is this not an attempt to pretend that there is a fair case to stand over, when he shirks submitting it to a tribunal&mdash;not one with authority to decide, not one with authority to scatter money, but an arbitration tribunal with authority merely to make recommendations to the Government as a result of the case put up by all the people in this dispute?</P>
    <P>Remember, it is not only the Government and the teachers that are concerned. The two most important corners of the square are not the Government and the teachers, but the other two corners, the parents and the children.  Those are the two corners which have not once been taken into account and have been referred to but rarely by the Government Minister, either in this or any previous debate.</P>

      <P>It was not until 1st July, 1945, that it became necessary to obtain a licence for the construction of a dwellinghouse.  Between that date and the 30th September, 1946, licences were issued which authorised the construction of 2,328 houses by persons other than local authorities and Government Departments.  No distinction is made <Col N="81" /> in the records kept in my Department between houses that are subsidised and houses that are not subsidised, or between houses constructed by public utility societies and those constructed by private persons.</P>
      <P>A figure cannot be given for the precise number of houses completed during the period July, 1945&mdash;September, 1946.  Many groups of houses for which licences were issued are still under construction, and until the period of validity of a licence expires the amount of work done under authority of a licence cannot be ascertained without special inquiry.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="118" /> Public Health if he will state under what terms and from what sources loans are available, at the present time, for persons wishing to make use of powers under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts to enable them to build houses.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have power to borrow from the Local Loans Fund in order to make advances to persons to build houses for their own occupation under the Small Dwelling Acts.  The present rate of interest on loans from the fund for this purpose is 2½ per cent. and local authorities may charge borrowers not more than ½ per cent. over this rate.  The market value of the house must not exceed £1,000, and the maximum advance that may be made is 90 per cent. of the market value.  The maximum repayment period is 50 years but does not usually exceed 25 years.  Local authorities have also power to obtain loans from other sources for the purposes of the Acts.</P>

    <P>NOTE.&mdash; The figures for the estimated population should be treated with reserve. It is not possible to be definite that the variation in population from year to year is caused solely by the ascertained excess of births over deaths and the balance of passenger movement. The estimate of population given is based on the population revealed by the Register of Population complied in December, 1943 for rationing purposes as affected by the best available statistics.</P>

For loans under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the Labourers Acts the maximum period is being fixed at 50 years; for harbours and docks, dispensary houses, mental hospitals, glebes and Gaeltacht housing, county homes, and for the purposes of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts the maximum period is, in practice, 35 years; public health loans are repayable within 30 years if they exceed £10,000 and in other cases 25 years; the maximum period for loans for courthouses and vocational education buildings is 30 years.  These represent the main categories of loans made out of the fund.</P>

    <P>As regards the information asked for by the Deputy at (c) in his question, there was a vacancy for an assistant teacher in the Central Model Infants' School on 21st February, 1946, due to the retirement of a member of the staff shortly before that date.  Consideration of the question of the staffing of this school was deferred on the occurrence of the teachers' strike.  The normal staff of the school is ten teachers and I regard such a staff as adequate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Pro-Cathedral and St. Patrick's No. 2 National Schools, I regret that, as I have already stated, I cannot give the number of pupils on rolls on 21st February, 1946.  There is no recent official information available in regard to the number of pupils on rolls in each class in these schools.  The total number on rolls on 31st December, 1945 (the last date for which the information is available) and the average attendances for the quarter ended on that date were as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The particulars asked for in questions 81 and 82 are given in the tables below, which cover the period 1939 to date. In compiling these tables, offences under the Emergency Powers Acts and the Orders made thereunder have been divided into three classes, which are <Col N="163" /> shown as Class A, Class B and Class C.</P>
      <P>Class A consists of security offences, i.e., offences against the security of the State.  Examples of the type of offences included in this group are: unlawful possession of wireless transmitting apparatus, landing or disembarking at a place other than an approved seaport or airport, interference with the military or police, unauthorised possession of military information, etc.</P>
      <P>Class B is confined to cases that consist of contraventions of the various Orders concerned with the maintenance of essential supplies and services.  Included in this group are offences relating to rationing and price control.</P>
      <P>Class C comprises cases of unlawful dealings in gold, foreign currency, watches, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very frequently&mdash;particularly as regards Class B&mdash;a large number of individual offences of the same kind (e.g., overcharging) were brought against the same person on the same occasion.  In these cases all the charges are dealt with as one charge: if the result on every charge was an acquittal, the case is treated as an acquittal: if there was one conviction the case is included as one conviction with the penalty imposed, the acquittals being ignored: if there were several convictions the case is included as one conviction and the cumulative penalties are added together (ignoring concurrent sentences of imprisonment) and included as one <Col N="164" /> penalty.  A couple of examples of actual cases will serve to illustrate the method that has been followed.  Thus, where a person was charged on 14 separate counts, acquitted on one count, convicted on the other 13 and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment on each of three counts, six months' imprisonment on each of five counts, and three months' imprisonment on each of two counts, all the sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently, and fined £100 on each of the remaining three counts, the case is included as one conviction with a sentence of imprisonment and fine in Table 1 of the return, as one sentence of nine months' imprisonment in Table 2 and as one fine of £300 in Table 3. Similarly, the case of a person who was charged on 44 counts, acquitted on nine of the charges, convicted on the remaining 35 and sentenced to three years' penal servitude on each of four charges and to various terms of imprisonment, to run concurrently, on the other charges, is included in Table 1 as one conviction with a sentence of imprisonment and in Table 2 as a single sentence of three years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>For simplicity, sentences of penal servitude have not been distinguished by name from sentences of imprisonment. The longest sentence of imprisonment that may be imposed is two years: the shortest sentence of penal servitude is three years.  When a sentence of three years, or over, is mentioned, it is consequently to be understood that the sentence was one of penal servitude.</P>
