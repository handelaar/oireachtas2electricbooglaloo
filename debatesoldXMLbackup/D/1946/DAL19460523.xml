      <P>During the emergency the functions of the Prices Commission in so far as control of prices is concerned have been exercised under the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, and Orders made thereunder.  The question of future policy in the matter is at present under active consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is intended that the practice of having a review, under the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, of tariff arrangements in certain cases, be revived; and if so, whether he will make a statement concerning the future procedure under the agreement in question.</P>

      <P>The reviews referred to by the Deputy were held in compliance with Article 8 of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 1938.  While this agreement continues the British Government may request the revival of the reviews. In such an event, in accordance with Article 12 of the agreement, the <Col N="648" /> reviews would be held first on the classes of goods for which the British Government might request early consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that, in a prospectus recently published by Irish Shoe Supplies (1946), Limited, it was stated that the original company had, in seven and a half years, carried net profits which represented an annual average of 33? per cent. on the ordinary capital; that the proceeds of the sale of a part of the assets of the old company will provide £2 4s. 0d. to each holder of £1 of the existing ordinary capital; that the five directors are to receive £1,400 per annum as remuneration; and that the company enjoys a protective duty of a minimum of 60 per cent.; further, if he will state if he was shown and approved this prospectus before it was published; and if it is his intention to continue the protection afforded to this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the prospectus issued by Irish Shoe Supplies (1946) Limited but it is not part of my functions to approve of such prospectuses.</P>
      <P>Since 1943, Irish Shoe Supplies Limited has conducted its business in accordance with a gross profit agreement made with my Department.  The net profits earned by the company under this agreement have been reasonable in relation to the company's turnover.  In this connection, I must point out that the ordinary capital of a company is not necessarily the capital employed in its business. Furthermore, the figure for directors' remuneration quoted in the question appears to include the salary of the managing director.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the prices charged by this company for its products have at all times been reasonable, and during the past three years been in many cases lower than the prices prevailing for corresponding goods in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of no reason why the protection afforded to the products of this <Col N="649" /> company should not be continued.  The company has conducted its business economically and efficiently, its factory is located in an area where industrial employment is very desirable, and its products have been of satisfactory quality and reasonable prices.  It represents a form of industrial development which the Government will always be glad to foster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the total acreage sown to wheat during the present year; and, assuming that the average yield of the past three years is maintained, the deficiency which is likely to arise in the home requirements during the next cereal year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated provisionally that the total acreage sown to wheat during the present year was 670,000 acres.  It is not yet possible to estimate the quantity of imported wheat which will be required in the coming cereal year as this will depend on a number of factors not yet known. The figure will probably be about 200,000 tons.</P>

    <P>I have no information as to stocks of raw wool or woollen yarn held by manufacturers and merchants in this country.  The export of raw wool continues to be subject to control but licences are granted only for the export of the lower qualities of wool.  During the first three months of this year exports of wool amounted to 1,409,000 lbs.  Particulars of exports during the month of April, 1946, are not yet available.</P>

      <P>The quantity of coal mined in Ireland in 1945 was 210,859 tons.  Statistics of the quantity of coal sold are not available.  The average price realised for coal sold will not be available until the returns for the Census of Industrial Production for 1945 have been compiled.  The average number of men employed in 1945 was 1,772.  These figures are to be regarded as provisional and subject to amendment.  Figures for individual collieries cannot be divulged.</P>

      <P>Particulars of the total capital indebtedness of local authorities as at 31st March, 1945, are in course of preparation and will be sent to the Deputy as soon as they are complete.</P>
      <P>The information as to parts (a) and (b) of the question, in so far as it is available in my Department, in respect of the financial year 1943-44, has been compiled in tabular form and will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I regret that I am not in a position to give the Deputy the information he requires in regard to average rates of interest.  In order to arrive at an accurate figure as to the average rate of interest paid by local authorities it would be necessary to extract particulars of every loan obtained by a local authority which is at present in course of repayment.  This would entail a considerable amount of research having regard to the fact that loans outstanding include borrowings incurred as far back as the year 1890. Furthermore, the result obtained would be of little value as a representative figure of the interest rate charged to local authorities over a prolonged period, in view of the frequent fluctuations in interest rates which have occurred since the commencement of the present century, and the lack of uniformity in the amounts borrowed from year to year.</P>

      <P>In 1944 Dublin Corporation applied for approval to the sale of a site to the vocational education committee for a school at Crumlin. The proposed site is a triangular area lying between two roads, one of which is an important main road that carries heavy industrial and passenger traffic.  A fortnight ago I discussed the matter with a deputation from the vocational education committee, who will consider a statement of what, in my opinion, are the disadvantages which attach to this site.  If the committee, when they have considered the objections to the site both from the town planning and legal aspects, adhere to their proposal and, despite the objections I have pointed out to them, still accept responsibility for choosing this site, I shall not oppose the corporation selling it to them.</P>

      <P>The wages of forestry labourers, to whom it is presumed the Deputy refers, are related to the rates of wages payable to other classes of labourers in Government employment, and may not be altered at the sole discretion of my Department.  It is customary to review their rates of wages in the light of the variations in the minimum rates payable to agricultural labourers under orders promulgated <Col N="664" /> from time to time by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The rates were last reviewed on the 7th February, 1944, following the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1944, and an increase of 4/- a week was then granted to forestry labourers.  The minimum rate at present paid to forestry labourers is 39/- a week.</P>
      <P>Provision already exists in my Department, under the system of remuneration, for the recognition of special skill and experience on the part of forestry labourers.  A differential of 2/- a week over and above the normal rate of wages is paid to selected skilled labourers of long service and experience.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was timidly and gently introducing my contribution to this debate when the Minister for Education interrupted to inform me that he and he alone is responsible for the Department of Education.  If the Minister insists on sticking out his neck in that way, I have no hesitation whatever in hanging the millstone of responsibility for all the failures which have occurred in his Department during his period of office around his neck.  We are called upon now to review the progress which the Minister has made in the management of his Department during the past year and, in reviewing the progress which the Minister has made for the past year, we must be influenced by the progress or lack of progress during his period of office.  In considering that matter we cannot fail to be influenced by the report of the Vocational <Col N="673" /> Organisation Commission.  That report, as is usual with objective reports of such a nature, was couched in very moderate and restrained language. But that report did direct attention to the lack of co-operation and cohesion in the whole Department of Education and in all branches of our educational service.  It directed attention to the neglect of vocational and agricultural education in primary and secondary schools.  It directed attention to what is the most important matter of all, the low standard of our primary education.  That report, seriously and deliberately considered, is a matter which cannot be overlooked or sneered at by the Minister or by the Government.  Everybody realises that there is no co-operation, no cohesion, in the Department of Education; that there is overlapping, futility and waste.  Everybody realises that the Minister for Education has shut himself up in a sort of air-tight and sound-proof chamber and excluded from his attention all prudent and expert advice in the matter of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vocational Organisation Commission strongly recommended the establishment of a council of education; not a council to direct the Minister, not a council to tell the Minister what he was to do, not a council to exercise executive or administrative functions, but a council to consult with the Minister and to advise him on all the varied and complex matters relating to education.  Why has the Minister refused to accept that recommendation? Why has he cut himself away from intelligent advice?  The Minister may say that he has the advice of the officials of his Department.  But here again the Vocational Organisation Commission pointed out that it is possible for people to rise to the highest positions in the Department of Education without having any real or practical educational knowledge.  The Minister may feel sensitive about this matter.  It may be an inferiority complex that compels him to refrain from entering into that conference with those who are qualified to give advice and instruction.  He could learn a lot from those engaged in the practical work of <Col N="674" /> teaching, from representatives of parents and from representatives of school managers.  But the Minister seems to fear that if he were to meet these people in open conference they would learn how deep is his ignorance of educational matters and he does not want to expose himself in that way.  I think the Minister should not be so sensitive.  The people who would have the right to representation on such a council of education would be people of a high intellectual standard and of a high standard of tolerance and I think they would be prepared to make all due allowance for the Minister and help him out to the best of their ability.  But because the Minister has refused to accept co-operation and advice, he has fumbled from blunder to blunder in the matter of education.</P>
    <P>To-day the <i>Irish Press</i> has sought to cheer the Minister up, realising perhaps that he may be feeling somewhat sore over the volume of criticism directed against him and his Department yesterday.  They have sought to cheer him up by reminding him of a speech which he made recently in which he advocated the christianising of Europe by this country.  The <i>Irish Press</i> expanded and developed that proposal, indicating that they looked upon the Minister for Education as the person best qualified to lead in this great christianising campaign.  I am referring to an editorial in the official organ of the Government Party, which I suppose represents, if not the view of the Government, what is more important, the view of the Taoiseach.  If the Minister for Education is starting out on this great educational and christianising campaign over Europe, he should turn his attention first of all to our own country.  He should see that our own house is in order.  What impression can he make upon the nations of Europe if he has to admit that there are 30,000 or 40,000 children in the streets of Dublin who are receiving no education, beyond what they pick up at the street corners or in the second-rate cinemas?  Is that the foundation upon which he will set out to christianise Europe?  Is the insult which he has offered to one of the heads of the Catholic Church in this <Col N="675" /> country a basis upon which he can set out to christianise Europe?</P>
    <P>If this great campaign of christianising Europe is to be embarked upon, the first step should be to christianise the Minister for Education.  In that direction the initial step would be to give him a preliminary canter through the Short Catechism.  There he would learn the respect that is due to our spiritual superiors.  There can be no education in this or in any other country unless it is based on moral standards.  Education, unless it is based on religious principles, is not sound education at all, and the Minister ought to realise that.  He ought to realise also that those who are divinely appointed to guide us in such matters ought to be given the right to intervene, in the interests of education, to end the deplorable condition which prevails in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>No useful purpose can be served by dragging out a dispute in the educational sphere.  No useful purpose can be served in prolonging this disastrous strike.  Everyone who has the interest of education at heart, everyone who has the best interests of the nation at heart, and everyone who seeks to promote the goodwill and harmony which the <i>Irish Press</i> talks about, must admit that a speedy settlement of the teachers' strike is urgently desirable. What could be more conducive to a speedy settlement than that somebody such as the Archbishop of Dublin should be permitted to mediate as between the teachers and the Government? Hardly ever in my experience has any industrial or trade dispute or strike been brought to an end without negotiation, mediation and consultation.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister want?  Does he want to sit like a sulky sultan in his tent, waiting for the teachers to crawl on their bellies and lick his feet?  Is that the only way he believes the strike can be brought to an end?  In a civilised and Christian country, which is being set up by the <i>Irish Press</i> as a model for all countries, there ought to be some other means of bringing about a settlement of such an unhappy conflict.  I am not going to join with <Col N="676" /> other Deputies in the appeals which have been made to the Minister to settle this strike.  I think the Minister is old enough to know his moral duty in the matter and I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Last year I directed the Minister's attention to the school-leaving age.  I expressed the opinion that wherever adequate provision is made for vocational or technical education, the school-leaving age should be raised in such districts.  There is no reason why it should not be possible to provide schools for vocational training in all districts.  This is a matter upon which a council or conference of education could give the Minister assistance.  It is a matter upon which the views of parents, school managers and teachers would be eminently helpful, but the Minister, in this as in other matters, shuts himself away from informed and expert advice.  There would be no purpose served in raising the school-leaving age unless provision is made for something in the nature of post-primary education, vocational education. It should be possible to provide that, since the majority of children attending primary schools have got to earn their livelihood by manual work, whether on the farm or in the factory, and, for the female section of the community, as housewives and domestic servants &mdash; it should be possible to provide some measure of education for such people.  There are rural districts where vocational schools exist.  In such districts no difficulty would arise in raising the school-leaving age.  In other districts it should be possible to provide an additional room in the national schools for instruction in domestic economy and other subjects of that kind.</P>
    <P>It should also be possible to attach to our national schools a garden where horticulture, the growing of vegetables, and some introduction to agricultural practices could be given.  Before this State was established ambitious and praiseworthy attempts were made in this direction.  For instance, rural science was taught in the schools and I think that was discontinued by the present Minister for Education.  Gardens were attached to most of the <Col N="677" /> national schools.  That also was discontinued in the majority of cases. Nothing practical is being done to train national school pupils in the direction of the employment which they would have to rely upon as their means of livelihood.  Is it not about time that some big effort was made in that direction?</P>
    <P>It is criminally wrong to allow boys to wander about the streets for one or two years after they have left the national schools.  These are the years when the habits of life are formed, and if bad habits are formed then it will be very hard to eradicate them afterwards. In the schools children learn a certain measure of discipline. Discipline is good no matter what a person's vocation in life may be.  If a boy who leaves the national school finds immediate employment on the land there is a certain amount of continuing discipline.  He has to rise early and go to work and remain at it for the day.  That, in itself, is a moral and physical training.  In the same way, if a boy goes to business he learns rules and acquires habits which stand to him for life, but if he is left at a loose end after leaving the national school for two or three years, he will form useless and worthless habits, which will follow him right through life.  That is one of the most serious problems that face us in regard to education.  It is a problem which has not been faced up to by our educational authorities.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish.  I think it is the general opinion of teachers who have had practical experience over a long number of years, that the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish imposes an unjustifiable strain, not only on the teachers, but upon the pupils and, perhaps, in this matter we should consider most seriously the effect on the children.  There is a strain imposed on them which is altogether unjustifiable.  Children attending a national school from the age of five, six or seven have to learn one language in their homes, and when they go to school they are immediately introduced to an entirely new language.  In the <Col N="678" /> ordinary course of events it is difficult enough for children to acquire all the subjects which they are expected to acquire in the primary schools, to learn how to read, and write, and to acquire a knowledge of arithmetic and other subjects, including religious instruction. All that imposes a heavy strain on the nerves and minds of children in the earliest stages of development.  To add to it we have the crazy attempt to force on children of a tender age what is to them an entirely new language.  That is becoming more and more evident to everybody who has experience in this matter.  I have spoken to teachers who were some years ago extremely keen and enthusiastic about the teaching of Irish, and were prepared to take steps, no matter how drastic, in order to have the language spoken by children in the schools.  They are beginning to realise that it is a hopeless and a futile task, and is defeating the real ends of education.  It is not adding in any way to the national spirit of our youth.  The young generation of to-day are not more patriotic than any generation brought up at a time when this country was under British rule.  Very little time can be found in our educational system to inculcate in the minds of our young people a really true and patriotic outlook.  There are many branches of educational instruction which would tend to give our young people a sense of pride in their country, but no time can be found for such study.  A good knowledge of history, a good knowledge of local history, of national songs and poems, would all help to turn the minds of our youth in the right direction, but unfortunately no real effort is being made at the present time, because the programme of our schools has been overtaxed by this effort to force a second language on them.  I have not met any children who can carry on a conversation in Irish.  What is the use of all the strife and all the hardship that is being inflicted upon our teachers and our children when it ends in futility and in failure, at least, as far as the overwhelming majority of primary school children are concerned? When I say that efforts should be made to inspire our young people with a good healthy national outlook, I hope these efforts will not be directed in the <Col N="679" /> future, as they have often been in the past, in the direction of inspiring our young people with a purely party outlook.</P>
    <P>Happening to have a few minutes to spare last week I went into a cinema to see the film, <i>A Nation Once Again.</i> I had heard and read in the Press favourable comments on that film, and I thought it would be of outstanding value and interest.  I was amazed and astonished to find that there was practically nothing about Thomas Davis in the film.  The only brief moment in which Thomas Davis appears is when three young men in old-fashioned dress, probably the dress of the period, appear in the Phoenix Park and then disappear.  Presumably one of the three was Thomas Davis.  That was the only occasion in which Davis was introduced into the film, but the Taoiseach appears in full size and his voice is heard ringing throughout a large portion of the film.  What was the object or purpose of the picture? Was it to teach our people something about the Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>The original intention for which the money was provided was to educate our young people in the history of the eventful period of the Young Irelanders, but the film failed absolutely in that respect, and did not make any real attempt to give any idea of the struggle that Thomas Davis embarked upon, or what he achieved during his lifetime.  It would seem from the film that all that Thomas Davis succeeded in achieving was putting Éamon de Valera into power and making him the mouthpiece of this nation.  That is one matter which should make us feel rather sceptical about entrusting anything in connection with educational matters, and particularly matters of national importance, to the present Department of Education.  I believe it is true that, if we had an educational council, it would not permit such a one-sided piece of Party propaganda to be foisted on the people in the guise of an educational <Col N="680" /> film.  There are some Ministers in this Government who have made great mistakes.</P>

      <P>All the Ministers have made some mistakes, but the Minister for Education has never succeeded in making anything but mistakes.  He has wandered from blunder to blunder over a long period, and, by his incompetence, has aroused the feelings of our people with regard to education to a pitch which, I think, has never been reached before.  The people are indignant with regard to the manner in which the education of our young people is being administered, and they feel grievously alarmed that such an important service, upon which the entire future of our nation depends, should be bungled and mismanaged by an inept and stupid Minister.  There is only one remedy, in my opinion, for this situation, that is, to get rid of the Minister for Education, and that is why I wholeheartedly support the motion to refer this Estimate back.</P>
      <P>A great deal of money has been spent on education for a number of years, and through want of co-ordination, through want of consideration, through lack of vision, that money has to a large extent been wasted.  The Vocational Organisation Commission has been forced to admit that our standard of education is lower than it has been for many years, and those of us who have passed middle age know, from practical experience, that the standard of education to-day is lower than it was in our schooldays.  It is not due to any failure on the part of the teachers; it is not due to any deterioration in the standard of intelligence of our young people; it is not due to any failure on the part of the parents.  It is due entirely to an ill-considered, ill-directed and ill-devised system of education, and it is about time this House demanded that a more competent Minister be appointed.</P>

      <P>On this Vote I should like to direct my remarks completely and entirely to the teachers' strike.  In doing so, I am leaving behind me a very fertile field which <Col N="681" /> demands great investigation and exploration of the type which the last Deputy who spoke has referred to.  We spend almost £6,000,000 on the various Votes with the administration of which the Minister is charged, and there is scarcely one of these in respect of which a great deal of good might not be done if we had time, free from financial worries of certain people, to discuss education as such and its radiation through the various branches, and if we also did not feel ourselves, on each occasion on which these Votes come before the House at this time of the year, bewildered, defeated and frustrated by the heavy, dreary incapacity of the present Minister.</P>
      <P>One would have liked to have searched this Estimate and to find out whether the allocation made for secondary education has really borne the fruit which such expenditure should bear.  One would like to discuss the position of university education in this country and compare its lamentably derelict state with the improvements which are taking place everywhere else throughout the world, and even to deviate into the minor branches of education to see whether, if at all, any improvement has been made in the fashioning of people in so far as they can be fashioned through an educational process, since this Minister took over.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cogan that until the sleepy hollow, which really is the best metaphor for the Department, is broken up by some sort of physical attack, there is not really much chance of getting any improvement made.  One finds it impossible to speak against the heavy slumbers of the present Minister &mdash;maintained not merely here in the Dáil but throughout the whole of his so-called working year.  The teachers' strike, however, occupies such a place in the minds of the people, particularly of this city, to-day, that every other problem, I think, must be put aside in order to have it discussed.</P>
      <P>The Minister devoted about a page of his lengthy speech here yesterday to this matter:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately, other counsels prevailed culminating in a position whereby 30,000 or 40,000 pupils of <Col N="682" /> primary schools in Dublin have now been deprived of nine weeks' schooling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am rather glad that he used the word &ldquo;schooling&rdquo;.  I suppose it was used advisedly.  Pupils to the number of 30,000 or 40,000 have been deprived of what he calls schooling.  That is not the problem.  There may be 30,000 to 40,000 school children at present roaming the streets, but the Minister knows that does not end the situation, even if he is to count heads.  He must know that there are at least 30,000 extra who are going to school but not receiving at the moment anything like the type of education they should be getting, because of the lack of co-ordination which there is in the schools at the moment&mdash;the fact that the staffs are disturbed, the fact that the classes are undermined and also the fact that the children who stay away from school are a grave temptation to those who might get some schooling if they attended the places which are still open.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know very well there are somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 of the people now wandering the streets who should be getting the last five or six weeks of education that they will ever get in their lives, and even if this dispute were to end now, they will have been deprived of the last finishing touches which schools can possibly give to such people.  He must know that many avenues for employment in this city open for the thousands who come of an age to go into employment and who must go into employment, are blocked and will be blocked because these children will not have obtained a particular certificate.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of irremediable harm which the Minister, by his very attitude, has worked upon at least that group of the people who are now out. In addition, the Minister must know that the results of this strike will go much further than anything that can be put before the public by merely talking of the number of people who are not out, and even by adding on the folk to whom I have referred, those who are getting a definitely distorted and disturbed type of education at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> The Minister will, no doubt, remember that at the time when Crumlin was being built, and when there was a period in which certain people had been moved to the outskirts of the city to the new housing settlement in Crumlin, the schools at which their children were attending were still in the city itself and there was a weary period of waiting before the schools out there were built and equipped. The children were supposed to travel into the city to attend the schools there, but for the most part the bulk of them did not do so; and I think it is within the Minister's cognisance that the teachers who applied for preference in the Crumlin schools lived to regret their decision to go there.  During that two or three months' disorder in the educational field those children became so demoralised that they were practically beyond control.  What is going to be the situation if, after a lapse of another nine weeks and then a long vacation period occurring, the schools reopen and we have the children, who are now wandering the streets, going back to sit under and receive their schooling from teachers whom they have probably seen parading the city streets with strike banners?</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that, to a great extent, the position of authority which a teacher occupies and which he must occupy if he is to control his class is one of place.  Children are taught to regard a teacher as being definitely on a higher level than they are themselves. They almost more or less idealise the teacher.  That aura is shattered now and I do not know how the children of the present generation&mdash;the children of the last five or six years who are now grouped together in the schools&mdash; are ever going to recover their faith and respect in their teachers whom they have seen parading the streets and outside their schools with strike notices, just as if they were shop assistants. I think nobody can but recognise the seriousness of that situation I shudder to think of the effect on the children themselves, on their parents, and on the community as a whole of the gap that has been created&mdash;almost <Col N="684" /> as if a war had come&mdash;and which is never going to be filled in the stream of people who should be now flowing out from the schools with whatever education the schools can give them. That is a gap in their lives which for some of them can never be filled owing to this lamentable dispute.  How did the dispute arise?</P>
    <P>The Minister again in a few phrases last night said that &ldquo;the discussions with the teachers continued for some months&rdquo;.  A Deputy in this House last night characterised the Minister's propaganda as misleading.  I think that was a well chosen word.  The phrases the Minister used last night were aimed at being misleading in some way.  What were the discussions that went on for some months?  The Minister, as far as I understand, met the teachers in November and presented them with the framework of a scheme.  While it can be said that on two subsequent occasions certain small additions were made to moneys that were offered to them the framework of the scheme was never altered.  There was haggling, like the haggling that takes place at a fair, as to whether £10 or £15 should be the addition made for a junior assistant mistress, and for some other grades. But the scheme thought out without any contact with the teachers, with the parents, or with the ecclesiastical authorities in the city is still solely the Minister's scheme.  There were no negotiations.  There was no suggestion made at any time from November last to the teachers that the scheme of categories and the attachments to it could be changed in any way.  The only change that was made was in the addition of some small amount of money. Strangely enough, the Minister boasts that the final offer to the teachers was made at that third meeting.  Was the Minister buying cattle at a fair?  Was he carefully considering the serious position of the teachers in the community as a group of special value? Had he made up his mind that there was an injustice that had to be rectified and had he given some thought to how great the injustice was and how far he could go in the rectification of it?  Why had we a first and a second and a final offer?  If the teachers had <Col N="685" /> accepted the first offer would the Minister have given them more?  Does not the whole thing bear the clear imprint of haggling; and a haggling that was not conducted, either on the grounds of the position that the teachers found themselves in relative to the cost of living and to the services that they render or to the Minister's view as to how their position could be changed for the better, but simply because there was a Department of Finance which said: &ldquo;You can spend so much; go to your conference and keep a bit in reserve?&rdquo; That is the ordinary haggling that takes place in the market place.</P>
    <P>The Minister now stands solidly on what he calls his final offer.  That final offer would have been the amount that was first offered had the teachers been unwise enough to take it.  Deputy Larkin by a question here in the House tried to secure from the Minister certain figures.  They are within the Minister's knowledge and the Minister can let us have them.  They are necessary if people are to discuss this matter and if they are to discuss it on the merits.  The Minister told us that the present offer represents an advance of £1,250,000 over the 1938 scale.  Why we should go back to the 1938 scale I do not know.  Why we make a comparison with the 1938 scale instead of merely being told what extra money would be required over and above what is being paid now I do not know.  As far as I can make out the figures, they are these: £1,250,000, even on the 1938 scale, is not, of course, accepted, but taking it as a starting-off ground, the Minister knows that there is a bonus which will lapse if and when the new offer, measured on the 1938 scale, comes into force and that bonus represents something between £450,000 and £500,000.  In answer to Deputy Larkin, we were told that £200,000 odd was earmarked for capitation.  If the £1,250,000 is a correct figure the new money to go to the teachers is something short of £600,000.  The Minister can tell us exactly what the figure is and I suggest this House is entitled to get that figure.  I hope that he will give it to us when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister in his speech says that the Government is acting as <Col N="686" /> a mediator between the community as a whole who have to pay whatever taxes are required to maintain public services, and the claims of the teachers.  The word &ldquo;mediator&rdquo; has been used in a connection to which I shall refer later.  The Minister's view of mediation strikes one, to put it mildly, as being somewhat peculiar. The Minister is mediating between, he says, the teachers and the community, who pay the taxes.  I should have thought that the first people who would spring to mind in connection with mediation would be either the parents or the managers, who appoint and may dismiss teachers, or a group of managers, or such a person as the Archbishop of Dublin, who may be regarded as personifying the managers, or even a representative group of parents, teachers, managers and perhaps Deputies of this House who also act in a certain representative capacity.  None of these at any time was called in.  The Minister was, in fact, mediating between himself and the teachers.  Surely it is a ludicrous application of the term &ldquo;mediation&rdquo;. Surely it is ludicrous to apply the term &ldquo;mediator&rdquo; to a man whose main task has been to refuse what, so far as the public Press shows, those mainly interested in this matter are inclined and willing to give.  I have not got the exact amount here, but to those who read the papers it is quite clear that the various local authorities, certain county councils, many of the urban councils, many of the vocational organisations and many of the trade unions have all passed resolutions in favour of the teachers.</P>
    <P>I do not know, I said before and I repeat, of any strike which has commanded the approval of so many prominent individuals as this strike has. I do not know if one name can be suggested to me as a person of prominence who has written to the newspapers applauding the Ministerial stand in this matter.  As far as I know, from my reading of the Press, those vocal in this matter, and they are a very wide group and a very representative body of people, have all written to the papers and expressed themselves as in sympathy with the teachers.  The Minister  <Col N="687" /> uses the word &ldquo;mediate&rdquo; with regard to his attitude of saying that the last word has been said, that this matter has been finally determined as far as the Government are concerned and that it is no good anybody, school attendance people, the Dublin Corporation, the Archbishop of Dublin, approaching us about this; we have finished with it.</P>
    <P>Again, the course of this matter is one to be looked at and it is of interest when it is regarded in the way in which I would like to have it put before the House.  Often in this country we have suffered from strikes and very often the body of strikers have found themselves very definitely up against a strong public opinion.  Public opinion, when it settles against those who are on strike, does so after considering a variety of matters.  One is&mdash;and it is a matter that causes great irritation at times&mdash;whether the strike is one that is called of the lightning variety or whether the public have been given formal and lengthy notice that there might be a dispute.  Another matter that the public often think of is, who has the merits.  One of the objections commonly voiced to what is called the lightning strike is that when a strike takes place under those circumstances the public have no opportunity of discovering what are the merits and on which side they lie.  A third matter that often intrigues the public in connection with an industrial strike is, who shows himself, of the two parties, most inclined to reason; is one party simply sticking to its guns and is the other open to conciliation or arbitration? Finally, when the public are allowed to judge, public opinion does form around whatever is the point at issue.  When they hear the arguments on both sides, they try to make up their own mind where the merits lie and add to that which of the two parties has behaved in a way conducive to the public weal.</P>
    <P>Add all these things together in this strike and is there any doubt on which side the decision must lie?  The teachers forewarned the Minister by many months as to what they intended to do.  They brought their position before him year after year.  They <Col N="688" /> brought it to a head about July of last year.  They waited for offers.  They met the Minister several times and they finally told the Minister that it was their proposal to take a referendum of their members on a particular question. There was no hint of a lightning strike about that, no question of rushing out immediately to try to take the other party at a disadvantage by moving at a particular time when it would be inconvenient and most embarrassing to the other party.  Where are the merits of this matter?  One party at least has argued the merits.  One party has put forward its views.  They have asked that a variety of things be taken into consideration &mdash; the depreciated value of the £, the lives that they live, the conditions of their work, the way in which their emoluments depend upon an inspection and a grading as a result of an inspection. They told the Minister of the serious aggravation amongst their members through the very unfair and ancient discrimination as between unmarried men and women.  Every item of their case has been put before the public in a way which leaves the public fully understanding what are the points of dispute.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's contribution? The last word has been said; as far as we, the Government, are concerned, the matter is finally determined.  No more argument.  Finally, when moved by the various considerations that I think would have swayed the community as a whole, the Archbishop of Dublin moved himself on to the stage, the Minister showed that while the teachers were ready to submit their case to any investigation, the attitude of the Government was that they would submit it to no investigation.  One hesitates to speak of the Archbishop of Dublin in this connection.  It has been mentioned in the House, and it has struck many people outside, that members of the present Government have a talent for rebuffing members of their own Church.</P>
    <P>One is reminded of the story of the little girl who was shown the picture of the lions with the Christians in the arena and was discovered crying, not because of the Christians, but because there was one lion that had not got a <Col N="689" /> Christian.  I would like to see a picture of the present Government and the members of the Hierarchy before them and think of the tears that would be shed because there is some Minister who has not yet rebuffed and insulted some member of the Church.  The Archbishop of Dublin knew the fate that had befallen two members of his Church&mdash;not merely rebuffs, but rebuffs administered with a particular type of incivility and bad manners that aggravated the simple rebuff that might have been given.  The Archbishop of Dublin moved himself on to the stage. He wrote to the teachers pointing out to the executive:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;how acceptable it would be to all parties concerned, if the children could return to school, pending a satisfactory settlement of your difficulties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Note the obligation that that letter put upon the teachers.  It meant that he said to them, if there is a deadlock and if you are one of the chief locks in the deadlock, let you remove one thing, break the deadlock, send the children back to school.  That was pending a settlement of the difficulties and the response was immediate.  The teachers would go back and hope to find the children there.  The condition was that the case would be reopened:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and that your Grace be accepted to act as mediator between the Government and the teachers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Archbishop replied to that, accepting that, thanking the teachers for their response and saying this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo; I am very sensible of the tribute that you pay to the Church and to the See of Dublin in assessing so accurately the position of the Teaching Church in education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is notable that he did that and I want to mark the contrast between the Archbishop's tribute to the teachers for their recognition of the position of the Teaching Church in education and what the Government afterwards said.  The Archbishop further said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your words leave no doubt in any mind that you, yourselves, correctly estimate the dignity of the profession, in which you are the lawful <Col N="690" /> delegates of the Church and the parents.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having put the position in that way&mdash; and I do not think anybody is going to challenge that as a proper way to put it &mdash;the Archbishop came to this point:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am, indeed, prepared to mediate if I am accepted; but you will allow me to say at this stage that the position of a mediator would in justice require that I give to both sides the most complete hearing.  Further, to mediate requires a willing, full acceptance by both parties.  And both parties must be left entirely free.  Lest then, while expressing my willingness to accept your gracious invitation to act as mediator on the terms which I have stated, I should, by any personal approach to the Government, have even the appearance of wishing to bring any pressure to bear upon the Government, I would venture to suggest that your executive should consider submitting to the Government for its decision all our correspondence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter is, if one may say it without impertinence, marked, first of all, by a clear statement of the position; and, secondly, it was a remarkable effort, as it was phrased.  Both parties were to be free.  Nothing might come of the matter, in connection with financial betterment or a change for the better in the teachers' position on the many points they had raised; but one thing was certain, that the teachers were going back to the schools and the children could have continued their education.  The Government's answer is that it would be wrong.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The final proposals represented the maximum sum which, in the Government's considered opinion, the community as a whole could, without detriment to the public welfare, be asked to provide in taxation for the improvement of the primary teachers' salaries.  No further concession can, therefore, be made.</P>
    <P>This being the position, no good purpose would be served by further discussion such as is implied in any suggestion of mediation.</P>
    <P>The Government understand fully <Col N="691" /> that the effect on the children of the continuance of the strike must be a source of anxiety to His Grace the Archbishop, as it is to themselves, and they appreciate His Grace's intimation that he is prepared to act as mediator.  It would, however, in the Government's view, be wrong to invite His Grace to mediate in an issue which, so far as they are concerned, has already been decided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The teachers gave warning of their position, they waited on the Government at any time when the Government received them to talk this matter over, they gave full notice that a referendum was being taken on whether they should go on strike or not and the Department knew the seriousness of the position as it was developing.  The teachers went on strike after a clear cut call from their members to do so; and when they were on strike they got the approval of nearly all important persons who thought they should write to the newspapers about the matter. Finally, when the Archbishop of Dublin approached them, asking them if they would take the first step to resolve the deadlock, they said: &ldquo;Yes, we will go back to school and let the children come to us, and in the meantime the Archbishop of Dublin will mediate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government make great play of the fact that there are two sides to this problem.  If the teachers get more money, more taxes will have to be imposed on the people and more suffering brought on an already overtaxed community.  That would be a proper argument or consideration to put before the people, if a mediator offered himself who had not that in mind and who was of such a type that he could not appreciate that consideration. Would anybody say that his Grace the Archbishop of Dublin is not capable of understanding the balance that has to be kept as between taxation on one side and the emoluments of the teachers on the other?  Is his Grace the type of man who would give a decision without giving that as much consideration as it deserves?  Is he a man so completely remote from public affairs that he would fail to appreciate <Col N="692" /> that that was the situation?  Is he a man of so little judgment that it can be thought that any decision coming from him in this matter would fail to have taken all the points that might be put before him and balanced them one against another?  In any event, what was the harm in having the matter argued out once more, under the chairmanship of a person who would have commanded everybody's respect as he heard the matter and everybody's approval of his judgment in whatever he recommended?  But mediation has been turned down.</P>
    <P>I have here a volume of speeches very much publicised through the country&mdash;&ldquo;Peace and War: Speeches by Mr. de Valera on International Affairs&rdquo;.  One of these is a great speech delivered at the time of the Abyssinian crisis and I remember cynically saying to myself as I read that speech that it was all very well for a representative of a small nation, which was not going to suffer much harm out of the Abyssinian struggle, to approach all the big nations, who were going to bear the brunt of any difficulties that arose, in the way in which the Taoiseach did.  His words got a flattering reception.  Amongst other things, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why cannot the nations put into the enterprises of peace the energy they are prepared to squander in the futility and frightfulness of war? Yesterday there were no finances to give the workless the opportunity of earning their bread; to-morrow, money unlimited will be found to provide for the manufacture of instruments of destruction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I stop at that quotation?  We can find money here to keep an army at twice the strength and twice the cost it was in 1938.  For what?  We are going to buy munitions of war&mdash;what munitions of war and what use will they be, if any war hits us in the next year?  In the Minister's own Estimate, we are going to have a new School of Cosmic Physics one of these days, but we cannot find money to pay teachers. We are going to have a new radio station to let the world know of the culture of this country.  Will we broadcast, <Col N="693" /> as an advertisement of our culture, the salary scales that we have given the teachers for so long and the improvement, measured in 1938 coinage, which the new scales will give to them, if they accept them and tie themselves to them for three years?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why can we not, in the spirit of justice, deal with wrongs when we perceive them?  Not every demand for change deserves to be listened to, it is true, but must we wait until the wronged has risen up in armed revolt before we grant him the redress to which we know he is entitled?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he spoke of economic problems, and continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will our conversatism, the natural philosophy of those who have and are concerned only to retain&mdash; will this conservatism give its consent and deem the time ripe only when the slaughter has begun?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And finally we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are adjustments never to be made but at the expense of the weak?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Supposing this strike goes on for a half-year and the teachers are beaten; supposing their finances cannot stand the strain and they go back, are we going to get good education from them?  Are they going to be efficient in the management of their schools?  Can we close our eyes to the fact that, as human beings, they will be deeply resentful of the treatment they have received and that they will not be as enthusiastic as they might have been if they got a return to teaching under new conditions?  Is the Government simply relying on this, that in the end they must prove stronger and the teachers prove weaker?  If that is so, might we not listen to what the Taoiseach said, as far away as Geneva is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are adjustments never to be made but at the expense of the weak?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The speech continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why cannot the Peace Conference which will meet in Europe when the next conflict has decimated <Col N="694" /> the nations, and disaster and exhaustion have tamed some of them into temporary submission&mdash;why cannot this conference be convened now, when calm reason might have a chance to bring the nations into friendly co-operation and a lasting association of mutual help?</P>
    <P>What is our position?  I do not want to associate myself with it, and should say, what is the position of the Government? Are they going to wait until exhaustion tames the teachers, tames them into temporary submission and then ask them to go back, ask them to continue the work that everybody in this House has praised, by paying lip-service to it&mdash;the great work of educating the young people of our community, the people on whom we are to depend if this nation is to survive. Are we to wait until, as I say, exhaustion brings them into temporary submission?  The Taoiseach was very eloquent at Geneva about calm reason. Could there be calmer reason, or a calmer atmosphere, for a reasoned decision on this whole difficulty than that which was offered by the Archbishop of Dublin?  Why could not the Minister for Education hearken to what his leader said at Geneva?  As I have said, it was easy for the leader of a small nation at Geneva to speak that way in connection with matters in which he was not going to have to bear any hardship if the conflict broke out.  I think a cynical view expressed at that time was that he might not have been so sweet in his language if this country was likely to be involved in a struggle, but that cynicism is justified now.  Here we have a dispute at home.  Here is a dispute in which certain elements in our community are in conflict, and the only way found of resolving it is for one party to say that &ldquo;the last word has been spoken; you go back to your schools&rdquo;, while the other party, which gets public support openly for its members, accepts the only offer of mediation that has been put before the community, and against that it simply gets this wall of obstinacy&mdash;this attitude which says &ldquo;we have said our last word and nobody is going to make us unsay it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In international circles, after the <Col N="695" /> 1914-18 war, there was the story of a statesman who came from one of the outlying countries and who got a tremendous advantage over a natural handicap that he suffered from.  He came to the international conference almost stone deaf.  He supplied himself with one of those machines which sometimes people who are hard of hearing get great advantage from.  He could switch the machine on and off from time to time.  When it was switched off he was impervious to argument because no one could reach his hearing.  That looked to be a great situation.  He sat there and people battered themselves fruitlessly against that particular situation because they could get no entry into his mind.  But the end was not so good.  People got tired of the merely mulish attitude that he adopted, they got irritated at his behaviour.  It can be seen from the records of the conference that his nation did not do so well as it might have done had he come down into the ordinary field of discussion, made his case there and tried to get international public opinion behind it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in that mood, that he will not listen.  He will not listen to argument any further, and will not let anybody else listen to argument on this matter.  The last word has been said, and the teachers' strike must go on until they are tamed and brought into submission.  Is that the example that we want to set elsewhere, the way in which we are to conduct disputes here at home?  Does the Minister want his example to be taken up by the trade unions here if they should come into conflict with any body of employers? His attitude, in face of the efforts of a distinguished Churchman, does not bring any credit on himself or on his Government.  Behind all that, does the Minister fail to see those swarms of children around the streets failing to get that little bit of education that the Constitution has so gallantly promised them, and failing to get it in the way that public opinion has already decided, and all because the Minister is afraid to meet the teachers in the open forum where the matter could be fairly debated, or even to have the case submitted behind closed doors to arbitration <Col N="696" /> to distinguished men that this country has produced.  He can come along and say that he may possibly bring the teachers to their knees although the signs are not that way yet.  The Minister and those who vote with him in this particular matter will sometime hence live to regret the day that they supported the Minister's obstinacy in this very difficult matter, with one party showing itself ready to discuss the matter under any auspices, and the Government simply saying that the matter is settled and that they cannot meet anyone.</P>

      <P>I rise chiefly for the purpose of thanking the Minister and the Department of Education for their consideration, and for the dispatch with which a number of schools have been built in the County Meath.  They come next to the homes in building up the foundations of the country.  As long as the homes are happy and contented we are likely to have good citizens.  The school comes after the home and, therefore, I want to say again that I am indeed grateful to the Minister and his Department for the efforts they have made to provide what well may be described as secondary homes&mdash;for that is really what the schools are.  Many of these schools were built during the recent period when materials were extremely scarce and when it was very difficult to procure them.  That shows the human feeling of the Department of Education. Every effort was strained to get these schools erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the idea that I might know something about education, but somehow or other since I came into the House this afternoon I got completely confused.  Deputy McGilligan spoke about the fertile field that he could not touch.  He was so completely absorbed in something that really did not affect him that he had to leave the subject of education entirely out of his speech.  Deputy Cogan said that education was rapidly deteriorating and had gone back completely.  I may not know anything at all about education, but I certainly do know something about sanitary houses and schools. Things cannot be right until we make a supreme effort to build good schools. <Col N="697" /> In the past many of them were hovels. In fact, in my own parish, up to a month ago, the children were in what was worse than a hovel.  It was most insanitary.  It had no sanitary conveniences at all.  Health, of course, is fundamental, and as far as that part of their policy is concerned, the Minister and his Department are quite sound in what they are doing.  Since I came into the House this evening I have been convinced that the Minister is sound in his policy, even in reference to the strike.  There is no other policy that could be pursued.  I wonder is there any man in the House who knows more about that than Deputy McGilligan does?  He stood up here this evening and revealed that he knew all those facts.  If we were to start off and take political chances, where, I wonder, are we going to get?  Suppose the Minister did agree and did give more than the £350 each to the teachers?  I understand that that is the average payment&mdash;£350.  Suppose he gave all that was asked, I wonder what Deputy McGilligan would say. Who would be the arch-enemy then? As members of the Dáil, we should view these things very seriously.  The Government are responsible for the expenditure of public moneys.</P>
    <P>We are going through an extremely dangerous time&mdash;a time which is likely to be extremely severe on us as a people.  No doubt, there has been inflation and, if I were a teacher, I should do my best to get a high salary now.  Most people would do the same. This is the time to get such a salary. If inflation collapses, the high salaries will remain.  The teachers are quite wise to get all they can.  But that would not entitle the Minister to agree to all that they ask.  That is his responsibility.  We might as well be honest about the matter.  I know of no volume of opinion in the country in favour of the teachers.  In fact, I did not even hear the matter mentioned.  I see no signs of such opinion in the City of Dublin. The children may be wandering around.  I presume they are, but, in passing through the city, I did not notice them.  If they are, it is a pity and, to tell the truth, I do not know whom to blame.  Certainly I could not <Col N="698" /> blame the Department of Education. It is not their method and it is not their system.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the idea is of all the propaganda and talk.  My candid opinion is that but for a lot of that nonsense the matter would have been settled.  Since we commenced to debate this Vote I do not think that we did anything to help the teachers. The Opposition have done an enormous amount to damage them and it is not fair to the teachers to do that.  Those who started on this stunt know that perfectly well.  I have the greatest sympathy with the teachers.  They have a severe task.  I mentioned the figure of £350, but I know that there are young teachers who have very poor salaries.  Even with that £350 as the average, they might still have poor salaries.  But they are beginners.  The next question is: how much more can the State afford to pay?  The Minister for Finance realised that the State could not afford the rate of income-tax which was being charged and reduced it by 1/- in the £.  Is that not an advantage to the teachers?  Do they not pay income-tax?</P>

      <P>I have the right to say it.  Is it not a fact?  That really amounts to an increase of salary.  If we are able to continue that, with the increase they have already been offered, I think that they will be reasonably treated.  I do not know much about city life.  I know that many middle-class people were hard pressed during the recent war and are still hard pressed.  I know very well that a great many farmers are hard pressed and that farm workers are hard pressed.  Many farmers and farm labourers regard the salaries of the teachers as enormously high&mdash;sums of which they can only dream.  Even if we could afford it, there must be some degree of comparison and some relationship between what the ordinary member of the public receives and what others receive.  It is all a clear indication to the teachers that there is not much public opinion throughout the country in their favour.  To be honest about it, there are not a lot of teachers in the country who favour it.</P>

      <P>Those are the facts.  I honestly and candidly admit that we do a bad service to the teachers when we talk in this way.  I believe that there are young teachers who are poorly paid.  I believe that there are teachers in the City of Dublin who are not too well paid.  However, the sum total of the amount given out is very great.  The rest depends on the machinery of distribution.  I doubt if the teachers' executive had not some hand in the distribution of that sum and, if they had, no blame attaches to the Government.  As regards teachers with families in the City of Dublin, the main contention has been that the cost of living of those teachers&mdash;generally senior teachers&mdash;is miles ahead of that of others.  I do not think that that is the case at all.  I think that the cost of living of teachers with families in the country&mdash;the maintenance and up-bringing of the children&mdash;is higher than it would be here in Dublin.  Those teachers have no facilities for the further education of their children in the country districts.  They may have to send their children away to school. What does it cost them to do so?  What does it cost them in boots and clothes <Col N="700" /> when the children have to go along muddy roads to school and when there are no facilities for drying their clothes?  When they leave school, if they cannot get a professional position, what chance have they of getting them employed in any business or of getting them apprenticed?  If such a teacher's child gets 5/- a week and maintenance away from home, how can it carry on? In the case of the teacher living in the city, that means an increase of 5/- in the family income.  There are many opportunities for the child of the teacher in the city which are not open to the child of the teacher in the country. If we were honest, we would turn it the other way, while taking into consideration a certain number of the younger teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is to judge of that?  Business people who employ those children are able to hazard a guess on the matter.  All I could gather from them was that education was too hurried and that the fundamentals were not being properly attended to.  The trouble is not that the programme is overloaded.  The fact is that there is a rush to get children through school at an earlier age than was usual.  The trouble is due to excessive anxiety to further the interests of the children and advance them.  I think really what happened was that they did not get time enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One excellent system, which is fundamental to education, is medical <Col N="701" /> inspection.  That has been carried out in recent times in a very satisfactory way and it will be carried out even more intensively in the future.  If a child is to have any chance, he must have good health and when every precaution is taken to see that he has good health, he will then have an excellent chance of getting a good education. After that comes the question of discipline in the schools.  If we are to have a disciplined nation, the children must be taught discipline in the schools.  Whether the &ldquo;rumpus&rdquo; started here is conducive to that I cannot say.  I regret that it has started and I am afraid it will not be conducive to the necessary discipline.  I hope that when this debate has concluded, a better atmosphere will have been created and that we shall see a more helpful attitude towards the teachers.  I sympathise with them thoroughly.  Through some miscalculation or other, they took on a task in which they could not possibly succeed.  I think the best thing this House could do is to show them sympathy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the strike took place, the matter was taken out of the hands of the Minister and the Taoiseach was put in the saddle.  The Taoiseach and the Government, and not the Minister, are responsible for the situation which now confronts the House&mdash; for the fact that so many children are roaming the streets of the city to-day. I disagree with Deputy McGilligan and other Deputies in blaming the Minister for everything that has gone on. Deputy O'Reilly agreed that it was a matter for the Government.  I wonder whether he inquired from his two teacher colleagues the reason they are on strike.  There are two teacher-members of his Party amongst those on strike and there are about eight teachers altogether who are members of the Government Party.  Surely it is not possible that these teachers would go on strike without some grave reason?  I hope that before this debate concludes, while the merits of the case are up for consideration of the House, both the Deputies concerned will <Col N="703" /> give Deputy O'Reilly the real reasons why they are on strike.</P>
      <P>I have heard the Government described under many titles.  I have heard supporters of the Government claim that it was a farmers' Government and a workers' Government and I have heard it described as a teachers' Government.  The proof of that, if any proof is needed, is that if Deputies look up the first advertisement inserted in the daily papers by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation after the strike was started, they will find&mdash;I was amazed myself&mdash;the claim made that they were the people who put this Government into office. I suppose they are being repaid for their services now.  They make that claim and Deputy O'Briain can say whether it is true or not, that were it not for them the Government would not be in office, with a professor, an old teacher, as head of the Government, and another old teacher as Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is undoubtedly the person primarily responsible for the continuance of the strike.  I am sure if the Taoiseach who is all-powerful in the Party, who dominates the Party, with the other teachers in the Party, the Minister included, made up his mind to accept the advice and assistance that was so unselfishly offered by his Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, within 24 hours the teachers would be back in their schools and the children would be benefiting by the instruction received from the teachers who are now on strike.  There is not a shadow of doubt about that and the majority of parents in the City of Dublin know that perfectly well. Nobody else but the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I may tell Deputy O Briain that if the Fianna Fáil Government accepts the title of being a teachers' Government, it is a most extraordinary thing that it took them 14 years to wake up and to realise that the teachers were entitled to something. It was only on the eve of a threatened strike that they showed any desire to consider the question at all.  I see nothing extraordinary in what is being offered to the teachers. If I had any responsibility for advising the teachers in this matter, on the first occasion when the proposals were submitted to the negotiating committee, I would advise that they should be turned down for one reason&mdash;that there were too many grades and groups involved in the whole scheme.  I invite the Minister to say whether that scheme was deliberately devised for the purpose of putting teachers or groups of teachers against other teachers or groups of teachers, causing disunity and demoralisation, with consequential bad results to the profession and to the children who are entrusted to them for their education. I have never heard in my life of such a small body of workers having to be separated into so many groups.  Deputy O'Higgins, I think, said there were 66 groups, Deputy Keyes said there were close on 40, and the Minister contradicted him.</P>

      <P>Not a bit to do with it. The Minister in his introductory statement gave you that information. The Minister submitted the proposals and during the negotiations which took place subsequently never changed the framework of the proposals.  What is the idea, at any rate, of having 40 or 66 groups?  Surely the whole matter could be dealt with by having five or six groups.  I saw that tried on the railwaymen as far back as 1922, and the people who were trying it on at that period, although there were about 20,000 railway workers as compared with 12,000 teachers, got their answer very quickly.  Is this policy deliberately framed for the purpose of dividing the teachers, one group against another, with the bad consequences that are bound to flow from such a silly policy?  I also cannot understand the people who defend these as generous proposals for the teachers, particularly in the City of Dublin, where the cost of living is so much higher than in other parts of the country. Is it not a fact that, if you take the purchasing power of the £ to-day as compared with 1938, the Minister's proposals are worth less to-day from the point of view of purchasing power than the salaries the teachers were receiving in 1938?  Is not that enough to condemn the whole scheme and to induce the Minister to take the matter back for further and more favourable consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed, I may be misinformed of course, that the majority vote in favour of the strike was mainly brought about as a result of the almost unanimous votes of the women teachers because the Government did not agree to pay them the same salaries as the male teachers.  I have heard the case for equal pay for women and men argued in many industrial disputes around many tables, but I know of no class of workers who could make as good a case for equal pay for doing the same kind of work as the women teachers in this country.  Is it not a fact that the woman teacher is teaching additional subjects?  Without any reflection on the overwhelming majority of the men teachers, I may say it is taken for granted by the parents of the children in many areas <Col N="706" /> that the woman teacher pays more attention to the needs of the children in the school than perhaps some, at any rate, of the male teachers.  As I say, I do not want to cast any reflection on any of the male teachers when I say that.  I am expressing a point of view which I have heard on many occasions, particularly since this dispute started.  I should like to hear the argument of the Minister on behalf of the Government as to why that claim is not being conceded.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly said there was no sympathy in the country, so far as he knew, for the teachers on strike.  That may be the outlook of people who suffer from an inferiority complex or of certain people who never like to see anybody getting more than themselves. But if the Minister will read the very able and eloquent address delivered on the question of wages and the Church point of view in connection with the rights of workers by his Lordship the Most Rev. Dr. Browne, Bishop of Galway, last week, I think if he follows the advice of his Lordship he will change his attitude and the attitude of the Government in this matter.  Deputy O'Reilly, of course, as a farmer Deputy, is worrying in case the country will be burst if the teachers get another pound added on to their salaries.  That kind of mentality was not displayed from the Government Benches in connection with other matters. There was no talk of that when it was a question, not alone of doubling but of trebling the cost of the Army during the emergency period. That kind of argument was not used when, through the instrumentality of the Budget, we all know that the subsidy to be provided to enable turf to be sold at 54/- per ton in the non-turf areas will have to be increased considerably as a result of the reduction of the price from 1st June for those who purchase turf in the non-turf areas. Everybody knows that the reduction of 10/- per ton in that particular case will have to be provided for out of the pockets of the taxpayers in order to increase the subsidy, because the actual cost of distribution of the turf from the turf areas to the non-turf areas will not be reduced.  There was <Col N="707" /> no complaint about the effect on the Exchequer when that was disclosed.</P>
    <P>In any case, apart from that, is it sound policy for a workers' Government, such as this Government is supposed to be, to reduce the tax on the rich before providing for a decent wage, a family wage, for those who live by their labour, whether of hand or brain?  Speaking on this matter the Bishop of Galway said&mdash;I do not want to read the whole quotation because I am sure the Minister has been given a copy of it already&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not.  I am only reading the pertinent part of it. Speaking about wages and what he describes as the Church's view on the right of workers to a decent minimum wage, a family wage, he winds up with this important pronouncement on behalf of the Church: &ldquo;The higher the proportion of national income that goes out in wages the better for the prosperity of the country.&rdquo;  Is it possible to get that to sink into the head of Deputy O'Reilly who expressed a funny point of view this evening?  He should read the whole of this address if he has time during the week-end and I can furnish him with the reference. He said there was no sympathy for the teachers' claims in the country or amongst the people he mixes with.  I admit that there may be a good deal in that, especially in certain parts of the country and among certain classes of people.  I do not know whether the Minister is responsible for it or not&mdash;I will not accuse him personally of being responsible&mdash;but I know that the whispering gang who usually go around doing Government propaganda work, and who seem to be paid pretty well for it, are going round certain parts of my constituency and threatening a general election on this issue if we in this House do not swallow the Government's point of view.  I have got so used to general elections that I have made up my mind that we are going to have one in the future every time the Taoiseach loses his temper.  We have had a few already for that reason.</P>

      <P>I say that the general body of citizens of all classes and creeds in all parts of the country deeply deplore the action of the Government, headed by the Taoiseach and advised by the Minister, in refusing the influential intervention of His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin.  Supposing we were still under British rule in this country and there was a strike of teachers and the Archbishop of Dublin offered his services to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, as he was called, and the Chief Secretary refused the influential intervention of one of the Hierarchy, would there not be an uproar from one end of the country to the other?  I do not think there would be any loss of dignity on the part of the Taoiseach or the Minister or his colleagues in the Government, or even the Deputies who back them every time on every issue no matter what their conscience may tell them, if even now, for the sake of the parents and the children and for the sake of education, the Minister would accept the kind and generous offer that His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin has made for the purpose of helping to bring this regrettable dispute to a successful termination.</P>

      <P>I understood the Deputy to say that there was a big volume of public opinion behind this strike.  Let it not be thought that I do not understand the teachers' difficulties. I do, very well, but, even though I do understand their difficulties, I certainly could not subscribe to the methods they have adopted on this particular issue.  I am sure that this volume of opinion in the country that the Deputy has referred to would be with me in that attitude and in that belief.  Like my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, I think the members of this House who have spoken so strongly about the strike and advised the Government to retreat from the position they have taken, have done a disservice to the teachers and to their cause. There is no use in holding out false hopes to the teachers in this connection. It is far better and far more honest for us to say to them that the Government have taken up a certain attitude; they have gone a certain distance to satisfy the claims of the teachers, and they cannot go any farther.</P>
      <P>Let me revert to the figures.  There were 9,121 papers issued; 3,773 voted for the Minister's offer and 4,749 voted against.  Even of those who voted, there was not any great majority for those who supported the strike action. There were 599 who did not vote at all. In other words, they appeared to be contented with their lot.  If they felt very strongly about the strike, they would have voted in favour of it.  Those who were not eligible to vote numbered 1,629.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan treated us to his usual cynical speech on this question of the strike.  True to form, he could not omit the Head of the Government from his cynical remarks.  He tried to point out that the Government were haggling over this question of the teachers' salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> He said that the teachers might have accepted the first offer if they were foolish enough.  If the teachers did accept that first offer, there would have been no haggling, and it was because the Government wanted to go the utmost distance they thought they could go that they continued negotiations with the teachers so as to satisfy their demands as much as they could, having regard to the needs of the community as a whole.  Deputies must remember that this is not a very rich community and that it is the duty of a Government to hold the scales evenly between all sections of the people.  I submit that the Government have done that fairly well during the period they have been in power.</P>
    <P>What is the issue in this strike? That is the question we should ask ourselves, and every responsible Deputy must weigh that in his mind.  The issue is whether a section of the people can make demands on the Government and follow up their demands by strike action.  Does any Deputy subscribe to the view that the Government would be fulfilling their duty to the community if they surrendered to that kind of action?  It is all very well for Deputies to say to the Government: &ldquo;You are obstinate; you are taking up too rigid an attitude.&rdquo;</P>

After all, it is £1,250,000 over the 1938 scale.</P>

This bonus is an emergency bonus and must come to an end when the emergency comes to an end, and then the scales of salary that have been fixed by the Minister will stand, but can be reviewed after three years.  That is the position.  The issue clearly is whether the Government have to surrender to people when they make demands, or if these demands are not acceded to, they take strike action.  If the Government did it in this case they would have to do it in every case, and that would be the beginning of the end of democratic government in this country.</P>

At the same time, we realise that there is a limit beyond which we cannot go.  Deputies who wasted their eloquence in this debate would be doing far better work if they advised the teachers to go back to their schools, instead of calling upon the Government to retreat from the position they took up, because the Government have given their final word.  Crocodile tears have been shed by Deputies across the way on the plight of the teachers, but it was the Government with which these Deputies were associated that first cut the teachers' salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a large sum of money involved in this Estimate, but we all acknowledge the importance of providing primary education, seeing that it is the poor man's university. Most young people in this country receive only that standard of education and, therefore, it is important that the standard should be as high as possible. It was stated by a Deputy that the standard of education in our primary schools had fallen.  It is 16 years since I left the primary school and, not having had the good fortune to go to any other school, I have to admit that the standard of education in primary schools has fallen very much.  I am not capable of giving a reason for that. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that that is the position.  For instance, if a Deputy receives a letter from a youth of 18 or 19, requesting him to make representations on his behalf, it will sometimes be found that the spelling is deplorable and the grammer outrageous. In fact, the rules of grammer are not observed by many pupils of elementary schools.  I believe that the teachers and the school programme are burdened with too many subjects, some of which should be cut out at the discretion of the teachers, the managers and the parents.  I think they are best able to make a decision on that question.  It has been argued that the teaching of Irish in the primary schools is the cause of the present position.  I do not accept that. <Col N="715" /> Compulsory Irish was in being when I was at school in 1926 and I learned the Irish language.  In those days the teachers were away for three months every year learning Irish in order that they could teach it to pupils on their return.  I must admit that I did not suffer any disadvantage due to the time taken up in teaching history, writing, composition and other subjects through Irish.</P>
      <P>I do not know what is the cause of the present position, but I must honestly say that children leaving school to-day have not as good an education as those who left 15 or 16 years ago.  Even in discipline and in manners the position is not as good.  When I was going to school, children would never dream, when meeting a man or woman on the road, of being the first to address them.  We would wait to be addressed.  We would then reply in the way we were taught to reply. Children to-day do not wait to be addressed, but address you first with a &ldquo;How go&rdquo; or &ldquo;How do.&rdquo;  That shows very bad discipline.  In my day, if my teacher found out that I had addressed anybody older than myself, I know what I would have to go through, and if it were found out at home, I would get double what I got from my teacher. I think there is laxity all round, not only in relation to teachers but in relation to parents.  The home is the principal place for the teaching of these matters, but a lot can also be done in the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to school buildings, I have a grievance in the matter of national schools.  The school in which I was taught was a great, long school with a fire at the end of it, which was all right for the teacher standing within a few feet of it, but which was not much comfort for the children who came in in wet clothes on a winter morning.  I am in favour of spending any amount of money, no matter where we get it, how we get it or who has to suffer for it, on education and school buildings.  You must provide comfortable surroundings for boys and girls if they are to take an interest in the subjects being taught them.  In the winter time, they must be warm, and, <Col N="716" /> if they come to school with wet clothes, there must be some means of getting them dried before they go home.  That facility does not exist in primary schools to-day, and, to a certain extent, it is the cause of the increase in T.B.  I do not see why classrooms cannot be smaller and so more easily heated.  This long room business is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly, I think, spoke about the sanitary conditions of the new schools.  Even in the few new primary schools which I have seen, the sanitary conditions are not up to standard.  The dry closet system is a disgrace.  On last Sunday I went into a school closet and found that it was in a disgraceful condition and not fit to enter.  That is a very bad example to give to children.  If the schools and the closets are kept clean, when the children grow up they will try to maintain the same standard of cleanliness at home, but if they see these school closets dirty, they cannot be expected to do so.  It is impossible to keep these closets clean without a proper flush system.</P>
    <P>I believe in having attached to schools large playgrounds in which the children can exercise, play games and enjoy themselves during the lunch hour, and I believe that the children should have a break in the morning of 10 or 15 minutes.  It is a long time from 9 o'clock in the morning until the lunch period at 1 o'clock.  I understand that the roll is not called until 10 o'clock, but they start in many places in the country at 9 o'clock.  At least, when I was going to school that was the practice.</P>
    <P>If I vote for this motion to refer back, I want to make it very clear that I do so because I feel that the system of education is not up to standard, that something is wrong somewhere. Judging by what many Deputies have said, this motion has a dual purpose, and for that reason I want to make it clear that I am not interested in the present teachers' strike.  I have no interest in it, and I believe that blame can be laid on the teachers just as much as on the Department.  It is all very well to get up here and talk about the badly-paid teachers.  We <Col N="717" /> must recognise that other sections of workers are badly paid also, and we must recognise that the Government have a responsibility and that they understand that there are sections who are badly paid.  They have gone a very long way in trying to meet the teachers' grievances in the matter of salaries&mdash;in the opinion of many people throughout the country, a little too far.</P>
    <P>I could get up here and say something different, from the political point of view, but it would not be good politics in Mayo.  I do not know whether it would be in other constituencies, but I can assure Deputies it would not be good politics in Mayo. From conversations I have had with teachers, I know that they are in no way in agreement with this strike. They regard it as an ill-advised action and they feel that the remuneration they are getting is reasonable.  The women teachers have a complaint in relation to capitation and the allowance for book-keeping.  They claim that they must call the roll and must do it just as well as the principal teacher, and they also claim that they have to teach two subjects&mdash;cookery and sewing&mdash;which the male teacher has not to teach; but notwithstanding the fact they have put these points in private to us and have claimed that their responsibilities and their duties are as great as those of the male teacher, they admit that, taking everything into consideration, they are receiving a reasonable remuneration.</P>
    <P>There is, perhaps, a section of the teachers whose scales of salaries may not be what we would like them to be, but I feel that the advance on the part of the Department was made more in respect of their needs than of those of other groups of teachers.  The Parliamentary Secretary made it clear that, in three years' time, this will be reviewed and, in the meantime, we expect a considerable reduction in the cost of living.  We expect a considerable reduction in various Estimates and there may be ways and means by which a further increase can be provided.  We will not begrudge it to them if the country is able to meet it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be understood as getting up here in any vindictive <Col N="718" /> spirit or with any spite against the teachers.  I fully recognise their importance.  I have said, not only here but elsewhere, that they come next to the parent in moulding the character of the young.  The example they set in the school, the way they teach and so on play a big part in moulding the character of the children.  That being so, they are a very important section of the community, with an important responsibility, and I wish it to be understood that I fully recognise it, as I am sure every other Deputy recognises it.</P>
    <P>But at the same time I recognise that we must take into consideration, firstly, what this State can afford in relation to salaries; secondly, that there are other groups in the community whose position we would like to see bettered, but for many reasons we are not able to do so; and, thirdly, that if we give way on the strike by giving the teachers what they are demanding you will establish, in my opinion, a precedent which cannot justify itself.  To meet these demands would not I believe be good for the State as a whole, nor would it be good for whatever Government will sit on those benches in five, six or ten years from now.  That is my candid opinion, speaking my own mind.</P>
    <P>Last year we voted in this House to have this Vote referred back because we felt then, as we feel now, that the system of education was not what it should be.  As far as this Party is concerned we are voting in the same way on this occasion.  But I do want to make it quite clear that we fully recognise the dual purpose of this motion to refer back; and we appreciate that a great number of the Deputies who have spoken on this matter have referred largely to the present strike position in Dublin and to the demoralising effect it will have upon the children and the bad example it may give them, together with the possibility of a lessening of their respect for their teachers when they return to school once more.  I do not think there is any grave danger of that. So far they have only been two months away from school.  I have often been three months away from school during the period when teachers were developing <Col N="719" /> their knowledge of Irish.  If the parents are proper parents and do their duty no child is going to run loose.  If the children run loose it is the parents' fault, particularly when there are still plenty of rods and canes to be found.</P>
    <P>I have a question down for next week, addressed to the Minister for Education, but I would like to take this opportunity to say something in relation to accommodation for young university students.  I think some effort should be made to provide suitable accommodation for the young men and women coming up from the country to both the National University and Trinity College.  I am sure it is well known to Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand.  As far as that is concerned, that is all I have to say.  If it is not relevant to the subject matter under discussion I do not intend to proceed any further.  It merely arose because of something which was brought to my notice and I thought I would take this opportunity of putting it forward.  However, I have <Col N="720" /> a question down and I shall await the Minister's reply to that.</P>
      <P>In so far as Irish is concerned I think it is a pity that it is not making more progress.  It must be admitted that once a boy or girl leaves school he or she takes little further interest in the language.  I have often thought that it should be possible to have some system of competitive examination in which prizes would be given, such as cups or something of that nature, to boys and girls up to the age of 21 in order to encourage them to maintain their interest in the language.  Under such a system they would be able to achieve a certain standard and that in itself would encourage the boy or girl to continue to practise the speaking of Irish.</P>
      <P>It would be an incentive particularly to a young man who would, I am sure, like to have a cup to put on his sideboard which would enable him to point to it and say: &ldquo;I won that cup 20 years ago; I won it because I passed a certain examination in certain subjects in Irish.&rdquo;  I am sure that if such cups were given you would have hundreds in every parish sitting for the examination and that would help to keep these young people in touch with the language and would help them to maintain their facility in it, as well as helping them to add to what they have already learned in the national schools. I think that in that way it should be possible to keep the language alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>You have cups given at the present time at the feiseanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the feiseanna are exceedingly good and I think more should be done to encourage them.  But I think the Government would have to sponsor the prizes I have in mind. They should be something worth while. The real cause of failure to revive the Irish language is inertia.  That is a pity.  When you turn on the radio now and the young people hear a conversation in Irish on it their immediate reaction to it is: &ldquo;What good is it; have we not got to find a living for ourselves outside our own country?&rdquo; They do not appreciate the culture of the Irish language.  They look down <Col N="721" /> upon the Irish language and, looking down upon it, they fail to appreciate that they are thereby looking down upon their own country.  If you degrade your language and lose your respect for it then you are bound to look down upon your country.  That is never brought home to them.</P>
      <P>I must say that I think only a very small percentage of our people to-day actually ridicule their country because they have come to realise something of its greatness and they have come to appreciate its history, its background and its culture and the fight that has been made to bring about its freedom. But they have not yet learned to appreciate the importance of the Irish language.  They have not yet come to realise that it was the Irish language which preserved to us our culture and encouraged us in our fight for freedom. As I said before, if something could be done in the way of providing prizes for boys and girls up to 21 years of age in order to encourage them to continue their studies in the Irish language and not permit themselves to become rusty &mdash;because that is what inevitably happens when one ceases to use a particular subject in every-day intercourse &mdash;we would go a big step forward in reviving the language.</P>
      <P>I am voting in favour of this motion, but I am doing so because I am dissatisfied with the system of education and not because I in any way approve of the strike or censure the Minister or his Government for the attitude they have taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (Co. Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be able to speak the Irish language as fluently as Deputy Micheál Óg MacPhaidín speaks it.  On the debate on the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Education last year, I was one of the Deputies who made a special request that the Minister would review the teachers' position with a view to its improvement.  I wish publicly to thank the Minister for coming to our aid and acceding to the representations that were made from these benches to review the position and to give the teachers a substantial increase.  I listened, to-day, to Deputy McGilligan.  His speech reminded me of the old proverb in the Book of <Col N="724" /> Caesar, <i>Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis</i>&mdash;times are changed and we are changed with them. Deputy McGilligan has changed with the times.  His contribution to this debate was typical of a number of other unconstructive contributions that he has made in this House from time to time.  There is no Deputy who does not at heart deplore this strike.  No Deputy here can subscribe anything to it except to say that it is really too bad that it has occurred.  We had that famous Deputy bringing in the Church and referring to Ministers of State as being anti-Church.  I defy any Deputy or anybody outside this House to point the finger at any Minister of State in the Fianna Fáil Benches.  The Taoiseach is an example to any country in the world.  Anyone who would say otherwise would be stating a terminological inexactitude.</P>
      <P>I am going to speak, probably very much against myself, politically, on this occasion but, as a trade unionist for over 23 years, I have been agitating for better conditions.  It is natural that every society, every organisation and every community should try to improve the position of its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as we, the Fianna Fáil Deputies, are concerned, a number of our loyal supporters and members that held our organisation together came to us and asked us to use our influence with the Government, with the Minister and at our Party meetings.  That was done, and 3,773 thanked us for it, while 4,949 told us to go to hell, that they would go on strike and would get more without our representations.  I am sorry that that attitude has been adopted by a body of cultured men in this country, because at all times I have deplored strikes.  It is well known that while in a number of cases strikes have secured increases, at the same time it must be admitted that honest, sound reasoning was responsible for getting increases without any strike, thereby saving a good deal of misery in the homes of the country.  I say now that I am very sorry that this strike has occurred.  Now that it has occurred, I want to say that last year I made a speech criticising the Minister, or at least appealing to the Minister, but now I want to say that I stand <Col N="725" /> by the Minister and the Government in the attitude that they have adopted. If I did not do so, I would not be worthy to be called a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  I hope that ordinary sound reasoning will prevail with the people who are on strike to-day, and that they will not be carried away by those who are trying to cash-in on them, people who did not mind as far as this country is concerned whether or not it was blown sky high during the late war, people who are not concerned with the unity or nationality of this country, but who are anxious to cash-in on the teachers to-day.</P>
    <P>I hope that at some time in the near future the teachers may say to themselves &ldquo;we have got a decent offer from the Government&rdquo;.  If, on the other hand, the teachers had got no offer, I could not speak as I am speaking to-day, but the teachers got an offer.  As Deputy Cafferky has said, we have to consider every section of the community. Fianna Fáil is a national organisation and, as such, is concerned with the uplifting of every section of the community.  I am sorry that we cannot do more for the farm labourers and various other sections who have large families to rear, and who, in many ways, are finding it hard to try to eke out an existence.  We have a number of unemployed in our constituencies, and we have to try to do something for them.</P>
    <P>We, in this State, have to cut our cloth according to our measure, and if one section of the people were to say that it was going to defeat the Government by going out on strike, then ordinary democratic rule would cease to exist in this country.  You would have the same chaos here as that which prevailed in other countries prior to and during the Great War. The position is that a stand must be made.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that the approach of the Archbishop of Dublin in this matter was turned down.  I know the Minister for Education.  I have exchanged views with him on this matter several times in his private room, and I know that he was sympathetic at all times, and that the Government was sympathetic.  Therefore <Col N="726" /> I hope the time will come when ordinary reasoning will prevail.  The teachers were given the opportunity of having the position reviewed three years hence.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Cogan make a speech here to-day.  I am not very long a member of the House and I try to learn some of the ordinary decorum and gentlemanly conduct that is expected at least from Deputies who have been members of the House for some time.  The very first portion of Deputy Cogan's speech to-day consisted of a personal attack on the Minister for Education.  The people of this country have answered Deputy Cogan and a few others by returning the Minister for Education to office. They have given him a vote of confidence, so that I think that is a sufficient answer to Deputy Cogan.  His ungentlemanly conduct shows that he is not worthy to be a public representative.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister for the interest that he has taken in trying to provide new schools for the children. They were long overdue.  I am delighted to find that the Minister is trying by every means in his power to see that the provision of new schools will be expedited.  Many more are needed because we must admit that we had a lot of old ramshackle buildings. What disappoints me is that the youth of the country are not taking greater advantage of the facilities afforded to them in the matter of vocational education.  We have a number of vocational schools through the country, and I am sorry that they are not being availed of to a greater extent by the young people, especially those over 14 and 15 years of age.</P>
    <P>I appeal to parents who live near these schools to get their children to attend them, and to avail of the educational facilities which they afford. I know that some poor parents may find it hard to do that, but I would appeal to them, in the interests of their children, to encourage them to attend. I am deeply concerned in the welfare of children of poor parents.  Every encouragement should be given them to attend not only the primary schools but the vocational schools so that they <Col N="727" /> may fit themselves for fairly decent positions in life.  In that connection, I would like to see more scholarships put at the disposal of each county.  I would ask the Minister to consider the giving of State grants for that purpose. You will find in the schools throughout the country a number of bright, intelligent children who, because of the financial circumstances of their parents, are denied the opportunity of continuing their education, and of preparing themselves for positions in life to which their talents entitle them.  That is why I suggest that these scholarships should be provided.  At the present time the position is that many of those bright, intelligent children are deprived of the opportunity of continuing their education, and have to turn to labouring, or some other kind of work.  I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind, and see that something definite is done in the direction I have indicated.</P>
    <P>The medical inspection of schools, carried out by another Department, is another praiseworthy feature that I must refer to.  I would suggest to the Minister that when new schools are being built, provision should be made in them for two rooms or two cubicles which should be set aside for medical inspection.  I do so in view of certain references which I have heard made from time to time about certain school medical inspections.  There should also be provided in a room or cubicle in each school a first-aid outfit.</P>
    <P>Another thing that is essential, so far as schools are concerned, is proper sanitation.  A supply of drinking water is important.  The possibility of acquiring playgrounds near schools has been referred to already.  No matter how anxious the Department may be from time to time, that is not a thing that can be done easily.  Under the Public Health Bill, promoted by another Department, parochial parks can be acquired by a local authority. I should like to see the park near a school because it would be a source of great encouragement to children and would help them considerably.  &ldquo;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.&rdquo;  Furthermore, it is essential, when children get out to play for a few minutes, that they should have <Col N="728" /> some ground where they can do so instead of being confined to a small school yard.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the standard of education.  We have been told that children leaving school at 14 years do not know very much. We have been told that a child of 14 years leaving school 16 or 20 years ago was better educated than the child of similar age to-day.  I cannot assent to that view because the child of 14 years, 16 years ago, did not know very much. The child of to-day is compelled to go to school and that was not the case 16 or 20 years ago.  It has been agreed on all sides of the House that we should encourage our national language and national customs if we are to carry on as a nation and give effect to the ideals of a number of men who died for the country.  The Opposition, when they were in office, had an educational system which was based on the learning of Irish.  I do not think that the learning of Irish is so terribly detrimental to the education of a child.  I think that it is most helpful.  In countries such as Belgium and Denmark, school-going children learn three or four languages.  What is wrong with us is that we are not sufficiently anxious to learn the language.  I have not a very good knowledge of the language myself.  I cannot speak it with sufficient fluency to make a speech.  I am only sorry that I had not the same opportunity of learning the language that the children of to-day have.  It is a great help to a child to be able to speak a couple of languages. A child who learns Irish will be an asset to the country.  We hope that some day&mdash;it may not happen in our time&mdash;our country will be 100 per cent. Irish-speaking.  That may take a generation to effect.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Education on the conduct of his Department generally.  He was most sympathetic with a number of representations I made to him.  Those representations affected the interests of advanced teachers and others.  I stand firmly behind the Minister and the Government in the stand they have taken, as I stated in my opening remarks.</P>

Deineadh laghdú ar a dtuarastal gan aon réamh-fhógra agus ní bhfuaradar aon tsásamh as ach an oiread.  Nuair a thánadar ansin go 1931, faoi Rialtas Chumainn na nGaedheal, bhítheas chun 10 faoin gcéad eile a bhaint den tuarastal&mdash;sé sin, an socrú a bhain na múinteoirí as Rialtas Shasana i 1920 a chur ar ceal.  Níor deineadh mar tháinig athrú Rialtais idir an dá linn. Nuair a bheitheá ag éisteacht anseo inniu agus inné leis an gol agus an beiceach agus an greadadh bos, as na <Col N="730" /> bínsí thall, ba dhóigh leat gurb iad sin cáirde na múinteoirí.  Ba cheart deireadh a chur le cluanaireacht agus fimíneacht den tsórt sin.</P>
    <P>Is dócha, nuair nochtaím mo thuairimí anseo mar gheall ar an stailc&mdash;agus tá mo thuairimí féin agam &mdash;go ndeárfáí nach cara do na múinteoirí mise ach is cuma liom.  Inneosaidh mé an fhírinne.  Táimse chomh láidir i gcoinne na stailce agus bhí aon duine de na 3,000 múinteoirí a bhí 'na coinne.  Is gráin liom é, is truagh liom go bhfuil sé ar siúl agus gur cuireadh ar siúl riamh é.  Sílim ná déanfaidh sé aon mhaitheas do cháis na múinteoirí. Chun an fhírinne ghlan a innsint, cheapas nuair léigh mé an tairgsint a fuair na múinteoirí ón Aire go mba thairgsint bhreá é agus go mba chóir glacadh leis.  Nuair a chuala toradh an bhótála, ní raibh riamh im shaol níos mó ionadh orm nuair nár ghlacadar leis&mdash;agus thárla an stailc de dheascaibh an bhotála.  Is trua mar thárla agus ba mhaith liom go mbeadh slí éigin as ag na múinteoirí. Níor mhaith liom go cuirfí síos iad ach ní theastaíonn uaim go gcurirfí síos an Rialtas ach oiread.  Níor maith an rud san don tír i láthair na huaire ná ins na blianta atá romhainn amach, agus ba chóir go dtuigfeadh na múinteoirí ar fúd na tíre agus na múinteorií atá ar stailc é sin.  Tá dhá thaobh ar an scéal.  Cuireadh taobh na múinteoirí go láidir os comhair na Dála le linn an Mheastacháin seo ach tá taobh eile leis&mdash;taobh an Rialtais agus taobh an phobail.  Gan aon amhras, tá taobh na leanbhaí, na scoláirí scoile, agus taobh na n-athar agus na máthar den scéal ann leis.  Dúrathas go bhfuil 40,000 leanbhaí scoile ag siúl na sráideanna i mBaile Atha Cliath de dheascaibh na stailce.  Fairíor géar, níl a fhios agam cén fhaid a bheidh an scéal mar sin.</P>
    <P>B'olc an ní stailc aon uair, ach is measa ná ní ar bith stailc múinteoirí agus sé mo thuairim ná raibh aon ghá leis chomh fada is bhí an tairgsint sin acu ón Rialtas.  Ba thairgsint fial maith é agus ba cheart glacadh leis, go mórmhór nuair bhí an coinníoll sa tairgsint go scrúdófaí an cúrsa arís i gceann 3 mblian.  Ní thuigim i gceart cad chuige go bhfuil an stailc ar siúl <Col N="731" /> in aon chor.  An airgead atá i gceist? An ceist na marcanna í nó tuarastal na mban?  Fé mar dúras, táim ar aon aigne leis na 3,000 múinteoirí a bhí i gcoinne na stailce.  Ba mhaith an rud é don tír agus do chúrsaí oideachais dá mbéadh na múinteoirí sásta admháil gur dheineadar dearmad agus botún agus go raghaidis thar n-ais.  Dá ndeinidis é sin, bheimis go léir sasta cabhrú leo chun pé gearáin bheaga atá acu a leigheas.  Cheap mise nuair a bhí an Meastachán os ár gcomhair anoiridh gurb é rud a bhí ag teastáil óna múinteoirí scoile ná scála 1920 a thabhairt thar n-ais.  Sin é a thuigeas ó litir a fuair mé ó Chumann na Múinteoirí féin.  Caifear admháil go raibh sa tairgsint seo a fuaireadar ón Rialtas tairgsint ná facthas a leithéid riamh agus ná fuarthas a leithéid riamh ó aon Rialtas ó cuireadh na bun-scoileanna ar bun sa tír seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do thógaint scoileanna nua agus do dheisiú scoileanna atá ann cheana féin.  Bíonn ana-mhoill ag baint le hobair deisiúcháin ón gcéad lá a chuireann an bainisteoir tús leis go dtí go mbíonn an obair críochnaithe ag an Roinn sa deireadh.  Is eol dom cúpla cás ina bhfuil deisiúcháin scol i gceist agus tá an scéal ar siúl le 5 nó 6 bliana gan aon tosnú fós ar an obair deisiúchain. Is dócha go raibh an saol mar bhí i gcoinne na hoibre sin, ach san am cheanna, níor cheart go dtogfadh sé 6 bliana chun an deisiú a thabhairt i gcrích.  Iarraim ar an Aire féachaint an bhféadfaí aon ghléas a cheapadh a bhrostódh obair den tsórt sin.  Tá dhá Roinn i gceist.  Labhras ina thaobh seo an lá faoi dheireadh nuair bhí Meastachán an Rúnaí Páirlaiminte don Aire Airgeadais ar siúl mar tá Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí i gceist leis.  Is deacair fháil amach uaireanta an ceart an milleán a chur ar an Roinn Oideachais, nó ar Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí nó ar an mbainisteór, ach idir an triúr, bíonn an mhoill ann agus ba chóir gan an oiread sin moille bheith ann feasta.  Tá a lán mion-rudaí le socrú sár a bhféadar cur chun oibre den tsórt sin ach tá an scéal práinneach. Tá a lán scoileanna nua ag teastáil ar fud na tíre agus tá a lán deisiúcháin ag teastáil sna scoileanna <Col N="732" /> atá ann.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire agus ag an Roinn chomh maith agus tá a fhios againne anseo go bhfuil cuid mhaith déanta le blianta anuas.  Tá sin le feiceál agus tá sé soiléir ar fud na tíre agus ba cheart leanúint den obair go dtí go mbeidh sé go léir déanta.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin fiafraí den Aire conas tá scéal an Ghúim i láthair na huaire.  Más fíor a gcloisimid bíonn moill ana-mhór ar leabhra Gaeilge a chur i gcló, agus ní fheadar cad é fáth na moille seo ón am a chuireann an t-údar an leabhar isteach go dtí go gcuirtear i gcló é.  Bíonn 5 nó 6 bliana i gceist, agus is dóigh liom níos mó ná sin.  Níl aon chrot ar an obair más fíor a ndeirtear liomsa, agus iarraim ar an Aire scéal an Ghúim agus coisde na leabhar a scrúdú go speisialta féachaint conas is féidir feabhas a chur ar an obair, féabhas a chur ar na leabhra a cuirtear i gcló, níos mó bun-leabhair a fháil más féidir sin, agus má tá an milleán in aon áit eile, féachaint chuige go leighistear an scéal.  Bfhéidir gur in Oifig an tSoláthair nó imeasc na gclódóirí a thárlann an mhoill seo ach pé áit ina bhfuil sé, ba cheart an rud a leigheas mar níl go leor oibre á dhéanamh ag an nGúm.  Níl go leor leabhar ag teacht amach, go háirithe leabhra i gcóir na ndaoine óga.</P>
    <P>Bhfuil an Gúm chun éinní a dhéanamh a bhéarfadh misneach do scríobhneóirí óga ón Ghaeltacht tosnú ar scríobhnóireacht?  Tá na seanscríobhneóirí ag dul i ndísc i ndiaidh a chéile.  Mura bhfuil na scríobhneóirí óga ag teacht chun leabhraí, scéaltaí agus litríocht a scríobh, níl aon mhaith bheith ag súil le Gaeilge a chur á labhairt ar fud na tíre.  Molaim don Aire bheith ag cuimhneamh conas is féidir na scríobhneoirí óga sa Ghaeltacht a chur ag scríobhadh in Gaeilge agus taithí a thabhairt dóibh.  Ní foláir nó go bhfuil cuid mhaith daoine óga anseo agus ansúd go bhfuil féith na scríobhneoireachta iontu agus ba cheart iad a mhealladh.  Ceist anatháabhachtach ar fad í an cheist seo&mdash; ceist na scríobhneóireachta.</P>
    <P>Is trua liom an cás ina bhfuil an tAire i láthair na huaire.  Fuair sé masla agus cáineadh agus droch-íde <Col N="733" /> agus gach rud níos measa ná a chéile ó na daoine a bhí ag caint ar an Meastachán&mdash;rudaí nár thuill sé.  Is eol dom féin gurb é an cara is feárr atá ag na múinteoirí é, dá dtuigfidís sin, ach ní thuigeann siad é.  Dhein sé rud dóibh nár dhein aon Aire Oideachais, maidir le cursaí tuarastail. Dhein sé a chuid oibre go maith agus is trua ná fuil gach aon dream sásta leis.  Níl sé ceart nó cóir do dhaoine anseo bheith ag caint agus ag spídiú-chán ar an Aire mar bhíodar.  Is trua liom an tslí ina bhfuil sé.  Sílim go bhfuil moladh tuillte aige mar gur ghéill sé don achainí a rinneamar anoiridh go ndéanfadh sé rud éigin chun feabhas a chur ar thuarastal na múinteoirí.  Dhein sé a dhícheall faoi sin agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an cáineadh a fuair sé tuillte aige.  Nuair dúrathas go raibh caighdeán an oideachais ana-íseal agus ag dul in olcas in aghaidh na bliana.  Ní cáineadh ar an Aire amháin é sin ach ar an gcóras oideachais agus ar gach duine a bhfuil baint aige leis an gcóras oideachais.  Is cuimhin liomsa an tam bhíos féin ag dul ar scoil&mdash;sílim go ndúirt mé é seo cheana&mdash;ní raibh an deis agam cuid de na rudaí a fhoghlaim atá á múineadh sna scoileanna faoi láthair.  Ní raibh ach an t-aon teanga amháin a múineadh an tam sin&mdash;an Béarla.  Na daoine óga atá ag dul ar scoil anois, tá siad ag foghlaim dhá theanga sa chuid is mó de na scoileanna agus á bhfoghlaim go maith.  Sin athrú mór agus feabhas mór ar chúrsaí oideachais.  Is feárr i bhfad an duine ag a bhfuil dhá theanga ná an té ná fuil ach aon teanga amháin aige nó aici.  Sin dul-chun-chinn sa tír seo i rith 25 bliana.</P>
    <P>Níl an ceart ag an Teachta Ó Cógáin agus ní fheadar cad é an t-udarás atá aige leis an méid a dúirt sé nó an bhfuil aon udarás aige bheith ag cur de mar sin agus a rá go bhfuil an caighdeán íslithe agus ag dul in olcas.  Ní théann rudaí mar sin chun tairbhe na tíre, chun tairbhe chúrsaí oideachais ná chun tairbhe na ndaoine a bhfuil baint acu leis, go mórmhór nuair nach fíor iad.  Bfhéidir go gcreideann na daoine a deireann na rudaí seo gur fíor iad ach ní dóigh liomsa go bhfuil aon olcas tagaithe ar an gcaighdeán oideachais agus creidim <Col N="734" /> go bhfuil na scoláirí atá ag fágaint na scoileanna na laetha seo chomh maith agus bhíodar 15 nó 25 bliana ó shoin agus bhféidir i bhfad níos feárr dá nochtfaí an fhírinne.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt arís don dá phointe seo&mdash;a riachtanaí atá sé brostú le deisiúchán na scoileanna agus le scoileanna nua a thógáil agus scrúdú speisialta a dhéanamh ar obair an Ghúim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for Education has been overshadowed, in the speeches to which we have listened this afternoon, by the teachers' strike. I do not intend to add anything to that portion of the debate beyond expressing the hope that the Minister will be strong enough, and that it will not be taken as an indication of any weakness whatsoever, to decide on the mediation suggested by the teachers, if offered by his Grace the Archbishop of Dublin. I do not share the views that some people seem to hold in this regard, in that I do not believe in dragging in the names of high dignitaries of the Church to our discussions here.  We have a peculiar habit in this country of trying to create an atmosphere of piety when we want to get through any kind of double-crossing.  I prefer the honest, straightforward way of doing business, without invoking the aid of any of those great men in the spiritual life of our country, such as Cardinals and Archbishops for whom I have the most wonderful respect and regard&mdash;possibly more so than most people who invoke their aid.  I distrust such people as I do those who recite the Rosary on certain occasions in the public streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I have listened to the debate to-day I felt that not sufficient stress was laid upon the various items contained in the various sub-heads of the Estimate.  Because of the feature of the teachers' strike, which as I have said has overshadowed most of the discussion, I daresay other material sides of the Minister's Estimate were neglected.  The Minister stated that there had been, for some time back, a noticeable advance in scientific endeavour and exploration and he deduced from that that there would be a demand in the post-war world for increased facilities in the teaching of science.  I wonder has the Minister <Col N="735" /> made any calculation as to the number of our young men and young women, having the degree of Bachelor of Science, who have had to emigrate to a neighbouring country in order to get a decent livelihood?  If, as the Minister suggests, there has been a great advance in scientific endeavour and exploration, and, as a corollary to that, a demand will be created for our scientists in the near future, it is a wonder that, having trained a number of these young men and women at the expense of the State until they reached the degree of Bachelor of Science, these people were allowed to emigrate because they could not get a living in their own country.</P>
    <P>I can give one example, that of a teacher who admitted to me himself that it cost the State roughly £2,000 to educate him, a young man who had a brilliant scholastic career, a man who had won almost every distinction that was open to him.  He had to leave the country because of the closing down of a training college.  He was able to secure a position at the other side and I want to say incidentally that one of the things which led to his being chosen from a number of candidates, including two flying officers in uniform, as assistant headmaster in one of the public schools on the other side was that, amongst others things, he had translated Virgil's <i>Eneid</i> into Irish.  He had also translated a number of books from Irish into Latin and <i>vice versa.</i> This young man was so versatile that he was employed in one of the big public schools as a professor.  He admitted to me, as I say, that it cost the State a couple of thousand pounds to educate him in this country, but he had to emigrate after the closing down of the training college.  If there is this great development which the Minister envisages, I wonder has he given any thought at all to the question of what is going on in the world of science in relation to plastics?  Some scientists believe that there is a great future for plastics.  I wonder has the Minister given any thought to this matter or has he given any directions to some of our science teachers to engage in some kind of research work in that connection?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> I endorse the remarks of Deputy Burke of County Dublin in reference to the disadvantages under which a poor man's child suffers in this country at present&mdash;the boy or girl who gets honours in the Leaving Certificate.  If he or she is not lucky enough to win a scholarship, being possibly cut out by five or ten marks, that is the end of that boy's or girl's career.  There should be some method by which that boy or girl would enter the University and get a sporting chance, at any rate, but, so far as I can learn from statistics and observation, the chances are a thousand to one against the poor man's child getting a show in the University.</P>
    <P>I am very much interested in the vocational side of the Minister's Estimate.  I notice that in this morning's <i>Irish Press</i> there was a sub-head in the report of the Minister's speech which read: &ldquo;A Chance for Girls&rdquo;, in relation to a paragraph in his statement where the Minister drew attention to the fact that domestic economy was occupying a fairly prominent place in the curriculum of the vocational and technical schools.  With some sort of pride, apparently, he referred to the fact that a number of these girls were being trained in a college in Wexford as domestics, waitresses, cooks, assistant cooks, etc.  I remember well that at a meeting of the Cork Vocational Education Committee we discovered that some agreement had been entered into with the Tourist Board by which these girls, when trained, mark you, as waitresses would be guaranteed employment by the Tourist Board at 12/6 per week and their tips.  I felt humiliated to hear that the Department of Education were giving their consent or assent to a weekly wage of 12/6 plus tips.  I would much prefer to see the wages offered without tips and not to have the word &ldquo;tips&rdquo; introduced into it at all.  Although I may give tips, I thought we should aim at something better and higher than to have the vocational education system linked up with a wage of 12/6 per week and tips.  If the Department continues these classes next year, I hope that they will endeavour to get a fixed wage for these waitresses and others engaged by the Tourist Board.  I think <Col N="737" /> it is a rather bad headline and that it will discourage a whole lot of young girls whom we would like to see going into the service of these hotels but who may feel that it is humiliating to accept tips.  I hope the Minister will look into that matter and see if he can make any indention on the policy of the board, if he has the power to do so.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Cogan who said that the people of the country were indignant with regard to the whole system of education.  He stressed the fact that, because of teaching through the medium of Irish, the people were overflowing with indignation. I should like to think that that was true.  In my view, however, the people are not so indignant at all.  I think that because they are being dragooned and steam-rolled they are in a state of complete apathy.  A lot of people consider that it is hopeless to protest against the way their children are treated in relation to teaching through the medium of Irish. If a person opens one's lips in this country in public or in private and says that he does not believe in the present system, he is told that he is unpatriotic, that he is a West Briton, or something of that sort.  That is begging the question.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what really happens in the ordinary workingman's home&mdash; and I believe most of the people in this House sprung from the working classes&mdash;and what are the realities of the situation?  A child comes home from school, to use a phrase which may be a kind of pidgin-English or Irish, moithered because of having to learn figures in Irish and possibly the alphabet or short words in Irish.  That child can get no help whatever from his parents.  I have said here on occasions that a lot depended on the help that a child was able to get at home with his home lessons.  When I say help, I do not mean that the parent used to write the exercise for the child.  But the parent was able to look over the exercise and correct it and show the child where he was wrong.  That has gone altogether.  I consider that the parent in that case was a wonderful asset to the teacher.  I think every teacher who knows his job will agree with me when <Col N="738" /> I say that he lost a great partner when the parent or guardian was unable to revise or review the home exercises of the child.</P>
    <P>Again, you have the position that Irish is not spoken in the homes.  I agree that that is a fine target to aim at so that the language will become more general than it is now.  But it is strange that, after 45 or 50 years of intensive agitation and cultivation of the language, not 40 per cent. of the people to-day can speak Irish.  I wonder what is the real percentage.  I move about in various parts of the country.  I am possibly more at home on the bogs and the mountains than in O'Connell Street.  Even in these districts I do not hear the parents or the children speaking Irish.  There are, of course, certain parts of the Gaeltacht where you will hear Irish spoken. But in the cities and towns and even in the rural areas the spoken language is English so far as I can ascertain, and I go into all sorts of places, including pubs, clubs and other places where people congregate.  I do not live in a monastery.  I have ears to hear and I can see what is going on.  We cannot delude ourselves into believing that we will become an Irish-speaking nation in the course of a couple of years, notwithstanding all the &ldquo;boloney&rdquo; about what is being done. In fact we might be called West Britons if we faced up to the whole thing and told the truth.</P>
    <P>I will not touch on the question raised by Deputy Cogan about the Christianising influence of the Government. Should we not drop that boloney, too?  We were the missioners who converted the world at one time. In our childhood days we were told these fairy tales. Are we anxious to resurrect these fairy tales now, and are the poor little children in our cities and towns to be told that we have that wonderful Christianising influence and we must widen the area of that influence by sending evangelisers to the four quarters of the world?  It is time we burst that bubble, too.</P>
    <P>There is an item here in connection with advanced studies.  It seems to be the intention to build two schools. <Col N="739" /> There is an increase of £20,160, the total amount in the Vote for that particular item being £41,150.  I understand that will have to be confirmed by a vote of the two Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>That money cannot be expended until the sanction of the Dáil and Seanad is given.  We are to have a school of cosmic physics and a school of historical research.  In these lean times are such things necessary? I do not want to be misinterpreted.  I am all out for culture of any kind, whether it is British or Irish or of any other origin.  I would like to see a fuller life lived by every man, woman and child in this country.  I would love to open the store of knowledge, that can only be gained by attendance at the universities, and I would love to see every opportunity granted, even to the poorest amongst us.  But in these times, when we are subject to all sorts of restrictions, when we are obliged to have black bread and when we are told to tighten our belts, it might be better to leave aside this school for advanced studies and this school for cosmic physics. Surely, we can do without such amenities for a few years at least?</P>
      <P>I think we should cry a halt to the building of these schools.  They might be included in the Budget, possibly in 1951 or 1952.  We have sufficient cultural institutions at the moment.  I believe we should have more, but we certainly have sufficient for our requirements, and I hope the Minister will find some other way of using that money rather than expending it on two cultural schools.  We can afford to do without these for a while and we should address ourselves to more material things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be big enough&mdash;I believe he is big enough, notwithstanding all the adverse criticism to which he has been subjected&mdash;to examine the other problem in all its aspects.  I know where his sympathies lie.  Perhaps his Government may be too strong for him, but I have a feeling that they are not and that the Minister will be strong <Col N="740" /> enough to do the right thing at the right time.  After all, he has not much more time to do it, and I sincerely hope he will accept the principle of mediation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened this evening to a good deal of criticism of our educational system.  If my memory serves me right, back in 1926 a commission on education was appointed and, represented on it, were the teachers, the Department, the managers, the Hierarchy, parents and other interests concerned.  So far as I know, the curriculum then approved is the one that is being carried out by the Department, yet, strangely enough, for the past two days the severest critics of that system were the very people who had the responsibility of putting it into operation.</P>
      <P>There was criticism of the condition of schools throughout the country.  One would imagine that the Fianna Fáil Government only has been responsible for that.  I will draw the attention of the House to what has been achieved from 1932 to date with regard to the provision of new schools and the improvement of old ones and I ask Deputies to compare that with what was achieved in the previous ten years. I think that is a sufficient answer to the criticisms we have heard about the structural condition of our schools.</P>
      <P>Complaints were made about the sanitary accommodation provided. That, I suggest, is the responsibility of the managers of the schools, and Deputies would be discharging their duties to the public more fittingly if they would draw the attention of school managers to these defects rather than air them in the national Parliament. At least, that is the line of action I take in dealing with these matters, and I believe it is the correct one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make one appeal to the Minister with regard to education.  I have had a good many years' experience on a vocational education committee and I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to institute continuation classes from the primary to the vocational schools, particularly for instruction in domestic economy.  The young girls leaving <Col N="741" /> school could not devote themselves to a more important subject than domestic economy.  It is absolutely essential for those girls to continue their education after leaving the primary school until such time as they will go into employment.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, there would be two or three years wasted in most cases, and it would be a pity to have that happening. It would be a pity to have young girls running uselessly about when they could be attending those classes.  They ought to be compelled to attend them.</P>
    <P>In so far as my influence went with our vocational education committee, we have succeeded in seeing to it that most industrialists will give employment only to those who have attended continuation classes.  I understand that system is in operation in Cork.  It is unofficially in operation to a large extent in our area.  I see no reason why it cannot be made compulsory throughout the State.</P>
    <P>I must express my surprise that some country Deputies this evening declared that they were not interested in the Dublin strike.  That is a very regrettable statement.  I am a country Deputy and I am deeply interested in the Dublin teachers' strike.  I think something definite should be done, and done immediately.  As one who favoured and sympathised with and supported the teachers' application for increased remuneration, I say that the Minister and the Government should take steps to have a plebiscite of the teachers throughout the State.  I believe, from what I have learned from many teachers in my district, that if those steps were taken there would be a different result on this occasion from that recorded in the plebiscite taken some months ago.</P>

I have not suggested that it has come officially, but, from what I have learned from many teachers, I believe if a plebiscite was taken now the result would be very different from <Col N="742" /> that recorded on the last occasion, due to bitter experience and what the teachers have learned.  Failing that, I suggest&mdash;and I say it unhesitatingly&mdash; that the Government, with the consent and co-operation of the managers and the Hierarchy, should take steps to replace the Dublin teachers.  I suggest that the Minister should go to the Christian Brothers' Schools throughout the country, in Dublin, Drogheda, Dundalk, Wexford, Limerick, Tralee and Galway, and from these select sufficient teachers from the students to replace the Dublin teachers without prejudice&mdash;I want to emphasise that&mdash;to the existing position.</P>

      <P>As the father of a family, I make that statement.  It is quite practicable, and I make no apology for making it.  It would not be scabbing, as Deputy Giles suggests. I suggest that it should be done without prejudice to the teachers' strike. It is the children we should consider rather than the teachers and rather than the Government.  That is my suggestion, and that is my only reason for speaking this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>To the credit of the Christian Brothers in Dublin they have refused to take in one extra pupil since the teachers' strike took place.  That should be said to their credit.  I hope they will continue that policy and not interfere with the teachers' demand for a living wage.  When the Minister is replying I should like him to tell the House something it is entitled to be told.  Did he at any time consult with the real employers of the teachers?  Did he consult the parish managers of the City of Dublin schools?  If not, why did he break away from the usual practice of allowing employers to con sult with their workers concerning terms of pay and general conditions? <Col N="743" /> If the Minister did consult them he should tell the House what recommendations were made to him by the parish managers of schools at which the children of Dublin are being educated.  Deputy O'Reilly stated that he had not seen any children running about the streets, and did not see any sign of trouble in the city.  The Deputy also stated that there was no sympathy for the teachers.  As to his first statement, about not seeing any of the 40,000 children who are away from school for nearly three months, why did he not see them?  The reason is that most Deputies, except those residing in Dublin, take taxis at the railway stations and only pass through O'Connell Street on the way to the Dáil or to their hotels.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that any Deputy who passes through Seán McDermott Street, Summerhill, the Docks, or the North and South Walls would see children engaged in dangerous pastimes in which some of them meet with accidents and are brought to the hospitals.  The mothers of these children are left in doubt for hours as to what damage idle hands are doing. Deputies do not see those things because they do not want to see them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies do not want to see what is going on and they have no knowledge of what is happening to 40,000 children, a large number of whose working-class parents are underpaid. These children have inferior boots or shoes and are almost naked. The Minister is responsible to the parents as well as to the teachers.  It is a great responsibility for him to ease the minds of the parents, so that they would know that their children were where they would be out of harm's way instead of running about the streets.  I appeal to the Minister to call the managers together.  Does the Minister know that Dublin Deputies have been invited to meet&mdash;and that most of them, with the exception of <Col N="744" /> myself and another Deputy, are at present in one of the Committee Rooms&mdash; some parish managers and the Dublin School Attendance Committee, who are seriously alarmed for the future of the children?  I hope to go to that meeting in a few minutes to hear what suggestions they have to make that would create a feeling of conciliation, so that the teachers will not be humiliated, that some reasonable offer will be made to them, and that they will go back to work.  But they are not going to go back to work at the crack of the whip of one man, the Minister for Education.  As to Deputy O'Reilly's other statement, that there was no sympathy for the teachers, I say that all Ireland is involved in this strike, because the teachers in the country fully realise that the teachers of Dublin are fighting their battle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The teachers of the country are subscribing handsomely, and will continue to subscribe to the Dublin teachers who are carrying on the battle, so that a decent wage will be paid to them.  Through subscriptions that are being sent to Dublin they guarantee that there will be no further interference with their rights, and that if any changes take place in the teachers' profession from now on they must be improvements.  No Government and no Minister will ever again take the risk of doing what the present Minister has done.  One Deputy stated that he was not going to put all the blame on the Minister, or to give him all the credit, if credit was deserved, for enforcing his will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Taoiseach and the Government are behind him and this is a Government decision.  Every time we see advertisements or letters in the newspapers we see a reference made to the Government's decision.  Therefore, the present treatment of the teachers is not due to Mr. Derrig, Minister for Education.  It is due to the Fianna Fáil Government, who are responsible for the position in which the teachers find themselves to-day, and particularly for the condition of the very large number of junior <Col N="745" /> teachers who are on the minimum salary scale in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly made reference to the fact that teachers in the country have not got the same facilities as teachers have here in the City of Dublin.  Teachers in the country, he said, have to send their children away from home in order to avail of higher education and he talked about the expense of that higher education. Does the Minister know that 90 per cent. of the teachers in Dublin are the sons and daughters of small farmers and that, because of the minimum salary paid to these in our large schools in Dublin, they have in many cases to appeal to their parents for a subsidy towards the cost of living in Dublin? Only yesterday in one of our newspapers I read an article in which it was stated that students studying here in our colleges are charged two and three guineas a week for the very minimum in the way of bed and breakfast. Think, then, of the position of these girls teaching in our schools and earning a little over £3 a week.  If one of them falls sick she has to pay as much as 30/- a week for a room and her breakfast&mdash;no dinner, no tea.  She has to exist on the balance; she has to clothe herself.  I know that there are many young male teachers in Dublin to-day who are unable to supply themselves with a second suit of clothes.</P>
    <P>I put it to the members on all sides of this House that this is their fight just as much as it is the teachers' fight. You have in your areas the parents of these teachers.  You have in your areas the parents of those students who come up to Dublin to train as teachers.  I am only talking now about those on the minimum scale.  I think that if the Minister had treated those a little better he would not find himself in the troublesome position in which he is to-day.  He very cleverly tried to split the teachers' organisation by offering to help the better paid ones and giving those on the lower salary scales the smallest possible increase imaginable.</P>
    <P>I notice that I am the only one left of the Dublin representatives in this House.  Having heard Deputy O'Reilly to-day.  I wanted to say something on this matter.  The Dublin members of <Col N="746" /> this House are at the present moment outside in a committee room discussing with representatives from the school attendance committee and the school managers the difficulties with which they are faced.  They are discussing the difficulties of Dublin parents, who, for the last three months, have been denied the opportunity of having their children prepared for the scholarships held annually in our primary schools. If the strike continues for another three months the effect is going to be most harmful on those 40,000 children It is going to be exceedingly harmful to those reaching the ages of 12 to 14. I appeal to the Minister to do something. We have heard so much in this House in the days gone by about conciliation and arbitration before a strike takes place.  Why was not some attempt made to have arbitration in the case of the teachers&mdash;arbitration by some outside authority who could look at this matter impartially and not &ldquo;through a glass darkly&rdquo; as the Minister has to look?  The Minister is the person who has to raise the money and he has to keep in mind, when raising that money, that he has to come before this House and justify his expenditure; and I must say on this occasion he made a very eloquent speech as to how much this was going to cost the taxpayer.  The extra couple of hundred thousand pounds required would have been money well spent.  In view of the reductions that have taken place in the Budget, I do not think that one person in this country would have complained if some provision had been made for the teachers.</P>
    <P>The position has been thoroughly debated by all Parties in the House and I think the Minister ought now to give some indication that he is not going to act in the same manner as the Employers' Federation acted in the old days.  The Employers' Federation in the old days in Dublin cracked the whip.  I well remember the days in Dublin when a dock labourer was paid 18/- a week.  The Employers' Federation refused to increase that wage and the men eventually had to go on strike &mdash;a strike that lasted for months and months and, during the progress of which, they and their families starved and their children paid the inevitable <Col N="747" /> price.  It took much misery and suffering and a long time for those men to succeed in getting a reasonable wage. The teachers are in the same plight to-day. The Minister can say that there is a handsome scale of salaries and he will produce to you the salary scales for those at the top.  But I am appealing for the 50 per cent. who are at the bottom of the list and who showed their  of their treatment by going cut on strike, knowing the hardships that that would bring them.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered at the same time that the teachers' strike is not merely for salary alone.  The teachers have struck against conditions generally. In this connection, I would point out to the House the wholly inadequate pensions they are in receipt of when they cease their practical teaching.  I have seen questions put down in this House by members of all Parties in relation to these miserable pensions. You have 300 to 400 teachers on £1 a week; you have 300 to 400 teachers on 30/- a week; and you have 300 to 400 on a little better scale.  That is another matter which helped to create the discontent in the teaching profession. Every Deputy in this House has had letters from these retired teachers in receipt of these inadequate pensions. I remember getting a letter from a man in Limerick in which he said that he hoped that before it was too late something would be done whereby they would not be compelled to apply for home assistance.  That unfortunate man came from Castle&mdash;I forget exactly the name of the place but, perhaps, Deputy Bennett will remember.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the place.  A retired teacher there wrote appealing for something to be done before it was too late.  A week or two ago I read in the paper that that man had died.  He died because he had not sufficient wherewith to keep body and soul together. I do not say that his family or those associated with him did not look after him, but the fact is that he had not sufficient of his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy in this House pays lip service to the teachers as being the men who made sacrifices, the men who kept <Col N="748" /> the flag flying, the men who took risks, and the men who subscribed handsomely to every national fund.  Here we find ourselves in 1946 discussing a teachers' strike in Dublin with 40,000 children running idle around the city streets and losing every opportunity guaranteed to them under the Constitution. The Constitution guarantees education to all classes.  That part of the Constitution has been broken for the last three months.  I appeal to the Minister to see the parish managers, to ask them for their recommendations and, when he gets their recommendations in regard to salary, to think of the conditions under which the teachers work and to endeavour to improve their surroundings.  He should give them decent schools in which to work.  There are two or three schools in Dublin that are a disgrace to any country.</P>
    <P>At the same time I want to say, for the Minister, that we have two or three schools in Dublin that are the best in Europe and that are a credit.  They have been built within the past 20 years by this Government and by the previous Government.  I want to congratulate the Minister on those three schools.  There are other schools in the tenement quarters of the city where the children are taught in small classrooms, where the rain is coming through the roof and in which the outlook is very gloomy.  If the teachers are to influence the children, they must be content themselves.  The teachers deserve well of the Government and of the country.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to take the steps that are necessary.  I shall not refer to His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin because reference has been made so often to the Government's refusal to allow him to use his good offices in order to bring the dispute to an end.  On the day the newspapers published the correspondence in connection with this dispute, I saw a newsboy, standing outside the General Post Office, who had a home-made placard on which he had chalked, &ldquo;Government refuse to allow the Archbishop to mediate.&rdquo;. We all know that no Government can interfere to that extent, but the Government have gone a long way to create the impression that they do not want any assistance in connection with <Col N="749" /> any dispute in which they are involved or do not want any suggestions from anybody.  Most Rev. Dr. Dignan and Most Rev. Dr. Browne were turned down.  Now His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, who has offered his help, is turned down.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister that those on the minimum and on the lower and middle scales should get a reasonable increase and that the teachers should be encouraged to return to their schools and to take the 40,000 children off the streets of Dublin.  Remember, a strong man can always be gracious.  The Minister, feeling strong, issues letters in connection with the teachers' strike to the effect that, &ldquo;I say so and so.  I have negotiated with the teachers' organisation and no useful purpose can be served by receiving any deputation&rdquo;. He refused to receive a deputation from the School Attendance Committee. He refused to receive a deputation from the public authority.  He refused to receive a deputation of private individuals who had suggestions to make that might help.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to continue carping criticism.  I put forward these suggestions to the Minister.  In the days of old the Masters' Federation tried to drive the workers against their will. They were very happy, in the long run, to have conciliation courts to help them out of their difficulties.  The Minister refuses to accept advice from those who are anxious to help.  I appeal to him to accept outside advice and to drop that firm attitude.  It would be unfair to say it is the attitude of the dictator.  I will not say the Minister is a dictator.  He is one of the few Ministers who does not adopt the attitude of being a dictator.  We always found him easy to approach.  He and his Department have given effect to many of the recommendations put up by this House.  He has given effect to representations concerning industrial schools and the treatment of boys in Borstal.  All these things are to his credit and to the credit of the Department. He can go one step further.  He can end this strike without any loss of dignity.  The parents of the 40,000 children in Dublin expect that from him and I hope that when he is replying <Col N="750" /> he will give them some words of encouragement.</P>

      <P>Rural Deputies have been wondering why there was a strike in Dublin and nowhere else.  We know the reason now.  Anybody listening to Deputy Byrne within the last quarter of an hour would have no doubt whatever that Deputy Byrne is largely responsible for the teachers' strike in Dublin to-day.  There is no doubt about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know I had such influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Byrne thinks he is doing a service to the teachers by staying where he is instead of going to the meeting which he has mentioned, I suggest he should send his friend, Deputy Cafferky, and they might do a little bit better.  Deputy Byrne spoke of all the mischief the children are getting into.  It is rather strange that I should have heard comments about the large decrease in juvenile crime since the teachers went on strike.  When Deputy Byrne talks about the young teachers and raises up his hands in horror at what they are charged in Dublin, I wish Deputy Byrne as a Dublinman, would advise his constituents not to put it on to the unfortunate country people that come up here or to skin them in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who listened to Deputy Alfred Byrne, or to Deputy McGilligan, could no longer wonder why we have a strike of national teachers in Dublin. Deputy Byrne will go where there is trouble, or where he can create trouble.  He will keep the pot boiling so as to prevent any settlement.  He is the boy who will do that, and he is doing it pretty successfully.  If there could be anything more mischievous than the speech which he made here this evening I should like to be told it. Let us see where we are in regard to this teachers' strike.  Deputy Byrne says that the Government did nothing. What about the cuts in the teachers' salaries that were made by the Fine Gael Government?  This Government restored them when it came into office. I have looked over the official debates, and I could not find anywhere in them <Col N="751" /> that Deputy Byrne kicked up any row when these cuts were made by the last Government.  This Government also took over responsibility for the teachers' pensions.  What ground is there, therefore, for Deputy Byrne's complaint?  The offer made by the Government would represent an increase in the teachers' salaries of £1,250,000.  That is a pretty considerable sum.</P>
    <P>I must say that Deputy Cafferky in his speech spoke the true mind of the ordinary farmer and farm labourer on this question.  Not long ago I was driving home a friend of mine who happens to be a national teacher.  I asked him how he had got on at the meeting, and he said that the teachers had turned down the Minister's offer. I said to him: &ldquo;How would you come out under it?&rdquo;  and his reply was: &ldquo;It would mean an increase of £140 to me.&rdquo;  I turned to him and said: &ldquo;Did you turn that down?&rdquo;  His reply was: &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;  The people through the country who are producing butter, milk and eggs for Deputy Alfred Byrne and for other people like him&mdash;perhaps I should also include sugar because I am sure he is fond of it&mdash;have to rear and support their families and prepare their children in fair decency to send them to school, are obliged to live on an income of £2 a week or £36 a year less than the £140 increase which was offered to that teacher.  That is the wage laid down for those who are producing our food supplies, and there are 495,000 males over 18 years of age engaged in agriculture.  I am sure that Deputy Byrne likes to have fresh milk for his tea on Sunday mornings but when the Deputy and the teachers are in bed the men with the £2 a week are out on Sunday mornings and again on Sunday evenings to milk the cows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the teachers cannot afford to pay for the milk that the Deputy is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who is responsible for the teachers' strike here in Dublin should take his medicine and not be interrupting.  If he has 40,000 potential constituents running around the streets of Dublin to-day, he ought <Col N="752" /> to be very proud of it.  At the same time, he says that some of his constituents are charging 30/- a week to the young teachers for a bed in a room. They supply no food to them.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the Government made a fair offer to fix up the teachers' strike by increasing their salaries by £1,250,000.  It was, I think, going farther than the State should go, that is, when one considers the conditions under which the people who are producing food for the country are obliged to live.  I have the utmost respect for the teaching profession and nobody should think otherwise, and for that reason I regret to see the teachers following the blind lead given them by Deputy Alfred Byrne and Deputy Patrick McGilligan.  They have led them on this gallop in Dublin so that they might use it for political propaganda, but it has turned out to be a damp squib and has fizzled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Cafferky has said, there is no sympathy whatever among the rural community for the situation that Deputy Byrne has created in Dublin. The average salary earned by a teacher was £240 a year, the bonus brought it up to £286, and, under the new scale, the average would be £349 a year.  It is all very well for Deputies to talk about young teachers, but what salaries do other young people get when starting out in life?  What about the banks in which Deputy Alfred Byrne has all his money?  If a boy in the country is appointed to a position in a bank and happens to be assigned to a Dublin office, it means that his father and mother have to support him.  His starting salary is not sufficient to keep him in Dublin.  The same applies to boys and girls from the country who enter the Civil Service. They have to be supported from home owing to the manner in which Deputy Byrne has organised the sharks of landladies who charge them so much for a miserable bed.  It is all very well to say that the Minister is responsible in this matter.  He went as far as he could go.  He has his responsibilities, and has to carry out the decision of the Executive Council.  The people that I blame for this strike are those people who knew that the Government <Col N="753" /> had gone as far as it could go to meet the teachers, and then said to the latter: &ldquo;If you will go out now, we will come along and get Archbishop So-and-so, or we will get at Deputies, and we will make the Minister and others come to meet you.&rdquo;  That, however, has failed.</P>
    <P>The teachers of Dublin now realise that they were led on a wild goose chase by Deputy Byrne.  I think they would be well advised to go back to work.  If they have any grievance let it be considered in a calm and ordered atmosphere, and not in a strike atmosphere.  If this country has any money to spare the first claim on it should be to provide decent wages and decent conditions for the parents of the children who are attending the schools, for parents who have to work, not 35 hours a week as the teachers do, but between 52 and 60 hours a week on the land producing food for all the drones we have, and who are doing that on a wage of £2 a week.  They have a far better claim than those who are earning on the average £349 a year. These men have to support from four to six children on £104 a year and they have to work seven days of the week. The teacher can stroll out of his house on Sunday at 1 o'clock or 1.30 o'clock and walk into the pub next door for a pint.  But, if the man from the country goes into a publichouse after doing his morning's work, he is caught and fined and the publican is fined for giving the drink to him.  That is equal law and equal justice, as we know it.  If there is money to spare, it should go in the way I have suggested.  I have the utmost sympathy with the teaching profession, but I think that they have got a fair and decent offer and that it is their duty to accept it.  If there are conditions attaching to their work which could be better arranged so as to make things lighter for them, that matter can be better dealt with when they are back at work than it can be by means of a strike.  If they succeeded in getting the Minister to move one peg, I think that the whole agricultural community, with its 495,000 of a male population&mdash;the community who provide food for the people&mdash;would be entitled to go out on strike to get conditions which would be fair to them.  They <Col N="754" /> would have a far better right to do so than men who are being fairly treated, at least, if not too fairly treated, by the taxpayer.  That is my opinion and I give it for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Byrne helped the teachers in any way.  He just showed his hand.  He showed that he was behind the scenes getting the teachers out on strike by foolish promises that he could compel the Minister to give way.  Deputy Byrne is a very foolish man but he is a pretty old campaigner.  I do not think that the parents of the 40,000 children who are being deprived of education in Dublin at present will thank Deputy Byrne for his activities in helping to deprive them of that education.  I should not like to have his responsibility in that respect.  I do not think that he helped the cause of the teachers by taking up that kind of attitude. Strikes are bad.  Nobody wants them. It is bad enough to have a just strike but it is far worse to have people coming out on strike without just cause or reason.</P>
    <P>I desire to deal with a few other matters on this Vote.  I heard Deputy Anthony talking about the fine schools in Cork.  Some of the rural schools in the vicinity of Cork are anything but a credit either to the Department of Education or whoever is responsible for their present condition.  There is a school in Whitechurch which is about 100 years behind the times.  I have the utmost sympathy with the teacher who has to work in it.  I suggest to the Minister that, now that the emergency period is over, he get to work on the Whitechurch school and see that proper accommodation is provided.  It is about six miles from the city and it is like something you would see on the Aran Islands.  Other schools in the East Cork area are in virtually the same condition.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to arrange for a little more agricultural teaching in the schools.  The majority of the rural scholars will have to go back to the land.  When they go back to the land, they should have some knowledge of that by which they are to earn their livelihood.  In my young days, a pretty good agricultural education was given <Col N="755" /> in the national school.  That has gone &mdash;very definitely.  We hear a great deal about the flight from the land. The teaching in the schools has a fair amount to do with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter which I should like to bring to the attention of the House and the Minister on this Vote.  I refer to the question of vocational education in the country.  In my constituency, there does not appear to be any directive or indication from the central authority as to how far the country is to go with vocational education or as to the limits which vocational education committees should set to their aims.  Some committees are attempting to run riot. They appear to have the idea that they should shove up a lot of vocational education schools in their counties. Other committees in other parts of the country seem to be moving in a conservative way.  In my constituency, a couple of white elephants which have produced no particular result have been run up.  They are there as monuments to the inefficiency of their builders. My opinion is that, before we erect elaborate vocational education schools, we should have some local demand for them.  I should like to see itinerary teachers or part-time teachers sent to a district before a school is erected. If there is a local demand for the school and sufficient population to justify its erection, by all means let the people have it.  However, we seem to have a lot of loose thinking by vocational education committees on this matter. In my county, the contribution in the rates for vocational education has increased from about ¼d in the £ to 5d in the £.  We are at the maximum of expenditure in that regard.  Any further employment of vocational teachers in that area or any further expense would mean that we would be running into debt.  So far as my opinion goes, some committees have been fostering a policy of running into debt in the hope or belief that the Department of Education will, ultimately, come to their rescue and that, if they do deliberately run into debt by appointing more teachers or erecting more schools, the Department <Col N="756" /> will, at least, amend the law so that a greater contribution can be given them from the rates.  The Minister may not have examined the matter.  I think that it is time he had an examination of the position throughout the country.  The Department should state how far we are to go with vocational education, having regard to what the people can afford to pay.  Now that we have erected vocational schools in the larger towns, the countryman is contributing towards them and getting no service from them and, accordingly, we should have some idea as to what the goal is. I am a member of a vocational education committee and they do not appear to know what the aim to be achieved is.</P>
      <P>They do not appear to know, because these rumours are coming in from other counties that a considerable amount of money will be made available for vocational education, how far they should go.  Some of them have very extraordinary views and would be prepared to give a vocational education contribution from the county rates of from 2/6 to 3/- in the £.  You often get men on committees like those who, not having the responsibility of paying the bill or not being in close touch with people who have to pay the bill, are inclined to go a very long way indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that certain good results have been achieved by vocational education but I also feel that many of the claims for it are grossly exaggerated. I feel that in many cases provision was made in vocational schools for the teaching of certain subjects to qualify students for positions which were found to be non-existent even when the students had qualified.  For quite a number of years there were shorthand and typewriting classes in many towns attended by youngsters from the country, particularly girls, to qualify them for jobs that did not exist.  These girls when qualified for jobs that did not exist, would not do farm work and did not want to do farm work.  They were looking for positions that were not there for them.  I would be all for giving the instruction in these schools a rural bias.  I would be all for providing some method of agricultural <Col N="757" /> education in rural areas for young people but the vocational schools are not doing that.  I feel that we would achieve far better results if, by some addition to our national schools, we could have night classes where the young people of the country would have an opportunity of getting a specialised training in connection with agriculture.  I feel that under such circumstances we would get far better results for the money we are spending. At the moment, I feel that the direction of policy is more or less haphazard and that the Department is not giving the direction it should to local committees. This is a matter about which the Department should make up its mind and we should decide how far we are prepared to go.  We should have some planned system, because I think that the system at present in operation leaves a lot to be desired and is not achieving results commensurate with the money we are spending on it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister, though I do not know whether it is in order on this Estimate, namely the condition of the school at Cloggernagh, Islandeady, Castlebar. It occurred to me that this particular school, like the statue of Queen Victoria in front of this building, might be kept as a kind of national monument of what schools should not be or that it might be preserved as a kind of museum for future generations to indicate the types of school at which some of our young people had to attend in these days.  A local contribution was made available in connection with this school some time ago and I cannot understand why a new school has not been built there.  Perhaps there is some reason, but I do know that it is not the type of building to which any parent would like to send his children.  It is the most deplorable type of building with which I am acquainted in this country and there have been many local complaints in connection with it.  To its credit let it be said, the teacher of the school has endeavoured to carry on with the rain coming in through the roof and in the awful conditions under which he had to work for a number of years, in the hope that the Department would <Col N="758" /> eventually come along and erect a decent school.  As I have said, the local contribution was made available some time ago, so I would appeal to the Minister, as this matter has been going on for a number of years, to let the people of Mayo know what is the reason for not proceeding with the erection of a new school.  As the question of strikes has entered so much into this discussion, I may say that there would be a very good reason if the people in that area felt inclined to keep their children from attending that school at all.</P>
    <P>As regards the unfortunate strike in Dublin, I feel sorry for the Dublin teachers inasmuch as I think they are being used as a political football by various elements in this House.  I wonder do the teachers believe that there is any sincerity in a number of the speeches made in this House on their behalf?  Various Deputies have given their views on this strike and I should like to give mine.  I think, like every other Deputy, that the strike is deplorable.  Many appeals have been made to the Minister in this House to do something but nobody seems to have the idea at all that an appeal should be made to the teachers to do something.</P>
    <P>Nobody appears to have the idea that some appeal should be made to the teachers, in view of their duty to the children and in view of the deplorable consequences which may accrue to the children of Dublin as a result of the strike.  I believe the teachers in the main are a reasonable body and that they are fully conscious of the very great duty they owe to the children placed under their care, but I also believe that if the teachers fully realised what may be the result of their strike action to the unfortunate children they would go back to work.</P>
    <P>This is a matter on which I think nothing should be said on any side of the House that would make matters more difficult for either party to this dispute, but I think we can appreciate that there must be a limit to the length to which the State can go.  The State is in a different position from an ordinary employer.  The State has to carry on a number of services.  I think that <Col N="759" /> if the teachers were to resume work there might be some outstanding differences, which would be regarded by laymen as small matters, for which some solution might be found.  I have talked to a number of teachers about this matter and I find that there is very great disagreement even amongst teachers themselves on the various matters in dispute.  If we take, for instance, one question which is regarded as a particular bugbear, that is, the question of &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;, teachers to whom I have spoken who are highly efficient would not agree that there should be no discrimination on this question at all.  They feel that they should get some extra payment in respect of their highly efficient grading and they put forward some very logical arguments in support of that. They suggest that if one man is better than another in any particular sphere of life or in any job he should be paid a better salary, that if one man is more efficient and can produce better results, that should be recognised in some particular way, and that at the moment they are being paid something extra because of their own individual endeavour and work.  Quite a lot of teachers want to abolish that and the main reason why they suggest that that system should be abolished is that it has been abolished elsewhere.</P>
    <P>To my mind, that is not a good argument.  If a particular grading has been abolished in England or Scotland or elsewhere and if we consider that a particular grading should be retained here in our particular circumstances, I do not think the fact that outside countries may have abolished the system is any reason why we should abolish it.  That has been the view put to me by this individual who is graded as highly efficient.</P>
    <P>I have also been told by teachers in my constituency that they did not want this strike, that they consider that the offer made was quite a good one and that their executive should have given some lead to the teachers throughout the country in this matter.  The executive evidently did not do so.  The feeling throughout the country is that, although the negotiating committee may have felt quite satisfied with this <Col N="760" /> offer, they were not strong enough to put over their own view on their organisation and allowed themselves to be jockeyed into this strike.  Without making a comparison between what teachers are entitled to and what the professional man, the farming community and the labourers are entitled to, I may say that no particular section is entitled to hold up the rest of the community to ransom.  I am one of those who have been fighting with the Minister for some time to get better treatment for the younger teachers, but I think the teachers have not the right to define what their salaries should be. It would be very nice if each and every section of the community could lay down what they should be paid.  In this matter, the teachers and their central organisation evidently appear to take the view that they have the right, irrespective of the rest of the community, to lay down what the community should pay to them.  As there are reasonable men and women in that organisation, I think that if they reviewed the matter they would not take that view.  I do not suggest that their work is not important.  I know that the teachers' work is most important in their own particular sphere.  But, if we say that the teacher's work is important, so is the doctor's work, the engineer's work, the farmer's work, and the farm labourer's work.  Every section of the community in its contribution to the national effort is just as important as the teachers.  Perhaps the teachers have more personal and closer relations with the children of this State.  But the teachers as reasonable people will recognise the principle I am endeavouring to put before them.</P>
    <P>If I wanted to make comparisons, I could point to two people in my own constituency, one a married teacher with over ten years' service and the other an assistant county surveyor, a young married engineer working under the Mayo County Council.  The teacher qualified with the assistance that he received from the State.  He is a very efficient teacher in a town in Mayo. On the other hand, the engineer qualified at his parents' expense without any contribution from the State.  This engineer on reaching his maximum can <Col N="761" /> never come within £100 of the teacher's salary.  I think that is not an unreasonable comparison as between two professional men and, therefore, I say that the offer made to the teachers was a fairly good offer.  I think it was a reasonable offer and that the State went a long way towards meeting the demand of the teachers.</P>
    <P>After all, we must have some finality about these matters.  Possibly it is a matter of the least said being soonest mended.  I do not want to go into the rights or wrongs of a body like the teaching profession going on strike or the people who may be inclined to follow their example if there is a surrender to their claims.  I do not want surrender on any side.  Many appeals have been made to the Minister.  I should like to ask the teachers, in view of their tremendous responsibilities to the young people of this city, to resume work.  There may be still some matters on which they could possibly get agreement by having a heart-to-heart talk with the Minister.  I should like both sides, as it were, to lay down arms and to resume good relationships.  If the teachers take that step now, I believe good relations would be established and that the teachers as a profession would get the assistance of every Party in this House.</P>
    <P>I am sure most of the teachers will realise that some of the suggestions which have been made here in this debate are completely absurd.  We had people demanding the Minister's resignation. That would not help the position, particularly as some of the people who demanded the Minister's resignation were the people who made inroads on the teachers' remuneration in the past.  All the political Charlie McCarthys who expressed the views of people outside for the purpose of creating political smoke-screens are not friends of the teachers.</P>
    <P>If the teachers, who I believe are a body of reasonable men who fully recognise their responsibilities and duties as members of the community and, in particular, in regard to the teaching of the young children in this city, reconsider the matter and go back on the job, I believe that a reasonable solution can be found of the comparatively small matters that may now <Col N="762" /> be outstanding between them and the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we should have a teachers' strike on when we are debating the Department of Education Vote, because I believe that really too much time has been wasted in dealing with the strike.  But, as the matter is so important and most Deputies have dealt with it and some Fianna Fáil Deputies have tried to defend the Minister's attitude, I think it would be no harm for me to give my personal views as well.  Deputy Ó Briain stated that the teachers had acquired some very new friends.  I should like to point out on my own behalf and on behalf of my Party that it is nothing new for the Irish Labour Party to be friends of any people who band themselves together in a trade union.  The teachers have been accused of blackmailing the public.  It is unfair to accuse the teachers of blackmailing the public, because of the unfortunate position in which 30,000 or 40,000 children are placed.  I think the teachers have as good a right to go on strike as any other section of the community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry compared the position of the teachers with that of agricultural labourers and possibly he might intimate that some sections of the Opposition are in full support of a section of the community which might be considered to have a reasonable standard of living.  In answer to that, I may say that we in this Party would hold out for the agricultural labourers and the unfortunate road workers, who get 39/- a week, just the same as we would for the teachers, who are not looking for support for those who are well paid and with decent salaries, but for the unfortunates who have small salaries.  In my opinion, that is the reason why we have the strike.  We are not so much concerned about those who have big salaries, but we are for the unfortunates in Dublin who cannot live on the remuneration they receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the teachers to go on strike was not an impetuous action on their part.  The teachers, as has been said about them by members of the Government Party, are admittedly an intelligent body of people.  It is their <Col N="763" /> business to be intelligent and to have a decent standard of education.  The thousands who voted for strike action have long visualised what would happen in the event of a prolonged strike. It was not an impetuous action when they decided to go on strike.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said that if the teachers cooled off for a little while and decided to go back to work they would receive the support of all Parties in this House.  I think most of the speakers on the Opposition benches have spoken in support of the teachers.  The last speaker has more or less stated that if the teachers came back, Fianna Fáil would give them their support.  I suggest the only thing that is keeping this strike in progress is the Minister's pride and the only thing the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned about is the Minister's pride. Any strikes I have known, no matter where they were&mdash;in foundries, workshops or factories&mdash;were usually settled, if they were of long duration, by some outside person, who had no interest in either of the parties, expressing his willingness to act as a go-between. It is not for me to drag the Archbishop of Dublin into this debate, but he has been brought into it during the last two days.  In all sincerity, I suggest he would be the man best fitted to hear both sides.  The Minister would not lose any of his pride if he agreed to let the Archbishop of Dublin hear both sides.  Deputy O Briain said there were two sides.  The man best fitted to listen to both sides is the Archbishop.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the strike should take up so much time in this debate.  I propose to deal with some aspects of education.  I have not much to complain about as regards primary education or, for that matter, secondary education, but I think one item which I think should be included in the programme for primary and secondary schools is physical culture.  This country has been famed for a long time for its specimens of manhood.  I venture to say that if physical culture is not treated with a little more respect in this country, Irishmen will not be famed for quite a long time to come <Col N="764" /> for their physical attributes.  It is all very fine to say the young kids are catered for as regards football, hurling and other sports, but young girls and boys who are inclined to be lackadaisical about these things will not bother.  If physical culture is included in the curriculum, eventually you will have a better and far healthier type of student.</P>
    <P>I have a personal interest in the Irish language.  I do not think the language revival is progressing to such an extent as the Government or the Minister would have us believe.  To my mind, it is like pouring water into a bucket in which there is a hole.  I am not many years out of school, and I am fairly conversant with the position of young men and women of my age.  We went to school, had our primary course in Irish, we had our secondary course, we left school and then, some five years afterwards, we do not know two words of the Irish language.  There are Irish colleges subsidised or run by the Department of Education but, strange as it may seem, most of these colleges are in a place in which, to my mind, they should not be; that is, the Gaeltacht, because the Gaeltacht by itself should be sufficient for the encouragement and development of Irish.  I suggest that instead of having Irish colleges over in the West, where you have the Gaeltacht, you should establish them in the Galltacht, in Leinster, in counties along the eastern coast.</P>
    <P>There is in Wexford County an admirable college which is run throughout the summer period.  I refer to Coláiste Carmhan.  Anybody going to that college will admit that for the short period he is in it, two weeks or a month, he learns more Irish than he would in another school during a period of three or five years.  If the Minister will consider setting up colleges of that type in the Galltacht, or if he could sponsor through his Department a type of summer camp in which there would be Irish spoken, I believe the language would develop. It is like carrying coals to Newcastle to have Irish colleges in the West where the language should spread out from the Gaeltacht into places ten or <Col N="765" /> 20 or 30 miles away.  It is in places like Wexford, Wicklow, Louth and Meath that you need to give some little boost and some little encouragement to the language.</P>
    <P>I might mention that Comhdháil Náisiúnta is doing quite a lot for the language.  I believe it is getting a grant this year of £8,000.  I suggest that in the City of Dublin Comhdháil Náisiúnta is working satisfactorily and, while the £8,000 might be expended with advantage in the City of Dublin, I would like to see some of it appearing in other parts of Ireland.  I suggest that some of this money should be devoted to that very admirable institution, Coisde na bPáiste, because it is doing genuine work for the Irish language.  The members are developing the language among the young children.  Coisde na bPáiste is being financed by some of the trade unions of Dublin and its function is to get young children around the city, the children of poor people, and send them to parts of the Gaeltacht for two weeks or a month in the summer period.</P>
    <P>That is the only way in which one will get a proper grasp of the language &mdash;by going to some place where Irish is exclusively spoken.  It is not a question of being compelled to speak Irish; it is a place in which it is a novelty to speak Irish.  My charge against the system is that the learning of the Irish language is more a penalty than a novelty and, until it becomes a novelty, the language has no chance of survival. The majority of the sons or daughters of Deputies will readily tell them that they like school all right, were it not for the Irish language.  We have not yet gone 25 per cent. of the way towards having the Irish language as a living tongue.  As long as it is a penalty in the schools it will never survive as a language.  In that respect Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and societies of that kind have the proper idea and by subtle and novel methods are doing the best work for the Irish language.  I can only speak for my native town of Wexford, where they have organised dramatic societies, céilidhte and gatherings of that kind which appeal to the younger people in the community. Generally speaking, the younger <Col N="766" /> people are definitely up against Irish. If they are going to be reprimanded or walloped in school when learning Irish, a language which they should be proud of, it has not the slightest chance of existing.  If they could enjoy themselves while learning the language, they would eventually get it.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that I have much Irish. I have some, and I may say that I learned most of what I have, not in my primary or secondary education course, but because I spent some weeks at a small college in County Wexford, at Camolin, and acted in one of their plays in Irish.  I mention that to try to look for some support from the Department for such associations as Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and Coisde na bPáiste, and to try to have a little slackening in the leaving certificate course, in which it is just as hard to get a pass in Irish as in the English course.  A student has to know poetry, literature, and grammar of the same standard as for the English course.  English is our ordinary day language.  Irish is something which we have to make an effort to acquire.  The same effort has not, however, to be made for English, and until there is a small slackening in the hardness, if I may use that word, of the Irish course, it will never be popular in the schools.</P>
    <P>I have one complaint to make about education generally, and that is about what happens every year, where you have boys and girls going to the primary schools who get the primary certificate and then go on to secondary schools.  They do the intermediate certificate and get honours, as well as honours in the leaving certificate, and then at 18 or 19 years of age there they are in all their glory with nothing to do. My idea would be that any young person who has the ability to pass the leaving certificate examination, and who has done it well, should be given an opportunity of going to a university. The leaving certificate is not a qualification, but it shows that a particular boy or girl is capable of taking a university course.  I agree with Deputy Burke and Deputy Anthony that there are not sufficient scholarships available to the poorer classes to enable their children to go to the universities.  There are <Col N="767" /> county council scholarships.  In Wexford county, four scholarships are granted, one for the rural community, and three for students in the towns. For a county like Wexford, which has a population of something like 96,000 or 98,000 people, to offer only four scholarships to enable students to go to the universities is rather lamentable. I think it would not be unreasonable to expect the State to provide such scholarships.  It is not right to deny the opportunity to any boy or girl, of 18 or 19 years of age, who has a bent for university education, and who wants to acquire knowledge and education. It is not unreasonable to ask that such students should be enabled to go to a university and have the same chance as the children of parents who can afford to provide such education.  I may be told that there are enough students in the universities at the present time, that there are too many medical students, too many doing law, and too many doing engineering, still, we cannot deny to others the right to compete with those who can afford to go there.  To my knowledge, there are no such State scholarships.  Scholarships of that kind would not be expensive.  A scheme of State scholarships for that purpose would be a very good step for education and, to use a hackneyed phrase, would mean an uplifting of the working classes.</P>
    <P>I would like to go back again to the position of primary education and suggest that when boys or girls came to the age of 14 years they should be helped to make up their minds as to what they were going to do.  I think those best qualified to direct them at that age would be the teachers.  There should be some system whereby teachers would advise parents of boys and girls as to the particular type of career they should follow.  Boys between 14 and 18 years of age do not generally know what they want to be, whether carpenters, labourers, dockers, or even Ministers of State.  I think a teacher who has studied a boy or girl for years would be the most competent person to advise parents as to what type of career the children should take up.  Of course circumstances would enter into the decision.  If sufficient <Col N="768" /> State scholarships were not available, it would be ridiculous to allow a boy to finish his secondary school course and then have to decide, owing to the circumstances of the parents, if he would be an ordinary labourer.  There is nothing wrong about being an ordinary labourer, but, in the meantime, the boy would have more or less wasted his talents, learning up to 18 years of age, when he could have started at 14 or 15 to learn a trade as a carpenter or as a labourer.  Sin a bhfuil le rá agam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few matters to which I want to refer on this Estimate before it closes.  I have listened to my colleague, Deputy Corish, and in his concluding remarks he more or less made the suggestion that more scholarships should be provided, either by the local authority or by the Minister, from secondary schools to universities and that any boy who attended a secondary school up to 18 or 19 years of age should have a university education made available to him. I do not at all agree with that suggestion. It is the aim of every parent to educate his children as far as his means will permit and if a parent wants to send a boy or girl to a secondary school until 18 or 19 there is no reason why such a child should not then take his or her place in the world either in trade, commerce, industry or anything else.  No claim can be made upon the State to provide free university education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is an entirely wrong approach in any system of education.  If university education were made available to every child then the day would come in this country when there would no longer be any replacements available in agriculture, trades, or anything else.  I am afraid that the tendency is somewhat in that direction at the present time.  Naturally it is everybody's endeavour to get as much education as possible.  Every parent's ambition is to educate his children.  But there is, I am afraid, an idea amongst farmers, amongst working-class men and amongst artisans that if they themselves cannot provide education for their children it should be done by some other authority; <Col N="769" /> and that where such education is provided they should not do any more work.  I am afraid there is a good deal of that in the country at the moment.  I am sorry that it is so, but it is unfortunately only too true.</P>
    <P>There are now a few matters on which I wish to ask the Minister some questions.  The first and most important one is the possibility of his providing new schools at a more rapid rate than he has done in the past.  We all appreciate the difficulties during the emergency and we know the trojan service given by the Minister and his Department during the emergency in order to provide schools.  Now that the emergency is over and materials are becoming available I trust that the erection of new schools all over the country and especially in the rural areas will double itself in the next five or ten years.  The Minister and his Department should set themselves a limit and they should decide that within the next five years they would provide a new school in every parish in which it is needed.  Every old school in the country is obsolete and needs to be replaced at once.  The sooner that is done the better.  Better facilities should be provided for the children and, by the provision of better facilities, education will naturally improve. The Minister has done a lot in the past but now that the emergency is over the Minister should go full steam ahead to provide these new schools.</P>
    <P>Now the main part of this debate was taken up in the last two days with the teachers' strike and the unfortunate position that exists in the City of Dublin, its effect on the children and on the community generally all over the country. It is a position to be deplored. Every reasonable person deplores the fact that we have here a body of highly educated men and women who have thought fit to withdraw their labour. Nobody denies that they had a perfect right to withdraw their labour if they wished to do so.  But certainly the primary teachers of this city carry a big responsibility.  Every individual in the community is responsible in some degree according to his vocation in life.</P>
    <P>Some carry greater responsibility than others, both to themselves and to the community.  I think it must be <Col N="770" /> agreed that the national teachers at all times carry a very big responsibility indeed.  By the withdrawal of their labour they have created the present situation as it exists in Dublin.  I think every reasonably-minded person in the country must say that this was an ill-considered, an ill-advised step on the part of the primary teachers.  I understand that there are certain rules in trade unions whereby a two-thirds majority or a three-fourths majority is required before any actual step can be taken or any rule changed.  I believe the same situation exists in the teachers' organisation.  Even in quite simple rules no change can be made unless a two-thirds majority of the congress agree.  I understand that a majority of one in favour of the strike would have been sufficient on the ballot which was held.  I think that that is an extraordinary position.</P>
    <P>Now in the last two days I listened to the speeches of Deputy Mulcahy, in opening the debate, and of Deputy McGilligan to-day.  I want to say that I think the speech made by Deputy McGilligan should not have been made in any Parliament.  Deputy McGilligan has admittedly great talent and great ability, but I think it would be a good thing for this country and for this State if Deputy McGilligan were not a member of the National Parliament of our country.  He certainly does more to injure the country than he does to help it.</P>
    <P>One important matter which has to be taken into consideration is the reaction throughout the country to this strike and to the efforts made by the Minister to avert it in his offer to the teachers.  The agricultural community expressed their views in fairly strong terms in many parts of the country. They said that the Government and the Minister were mad to make the offer they did.  They believe that it is now only necessary to threaten to strike in order to get a substantial increase in remuneration and they think that the offer of a substantial increase in their pre-emergency remuneration made to the teachers by the Minister was going too far altogether.  The agricultural community believe that. From their own experience they know that they merely get what is left when <Col N="771" /> everyone else has been paid.  They are the residuary legatees of the country. They have always been so and, as primary producers, they will always be so.  I am perfectly certain that the Minister and the Government, when making their offer to the teachers, took everything carefully into consideration and weighed carefully the ability of the country to provide that extra increase which they were prepared to give them.</P>
    <P>They took that, I am sure, carefully into consideration, as it is their duty to hold the scales evenly between all sections of the community.  The Government decided that it was possible to take so much out of the national pool in order to increase the teachers' salaries.  I wonder, and the agricultural community wonder, whether the Government, in deciding to take £1¼ million out of the national pool, over and above the pre-war remuneration of the national teachers, were satisfied that agriculture at the present time and for the next five years, during which agricultural prices may not improve, can bear the charge that they propose to put on the national Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Government should have the full support of every member of this House in this matter, not as against the national teachers, but as defending the right of the established Government of this country to decide, and finally decide, what part of the pool of national taxation, which is taken out of everybody's pocket, should go to any one section of the community. Why should there be arbitration on this matter?</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Standing Orders of this House provide&mdash;and I suppose the Constitution also lays it down&mdash;that no amendment can be brought in by a Private Deputy to impose taxation of any kind?  The members of the chief Opposition Party, the leader of the chief Opposition Party or any other Party, cannot put down an amendment which would be in order to any motion, financial or otherwise, that would increase taxation. Is that not a fact?  Arguments were used here in the last two days demanding that the Minister should surrender in this matter.  The Minister told the teachers and the country&mdash;he made it plain&mdash;that the last offer he made was the final offer and was irrevocable. They were fully warned on the matter but, in spite of that, they were badly advised by somebody to withdraw their labour, as they were justly entitled to do.  That is not the issue at stake here.  The issue at stake in this House for the last two days, and in discussions here since this strike took place, was that the Government <Col N="773" /> should abdicate, that they should surrender their right to determine what the various sections of this community should have out of the national pool.  That is the issue at stake, as I see it.  I tell the Minister and the Government that the country, especially the agricultural community, the farmers, the agricultural workers and the lowly paid sections of the community, expect the Government to stand firm on this matter.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>We can all sympathise with the teachers but there is one thing I cannot understand, that is, why they took the mad action that they did take.  During the debate I threw my mind back to the first years of this century when I first saw the inside of a classroom.  I remember the old teacher who was there.  He was rated highly efficient, as I understood.  He was working for a very small salary.  I often heard it said that his salary amounted to only about £60 a year.  An agricultural worker at that time had, roughly, £30 a year.  I am old enough to know the conditions of agriculture and I remember the rates of wages paid to the agritural worker at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural worker at the present time has probably about £120 a year.  Things have changed and their salaries have increased a bit.  As I understand from the figures supplied, the average salary of a national teacher under the offer made by the Minister would be £349.  There would be many teachers in receipt of a salary under that figure and many in receipt of a salary above it, but that is the average.  Their remuneration has increased over the last 45 years to a greater extent than has that of the agricultural community.  It is no harm to point that out at this stage.  There is a document, issued recently by the Minister for Finance, which shows that the income of the agricultural community is not very high.  I think the Minister for Agriculture gave us a figure for the year 1939, at one time, as being between £70 and £80 per head of those engaged in agriculture&mdash;a very low rate.  I want to suggest to the House that they should seriously consider this whole matter and not allow <Col N="774" /> themselves to be influenced in any direction that may injure this country. I have no animosity, not the slightest, against the teachers.  They are quite right in trying to get the best possible standard of living for themselves that they can get but I do say that they took action in the wrong direction. Their action was foolish from their own point of view and from the point of view of the country.  The country expected more from them.  If they had taken strike action a year ago, when there was no offer, there might have been some justification but there was an offer made which represented a considerable improvement in their salaries.  It amounted, in some cases, to £3 10s. Od. per week, I think I would be fairly right in that.  That is much higher than the agricultural worker will get, probably, in the next six years or that the country can afford to pay him.  That must be remembered. Possibly, there is a number of young people who were badly paid in the past but their salaries are being improved and the starting salary of the male teacher under the offer made by the Minister is, I believe, £212 a year.  That is something like £4 a week.  He will be 21 or 22 years of age.  He is a highly skilled technician at that age. The agricultural worker, also, is a very highly skilled technician and he may have a large family and he will not have £4 a week.</P>
    <P>All these things should be taken into consideration.  These things should be viewed, not from the point of view of any particular section, but from the point of view of the country.  The National Parliament, or any section of it, should not try to use one section against the other.  I do not want to do that.  I admit right away that the national teachers or the secondary teachers are entitled to a much higher scale than, say, a man who is working in the field.  That has been the position since the world started, that different sections of the community are entitled to different scales of salary and of remuneration for their services.  Some are more important than others, but no one section is entitled to hold the country up to ransom, it does not matter whether they are postmen, <Col N="775" /> engine drivers, farmers, farm labourers or any other class.  We have had strikes from time to time among almost every section.  The farmers were on strike a few years ago, and the farm workers may be on strike. You may have a strike of transport workers or of some other section of the community at one time or another, but the main point is that no one section is entitled to hold the country up to ransom.  Again, I want to emphasise that the country expects this House to stand behind the Minister in putting across the principle that the Government elected by the people has the right to determine what any particular section of the community should get out of the national purse.  I hope that every section of the House will support the Minister in that principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the remarkable things about the expressions of opinion that we have heard on the particular difficulty that we have in Dublin at the present time is this: that the more distant a Deputy is removed from the scene of the conflict the more convinced he is that the Government is correct.  Even members of the Government Party who represent Dublin constituencies and who, I am sure, are as loyal in their support of the Party as the members of it from country constituencies, for the reason that they are closer to the problem, have not all made the same approach to this particular question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen has raised a very interesting point.  He has referred to the income of the farming community, and particularly to that of the agricultural labourers.  While he disavows any intention of using one section against another, he has made a comparison which, to his mind, justifies to a certain extent the official attitude taken up towards the teachers in Dublin. The particular booklet that he quoted from was issued by the Minister for Finance.  That is a booklet that has not received in this House the attention that it is entitled to, and especially the particular figures the Deputy referred to.  One of the features of the present dispute is not merely the question of the coming to a head of their <Col N="776" /> grievances on the part of the teachers in relation to conditions spread over a number of years&mdash;the coming to a head of an effort on their part to secure an adjustment in scales of salaries&mdash;but also to secure an adjustment in respect to the effect of these scales of salaries on their standard of living over the last six years.</P>
    <P>I wonder do Deputies appreciate that in that official booklet the only section of the community that is shown to have increased its share of the national income is the agricultural community, both the agricultural labourers and the farmers.  Nobody quarrels with that or denies that they were not entitled to such an increase, but where did the increase come from?  If one takes a graph in that booklet one will find that there has been this increase in income in agriculture, while there has been the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> in the case of those whose incomes are made up from dividends, profits and rents. The only reduction in incomes that has taken place is in the case of those&mdash; including the teachers&mdash;who are depending on wages and salaries.  I suggest that because the agricultural labourer is not getting £4 a week is no reason why the teacher is not entitled to consideration.  That would seem to be stretching the argument somewhat far, especially when we go into the record of the Government Party in regard to agricultural labourers over a recent period.  Over that period we have had encomiums poured out on the agricultural labourer, but, as far as I can see, the only time they are able to secure an improvement in their condition is when they are able to get it for themselves.</P>
    <P>At this particular stage I do not want to touch on that matter.  The issue that is before us in Dublin at the moment is far more important.  I am not concerned at the moment as a public representative&mdash;I may be as a trade unionist because my sympathies as a trade unionist are with the teachers&mdash;with the merits of this dispute on either side, but I am concerned with this fact that, half an hour ago, we were given the latest figures with regard to attendance in the schools in Dublin by the School Attendance Committee for Dublin. <Col N="777" /> These showed that 59,000 children in the City of Dublin, out of a total school population of 79,000, are not attending school.  I understand that that figure is a very carefully checked figure, and actually represents an increase on the last figure that we were given some nine days ago, of from 42,000 to 59,000. Therefore, the position is that at present we have 20,000 children attending school, and what the conditions are for those 20,000 children may be imagined.  We were told that in a school like St. Agnes's at Crumlin, the largest school in Europe, the 60 lay teachers there are absent from their duties, so that the nuns who are carrying on the school are left to handle some 3,000 children.  So far as the 20,000 children who are attending school are concerned they might as well not be at school at all.  It is certain that the physical, mental and spiritual strain imposed on those who are attempting to carry on school must be tremendous, and is gradually, I understand, becoming overpowering. Again, I want to emphasise that, so far as we in this House are concerned, the problem at the present time is that we have 59,000 children not attending school.  That has to be said without commenting on the merits of the dispute on either side.</P>
    <P>In the course of one of the replies from the Minister to a suggestion in regard to mediation, the phrase occurred in his letter that the Government could not accept the suggestion of mediation because, as the letter said, the Government itself was a mediator between the citizens and those who are employees of the State.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Government is something more than a mediator. The Government has the responsibility of governing, of carrying on the ordinary civic life of this country.  It is not a mediator.  It is the representative of the people, and not only is the Government the representative of the people but, on numerous occasions in this House we have been told that the Government is in effect this House, this legislative chamber, because it represents the majority in this House and is elected by a majority vote.  If a Government is charged with the duty of governing, it has also <Col N="778" /> the duty of trying to estimate public opinion, and of measuring that public opinion in regard to various situations that may arise.</P>
    <P>The Government has expressed the view of this particular issue that it has carefully measured up the possibility of meeting the claims made, and that it has arrived at the point where it could say that it could go no further.  That statement was made before the Minister for Finance made his Budget statement.  The unfortunate thing is that, following on that Budget statement, there seems to have been no recognition, on the part of the Government, of the fact that the situation had changed.  It may be that, up to the date of the introduction of the Budget, the Government could quite truthfully say that it was not in a position to find the additional money required, but since the Budget statement was made I do not know how that position could be maintained.  The Minister for Finance, in his Budget speech, presented the House with this statement, that without any additional taxation he had a surplus of £3,000,000.  That surplus has been allocated in different ways.  One of the forms of disposing of that surplus was to afford a reduction in income tax.  The other day we had the statement in this House that that reduction would benefit from 110,000 to 120,000 people.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that to the section of our community which is called upon to pay income tax that 1/- will not make much difference in regard to their standard of life.  Yet, there are only 110,000 or 120,000 in that group.  Here, in Dublin, 59,000 children are immediately affected by this strike.  Leave aside the claims of the teachers and deal with the question of the children and the problems which confront their parents.  Leaving aside the question whether the Government should or should not change its decision and dealing only with the possibility of easing this situation, I suggest that it would have been more public-spirited to apply portion of that surplus, used to reduce income tax, to easing this problem in Dublin.  That could readily have been done and it would have provided us with a way out of this impasse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> For a number of weeks, continuous efforts have been made not only by members of Opposition Parties but by members of the Government Party to find a way out of this impasse.  We are told that not merely is it a Ministerial decision but that it is a Government decision that there can be no change. The only solution, we are told, is that the teachers return to work&mdash;presumably unconditionally&mdash;and that, at the end of three years, the undertaking of the Government to review the scales will be given effect.  In the ordinary industrial dispute, both sides may be determined not to give away their position but there is almost always a readiness to accept some form of mediation. On one side, in this case, there has been a readiness to accept mediation and to carry on work in the meantime but mediation has been rejected by the Government, who say they are the mediators between the citizens and the employees of the citizens.  If the Government feel that this is a responsibility of which they cannot divest themselves, surely there is a higher body than the Government&mdash;this legislative chamber as a whole.  If the Government cannot take upon itself the responsibility of making adjustments and decisions which may impose, as they say, additional burdens on the taxpayers, is there any reason why that responsibility should not be left to this House as a whole?  Why should not the ordinary issue&mdash;not the issues in dispute&mdash;whether we can find a way out of this impasse which will not be objectionable to the Department of Education or to the teachers, from the point of view of safeguarding their positions, be left to the House?  I refer to a way which will open the door so far as there is an impasse and open the doors of the schools to the children who are running wild on the streets.  Let this House which, as we have been often told, elects the Government, decide whether, being representative of the people&mdash;I do not speak of any particular Party&mdash; it would be prepared to allow the issue to go to mediation.  If there was a decision by the House that that should not be done, then we should have to carry responsibility not only for the continuance of this deadlock but for the <Col N="780" /> harm that is being daily done to the children in Dublin.  If we decided that there was a way out, there could be no suggestion that any section of State employees had forced its will on the Government of the day, because the responsibility would have to be borne by all members of the House, irrespective of Party.</P>
    <P>Whether this strike is to go on until September, when the holiday period will be over, as somebody suggested, or even longer, one thing is quite clear &mdash;that, regardless of where the responsibility rests, irreparable harm is being done to a large body of children. That harm cannot be remedied in the immediate future.  Each year in Dublin, some 4,000 children are reported to the labour exchanges as finished with school and available for work.  Of those 4,000 less than 1,000 are provided with employment by the employment exchanges.  The majority of the thousand are sent into blindalley jobs such as those of messenger boys and messenger girls.  To that large number, we are to add a larger number this year.  Many of the children in their final year at school would be seeking employment for which they would have to produce the primary certificate.  They will not have that certificate in order to comply with the conditions of entrance into certain employment.  Under what conditions they are to be afforded an opportunity of securing that qualification, I do not know, and I do not think that anybody else knows.</P>
    <P>We have already in the city 14,000 youths who have never done a day's work.  Every day that passes, we are permitting some of these 50,000 school children to be affected in such a way that they will be found unsuitable for taking up such employment as may offer when they finish school.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking on this matter as a trade unionist.  On that aspect, I have quite definite views which, I suppose, are known to everybody in the House.  I am concerned with the matter as a public man, representing, like some members of the Government Party, the City of Dublin, who has the problem at his doorstep.  It is understandable that Deputies from the <Col N="781" /> country do not see the problem from the same point of view as we in the city do.  In the city, we have this large body of children running wild, in the sense that they lack discipline, and in danger from the fact that they have got to find their own sources of amusement, and sources of amusement and recreation in the city are often of the most dangerous character.  Apart from the physical strain on the parents, there is the economic strain caused by the wear and tear of shoes and clothes.  That is continuing and there is no suggestion that we can find a way out.  The suggestion that the teachers should return unconditionally is one which does not merit serious consideration from any serious-minded man.</P>
    <P>It may be quite satisfactory for the Government to take up the attitude that State servants have no right to engage in strike action.  May I ask how any section of State employees are to secure redress for their grievances if they are to be debarred from taking action which is open to any other class of workers?  Any other section, from the men cleaning the streets to analytical chemists, can go on strike to secure an improvement in their standard of life and nobody takes exception to their conduct.  It is recognised that they are entitled to withdraw their services, if working under conditions which are objectionable to them.  It is only when we come to State employees, in which category teachers are placed, that this dividing line is drawn.  It is suggested that State servants can secure redress by persuading the people to return a Government that will redress their grievances.  How one section of State servants&mdash;whether civil servants or teachers&mdash;could secure the return of a Government, which will be representative of the whole country, I do not know.  That contention does not seem to be logical. I do not see why, as an ordinary matter of justice, an employee, whether of a private or State employer, should not have the right to say: &ldquo;I am not prepared to continue in my employment under present conditions and I shall withdraw my services until I secure an adjustment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> The suggestion that it is imperilling or undermining the authority of the State, is entering into a field that so far we have been lucky to avoid in this country.  There can be no question whatever, in face of the problem we have in Dublin at the moment, that a solution along the lines of mediation, regardless of the individual to whom that mediation may be entrusted, so long as he is of such a broadminded character as to be acceptable to both sides, would in any way lower the dignity of the State or affect its standing in the eyes of the people.  I think even members of the Government Party who have spoken would be glad to see an outcome which would be acceptable to both sides.  I would suggest to them that if to-morrow morning their leaders did find it possible to accept some form of mediation, so far as the people of the country as a whole are concerned, they would regard it, not as being a backward step on the part of the Government, but as something affording the best evidence of statesmanship and a recognition on the part of the Government of their responsibility to the whole of the people and particularly to the people of Dublin and their children.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that even at this hour, if there cannot be an acceptance of mediation outside, the Government should recognise, as it has repeatedly stated, that it is not only the mouthpiece of a particular Party or of the people who have elected it, but that it is also the mouthpiece of this House in so far as it represent a majority vote in this House.  It could quite readily and quite easily, without affecting its position as an administrative body, leave this problem for settlement to the House as a whole and say that it is a problem of national importance, as certainly it is of great importance to the City of Dublin, and that the elected representatives should now take upon themselves the responsibility of judging this issue and of deciding whether or not we can find an accommodation which will allow the children of Dublin to resume attendance at school, which will afford the possibility of an examination of the claims of the teachers in a spirit of peace and calmness and which will make possible <Col N="783" /> a peaceful adjustment of this dispute. To continue as we are is going to have one of two results.  One is that the Government is successful and the teachers return to work feeling that they must continue to suffer under a sense of grievance and also feeling that they have been driven back to work.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of seeing men driven back to work under such conditions and I have never known in my experience that it has been helpful or conducive to good relations in the particular industry in which it has occurred. Certainly in a profession such as that of the teachers, where men's faculties have to be tuned to the highest pitch to get the best results, it is not going to be helpful to the children of the future if the teachers are driven back under these circumstances.  Your whole educational policy will suffer and the men and women who have to resume work under a sense of defeat will not be desirous of giving their best to the community.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we can envisage a situation where the Government would give way, I think it could not be regarded from the Government's side as a retrograde step.  At the moment there is still time for somebody to sit down and find a way out of this dilemma. It is neither a fair nor a proper attitude&mdash;certainly it is no proper acceptance of responsibility on the part of the Government&mdash;merely to say that the door is closed and that there is no way in which it can be opened except by the teachers giving way.  There is a middle course, and I suggest that just as many other issues of this character have been settled, not only between communities but between nations, by following the middle course, at this eleventh hour the Minister might indicate that it would be possible to follow the middle course and find a way out of the impasse.</P>

      <P>I understand that there is a desire to conclude the debate to-night.  I had some notes prepared which would keep me going for half-anhour but in the circumstances I shall not inflict them on the House.  There is just one matter to which I should <Col N="784" /> like to direct the Minister's attention. A census paper is at present being collected from the people on which there are five or six questions dealing with the water supplies in rural Ireland. There is no question of finding out how rural schools are situated.  Putting it in a nutshell, there is not a drop of water in any of the rural schools in the Co. Tipperary or in practically any of the schools in rural Ireland.  I need say no more, Sir.</P>

      <P>Several Deputies have referred to the injury done to the school-children by the strike. I only regret that those responsible for the strike have not had their attention called to this matter and have not had its illeffects emphasised to them in the eloquent manner in which various Deputies have spoken in the House to-day and yesterday.  Deputy Martin O'Sullivan referred to the fact that many of the children affected by the strike, and who are now absent from school, were children of the poor, badly nourished and living in a poor environment.  I think I might add that, in addition to all their disadvantages, they are now being asked to labour under a further serious disadvantage. Apparently it has been brought home to those who have been making appeals to me and to the Government that there are several thousand children leaving, or about to leave, the schools whose future is being very seriously affected by this strike. The figure of 4,000 has been mentioned by Deputy Larkin.  Deputy McGilligan and others have referred to the fact that some of these children, who are now reaching the age of 14, will have <Col N="785" /> no further opportunity for education so far as we know.  There is a still more serious situation and that is that, not alone are they being deprived of education, but their opportunities for employment, for advancing themselves in the world, for settling down and earning a livelihood, are being very seriously jeopardised.  On the 5th June next, the Department's primary schools' certificate examination is being held.  This examination, as the House will remember, was established entirely for the benefit of the pupils so that they might have, towards the conclusion of their elementary school course, reliable official evidence that they had attained a certain standard of education.</P>
      <P>The success or failure of these pupils in the examination for the certificate does not affect the teacher's standing or his financial prospects.  We can understand that the teacher may have a natural desire to have his pupils succeed and do him credit.  I think that the number of teachers who would not be anxious in normal circumstances to advance the prospects of their pupils by giving them every opportunity to sit and pass the examination would be very few.  The examination really means nothing to the teacher; but success or failure in the examination may mean a great deal to the pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are fully aware that this Department conducts this examination every year; that employers are increasingly demanding the primary certificate as the educational qualification necessary for entry into their employment.  Certain apprenticeship committees, for instance, the apprenticeship committee for house painting and decorating and the apprenticeship committee for the furniture trade in Dublin, specify the primary certificate as the educational qualification for entry to employment as apprentices.  So that the position of the boys in the back streets or in the areas where they were attending the schools which are now closed owing to the strike and who wish to go ahead for one of these trades is that if there is no examination there will be no job so far as they are concerned.  The <Col N="786" /> primary certificate is also accepted in lieu of the entrance examination in secondary schools.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the primary certificate examination is of very great importance for the pupils in the higher classes in the national schools and for that reason I have decided, in spite of the adverse conditions created by the teachers' strike, to make every effort to give the pupils here in Dublin who are eligible for the examination the opportunity to sit for it.  The fact that pupils may sit for the examination can have no effect whatever on the issues involved in the strike.  Neither side will have gained or lost anything thereby.  But, if the pupils are not given the opportunity to sit for the examination, they and their parents may suffer distinct loss, and there seems to be no valid reason why they should be subjected to the possibility of this loss without any consequent gain to anybody.</P>
    <P>In the light of these considerations, therefore, I am having arrangements made to provide facilities for the eligible pupils of schools now closed as a result of the withdrawal of teachers to sit for the primary school certificate examination and I trust that this year, as in the past, school managers will co-operate with the Department in making the examination a success.  The centres at which the examination will be held will be selected with due regard to the convenience of the pupils concerned and, if it is necessary the places in question will be communicated by advertisement in the public Press to those concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the motion in the name of Deputy Mulcahy, the Deputy must have left other members of the House in doubt, as he certainly left me, as to what was the chief argument or what was the chief reason he had in view in moving his motion to refer the Vote back.  He dealt with the general question of education, which I shall mention later, before coming on to the question of the strike at present going on among the Dublin teachers. He made no reference to the proposals which the Government had made to the teachers' organisation.  He made no criticism, and indeed very few of the <Col N="787" /> Deputies who have been making these appeals have suggested that the proposals were not fair and reasonable. If they were not fair and reasonable, it is extraordinary, as has been pointed out, that well over 3,000 teachers consider that they should have been accepted.  I should have liked Deputies to have paid more attention to the question of showing in what respect, having regard to the circumstances that have to be taken into consideration by the Government, the offer was not as I described it, fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>There is the second question whether, if, as I believe, the vast majority of our people consider it to have been fair and reasonable, the teachers were justified in having recourse to strike action.  That is a question which it will be difficult to answer.  But, for the moment at any rate, the Government are entrusted with the responsibility for the conduct of national affairs and in the decisions which they make in the general public interest they expect, and have the right to expect, that the public generally will support them.  Have the Government taken up a proper attitude in this matter, or is what they have done in the general public interest?</P>
    <P>Have Deputies been able to show that, if the Government took up another attitude, if they were prepared, as has been suggested, to make a graceful retreat, to yield gracefully, as one Deputy would have it, the general public interest would have been advanced?  I think that if Deputies will think over the probable results and reactions of that course, they will have very little difficulty in coming to the conclusion, and I think, if they had been expressing their real minds in regard to this whole matter, they would have expressed that conclusion here, that it is not possible for the Government to alter their attitude and that these appeals they have been making to me could be more appropriately and more fruitfully addressed to the teachers.</P>
    <P>The Government made their position clear in the course of correspondence and negotiation.  An effort was made during the course of this debate to <Col N="788" /> argue that it was not the question of remuneration of teachers even that was responsible for the strike, but a number of other matters.  But the correspondence and negotiation dealt with the question of teachers' remuneration. The teachers met me in 1944 and 1945. They met the Taoiseach in 1945.  I met them on three or four occasions towards the end of last year.  In addition to that, correspondence took place between the teachers and myself.  As a result of that correspondence I wrote them a letter on 1st December last in which I stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As to the contention that the Government's proposals would leave the teachers in a worse position than in 1938 when measured by their actual remuneration in relation to the cost of living, it is necessary to point out that almost all sections of the community are at present and are for some time likely to remain in this position.  This is the inevitable consequence of the war and the general circumstances of this country during the past six years.  If the proposals which I put forward on the 16th November were brought into operation the teachers would in this regard be considerably better off than other sections of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the final proposals which I communicated to the teachers, at their request, represent an extra cost of £250,000 over and above the offer to which I have just referred, made to them on 16th November.  I stated further:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You refer to anomalies and objectionable features of the existing scales as being retained or accentuated within the framework of my proposals.  This is a matter which is open to discussion, and I was and remain ready to consider the views of your organisation as to any adjustments you consider should be made and would be pleased to meet you to discuss possible improvements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have referred to the improvements which were made.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to the principles which you suggest are fundamental in the drawing up of any scale of salaries, the Government is not prepared to accept the view that all <Col N="789" /> teachers&mdash;national, secondary and vocational&mdash;should be classed together and put on common scales. Neither can we agree that there should be no distinction on the grounds of sex.  Whatever might be said in favour of this principle, the fact is that to act on it would have far-reaching results in regard to existing practice, not only in the case of teachers but also in that of a number of other classes of officers remunerated from public funds.  It cannot be applied to the teachers in isolation and, in the Government's view, the present is not an opportune time for a general review of the whole question.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that maxima should be obtained on satisfactory service, it is the considered opinion of the Government that the existing system, providing special recognition for exceptionally meritorious and efficient service, must be retained.</P>
    <P>No necessity is seen for machinery for the revision of scales of salary on a year's notice from either side.  The establishment of such machinery would introduce a highly undesirable factor of instability in the remuneration of teachers and uncertainty as to the extent of the burden falling on the community from time to time. The Government is, however, prepared to agree that any arrangement made at the present time should be open to review after a period of, say, two or three years, when it is hoped that conditions will have become well settled and prices will have reached a more stable level.</P>
    <P>As to the remaining points, I have already met you on the question of men receiving extra payment on marriage, and I am prepared to meet you also on the making of allowances towards rent in the cities and larger towns.</P>
    <P>The proposal submitted in your letter is one for the adoption of scales of salary in general equivalent to those now operating in Northern Ireland but so adjusted as to give effect to the principle of special allowances for married men.  The Government cannot accept standards <Col N="790" /> set up elsewhere as a basis for determining the scales of any class of officers remunerated out of the public funds of this State.  The determining factors must be the needs, conditions and resources of the community within the State itself and the Government could not approach the Oireachtas on any other basis for authority to impose the additional taxation that would be necessary to give effect to increases in the teachers' salaries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was in the light of that letter and the position stated clearly by the Government, as representing its view as to the only basis upon which discussions could profitably proceed, that the negotiations continued.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned to the House that, on the 10th December&mdash; that is, ten days after I had sent the letter I have just read, the teachers wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The executive sincerely hope that this is not the Government's last word on the matter, but should that be so, and should this offer of £150,000 represent the final effort of the Government to reach agreement, the executive desire to repeat what was stated to you in the course of Saturday's interview, namely, that the Dublin members of the organisation will be called out on strike on January 17th.  The executive do not wish that this should be regarded as in any sense a threat.  It is a bare statement of the course which events will eventually take if the appeal which has been made to the Government through you is ignored, and it is stated now in order to impress on the Government the seriousness of the position as it now stands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before I had time to communicate with the teachers about the matter, the paragraph was withdrawn.  On December 11, I received the following letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have learned with regret that a paragraph in the letter addressed to you on the 10th instant is regarded as containing a threat to strike.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That being so, we desire to say that the paragraph in question is <Col N="791" /> hereby unreservedly withdrawn.  We feel that, in taking this action, we are expressing the views of the whole executive.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Signed) T.J. O'CONNELL,</P>
    <P Just="Right">General Secretary.</P>
    <P Just="Right">D.J. KELLEHER,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Vice-President.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having received that letter, withdrawing the strike threat unreservedly, I met the teachers, It is suggested by Deputy McGilligan that these meetings were not, in fact, negotiations. The point is that, since the beginning, the Government had in view the special position of the Dublin teachers.  They recognised that a case could be made for the Dublin teachers which could not be made for rural teachers.  If any analogy could be made in regard to the condition of State servants, it is surely between the State servants in Dublin and the national teachers in Dublin.  Budgets were given to us of the teachers' position and the matter was referred to <i>in extenso</i> last year on these Estimates. It is quite clear that the Irish National Teachers' Organisation would not consider a separate scale for Dublin teachers.  In order to meet the wishes of the organisation and try to satisfy the body of national teachers generally, the negotiations went ahead on the basis that all teachers should be treated the same, so far as primary teachers were concerned, at any rate. In whatever part of the country they were, there was to be no differentiation.</P>
    <P>That was an attitude on the part of the teachers that the Government very much regretted, and I made it clear in my discussions with the teachers that we had particularly in mind the case of the Dublin teachers.  I think the Teachers' Organisation felt that, because I mentioned the case of the Dublin teachers and made it clear that the Government felt that their position certainly deserved consideration, I was endeavouring to drive a wedge between the Dublin teachers and the other members of their organisation, to split their organisation.  Of course, that is not the position, neither is it the position that it was because this <Col N="792" /> threat of a strike was in the background that I mentioned the question of the Dublin teachers.  I think I made that clear to their representatives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy suggests that the Government submitted to pressure. He mentioned that we had not met the teachers officially with regard to the new scales until this question of strike action loomed in the air.  If the Deputy or anyone else thinks that it was because of the threat of a strike we met them, I wish to say, and the course of events has now clearly demonstrated it to all concerned, that it was not because of that that the Government made the offer.  The position with regard to the teachers was peculiar.  They were not paid on the basis of a cost-of-living bonus.</P>
    <P>It was impossible to pick them out and say, &ldquo;Their case must be dealt with specially; we must make a special exception in the case of the national teachers, but every other class which is in receipt of wages or salaries must remain controlled by the restrictions under the Emergency Powers Acts, known as the Standstill Order&rdquo;.  That was quite impossible. That was what An Taoiseach and myself explained to the teachers in 1944-45.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, as soon as the war was over and it began to seem that we were within reach of the time when these emergency restrictions would be taken off, we at once, without any avoidable delay, went into the question of the national teachers' salaries.  They were the first section to be dealt with, and the fact that the Government took them out to deal with them primarily, as an urgent matter, shows that the Government had an interest in this question, that it was not a matter of presenting them with an ultimatum or a question of putting them aside, or a question, as Deputy Mulcahy suggests, of not treating them with consideration.</P>
    <P>According to the Deputy, the teachers were treated with lack of consideration all through last year.  The Deputy spoke at great length last year on the question of the teachers' position. This year he has not uttered a syllable <Col N="793" /> about the proposals the Government made to the teachers, whether they were good, bad or indifferent, or in what respect they were lacking.  But he comes along now and tells us that they were treated with a lack of consideration all through last year, that they were put aside and we only dealt with them when the question of the strike was mentioned.</P>
    <P>If this present unfortunate situation is to be remedied, it ought to be remedied in the quietest way possible and, as has been suggested, without raising any additional rancour or bad feeling or making the situation worse than it is.  What was originally a challenge to the Government has been made the subject of a political debate here to-day.  I do not think any Deputy examining the question seriously can deny that that is what it was.  It is now being made a political issue, the Government are being challenged in the Dáil on that issue, and the whole policy of the Government in regard to this and all ancillary matters is being challenged, or is likely to be challenged.  If Deputies cannot see that that is a natural result of the speeches and the political issue that they have made out of this strike, then they are not honest with themselves.</P>
    <P>They know very well that the remuneration of national teachers cannot be divorced from the remuneration of public servants generally.  They know that it cannot be divorced from the question of the remuneration of other sections in the community outside.  Every Deputy on the Labour Benches who has spoken&mdash;and they all have the right to speak on this matter&mdash;knows very well that if the Government are defeated on this issue, to-morrow there will be ten, 20, 100 demands from different sections, not alone those directly employed by the State, but those outside.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin suggested that there was money to spare in the Budget. The point is that this neutral State was compelling its taxpayers to pay at a rate that the Opposition Parties, year, after year, described as absolutely indefensible and as justifiable only in a belligerent State.  That was the attitude of the Opposition and the Press of this country and that was why the <Col N="794" /> Minister for Finance considered it necessary to reduce income-tax.</P>
    <P>Deputies have been shy about referring to the proposals.  So far as I know, and I have listened to most of the debate, no Deputy has said that they were unreasonable or ungenerous. A great many Deputies, when this matter was first raised in the House, were under the impression that these scales compared very unfavourably with scales elsewhere and that they were altogether below what was reasonable, having regard to the fair claims of the teachers.  We know that for years before the war, in fact all the time that the teachers have been campaigning for a settlement of this question of their remuneration, they have based their case on the scales granted to them in 1920.  I am sure there are teachers in the country, a large number of teachers, who will admit that they would be quite satisfied with the restoration of the scales granted in 1920.  When these scales were agreed upon in November, 1920, the cost-of-living figure stood at 276.  It stands around 295 now.  The Government could have said: &ldquo;We will give you the 1920 scales for which you were looking, a restoration of the position when the British Government gave you new scales of salary 26 years ago&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government went beyond that. In the case of teachers at the minimum, the proposal that I made to the teachers on behalf of the Government would have meant, both in the case of men and women, an increase of £61 over and above the scales of 1920.  At the maximum, the single man would be £25 above, the woman £62 above, and the married man £130 above. These would be the ordinary efficient teachers.  If they were highly efficient, the single man would be £18 above the 1920 figure, the woman would be £69 above, and the married man £127, at the maximum of the highly efficient scale.  In comparing these figures I have deducted, as I think I am entitled to do, the 4 per cent. pension contribution payable on the 1920 scales.  No pension contribution is payable on the scales which I offered to the teachers in November last.  The fact that reduced rates of income-tax are now operative, both here and in <Col N="795" /> the Six Counties, enables a further comparison to be made between the salary scales there and those which were offered by me.  We must also bear in mind that the scales in the North are subject to a deduction for pension contribution, usually 5 per cent., whereas here there is no pension contribution.</P>
    <P>Let us take examples.  The maximum of our scale for married men would have gone to £485 efficient, and £525 highly efficient, with rent allowances ranging from £40 in Dublin area to £10 in rural areas.  There are no such rent allowances in the Six Counties. Take the case of a married Dublin teacher and that of a teacher in the North, each having two children.  The net income for the Northerner at the maximum is £469, but our teacher would receive £512, if efficient; that is £43 more, and £544, if highly efficient; that is £75 more.  Our rural teacher with two children would receive, if efficient, £486, or £17 more than the Northerner's figure of £469, and £521 if highly efficient; that is £52 more than his colleague, allowing for the deduction in both cases of the appropriate income tax and of the 5 per cent. pension contribution in the North.  Our woman teacher would have £14 less on entering and £21 less at the efficient maximum, but would actually have £5 more in net cash at the highly efficient maximum, making the appropriate deductions for pension contribution in the Northern case, and income-tax in both.  Our single men would go from £215 to £336, efficient, and £363 highly efficient, that is £22 less for a teacher at the minimum, £56 less at the maximum for efficient rating, and £29 less at the maximum for highly efficient.  It must not be overlooked here that we are comparing a scale for single men only with a scale for men both married and single.</P>
    <P>The attitude that the Government has taken up in this matter has been explained.  I have referred to it in the Dáil and Seanad.  It was very noticeable on the Budget proposals, when this extraordinary interest that was shown in the teachers for the past two days in this House could have been more usefully and more fruitfully exploited, <Col N="796" /> that there was only one slight reference to the question of the teachers during that debate.  The demands were for increases in old age pensions and other social services.  I believe that if the Government were to take any line of retreat they would be simply abrogating their functions. I believe it would not be in the public interest that a Government which would even attempt to seek such a line of retreat in an issue of this kind, or which would allow itself to be browbeaten by any organised sectional interest, should remain a moment in office.  This Government refuses to permit itself to be put in that position. I think there has been sufficient voice given to the opinions of the ordinary person down the country, and the ordinary citizen here in Dublin, to make us all realise that the country is taking a very keen interest, indeed, in this matter.  The Government is expected to rule and if it is not able to assert its authority in matters connected with the national housekeeping, it would seem too much to expect that it is going to maintain its position and its authority in more serious matters, which happened to be raised also at the present time.</P>
    <P>There are influences and individuals abroad very anxious to fish in muddy waters, and to create as much agitation and turmoil as they can to advance whatever particular ideas they may hold although they do not necessarily hold the same ideas very long.  Unfortunately, their tendency to violent action, and to the creation of disturbance and turmoil, does not change, and with the removal of emergency controls to which these people are looking forward, and the fact that the war has ended, and that we have now a free Press, when any agitator can get publicity for himself, even though he represents nobody but himself, and cannot even allege that he is the spokesman of any substantial section, it is obvious to everybody that the Government is going to have a very difficult situation to deal with during the coming period.</P>
    <P>We have always been mindful of that.  We have realised that we were going to have that difficult situation. <Col N="797" /> I had thought the national teachers, as intelligent educated citizens, as leaders of the community, would appreciate the Government's difficulty.  Instead of that, they have rushed in and allowed themselves to be used as a spearhead, to be jockeyed into an agitation of this kind, the full dimensions of which we can only guess at.  We do not know how it will develop or what the end may be.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a much greater question at stake than the question of money.  As far as the question of money is concerned, it is not a question of the Government refusing to pay a penny more than what is just and reasonable.  It is a question of their having fairly and fully considered over a long period what was fair, reasonable and just in all the circumstances.  The Government were asked to give their final word and they gave it.  They were asked to fix a date, and before there was any question of the removal of the Standstill Order taking effect, and before much lower paid sections of the community received any intimation whatever that there was to be a removal of this control, so that they could strive for an improvement in their conditions, the date September 1st. was fixed by the Government.</P>
    <P>In fixing that date the Government had to face the fact that it was going to be regarded as D-day for a great number of people, for various other sections as well as the national teachers.  But in an effort to remove any doubt that the teachers might legitimately have as to whether we were in earnest on this matter, whether we were putting proposals before them which we meant to keep on the long finger and bring in at some date in the not too distant future, we fixed that date, not knowing at the time what the world position, the general international situation or even our own internal difficulties might be by that date.  We are in the position, as well as being the executive authority of this State, of having at our disposal all the necessary information.  By virtue of our position, we have that information and are able to judge all the relevant circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey says the question <Col N="798" /> of arbitration has not been raised. No, because, 10 years ago, when the Minister for Finance had his proposals rejected by the Civil Service organisations, it was apparently recognised, because the matter has never been raised here since, that it was impossible for the Government to hand over the determination of the remuneration of the State servants to an outside body.  No matter how anxious the Government might have been to bring in the scheme, the inherent difficulties were so great that it was impossible to satisfy the claims being made and the whole matter had to be dropped.  During the course of that debate, it was pointed out that, when the proposal for the establishment of Whitely councils was put up to the former Government, the President of the Executive Council, as he was at that time, said that the establishment of these councils and the setting up of the type of arbitration for the Civil Service which they envisaged would mean that the Government of the day would simply be divesting itself of its powers and its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>That is the position, and Deputies seem to have recognised it because they were careful to say that arbitration was not in question, but if arbitration in regard to money and the improvement of the financial proposals the Government made was in question, why all this talk?  The Government is the authority responsible for the custody of the national purse.  It is the trustee of the people, and it is its duty and responsibility to deal fairly and justly with all sections, and to see that no one section gets an advantage at the expense of others, or at the expense of the community generally&mdash; in other words, an unfair advantage. Ministers who sit at the table of the Executive know very well that it is perfectly true that the Government is in the position of a mediator.  Has the Minister for Agriculture not to put his proposals for the improvement of farming conditions, for the bettering of prices for farm produce and so on, before the Government and have not all the Ministers to express their opinions and is the decision not the collective responsibility of the Government? <Col N="799" /> So, too, with regard to the Army, the police, the Civil Service&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the hunger strikers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the imposition and relief of taxation, and the allocation of expenditure generally.  Each Minister is entrusted with the administration of a Department, but, on large questions of general policy, the decision is the decision of the Government as a whole, the collective responsibility and the collective wisdom of the Government.</P>
      <P>In viewing this situation, therefore, we have to put on one side the collective and combined wisdom of the Government exercised in this matter over a long period of time and their having given to it careful and thorough consideration, and, on the other, a body of employees who, whatever their grievances may be, have had explained to them that the Government has made its final offer.  I do not see any way out of that impasse.  I do not see how the Government can avoid its responsibilities, or hand them over to somebody else.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that mediation takes place between private employers and their employees.  That, of course, is the case.  If a private employer decides that it is economic and good business for him to increase the remuneration and to meet the demands of his employees, he is at liberty to do so.  If, on the other hand, he considers that it would be uneconomic and unprofitable for him to continue his business, that he would be running it at a loss if he acquiesced in the demands of his employees, he is at perfect liberty to close down his business. The Government and the State are not in that position.  The Government has its responsibilities, as I have said, as guardian of the national purse. The Government has, as its responsibility, too, to see that the services are maintained and that the necessary moneys are raised to enable them to be carried on.  So, too, the Government has to make provision for commitments into which it has entered or for commitments which it may enter into in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the figure of £1¼ millions, <Col N="800" /> of which, as has been stated, more than £1 million would represent new money to the lay teachers generally over and above their 1938 scales, indicated a very fair offer.  It is obvious there is a certain limit beyond which the Government, even with the best will in the world and with all the anxiety it has had to get settled this question of teachers' remuneration once and for all, cannot go.  Reference was made to cuts that were made in teachers' salaries in former years.</P>
    <P>May I point out that, at the present moment, the State is carrying a burden of £440,000 annually in respect of the superannuation of teachers and that these proposals, had they been carried into effect, would have increased the pensions accordingly, and that ultimately, in 15 or 20 years' time, the pensions bill would have risen by another £140,000.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am unfair or unjust in suggesting, because it is a point which has been frequently made to me and has been mentioned by some of my friends behind me in the course of debate, that, as well as expecting a good example and a proper lead from the teachers in times of emergency and uncertainty like those we are in at present, there is something even more personal and deeper in it in that nearly every teacher owes a debt of gratitude, whether he admits it or not, to the State, because the State has taken him and given him the position he holds. It is true that the State is not the actual employer of the teachers.  When I say that the State has given them the positions they hold, I mean that a great deal of the cost of educating future teachers and preparing them for their profession is borne by the taxpayers. In certain cases, nearly all the cost is borne by the taxpayers. Therefore, I think we have a right to expect that, in fairness and in gratitude to the community, the teachers should remember that.  After all, the Government, as I said before, are only the trustees for the community and are only acting for it and the present situation shows a lamentable lack of appreciation on the teachers' part of what has been done for them.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested then that compulsory arbitration should be <Col N="801" /> applied.  That is not practicable because the relations between the Government and its servants, or those persons paid by it, are quite different from the relations existing between the private employers and their employees. Deputies on the Labour Benches are, as we know, the first to criticise and the first to condemn any suggestion of compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The teachers have agreed to submit the matter to arbitration. There is no question about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the women teachers, it is well known that at the present moment in England a Royal Commission is sitting on this very question.  We are very prone to holding up Great Britain as an example&mdash;a shining light in matters of social and educational services&mdash;to which we here must try to aspire and attain.  In Great Britain, with its much longer record of social service and endeavour of that kind, it is only now that the question of equal pay is being examined by a Royal Commission. Obviously people are not all of the one mind on the matter nor have they all got the one viewpoint.  The last Government in Great Britain was defeated in the House of Commons by one vote&mdash;if I remember correctly&mdash;on that very question.  The then Prime Minister subsequently asked for a vote of confidence.  The Government there were not prepared to accept the principle of equal pay in the case of teachers, particularly.  I take it that, in the same way as we are, they were anxious that the general principle of equal pay should first be carefully examined in other spheres of employment before it could be accepted in the case of teachers.  I am not saying that there is not a case or that a case cannot be made, but I do say that the Government have pointed out that the present is not the time for reviewing that situation.  We must, first of all, get out of this transition period and, in making the proposals we did make, we had regard to all the relevant circumstances. It has been suggested that we should apparently have compensated the teachers fully for the increased <Col N="802" /> cost of living.  Has any section of the community received such compensation? Does any section of the community expect to receive such compensation?</P>
      <P>Deputies have complained about the advertisements that were issued by the Department of Education.  Does anybody think for one moment that if I had wanted to make the case against the teachers I could not have issued advertisements setting out comparisons with other occupations and other avocations which would, I think, have been the subject of more legitimate criticism than the ones I did issue?  The ones I did issue merely showed the actual position.  There are only five main scales and about 90 per cent. of the existing teachers are on the main scales appropriate to married men, single men, assistants, junior assistant mistresses and untrained teachers. The last class I have mentioned is a class which will disappear in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the highly efficient rating, I agree with the Deputy who pointed out that it is an incentive and a stimulus to a teacher when he knows that if he shows exceptional merit he will be rewarded accordingly.  It is not true to suggest that if the highly efficient rating were abolished&mdash;and I doubt very much if it were ever the intention to utilise it for purely financial reasons&mdash; all teachers who are efficient would automatically draw the higher salary scale of the highly efficient class.  The avenues for promotion in the teaching profession are limited; but teachers can be appointed as principals of schools and, in that respect, it is important that the manager should be able to judge as between one teacher and another.  The highly efficient rating serves the useful purpose of giving the manager an opportunity of estimating the value of the teacher's work and his efficiency in a way he could not otherwise do.  It was suggested by the teachers that there was some artificial restriction.  There is no artificial restriction on the number of teachers who can gain the highly efficient rating, if their work deserves it.  Nearly all of our inspectors have been themselves teachers.  There is an appeal board; the personnel of that board includes a representative of the teachers <Col N="803" /> and the teachers can appeal to that board if they feel they are being deprived of this highly efficient rating with its extra remuneration.  I do not believe, as I have said, that there is any foundation whatever for the suggestion that the number of such teachers is artificially restricted.  In the same way as in other walks of life, certain men attain to the heights of their profession; so in the case of teaching.  The 30 per cent., or thereabouts, which is the relative proportion of highly efficient teachers, is probably higher than what one would meet with if one applied the same standards in other professions and other avocations.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points raised.  With regard to the future, the only suggestion I can make is that, since there is no possibility of the Government altering its decision, and since it is quite clear, as I have stated before in this House, that the Government cannot be beaten and the teachers themselves quite understand that position, if when every other avenue fails, the teachers, by reason of their primary loyalty to the children and by virtue of the position they hold in the State and the work they are doing both for Church and State&mdash;if they can make a gesture, <Col N="804" /> and I suggest that they do it unconditionally, they will be doing better. They will not lose in the future; they will probably strengthen their own position generally and earn a greater goodwill if they make the gesture, since the Government cannot improve on its offer and since it is unwilling to advance further.  Because of the very serious results that will accrue to the children, the liabilities that will be imposed upon them, and the serious losses educationally should this strike go on for a considerable time, if the teachers are prepared to go back and resume their duties, their position, as I say, will be strengthened.  The only alternative&mdash;Deputy Larkin has put the case but he has, I think, tended to pass over it rather lightly&mdash;is that the Government, who are entrusted with this matter and who have given their decision after full consideration, should hand over the matter now to another body of representatives.  If it were to do that the Government would be simply handing over its responsibilities. I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 24th May, 1946.</P>
