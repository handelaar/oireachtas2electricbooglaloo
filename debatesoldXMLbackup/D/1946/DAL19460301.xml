      <Col N="1840" /> Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>127.  To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  The proceedings at a local inquiry shall be governed by the rules of evidence and the findings of the inspector upon the evidence tendered before him shall be made public within three months from the date upon which the inquiry terminated. &mdash;(Deputy Coogan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this amendment was adjourned last night, I was trying to deal with some of the objections which the Minister put forward against the acceptance of it.  So far as I could follow the Minister, he objected to the word &ldquo;findings&rdquo; in the amendment.  If that is all the Minister has to object to, we are quite satisfied to allow the Minister, instead of the word &ldquo;findings&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;report&rdquo; or the word, which he seemed to prefer himself, &ldquo;observations&rdquo;.  The amendment is a simple straightforward proposal.  It seeks to secure that the proceedings at an inquiry shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence and, secondly, that the report or observations of the inspector who conducted the inquiry shall be made public within three months.  I do not think there is anything unreasonable in that.  Not only do I think there is nothing unreasonable in it but I think it is absolutely fair, and if justice is to be meted out to the person or persons arraigned before that inquiry and who may be penalised as a result of the inquiry by the Minister, I think it is quite reasonable to ask that there should be some rules governing the procedure to be followed and that the report should be made public.  Some time ago we had what I might call an outcry in this city &mdash;indeed it was not confined to the city &mdash;in connection with the Cork Street Hospital Inquiry.  I think it true to say that not only the board concerned in that inquiry and in the Minister's decision, but a considerable body of public opinion, thought that the board <Col N="1841" /> had been unjustly treated and that there were no grounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make my case for the amendment.  The amendment asks that reports or observations made by the inspector holding the inquiry shall be made public. Surely I am entitled, with all respect to the Minister, to give an instance where not only the board concerned but the general public, the taxpayers and people who are concerned with the institution in Cork Street, believed, rightly or wrongly, that the Minister's decision in the matter was not a just or fair decision.  I am not saying whether it was or not.  I do not know because the report upon which the Minister's decision was based was not published.  The Minister suggested that, in coming to a decision on the evidence, he was not influenced in any way by the report or the observations of the inspector.  That is the suggestion he tried to convey to the House last night, that the decision was based solely on the minutes or verbatim report of the proceedings.  I cannot accept that.  We can remember some prolonged inquiries held within recent years&mdash;the Limerick one was mentioned last night, in connection with another amendment.  It lasted for 30 or 40 days; a great volume of evidence was taken; very many witnesses were examined and I am perfectly satisfied that that evidence itself, without the report of the inspector, would not have enabled the Minister to come to a <Col N="1842" /> clear-cut decision on the matter.  The Minister stated emphatically last night that there was no difference between the present system of holding inquiries and cases conducted in the courts before judge and jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I say the Minister did&mdash;and I was listening to him and following him closely.  Not only did he say it, but he repeated it and, feeling he had something very good, he rolled it over and over.  I suggest that there is something in the judge and jury method which we do not get here, the difference being that the person who is charged in court is present and can hear the judge's charge to the jury. The judge points out to the jury the value or otherwise of the evidence which has been tendered in the court on the case and tells the jury what they are to take into account and what they are not to take into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So my inspector is to tell his Minister what the Minister has to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, certainly not. The Minister is touchy about his authority and does not want to see it encroached upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about the authority of the House and the Government of the people that the Minister is touchy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No one is trying to encroach on the authority of the Minister, but there is such a thing as the rights of the people, the rights of the citizen and the rights of a board conducting, within its own sphere, part of the work of this country.  We are not going to admit that Government authority or Ministerial authority can override all other rights&mdash;that is the difference between the Minister and ourselves.  I do not admit for one moment the Minister's contention that acceptance of the principle in this amendment would in any way encroach upon his authority.  Nobody here wants to take away from the Minister the right to come to a decision, but surely we are entitled, and the public are <Col N="1843" /> entitled, to know the grounds upon which that decision is based.</P>
      <P>If a decision is reached by a Minister on a report which is known only to the inspector and to the Minister himself, surely that is little short of Star Chamber methods?  When one considers the penalty and the effect of a Ministerial decision on an official or officer, or even, indeed, on the members of a public board, one begins to wonder why even the Minister himself cannot see the justice of what we are putting forward.  Now, I am afraid that the Minister's attitude in regard to this amendment, as in relation to a number of other amendments, is founded on the fear that there is a desire here to take away from his Ministerial position the authority which he is legitimately entitled to exercise.  There is no such desire, but it is the duty of members of this House, when passing legislation, to see that we do not put into the hands of the present Minister, or any other Minister, an instrument which can be used unfairly against either an individual or a public body.  It is in order to safeguard the interests of people who may be charged in that way that this amendment is framed.  There are just two points in it&mdash;that the procedure shall be in accordance with the rules of evidence and that the report or observations of the inspector shall be made public.  It is a very reasonable demand and there is no necessity in the world for the Minister to be apprehensive or to get annoyed about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got a feeling that the line the Minister adopted in connection with the Cork Street Hospital Inquiry, and his refusal to publish the report of the inspector in that case, has led him to dig his heels into the ground in regard to this whole Bill. I do not think he is doing himself justice by that attitude.  He would be on stronger grounds and his authority and that of the Government would be reinforced if he were to say, in every case where he finds it necessary to hold an inquiry: &ldquo;I will publish the report of my inspector on the facts as ascertained by him; I will come to a <Col N="1844" /> decision on the evidence submitted to me; and, recognising that I am answerable to the Dáil and to the people, I will say on what grounds I came to that decision.&rdquo;  The Minister must recognise that, under the Constitution, he is responsible to the House and to the people; but, for some reason or other, he does not want to disclose to the House and to the people the grounds on which he comes to decisions.</P>
      <P>Is it unreasonable for the House to say to a Minister whom it elects to a responsible post in charge of a State Department: &ldquo;When you come to decisions, you ought to tell the Dáil the reasons which induced you to come to them&rdquo;?  Is it unreasonable of the House to tell the Minister that he need not be afraid or ashamed to tell the people the reasons which induced him to come to certain decisions?  After all, the House elects the Minister on the assumption that he is a responsible and capable person, capable of weighing evidence and unafraid in the discharge of his duty.  Therefore, if the Minister finds it necessary to make a decision, of a disciplinary character or otherwise, surely he must have had some reasons to influence him in that particular direction?</P>
      <P>If these reasons operate in his own mind to compel him to take a certain decision, what is the reason for the Minister's refusal to pull back the curtain and let the public and the Dáil see the mind operating in arriving at a particular decision?  The Minister takes the view that he must hide the inspector's report, although the inspector's inquiry has been conducted at the public expense; that he must not, under any circumstances, permit the Dáil, the Parliament of the people, or the people themselves, to know the contents of the report furnished by a public servant, and that the Minister is entitled, within the recesses of his Department, to come to a decision and, beyond saying &ldquo;It is my decision&rdquo;, not to disclose the reasons on which that decision was based or do anything to enable the Dáil to ascertain whether the facts as reported by the inspector justify the decision of the Minister in any particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> I think our democracy will be all the healthier if we do things publicly rather than by stealth.  What the Minister is endeavouring to do is to justify an attitude in which, privately, without any observation by the Dáil, he may come to decisions which affect the future, the whole career and, perhaps, the character of servants of public authorities who may, for all we know, be innocent, because the House has no opportunity of judging the evidence on which the Minister bases his decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he has to safeguard the authority of the Minister and the authority of the Government. I take it he is not concerned only with safeguarding his own special authority as the present Minister for Local Government; that he is not concerned really with safeguarding the Government.  It seems to me that in his desire to safeguard the Minister for Local Government and the Government, the Minister is endeavouring to create a situation in which, apparently, the ordinary citizen is to have no rights when a particular Minister, subject to all the frailties to which the human race is heir, comes to a decision in a particular case.  Has the citizen no right against the Minister?  If there is a clash of opinions and a clash in the evidence as between the Minister and an honourable citizen, must the honourable citizen fall lest the majesty of the Minister become in any way smudged? That seems to be the proposition which the Minister is endeavouring to defend.</P>
    <P>The ordinary citizen will be concerned with truth and justice in this matter and we ought to be concerned that that ordinary citizen gets a fair trial.  I do not think even the Minister's own Party would stand for downing an ordinary citizen, merely because the Minister erroneously exercises judgment in a manner calculated to harm an innocent citizen.  In a matter of truth and justice the Minister ought to have no superior authority over any citizen.  He ought to stand level with the citizen in the matter of truth and justice.  But here in this Bill the Minister is seeking to establish for himself and the Government a position in <Col N="1846" /> which there must be a security silence thrown over the report of the inspector and the Minister's reasons for coming to a decision, lest the citizen might, in the exercise of his rights, worst the Minister in a contest as to where truth and justice ought properly to lie.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given no reasons whatever, except the artificial and unconvincing reasons that if you disclose the inspector's report you, in some way not clear to anybody except the Minister, undermine the authority of the Minister.  I think the Minister's authority would be reinforced by disclosing the inspector's report and then letting the public and the House know the reasons on which the decision was based.  If the Minister will do that, I think he will be helping to create a much healthier democratic atmosphere and spirit throughout the country and, so far as he is concerned, he could rely on public opinion to take its stand in support of him if they felt he was right and, acting on their legitimate constitutional rights, to criticise him if they felt he was wrong.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to apply the rules of evidence in connection with these inquiries.  Apparently, that is not acceptable to the Minister.  Everybody has accepted that the rules of evidence are a fair code of conduct in the matter of trying persons where their livelihood and liberty are at stake, but the one Department that wants to abandon the rules of evidence as a fair code of conduct is the Department of Local Government.  It says that these are a handicap to the Department.  They cannot be if you are concerned with abstract truth and justice.  They can only be a handicap where you want to do a job on a local authority or hammer a job on an individual.  If you are concerned all the time with truth and justice, there is no reason why the law and the rules of evidence ought not to be permitted to operate, especially when the livelihood of ordinary citizens is at stake.</P>
    <P>If the Department is concerned only with ascertaining truth and applying justice, then reliance on the rules of evidence will not encumber it in the slightest way.  If the Minister feels that the citizen employed by a local <Col N="1847" /> authority should get as fair a trial at the inquiry as he would in the courts, and as he is entitled to, then he ought not to hesitate in accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, after the speech to which we have just listened, we ought at least to require responsible Deputies to read the text of the proposition which they are discussing. Deputy Norton has stated that the Minister proposes to change the law, to make what is described here as the report of an inspector a confidential document, to cover himself with a cloak of secrecy, to try to withdraw these things from the public gaze.  I have not sought to do that.  That is the allegation which has been made by Deputy Norton and the Deputy did not produce one single fact to substantiate that charge.  Does the Deputy know what the law is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has quoted it; he has told us about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The law has been settled for a generation and more in relation to the reports or the proceedings of sworn inquiries.  It is not the Minister who wants to change the law, it is the Deputy who is responsible for this amendment, because, if the law is that these reports or documents or whatever they may be can be published, why is it necessary to put down the amendment?  The present position of the law is unchallengeable. It has been defined and tested in the courts and in practice and the sole justification for this clamour on the part of the Opposition and others is not the public interest because they think that if they can compel the publication of the observations of an inspector it is going to be a political score for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a statement in Deputy Norton's speech that could not be traversed and could not be shown to be without justification and without substance.  No person who may be damnified as a result of an inquiry, and the Minister's findings on an inquiry, is without a remedy.  The <Col N="1848" /> debates which have taken place here on certain provisions of this Bill show that.  The fundamental position in regard to these matters is that the Minister concerned is responsible to Parliament, that he does publish his findings and, despite what Deputy Norton says, publishes not merely his findings but the considerations which have moved him to arrive at those findings, and the evidence upon which those findings are based. Cork Street has been mentioned in this matter. Here is published in full for the public information, and for the information of any person who is concerned, all the evidence that was taken at the inquiry.</P>

It was also stated that the Minister when publishing his findings, did not state the considerations which led him to his conclusions.  Here again is refutation of what Deputy Norton said.

The Deputy alleged that I want to change the law, so as to shroud these proceedings in greater secrecy.  That I have shown to be untrue.  What is proposed here, in Deputy Coogan's amendment, is to change the law in a significant and vital particular, which would relate not merely to whatever document contains comments made on evidence at the inquiry, but to other papers.  If there is one thing well settled in law also it is that every communication to a Minister by a servant or officer on a departmental file is a privileged document.</P>

      <P>The proceedings of Parliament are public.  Perhaps the Deputy was thinking of a star-chamber. Perhaps he wants to convert this into a star-chamber.  We know very well the mentality which still dominates the Party opposite.  Perhaps they want to create a position here in which you will have, on the one hand, a Minister and, on the other hand, a civil servant who will be the object of public debate. That is what the Deputy is trying to do.  The whole procedure is to try to erect what has been described as bureaucracy, the Civil Service, to a position of independence of the Ministers and, being independent of the Ministers, independent of Parliament, and of the people.  That is what is at issue.</P>

      <P>I was saying that this is a demand for the publication of a communication which, in certain circumstances, civil servants or officers might address to their Ministers.  You cannot stop at that.  If you were to accept that principle in relation to one matter, you would have to accept it in relation to every other matter.  Of course that is the purpose behind the amendment.  As to those who have been talking about democracy during the week, and who have been describing me as a dictator, their real purpose is to try to shackle the Minister, to make him the instrument and figurehead of his Department, instead of being what the Constitution prescribes, and what Parliament and the people expect him to be, the effective head of his Department with a right to come unfettered, except by law, to decisions in regard to any matter which his judgment tells him are wise decisions.  That is what is at stake.  How could a Minister come to an unfettered decision, how could he act in the free exercise of his judgment and opinion, if he knew that he was going to have to justify that judgment in face of observations made by an officer of his Department?</P>

      <P>That is not what is here.  If Deputies have put down amendments, would they at least realise what they are?  This amendment asks, among other things&mdash;it asks something else as well&mdash;that the findings of the inspector upon the evidence tendered before him shall be made public within three months from the date upon which the inquiry terminated. What is the purpose of that? What purpose is sought to be served by that, except to set up the opinion of an officer of the Minister as against the Minister's decision?  Is not that the purpose of it, so that those who are in political disagreement with the Minister may challenge the conduct of the Minister if the Minister ventures to override the judgment of his own officer?  Is not that the purpose of that?  Has it any other purpose than that?  I contend that, so far from serving the public interest, if the Dáil were to be sufficiently misguided to adopt this, it would tend the other way because, remember this: the Minister is head of the Department and if any question of conflict arose between the Minister and his servant the Minister might have political embarrassments in dealing with the misrepresentations of the Opposition, as he has had continuously during this Bill, but the position of the civil servant would not be a very comfortable one either and he might be very careful before tendering any advice to his Minister to try to find out what sort of advice the Minister would expect him to give so that this public conflict would not arise between himself and the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am pointing out that, so far from getting the unbiased and unfettered advice or observations of any officer, a proposal of this sort will tend to make the officer very careful to ensure that his opinions and the views which he expresses coincide with the views that the Minister may hold.  That is in fact a real danger.  The best way and the <Col N="1853" /> only way in which this can be decided is that these documents should continue to be regarded henceforward, as they have always been, as confidential.  They have always been regarded as confidential and privileged and the courts have declined to require the Minister to produce them.  That is the position and that is the position which I hope this House will maintain. That is why I hope it will reject this amendment and end this thing once and for all.</P>
      <P>Let me say this, that the person appointed to hold an inquiry is an officer of the Minister.  He is not, however, the only officer who is responsible for considering the evidence.  We do not go to the trouble of having a verbatim report of the evidence prepared merely for the comfort and guidance of the inspector.  The evidence of all these inquiries is studied by several minds.  Some will point out the significance of certain things that are said; others will perhaps find other aspects of the matter that require attention and consideration. It is as a result of the collation of all the facts which are published and which are before the Minister and his own individual study of the evidence that the Minister comes to a decision and publishes his findings.  This thing is not done in an arbitrary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This thing is not done in an arbitrary way.  As a rule the inspector is a senior officer of the Department but there are officers of higher rank above him who have to be satisfied that the inquiry has been conducted fairly, who have to be satisfied that any observations the inspector may make on the evidence are well founded and who have to study the matter independently for themselves. A reference was made here to the report of the Limerick Gas Works Inquiry.  There was a considerable delay in the publication of that report. That delay was due entirely to the fact that practically every page of the transcript was closely studied by several officers in my Department and <Col N="1854" /> the great bulk of the evidence, such as was relevant, was read by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Some reading, yes, and that applies to every important inquiry, but the issues were such that before I allowed any findings to go out, before I arrived at them, I took pains to satisfy myself, as I always do, that they were well founded and they were, from that point of view, my findings, arrived at after discussion of every aspect of the evidence with my senior officers and fully armed with such observations as the person who held the inquiry on the technical side of it wished to make.  That is the position and I do not think there is any other procedure that will ensure that the purpose of these sworn inquiries will be fulfilled.  They are not, as I said last night, judicial proceedings.  They are proceedings to ascertain facts, to ascertain whether administration has been sound and efficient and good.  No question of law arises or, at least, arises only very seldom.  What is involved is the conduct of individuals, whether individuals have been careful to see that the undertakings for which they have to be responsible have been properly carried on, whether they have been careful to see when they are dealing with public moneys and with contracts that everything is done in due and proper order; when they are responsible for keeping stores, to see that they will properly account for these stores.  These are all matters of fact, facts which are, as I have said, recorded and which are studied by the Minister.  If the inspector or auditor reports that he has found a deficiency in certain stores and if the person who is asked to account for that deficiency on oath is unable to give a reasonable explanation, is unable to give an explanation which holds water in the eyes of the Minister, ultimately, what virtue is there in his finding justification in the eyes of someone else?  It is the Minister, whoever he may be for the time being, who is responsible to his colleagues in the Government in the first instance, under the doctrine of collective responsibility which is enshrined in our Constitution, for ensuring that he does his duty and seeing <Col N="1855" /> that the local administration of this country is properly carried out and is above reproach.  It is the Minister who, subsequently, is also responsible to the Dáil on the same grounds and, of course, through the Dáil, to the community as a whole and, so far as he is a citizen, to every individual within that community.  That is his primary responsibility.</P>
      <P>If a man does not do his duty as a local officer, or if an elected body does not function properly as an elected body, the Minister is concerned with that naturally.  But he is not concerned to protect those people in their official positions.  He is concerned to see that the public interest is placed above every other interest.  Therefore, it is not necessary that he should be satisfied that a criminal offence has been committed.  All he is bound to see is that the person has so conducted himself in his office as to put it beyond doubt that he is a trustworthy and competent person and fit to continue in that office.  No person should hold an office of public trust, whether as a member of a board or as an officer of a board, who is not competent, trustworthy and above suspicion.  If there is a person holding a responsible position in whom the fullest trust and confidence cannot be placed by the public, it is the Minister's duty to see that that person will not be in a position to abuse his trust and, if necessary, because there is no other way to do it, to remove that person from his office. That is how the Minister must function because, as I said, he must put the public interest above everything else and he must be careful to ensure that the ratepayers and the taxpayers will have confidence in all their officers. That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in the exercise of that, the Minister has had to take drastic actions on occasions.  It has been alleged here that the persons affected by his actions have no redress.  That is what Deputy Coogan was saying, what Deputy Morrissey was saying, and what Deputy Norton was saying. It is quite true that, if a person is removed from office under a public authority, his future will be very precarious.  But the Minister must take that also into consideration and, therefore, <Col N="1856" /> before the Minister does anything which reflects either on the elected members of a local authority or an officer of a local authority, he has to be satisfied in his own mind as the judge in this matter that he is fully justified in the drastic steps which he proposes to take.  That is the first safeguard the person has.  Is it alleged that because the Minister, first of all, secures the confidence of the people at an election at which his whole public record and character are before the people for judgment, because the Minister secures an expression of public confidence from a great number of people who know him very well and to whom he is no stranger, and then comes along to this House and secures the confidence at least of a majority of the House and the confidence of his colleagues in the Government, he is going to act unjustly or is less capable of doing justice to any man than any judge on the bench?</P>
    <P>We who come to Ministerial office have to go through a very hard trial. Office is not thrust on us by accident. We have to justify ourselves and everything we do to the public.  There is no other person in this country who is in precisely that position.  Judges do not have to justify themselves beyond the rightness of their decision; nobody else has to do it; but we have.  We function in the public eye all the time and, therefore, because his reputation for justice, honesty and probity is as dear to a Minister as to any other citizen, we are careful to ensure that our decisions will stand the test of criticism and will stand the test of discussion and examination such as we have had here.  I am saying that as a preliminary to the point I am going to make now.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that the person who has been affected by the decision of the Minister, arrived at in these circumstances, with that background, and with these considerations before him, has no redress.  That it not true. Every Deputy must be aware of the fact that it is not true, because at least once a year the conduct of every Minister in the administration of his Department comes before Parliament, and there is nothing that the Minister has done in his administrative capacity <Col N="1857" /> during the preceding 12 months that cannot be discussed here on his Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first point.  Automatically, every 12 months the conduct of a Minister in the administration of his Department comes before Parliament for review, and if the Minister has been guilty of any unjust conduct, any wrongful conduct, those who believe him to have been guilty of it have a full opportunity to ventilate the matter here in the high court of honour.  More than that, if there is any particular matter with regard to the Minister's Department which Deputies consider of sufficient urgency and importance to raise specially, they can put down a motion and the whole matter can be debated and decided here.  Cork Street Fever Hospital has been mentioned in the course of this debate, drawn in by a side-wind.  Let those who think that the Minister's decision in that regard was unjustified put down a motion and let them prepare to justify to the public some of the matters I referred to in this report.</P>

      <P>It is a long time since the report was published and, though Deputies have been careful to state that there has been public uneasiness, what proof have we of this alleged public uneasiness?  I am not unaware of the fact that an attempt <Col N="1858" /> was made to get up a petition many months ago and that in certain premises in this city customers going in about their ordinary business were being plagued to sign the petition.</P>
      <P>I am not unaware of the fact that, at least, one newspaper in this country has been conducting a sort of campaign in regard to this matter, but I have seen no signs of uneasiness on the part of the general public notwithstanding the attempts that were made to create uneasiness in the public mind.  On the contrary, I think that the ratepayers of Dublin who have to provide many thousands for the upkeep of that institution are better pleased that it is being administered now by a person who is in close contact with the day-to-day running of that establishment, and who will make certain that it will be reorganised on such a basis that, for every penny of public money that is spent on it, a full pennyworth of value will be secured.  That is what we are concerned to see.  There must be somebody to protect the people who pay for these things, and it is on the Minister that the responsibility for protecting the ratepayers and taxpayers has been imposed.  All that we have done in regard to Cork Street has been to put a person in there who will be able to devote, for the time being, such an amount of attention to the supervision of those who are administering that institution that henceforward, when it reverts to its former position, we will be satisfied that the institution is well organised and is well run, and that, as I have said, the ratepayers of Dublin City and County who mainly maintain it will be getting full value for their money.</P>

      <P>I want to reiterate what I have already said, that the purpose of this amendment is to provide certain legal safeguards for parties who may find themselves confronted with a public inquiry. Beyond that I am not going one inch, but right through this debate the Minister has sought to distort the <Col N="1859" /> purpose of the inquiry, and to distort the arguments that have been made in favour of the amendment.  Now, the Minister has given us a dissertation on constitutional law.  I want to impress upon the Minister that, in this matter, I am only concerned to ensure that the Minister's own decision shall be in accordance with the law, and shall be subject to the rule of law.  What I am concerned with in this is to prevent anything in the nature of an arbitrary decision being arrived at by the Minister or his subordinates without regard to the evidence upon which they act. The rule of law is a fundamental principle in our Constitution, and it simply means that every citizen shall be equal before the law.  It also means that every action taken whether by the Minister, or by the officers of State, shall be in accordance with the law.  I am asking no more than that.  I am endeavouring to ensure, by providing some legal safeguards in the holding of public inquiries, that the exercise of arbitrary and autocratic power will not be possible.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the past, but there have been concrete cases where officers were removed by the exercise of arbitrary and autocratic power.  It is futile for the Minister to argue that these officials have redress because Deputies, once a year, can criticise the Minister's administration, and raise the question of the particular person concerned.  What redress is that to the person?  He has gone, and he has no appeal to any court.  That is the very point that we are arguing here.  It is poor consolation to any individual who has been removed by the arbitrary exercise of Ministerial power to know that some sympathetic Deputy will raise his case once in 12 months, or, perhaps, once in a lifetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my position on this amendment. I am sorry that the debate has gone to such inordinate lengths, but I see no way out now other than that of a full answer to the Minister.  At the risk of being put in the same position as Deputy Byrne was, when he quoted a certain document, I am going to quote from the same document.  I may say I got this document in the Library <Col N="1860" /> of the Oireachtas.  It happens to be the official report of a committee that was set up by the British Government, and mind you the devil, on occasion, can quote Scripture in his own defence.  I see no objection to a Deputy quoting in this House the findings of a committee set up by another Parliament if he is satisfied that the recommendations of that particular committee are pertinent to a discussion here, and if he is satisfied that the personnel of that committee were such as to command public confidence, not only in another country but in any country in the world.  When Deputy Byrne did so he was reminded of his attendance at royal coronations and funerals and that sort.</P>
    <P>This committee was entitled: &ldquo;Committee on Ministers' Powers&rdquo;.  It was set up in October, 1929, and reported to the British Parliament in May, 1931. It considered this very question that is now at issue before this House.  I want at the outset to make a few quotations from the report of that committee on this question of the exercise by Ministers of judicial and quasi-judicial functions.  The Minister to-day admitted that the functions that he exercises are judicial.  The committee in their report say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be convenient if, on the threshold of our report, we state our general conclusion on the whole matter.  We do not agree with those critics who think that the practice is wholly bad&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the position that I am taking up and have taken up all through on this Bill.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We see in it definite advantages, provided that the statutory powers are exercised and the statutory functions performed in the right way&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to mark this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But risks of abuse are incidental to it, and we believe that safeguards are required, if the country is to continue to enjoy the advantages of the practice without suffering from its inherent dangers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They go further in this very connection to say that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What people want is security for <Col N="1861" /> justice, and the only security for justice is law publicly administered&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now my entire argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There has not been any other Committee.  I know the Minister has already argued that this committee sat and gave its findings, but that its findings were never translated into law.  All that I can say on that issue is this: that the British Government must be suffering from the same disease that our Government here is suffering from, that when they set up commissions to investigate very high sounding policy, and when these commissions come back with a report which the Government does not like, or did not anticipate, they pigeon-hole it.  The committee in its report quotes from a book entitled <i>The New Despotism</i> by the late Lord Chief Justice of England.  The quotation is pertinent to this question of decisions being arrived at within the privacy and secrecy of Government Departments. The Lord Chief Justice says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;How is it to be expected that a party against whom a decision has been given in a hole-and-corner fashion, and without any grounds being specified, should believe that he has had justice?  Even the party in whose favour a dispute has been decided must, in such circumstances, be tempted to look upon the result as a mere piece of luck.  Save in one or two instances, none of the Departments publishes any reports of its proceedings, or the reasons for its decisions, and as the proceedings themselves, if any, are invariably held in secret, even interested parties have no means of acquiring any knowledge of what has taken <Col N="1862" /> place, or what course the Department is likely to take in future cases of the same kind that may come before it.  A Departmental tribunal is, however, in no way bound, as a court of law is, to act in conformity with previous decisions, and this fact is commonly regarded as one of the reasons for the policy of secrecy. However that may be, the policy is fatal to the placing of any reliance on the impartiality and good faith of the tribunal.  It is a queer sort of justice that will not bear the light of publicity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that opinion is from no less an authority than the late Lord Chief Justice of England, and it was on this very issue that we are discussing here. The Minister has said that the law in this matter is settled.  So far as I know, the law in this matter is entirely unsettled.  If the Minister has in mind the case of <i>Rex v. Local Government Board Ex parte Arlidge</i>, away back in 1914, there was a remarkable conflict of judicial opinion there.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be dragged into the Cork Street Hospital <Col N="1863" /> Inquiry.  Let us consider this question without going into the matter of the Cork Street Hospital Inquiry.  The Minister gave us cases of constitutional law, and he instanced the institution of powers which are separated into three well-known compartments: the executive function, the judicial function and the administrative function; but he stopped short there, and gave us no indication of matters which have arisen through our written Constitution, nor any indication that there is anything to ensure that one of these powers will not encroach on the other. Naturally, the Legislature is jealous of its jurisdiction; the judicature, naturally, is also jealous of its jurisdiction; and the Executive is not only jealous of its power but, judging by present indications, it wants to take everything into its maw.  Like Gargantua, the more you feed into its maw, the more its appetite grows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, on this question of legal decisions and quasi-legal decisions, the Minister, last evening, gave me clearly to understand that the procedure was no different in our courts when a judge and jury tries an action.  I do not want to go back over that ground, but I should like to know who is to be the judge.  According to the Minister himself, he is to be the judge.  Then, who are to be the jury? The great weakness in that argument is that when the jury retires to consider its answers to certain questions put to it by the judge, they have had the advantage of listening to the witnesses. They have seen the witnesses and they have been able to form an impression of their character and credibility.  They have heard the witnesses on direct examination.  They have heard them cross-examined and they could form a very good opinion of their credibility and character.  No such thing can happen in the case of the Local Government Department. The only person who has seen the witnesses is the inspector who has held the inquiry.  He might advise the Minister's advisers as to the credibility of the witnesses, but he is the only person who has seen those witnesses in action and who can give the Minister an authoritative opinion as to their worthiness as witnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an entirely different procedure from that which obtains when a judge and jury sit in connection with a matter.  Furthermore, as Deputy Morrissey has pointed out, the jury have been sitting for a period of days. They have had the advantage of hearing counsel for the prosecution and the defence.  They have also had the advantage of hearing the judge sum up. Furthermore, the judge is the absolute arbiter so far as the law is concerned and the jury must accept his rulings on matters of law.  They can find only <Col N="1866" /> on the facts.  There is no analogy whatever between the two forms of procedure.  The Minister went on to tell us that, in certain cases, proceedings are held on documentary evidence. That is so but he forgot to mention that the great majority of cases on appeal are decided on oral evidence. We have the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court.  Having regard to the fallibility of human nature, human judgment, understanding and knowledge and the fallibility of judges, we have seen fit to provide a system of appeals from the lowest court in the land to the highest court.  The majority of those appeals will be by way of oral hearing.  In other words, the judge on appeal will have the advantage of a full oral hearing on retrial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They go to the Supreme Court only on matters of law. But in the case of the ordinary appeal to the High Court on circuit, you have a full oral hearing &mdash; an entirely different proposition from that indicated by the Minister.  In any event, there is no appeal from the Minister's decision.  The only appeal he has admitted to to-day is this peculiar suggestion that an aggrieved party might have his case raised in the House on the annual Estimates &mdash; a poor form of redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this matter of decisions, there are four requisites to any normal hearing &mdash; (1) the presentation of the case by the parties to the dispute; (2) if the dispute is a question of fact, the ascertainment of the facts by means of evidence adduced by the parties to the dispute, with the assistance of counsel; (3) if the dispute is a question of law, the submission of legal argument by the parties and (4) the decision, which disposes of the whole matter by the finding on the facts.  These are the normal ingredients in a court case. Take the ingredients in the Minister's case.  Requisites (1) and (2) are present but you rarely get the third and you do not get the fourth, whereas in a court of law you have a full, <Col N="1867" /> reasoned judgment in which the judge gives his grounds for coming to the conclusion he has reached on the case before him.  Having regard to that fact, this committee held that the proceedings of the Ministerial tribunal should be such as would leave no doubt in anybody's mind that justice had been done.  Furthermore, they strongly recommended that the rules of natural justice, so far as they could be applied, should be applied to such proceedings. The first and most fundamental principle of natural justice they held to be that a man may not be a judge in his own cause.  They went on from that to argue that, in very rare circumstances, can a Minister be a disinterested party as between even a local authority and the Minister or between an official and the Minister and they urged that, for that reason, it was necessary that the Minister's powers should be carefully curbed and the proceedings safeguarded.  They made this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are of opinion that, in considering the assignment of judicial functions to Ministers, Parliament should keep clearly in view the maxim that no man is to be a judge in a cause in which he is interested. We think that, in any case in which a Minister's Department would, naturally, approach the issue to be determined with a desire that the decision should go one way rather than another, the Minister should be regarded as having an interest in the cause.  Parliament would do well in such a case to provide that the Minister should not be the judge but that the case should be decided by an independent tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the case I have been arguing throughout this debate.  You have that position in the Department of Industry and Commerce where the tribunals set up are usually conducted by lawyers, with the assistance of lay assessors. You have the same position in the police.  When charges are preferred against an individual member of the police, a board of officers is set up if the charges are denied.  That board inquires into the charges and arrives at its findings.  They say whether the <Col N="1868" /> party charged is guilty or not guilty. If the board find that he is guilty, then the Commissioner may impose disciplinary punishment.  If the board find that the charges are not proven and that the person charged is not guilty, that is an end of the matter. That is an entirely different proceeding from that of a tribunal in the Local Government Department.  In the Army, a soldier has a right to court-martial and the Minister does not interfere.  I cannot see why the Minister should worry himself in these matters, why he should not rid himself of these judicial functions by handing them over to an independent tribunal.  In that way, he would relieve himself of considerable responsibility.  He would be doing himself justice and he would be bringing about a position which would be fair to himself and his Department and to the aggrieved party.  &ldquo;The second principle of natural justice,&rdquo; this committee says, &ldquo;has two aspects.  No party should be condemned unheard&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put forward these as cogent reasons for my argument. As a matter of natural justice, it can be argued, the committee says, that a party is entitled to know the reason for a decision at which a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal has arrived.  The parties should be informed of the decision and the report of the tribunal should be published to them.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That a Select Committee of the Dáil be appointed to consider and report upon the extent to which the growing practice of legislation by Order, without the prior approval of the Oireachtas, is inconsistent with <Col N="1869" /> the powers which the Oireachtas should exercise under the principle of democratic government as enshrined in the Constitution.&mdash; Deputies Anthony and Byrne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment on the last evening I endeavoured to show that there was a case of necessity for the existence of this system by which the broad principles and essential parts of legislation are provided for in an Act of Parliament and the subsidiary details, particularly the administrative details, are then worked out by the Minister and published as Orders under his name.  That delegated legislation is essentially subordinate in nature and the conclusions arrived at, both from reason and supported by the investigations of the Donoughmore Committee and others, were that the practice was advisable, that in any case it was inevitable under modern conditions, and that it was becoming more and more necessary as the functions of Government were taken up with the details of everyday life more and more as time went on. Further reasoning brings us to another conclusion and again it is a conclusion supported by the investigations carried out by the committee of which I have spoken.  That is, that there is clearly a danger in this system, a danger of the Executive possibly acting beyond the will of Parliament.  We may as well face the fact that there is a problem here and it is not a problem peculiar to this country.  It is not a problem that, as some members on the Opposition tried to make out, is peculiar to the present time here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been convenient for a certain line&mdash;I cannot call it policy&mdash;recently to work up certain catch-cries, and it is convenient for them to advert to this question of Statutory Rules and Orders now.  I should like to remind the House, however, that this problem has arisen in England, perhaps more acutely than here, and that it is a problem for all democratic Legislatures at present.  In facing up to this problem, it is accepted that the system must be worked and the question is how to work it.  How to work it turns upon the question of safeguards. <Col N="1870" /> What are the safeguards that are necessary?  The safeguards are these: firstly, that the Orders remain always subordinate to Parliament. Nobody can suggest that this House has not complete power to revoke or alter in the appropriate way any Order of the Minister; the supremacy of this House remains as it has been and as it is.</P>
    <P>The second safeguard is that it is desirable that members of the Oireachtas should have access to these Orders.  I do not think anyone will deny that it has been the practice, in the case of Statutory Rules and Orders generally, to place them on the Table of the House.  In most cases I think there is a provision of annulment within a period of time.  If that is not sufficient notice, it is difficult to see what would be.  Not only are safeguards provided in the House itself but there are other safeguards for the public.  Reason dictates that safeguards be provided, and again it is a question for the House to see how far they have been carried into effect. Publicity, for instance, is one obvious safeguard.  What is the publicity afforded?  In the case of every Statutory Rule and Order, notice of its enactment will be published in the Official Gazette&mdash;<i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  In addition to that, the Order itself is printed and is available at the Stationery Office.  There are copies at the Stationery Office for anyone to buy.  I might qualify that by saying that during the emergency certain emergency Orders were roneoed off, prior to printing, in order to save time, but definitely in regard to ordinary Rules and Orders, which I understand form the subject of this motion, they are printed and on public sale at the Stationery Office. What other publicity can you have within reason?  Of course it is open to every diligent member of the House to secure copies of these Orders.  He can read the gazette to find out what they are, what they relate to and where they are.  He can then, if he is energetic enough, go down and purchase a copy and if he does not like the terms of the Order and wishes to criticise it, he can put down a motion for that purpose in this House.  What <Col N="1871" /> more do Deputies want in the line of safeguards, from the point of view of publicity and questioning the matter in the House?</P>
    <P>To return to the Donoughmore Report, the Donoughmore Report mentions safeguards and proceeds to deal with such matters as the need for having the powers of delegation clearly defined.  If any Deputy cares to inspect the normal peace-time enactments of this House, I think he will find that the powers of the Minister to prescribe regulations are strictly confined to certain matters, that there is no general power to enact or no power that would give a Minister an opportunity of overriding an Act.  In certain cases&mdash;I think the Road Traffic Act might be one&mdash;you will find the actual matters about which the Minister can legislate enumerated alphabetically. I do not see how you can go further in circumscribing and defining the matters about which the Minister can make regulations, unless, of course, you are going to tie him and prevent him making any effective regulations at all and then you are in the danger, of which I spoke previously, of having the intention of an Act of Parliament negatived by the absence of administrative detail for its implementation.</P>
    <P>This logically leads to consideration of the famous Henry VIII clause.  That was a clause that virtually delegated complete legislative powers in certain matters to a Minister.  That clause you will find is exceptionally rare in modern delegated legislation and the recommendation of the Donoughmore Committee was that it should be used only for very grave and serious reasons. Again I suggest to Deputies who are interested in this matter to examine the statutes which have been passed by this Parliament.  Let them take the sections which empower Ministers to make Orders and they will find that this type of clause is of very rare occurrence.  I do not know myself of any such clause in normal peace-time Orders.  One could go further into detail in regard to this matter but, as I had already taken up a good part of the time of the House before the adjournment, I do not <Col N="1872" /> propose to go into the question further.  I would ask Deputies who support this motion what other method for making democratic government effective can you have?  Is it seriously proposed that we should legislate for every little detail in this House?  Let them ask themselves that question and give an honest answer to it.  When they do, they will find they have to delegate power to some executive body &mdash;and what better executive body can there be than a Minister of State? Ministers are responsible to this House and it is not the practice to delegate to anyone else the powers to make Orders.  The House also has complete control of penalties, as it is not the practice to delegate the power to inflict penalties.  Again I ask what other system can the House have to make democratic institutions effective in practice?</P>
    <P>To return to the terms of the motion, the proposers ask to have a select committee set up.  The next question then is&mdash;what is the need for such a committee?  Again, what can such a committee find out?  Here is a problem that has been examined exhaustively and in detail.  We have the Donoughmore Report of 14 years ago, we have books published on it from both points of view, we have had the Ministerial answers and the Opposition speeches in this House and in many other Houses.  The problem has been thoroughly examined and there is an inevitable conclusion, both from reason and on the findings of those investigations.  Delegated legislation by order is a necessity.  There is unanimity in regard to the safeguards that should be observed.  Why, then, waste the time of this House with a committee to examine such matters?  The members of the House would be much better concerned&mdash;as they are concerned&mdash;with the legislation going through.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is no case for a committee, that the practical problem before us is to continue to work our institutions.  In order to administer the law and keep the functions of government going, Ministers will be making Orders from time to time, as may be necessary, and this <Col N="1873" /> House can keep its control on  Orders.  Any Deputy can ask questions or move motions here and so keep the Minister within bounds.  The exercise of that safeguard is much more desirable than the setting up of an academic committee to consider something already sufficiently discussed. While the committee may be sitting and considering, and in the end only coming to conclusions already come to, the necessary work from day to day may be neglected.  For that reason, I suggest that no case has been made for the appointment of a committee.  We are all agreed that there is an inherent problem in this matter, and we can be equally agreed that the only one way to solve it is to provide certain safeguards.  In other words, we should make democracy work instead of hindering democracy by some of the talk indulged in by some Deputies who have supported this motion.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, while sympathising with the desire of the proposer and seconder of this motion to guard our fundamental Parliamentary rights, I do think it is unnecessary to set up any select committee and I would recommend to the House that that should not be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the reasoned remarks by Deputy de Valera on this motion.  I think he has put the case fairly and squarely.  At the same time, I do not agree that he has made a case against setting up a committee of the House to investigate this problem.  We know that the matter has been fully investigated in other countries and that certain conclusions have been reached as to the safeguards necessary to prevent the arbitrary exercise of power by Ministers.  We have, however, the position in this House that, in Bill after Bill introduced here, the Minister in charge is seeking to secure to himself the most despotic power. Not only that, but he is seeking to secure to himself the final arbitration in any matter of dispute that may arise in the administration of the Act.  We generally find the phraseology in all these Bills now that &ldquo;the decision of the Minister in this matter shall be final and conclusive&rdquo;.  In other words, <Col N="1874" /> we have reached the position where, in measure after measure, the aim is to circumvent an appeal to the courts.</P>
      <P>I am not going to argue that this system of delegated legislation is inherently bad.  Having regard to the complexity of our modern life and to the growth of economic and social legislation as a result, we are compelled to delegate our powers to Ministers and subordinate authorities.  My quarrel is that, in this delegation, we are not safeguarding the rights of the citizen as against the Minister.  The recommendations put forward by the Sankey Committee, presided over by Lord Donoughmore, are, on the whole, sound.  I would entirely agree with the present system, if there were a right of appeal to the courts of the land, that is, in a matter of dispute as between John Citizen and officialdom, if the final word did not rest with officialdom but the aggrieved citizen had the right to appeal, not to the Minister but to a court.  That may give rise to a host of cases and a lot of litigation and might inevitably lead to our having to consider setting up some sort of administrative court to deal with matters of that kind.  I think that is inevitable, if legislation is to continue on the modern lines we have at present.  The need of a select committee would be apparent to the Deputy if he were listening during the last couple of days and saw the attitude adopted by the Minister for Local Government on the Local Government Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to this position, that the Minister says: &ldquo;I will not be advised by an independent tribunal, neither will I be advised by a tribunal of my own subordinates.  I refuse to become the agent or servant or instrument of my subordinates in my Department.  I refuse to be bound by their recommendations or decisions and neither will I agree to the setting up of an independent tribunal.&rdquo;  That mentality is very nearly the mentality of Louis XIV&mdash;&ldquo;I am the State&rdquo;&mdash; and throughout this debate the Minister has been emphasising: &ldquo;I am the Minister for Local Government, I am the final arbiter.  I am the person vested with jurisdiction under the <Col N="1875" /> Constitution and I alone will decide these issues.&rdquo;  That may be all very well, but it is quite possible to conceive that in certain cases, perhaps with a political complexion, the Minister so minded is not entirely unbiased and that he cannot be trusted with a judicial decision in matters of that kind, that his outlook from the start is biased.</P>
    <P>It is fundamental in our law that no man should be the judge of his own cause and, when you vest powers of the extraordinary nature that you are getting under present-day legislation, you have to ask yourself what is the protection to be afforded either to the official or the citizen when the Minister concerned comes to exercise his powers?  What redress has he?  None whatever that I can see.  The citizen is concluded.  The Minister to-day, dealing with this matter, says that the aggrieved official or citizen has a very welcome form of redress; the matter may be raised once a year or once in a lifetime on the annual Estimate relating to the Minister's Department in this House.  What in the name of Heaven redress is that for the unfortunate official aggrieved by the Minister's decision, or the unfortunate citizen who has been turned down in some matters by officialdom?</P>
    <P>The essence of all administration and law is that it should be as open as possible, that there should be nothing of a secretive or hidden nature about the matter, that a decision, when reached, should be founded on definite grounds and that the citizen or official who is aggrieved by that decision should have the grounds communicated to him.  When you hand over to a Minister the right to decide certain issues, in practice it means that you are handing over to some anonymous official the right to decide these matters.  If he does not decide them <i>per se</i>, he will have a large influence in bringing the Minister's mind to bear upon them.  It is quite conceivable that in very busy Departments it would be a physical impossibility for the Minister to decide petty matters.</P>
    <P>The weakness of the system is that, first of all, the decision reached by the <Col N="1876" /> Minister is reached in the conclave of the Government office; it is reached behind the back of the party interested in the matter; it is reached in an atmosphere of secrecy, perhaps of suspicion.  The aggrieved party has no opportunity of challenging the decision.  He is concluded by the particular Act.  He has no access to the courts to ventilate his grievance and, furthermore, in the process of reaching this decision, he has no means of challenging the officials who are ruling against him.</P>
    <P>It may be inevitable that this procedure has to be adopted.  I am not questioning that, but what I do question is that where decisions are reached and they lead to grievances, then the citizen or the official so aggrieved should have the right to have an appeal to the courts and have the matter fully thrashed out where the parties to the issue can be examined and cross-examined in the full publicity of a court of law.  That is one point I would like to make.</P>
    <P>The only other thing I would like to mention is that in all these matters we have to bear in mind that the Minister is not entirely disinterested, that very often he is an interested party and, in any case, where the Minister has an interest in a decision, then I think he should not have the power to reach a final decision at all&mdash;that some independent tribunal or method should be found in order to get a fair and equitable decision.  The mentality displayed by some of the Ministers is such&mdash;I am not saying they are all suffering from this mentality, far from it&mdash;as to raise seriously in the minds of every Deputy the necessity for setting up some form of safeguard of the kind I have indicated and of the kind I have been trying to get the Minister for Local Government to accept under the Local Government Bill.</P>
    <P>If we must delegate legislation to outside Departments and to subordinate bodies, then this House is entitled to ensure that when that legislation comes to be implemented and administered the citizen will have fair play and the only place, to my mind, where the citizen can get fair play is in the courts of our land.  It <Col N="1877" /> is not enough to say that the citizen will have the right of appeal to the Minister.  That is tantamount to giving the citizen a right to appeal to the devil when the court is held in hell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coogan made an excellent speech, with the main material of which I find myself in entire agreement, but it seemed to me to relate to a topic of an entirely different nature from that under discussion in this motion.  As I understand the motion, it deals with the question of the making of legislative Orders by Ministers; it has no reference to the other very great evil of the consistent effort of the Executive to set the courts aside and deny the citizen the right to go into court and assert his interest against that of the State if it challenges him.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera confined himself strictly to the specific evil that is envisaged in the motion and seems to think that we cannot take any measures to mitigate the evil without attacking democracy.  I hope he will not thus early fall into the common error that infests those benches, that anyone who criticises the Fianna Fáil Government is attacking democracy. We sometimes think that the Government errs too much on the side of reserving to itself the right to legislate, independent of the Oireachtas, and anyone who has experience of a legislative body such as this cannot but have considerable sympathy with the over-burdened Minister who is trying to get the work of his Department done as expeditiously as possible and who does feel a certain impatience with the somewhat ponderous procedure of a democratic legislative assembly in enacting the law.  Nevertheless, it is a very great danger to freedom if bureaucracy is entitled or encouraged to supplant the Legislature in its legislative functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that, with the increased intervention of the Government, of all Governments, in the everyday lives of the citizen, to legislate in the old Gladstonian way is becoming impracticable, but I think we should try to meet that in two ways.  One is to reverse in so far as <Col N="1878" /> we can the tendency to ask the Government to intervene in the daily lives of the citizens.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a most salutary experience for every Deputy to go out to Ballsbridge.  I want to make it clear that, when I had occasion to go there, I received from members of the Civil Service every assistance and courtesy that could be expected. Nevertheless, as I treaded my way under competent guidance through that infernal machine which is the Department of Industry and Commerce at Ballsbridge, I realised the magnitude and the impersonal attitude of that whole vast machine.  I could not but think of the small shopkeepers who are my neighbours, who get caught in that huge machine and who, from the moment they make contact with it, cease to be human beings, simply becoming pink files that go through that inalterable and inflexible machine.</P>
    <P>There is no use going in and trying to persuade that mighty machine that Mrs. Foley, who told an inspector to go to hell, had sciatica since last week, or that her uncle's nephew was on a drunk the night before and had scandalised the family.  The answer of that vast machine is that Mrs. Foley will get the same treatment as every other caller, no more and no less. Looking at it in that way, at hundreds of thousands of pink envelopes, if you invest those they represent with sciatica, you would never get the work done.  If you intervene in every detail of people's lives you cannot retain full respect for human frailty and the natural difficulty of each individual citizen, because if you did, you would have to have ten times as many civil servants, and the result would be that all would be civil servants and there would be nobody for the pink envelopes.</P>
    <P>If we are to mitigate the problem, our first line of approach should be to relieve the central Government as much as we can of those duties which involve interference with the daily lives of the citizens of this State.  I think one way to do that would be to encourage decentralisation.  Most Deputies will agree that there is a <Col N="1879" /> tendency to draw control of everything to Dublin.  That results in turning us all into pink envelopes. Could we reverse the process?  Many Deputies will remember the old district councils, which had very small areas of jurisdiction.  We knew the councillors, and the councillors knew the people, and when some particular matter relating to social services with which they were dealing arose, they not only knew that an applicant, say Mrs. McGrath, had a sick baby, but they knew that they had been kept awake the night before because, through the back window, they heard the baby roaring.  That act of sympathy, of understanding, and recognition of the individuality of those in whose lives our social services are required to intervene, introduced a human element into the relations which made the administration of the social services, and various other services, a more tolerable system than a great centralised machine working at Ballsbridge, which, in the circumstances, must, of its very nature, be impersonal in order to get the work done.  That is one way in which this evil might be met.  The other way also requires to be looked into.</P>
    <P>What this motion complains of is that the Legislature is habitually asked to delegate its legislative functions to Ministers and, on that delegation being made, it virtually abandons its own right to review such legislation as Ministers may have by Order made.  It is quite true that they can be brought up on motion or by question in this House, but it is also true, Deputies will agree, that very often members' motions are on the Order Paper for 12 months without being reached.  We tried to remedy that in some measure by restricting the time during which Private Members' motions can be discussed to three hours.  Without going into details, in effect, and in practice, emergency Orders or Statutory Rules are very rarely raised by way of motion.  The general machinery of this House tends rather to prevent that taking place.  The right way to do it would be to establish a Standing Committee <Col N="1880" /> of the House, which would arrange with representatives of the whole House that each Minister making a Statutory Order would be required to send it the Order, and to place upon that Committee an obligation, either positively to pass it, adopt it, or to have some method whereby they would be deemed to have passed it.  That procedure would involve that the Standing Committee for Statutory Rules would meet, say, every Tuesday when the Dáil was sitting, or possibly it might be necessary to meet every Tuesday during the year, except during the holiday period and the long recess, and when it met the duty of the clerk would be to present, or to send in advance, to members an agenda setting out the Orders it would be called upon to approve or reject.  The chairman of the meeting would then go through it, as we go through the sub-heads of an Estimate in the Committee of Public Accounts, calling out each Order as he came to it and, if any Deputy wanted to raise an objection or call for an explanation, he could stop the chairman and say, for example: &ldquo;On item 17 on the agenda there is a point I want to object to&rdquo;, and another Deputy might say: &ldquo;In regard to No. 19, I simply do not know that Order means.&rdquo; That Committee should have the power to send for persons and papers. In 85 per cent. of cases it would not require to send for either.  People often think that if you confer a power of that kind on a Committee of this House it may be abused and that they would be sending for Ministers and busy Secretaries of Departments, calling for files, and so forth.  That really in practice is not true.  I was seven years Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, with power to draw all the files in the Government offices if I wanted to.  I suppose most Fianna Fáil Deputies, had they realised that they were conferring that power upon me, would have fainted away at the thought of my being constituted chairman but, in fact, I only drew seven files in the whole time I was chairman.  We did not do it.  It does not become necessary to do it. Outside this Chamber, Deputies <Col N="1881" /> usually behave very reasonably and if you exclude the Press, and if you exclude, better still, the official reporters, everybody becomes astonishingly reasonable after the first couple of days.</P>

      <P>I abstain from personalities in that regard and I suggest to our friend, the Deputy from Drogheda, that he will emulate my excellent example.  Thus, I think, the essential control of this House over legislation would be preserved.  I am one of those old-fashioned people who believe that the preservation intact of fundamental principles is an immensely important thing.  Even though much of what one is doing is of a formal nature, so long as the observation of that form operates to preserve a fundamental principle, it is good and useful and so long as the Legislature retains and insists upon its ultimate right to have all legislation submitted to it or to its appointed delegate, a standing committee of itself, a very important principle is preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last word I want to say is this: usually when I make suggestions of this kind in the House everybody shakes his head angrily.  Almost invariably, within five years, they do what I have suggested and say then that somebody else proposed it.  You will see this standing committee set up some time, not in the immediate future, but sometime. It is quite inevitable and will certainly be done.  When it does come to pass I want to remind the Taoiseach, who is present, and the members of the front Opposition Bench of the Labour Party, who may then constitute the Government, that such a proposal as I have in mind will involve a very heavy additional burden of work on the Deputies who constitute the membership of that committee.  I take this occasion to refer to it because, if you establish special committees of this House, there are two alternatives, one, that the Deputies on them will not do their work and the other that, if the Deputies on them do their work <Col N="1882" /> and attend to their Parliamentary duties as well, they will have no time to do anything else.  That is a serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>If a man is trying to earn his living, and finds that faithfully to discharge the duties he has undertaken in connection with Parliament occupies so much of his time that he has no time to earn his living, that is a problem which Parliament will have to face. If you provide a special supplementary allowance designed to compensate members of standing committees for the extra work they do&mdash;let us be plain and frank&mdash;what is going to happen is that all the lame ducks in the House will line up at once for accommodation on the special committee. Trailing wings will appear outside the Taoiseach's office, outside the Leader of the Opposition's office, outside the Leader of the Labour Party's office, outside Deputy Blowick's office and even, I have no doubt, though I hesitate to be rude, it is possible there might be a trailing wing outside the office of the National Labour Party.  I am in the happy position that I cannot trail a wing to myself.  I stand alone.  There is that problem and it is a very difficult one. The right course would be to enable members of a standing committee of that character to receive an allowance from the Legislature which will enable them to give as much time to their work as Parliamentary Secretaries give, but I see no escape from the difficulty that, if you do that, you will have a committee of lame ducks.  That is a problem for which probably we will find some solution.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I recommend that the evil complained of in this motion should be met (1) by a limitation of bureaucracy; (2) by an assertion by this House of its unique right to legislate for the country and, in the event of delegation of these powers becoming necessary, that this House should delegate it to its own committee and not to any Minister in the certainty that such a committee will expeditiously dispose of every Order submitted to it and will constitute itself no real clog on the efficient discharge of executive duties.</P>

It is rather remarkable that, during some hours' discussion in reference to the Statutory Rules and Orders, we have not had a specific reference to even one of them. Not one number has been quoted.  One would imagine that to come to this House and ask for a Select Committee to be appointed one would need to be in possession of a mass of facts and detail showing the great hardships that had been suffered by our people by reason of this practice of legislation by Order.

I have never heard Ministers adopting that attitude.  I have always heard Ministers stating that the officials are the Ministers' officials: Ministers have always accepted full and complete responsibility for their actions.  Some of the earlier speakers to the motion suggested that the civil servants wanted wider powers and suggested that it would be an evil thing to give the civil servants such powers.  A stranger listening to these remarks might well wonder of what race or breed of men these civil servants were, and where did they come from, and would be surprised if he were told that these are our own people, that we have some of the best brains in the country in the Civil Service.

      <P>By failing to quote any specific instance, the proposers of this motion have completely failed to make any case for it.  The motion states that the Orders are made without the prior approval of the Oireachtas.  That would be impossible. Under our Constitution no Minister can get power to make Orders or regulations except from the Oireachtas.  The Act must first be passed by the Oireachtas, and then the Minister has power to make the Orders.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan would appear to be satisfied with the making of Orders if a right of appeal was given to the courts.  He did not mention any specific case.  There are many Acts under which these Orders are made. There are many types of cases, and I cannot say what was in his mind or for what type of case he would like to have a right of appeal to the courts. The Deputy knows that at the present time our courts are fully occupied.  He cannot point to any court, from the District Court up to the Supreme Court, which has not sufficient work to keep it going.  I wonder did he try to visualise what would be the position of our courts if a right of appeal against every Order made by a Minister was given.  How many courts would you need; how many lawyers would you need?  The entire financial resources of the State might be needed to pay for the courts alone, if you gave the right that Deputy Coogan suggests you should give.</P>

      <P>If you have got the money.  Some of the words used by other Deputies sounded rather strange in a State like this, such as &ldquo;despotism,&rdquo;&ldquo;despotic control,&rdquo;&ldquo;bureaucracy,&rdquo; etc.  Reference was also made to the statement of the chairman of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce who said: &ldquo;We are rapidly <Col N="1886" /> approaching that totalitarian structure.&rdquo; I deprecate those statements. We are all proud of our Constitution; we are all proud of our democratic institutions.  I do not know of any other country which has better or more democratic institutions than ours.  I think it is most undesirable that these slanders should be uttered, particularly when they are slanders, not against an individual, but against the State itself. The Minister who takes power and accepts himself as being the sole arbiter in anything displays great courage.  Having accepted such power, if anything goes wrong he cannot come to the House and say: &ldquo;I would have put this right if I had the power.&rdquo;  He accepts the power and, with the power, he accepts the responsibility.  Overriding all this is the basic fact that when a Minister gets power to make regulations he does not get the power for the remainder of his life, as was mentioned by Deputy Coogan.  He has only this power so long as he remains a Minister, and the people of our State have the right, at least every five years, to say whether they will continue to have such a Minister in office or not. The voters are the arbiters and the final court of appeal.  To suggest that there is anything undemocratic in that procedure is mere propaganda.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. I can recall that in 1937, when the Taoiseach was speaking in my constituency, he dwelt for some time on the rights of citizens.  He dealt very ably with the question of democracy on that occasion.  The reason why I could not forget the Taoiseach's speech on that night is because I was beside him on the platform.  As a matter of fact, I was holding an umbrella over his head on that very wet night in Portlaoighise. I can recall every word of his speech. It was a complete statement of his future policy, which, he said, was going to be completely democratic.  The Taoiseach usually comes into this House with encyclopædias or dictionaries when he wants to get round corners.  I see he has some of these with him to-day, and very probably he is going to give us some information as to what dictatorship means from some of the encyclopædias or dictionaries he is accustomed to consulting when confronted with criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor said that no examples had been quoted by the supporters of the motion of any difficulties or inconvenience caused to citizens as a result of Orders made by a Minister.  I can say that the vast majority of the work which I have to do as a Deputy is as a result of inconveniences caused by taking away the liberties and rights of citizens.  Take, for example, the huge machinery of the Department of Industry and Commerce, which Deputy Dillon referred to.  Deputy O'Connor told us that <Col N="1888" /> thousands of Orders were made by the Government since the emergency.  We know very well that there were cases where the citizens' rights were completely taken away from them by Orders made by the Department of Supplies and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  For example, during the emergency, as Deputy O'Connor must know, there was only a limited number of motor cars on the roads.  Complaints were made that motors were used to take people to races and to football matches and the report of the local Gárda or civil servant was accepted in each case, with the result that the owners of these cars were completely deprived of their means of livelihood by the Department of Supplies at the time under an Order introduced by the Minister.  Such a citizen did not get an opportunity of proving that he had not his car at the races or the football match, or was not doing any other kind of work than that which he was legally entitled to do in order to secure a livelihood.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to rationing. We have had various cases in which small shopkeepers were charged under an Emergency Powers Order with failing to keep records.  These people's licences were taken from them and their business was completely closed down and they were deprived of means of earning their livelihood.  From our own experience we know that injustices are committed every other day against citizens because they are being penalised to a great extent as a result of the enforcement of Emergency Powers Orders.  If they disobey the word of a Minister their permits are withdrawn and their means of livelihood is taken from them.  The famous standstill Order prevents men getting an increase in their wages.  As regards all these matters, there is no question of appeal.  It is very hard on the general body of traders, and on people with small shops, that if their licences to sell tea and sugar and other commodities are taken from them that they have no right of appeal.  They may make an appeal to the Minister to alter the decision taken by his Department, but the reply they get is <Col N="1889" /> that he sees no reason for making a departure from the decision already given.</P>
    <P>I believe that we have a complete dictatorship so far as the making of Emergency Powers Orders is concerned, just as I believe that the County Management Act represents a dictatorship.  The only difference that I see between the dictators in this country and the European and other dictators is that the latter sometimes bump themselves off while our dictators do not.  I think our people are becoming alive to the fact that democracy has never got a chance here. Deputy Vivion de Valera said that democracy must be encouraged.  In other words, he said, democracy must be catered for in order to prove its good result for our people.  In my opinion, the vast majority of the Emergency Powers Orders made by members of the Government were to the detriment of citizens who have no means whatever of making any defence against them.  We have now reached the stage when Parliament is being ignored.  Yesterday the Taoiseach was asked a question about statements of national importance.</P>

      <P>I believe that all questions relating to administration should be discussed in this House. Parliament should be consulted first.  It is in Parliament that the laws are made and, therefore, I submit that future Government policy should first be discussed and, if necessary, criticised in Parliament.  What I find is that Parliament is being more and more completely ignored.  I realise, of course, that Ministers must have power to do various things, especially during a war or an emergency.  It was for that reason that, at the beginning of the emergency, there was very little opposition in this House to the delegation of powers to Ministers.  During the emergency period we were silent on the question of these Emergency Powers Orders because we believed that a certain number of them were <Col N="1890" /> necessary at that time.  We had a Press censorship during the war, but that ended with the return of normal conditions in the world.  To our astonishment, however, a number of these Emergency Powers Orders that, I think, are detrimental to the people, are being continued and, as one Deputy pointed out, some of them, such as the wages standstill Order&mdash;the most hated Emergency Powers Order of all &mdash;are being enshrined in our permanent legislation.  That is one of the dangers that I see, especially in view of the fact that the emergency ended nine months ago.  I think it was Deputy O'Connor who said that many more of these Orders are likely to be made. That will not be very encouraging news for our citizens who have been victims of these Orders.</P>
      <P>I think that this motion, tabled by Deputy Anthony and Deputy Byrne, is a very useful one.  I hope that the Taoiseach, when replying, will realise the grave danger such Orders as these are to the rights and liberties of our citizens.  With Deputy Dillon, I trust that a committee will be appointed by the House for the purpose of considering the Emergency Powers Orders that are made by Ministers.  I think that if we had such a committee, representative of all Parties in the House, Ministers would not make such drastic Orders as they have been making, and that the work of the committee would be productive of good results.  The position is, I think, that Ministers have got too much power. They have taken complete power from Parliament.  I hope that the committee will be set up, and that any recommendations it makes will be considered by the Government.  A very useful debate has taken place on this motion, and I trust that good results will follow for those members of the House who are interested in the preservation of the rights and liberties of the citizens.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan seems to be interested in the books that I have here with me.  I do sometimes bring books with me because I find that people use words without, apparently, taking the trouble to <Col N="1891" /> understand them.  Therefore, instead of giving my own views as to the meaning of words, I sometimes think that those who wish to understand might listen somewhat better to a standard book on the subject than they would to a statement of mine.  When Deputy Flanagan said that he had held an umbrella over me at a meeting at which I spoke about democracy, and added that he had never forgotten the speech, I was wondering whether he had learned very much from it, because he does not seem to understand very clearly what democracy is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this subject that is before us to-day, one can say that the older members amongst us have our longings for the spacious days of long ago.  I must say that I regret, as I am sure many other members of the House do, the passing out of the saddle horse and the four-in-hand: the passing of the days when the village shoemaker was able to superintend, in absolute detail, the work of his journeymen, and to take a pride in the work of his own hands, and in the work of their hands.  I share, as I say, the regret of these people for those days.  If we could bring back some of the features of those days we would be very happy, but, unfortunately, those days are gone, and, I am afraid, gone for ever. We have no longer the saddle horse and the four-in-hand: we have now the motor car, the swift motor car.  On the seas, in the matter of communication between Continents, we no longer have the old sailing vessel: we have the swift aeroplane; and we might as well think of the days of the dip candle when we are talking about this matter, forget the development of the open gas jet and the superseding filament lamp, go back to the old days of the dip candle and think that such days are possible now.  But we simply cannot do that, whether we like it or not, and some of us do not like it at all.  The Government, and legislation generally, have nowadays to intervene very much in what would be regarded as the private concerns of the individual, but none the less it is a fact&mdash;and we cannot get away from it&mdash;that as a result of all these developments you now have hundreds of legislative enactments <Col N="1892" /> where you had only to have one or two before.  In the old days, Parliament had to concern itself only with keeping law and order, with collecting taxes and revenues, and with defending the State, but now it is an entirely different problem, and what we have to deal with now are the problems of the present day.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Costello who said that between 1922 and 1932 something like 3,000 Orders were made here.  Whether that is right or not I do not know, but supposing that there were hundreds of Orders made, does not that show that the enactment of these laws was due to something that was happening at the time and not due to something that had been done by the present Government?  Deputy Costello, incidentally, was not slow to suggest that it was due to the despotic ideas of the present Government, and suggested that it was because we were really, at heart, dictators.  Now, when I was listening to Deputy Costello, and when he was lecturing us on dictators and all the rest of it, my mind went back to a certain time, when a certain Bill with regard to the wearing of uniforms was passing through this House.  Deputy Costello was opposing the passage of that Bill, and here is an extract from his speech&mdash; it is in Volume 50, column 2237 of the Official Debates.  Deputy Costello, on that occasion, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister gave extracts from various laws on the Continent, but he carefully refrained from drawing attention to the fact that the Black Shirts were victorious in Italy and that the Hitler Shirts were victorious in Germany, as, assuredly, in spite of this Bill, and in spite of the Public Safety Act, the Blue Shirts will be victorious in the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, one would imagine that, of all people, the last to talk about dictatorships, and all the rest of it, would be Deputy Costello, and this whole suggestion that the device of Statutory Orders was a device by this Government, and was indicative of their desire to get dictatorial control, is something which is harmful to the country both internally and externally.  The <Col N="1893" /> truth is&mdash;and everybody knows that it is true&mdash;that we are at the moment one of the most democratic States on this earth.  Our Constitution gives our people fundamental control.  They are the masters.  They cannot, of course, be masters from hour to hour.  We might as well go back, as I have said, to the days of the dip candle as to try to go back to the days when the whole community could meet in assembly and keep control day after day.  We cannot keep control&mdash;the people cannot keep control&mdash;in that sense.  The way the people keep control is by having a representative Assembly, an Assembly representing them, which will legislate and control the Government.  Now, we have that here, and we have it in a wider sense here than they have it in Britain, because here we have proportional representation.  I do not want to say that proportional representation will give you, or can give you, representation of every political point of view, or every other point of view, that might be held in the country, but we have here a representative Assembly, and it is through this representative Assembly that the control of the people works.</P>
    <P>Now, this Assembly has two main functions.  Its first function is the making of laws, and no law is made in this country without the prior consent of this Assembly.  It is with the prior consent of the representatives of the people that every legislative enactment is made here, whether directly, in the case of the Bills that we pass, or, indirectly, through the powers that are given to individuals or bodies under their control.  The first is the legislative power.  The next power that this Assembly has is the power of control of the Executive.  We have here in this country a system corresponding to the system they have in Britain, in which the Executive body &mdash;the Government here&mdash;is dependent from day to day on getting the approval of Parliament: getting the approval, I mean, of the Dáil, here, which is this branch of the Legislature. If a majority in this House&mdash;a majority representing the people&mdash;at any time finds fault with either the collective acts of the Government or with the act of a Minister, that will <Col N="1894" /> mean&mdash;it must mean&mdash;that the Government has to be changed or that the Minister must be changed.  A Government cannot exist in this country except by the support of the majority of the people, as represented in this House.  How, then, can anybody say that this Parliament, or the people, as represented by it, are losing control, or have lost control, as long as those who make the subordinate legislation are responsible to them?</P>
    <P>That is the position.  If the attitude of the Dáil is to be that they must be in a position to supervise at all times every act of the Executive, then it means that they must think of themselves as the Executive; they cannot do that, but that is what the device of having a Standing Committee of the Dáil set up to deal with such matters amounts to.  The Dáil realises, however, that they are not in a position to follow and supervise at each particular minute the Executive acts which are necessary, but it is quite wrong to suggest that therefore in this State the people, through their representative Assembly, are not constantly in control.</P>
    <P>What we do here is what is ordinarily done in business.  In a business you have a board of directors, and they have the authority to delegate to certain managers executive power of deciding matters from minute to minute and from hour to hour.  That is done as a matter of necessity.  It is the same thing here.  There is no other way in which executive power could be carried out except by delegating that power, as you do, to the Government, and then holding the Government responsible.  Now you must give them power to do that; and it is a good general principle, if you want work done, which you cannot do immediately yourself, to give to some other person the power of doing it and hold him responsible for his acts.  That is what is done here.  The Government is given power to do certain things, and you hold the Government responsible for its acts, and if at any time this House disapproves of any act of a Minister or of the Government, and shows its disapproval by a vote against it, then that means the end of that particular <Col N="1895" /> administrator or of that particular administration.</P>
    <P>Surely, then, that being the case, nobody can suggest for one moment that you have not democracy working fully here.  Just as this House could not make itself responsible for the day-to-day carrying out of acts of the Executive, so this House is not capable of enacting all the legislation that is necessary in modern conditions.  Portion of it must be delegated.  As has been stated, this matter has been fully examined several times and everybody who has given it any attention has been forced to admit that this system is necessary but that there are dangers in it.</P>
    <P>There are always dangers when you delegate powers but, if you do not delegate them, the work will not be done.  If you want the work done, you must delegate it and then ask yourself what safeguards you can have.  The matter has been somewhat complicated in the debate by the introduction of Emergency Powers Orders.  The emergency has, naturally, been present to our minds.  A greater number of Orders were made during the emergency than would have been made in a normal period.  I shall refer to them only for a moment.  Everybody recognises, particularly those who are interested in democratic control, that, if democracy is to survive in a crisis, then democracy must give practically plenary powers to the Executive.  The necessary swiftness of action would not be possible without that.  The Dáil, like other Parliaments in similar circumstances, recognised that fact.  It gave, with certain limitations, practically unlimited powers to the Executive.  We have passed through six years of emergency. Deputies opposite may say that, during that time, we did certain things that were wrong but I do not think that any Deputy can honestly say that those powers were abused with a view to getting dictatorial control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

      <P>That is the Deputy's opinion, to which he is, of course, entitled.

I am sure that the Deputy will not say they were abused with a view to getting dictatorial control.</P>

      <P>Maureen O'Hara served a very useful purpose in bringing a certain question to the attention of the Irish people and other peoples. Speaking of that, I may tell you that the Press report was all wrong.  It was only in a private examination, apparently, that this question was put up.  It was not put up by the judge in public, and the judge did take the view that she had no allegiance other than allegiance to this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

      <P>Sometimes, when we are using words, it is necessary that they should have a common meaning. The nature of the emergency demanded swift action.  Those who were responsible had to take that swift action.  If it is suggested that that was done for the purpose of obtaining dictatorial control, I wonder why the Dáil gave the powers.  They gave the powers and would give them again. They would have to give them again in a crisis of that sort.</P>

      <P>In a crisis of that magnitude, the Deputy would not be able to get guarantees, which would mean that those immediately responsible for executive action would be helpless.  Deputy Costello referred to my appeal at the last election for a strong Government.  Again, the suggestion was that, because I appealed for a strong Government&mdash;which I believed was the best thing for the community&mdash;we wanted a dictatorship. The trouble with the Opposition is that they will not accept the fact that they are a minority and that decisions can be taken only by a majority vote. There is no other way.</P>

As regards the reference to a strong Government, an English professor was quoted by the Deputy to indicate that behind that was the philosophy of dictatorship.

      <P>This is a recent book on &ldquo;Election and Representation&rdquo; by James Hogan, Doctor of Literature, Professor of History, University College, Cork.  As a Professor of History here, I think that he knows more about our circumstances and conditions than would somebody in Oxford or a member of the King's Inns in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1898" /> He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As anarchy, the parent of tyranny, is the malady to which representative democracy is most characteristically susceptible, and as impotence in government is invariably the immediate author or occasion of anarchy, it follows that representative democracy can afford, in less measure than any other type of political régime, to dispense with the conditions of self-reliant, firm, consecutive government.  The great complexity of the economic, social and international conditions to which a modern democracy has to adapt itself, if it is to survive, calls for increased Government action in very many directions.  Hence, far from having decreased, the need for strengthening the function of government has greatly increased. No one who has fairly studied the evidence can doubt that one of the major factors in the decline of the Parliamentary system has been its failure to develop itself as efficiently on the executive as on the legislative side.</P>
    <P>If we may accept as universally valid a political proposition which in effect is directly challenged only by those who repudiate the principle of government as such, that is to say, if we acknowledge that government to be good must be effective, then it follows that democratic government, like any other form of government, must needs possess within its assigned constitutional and legal limits a real freedom of judgment, initiative, and action in all matters where the ordering of the affairs of the community is concerned.  When, furthermore, we have to concede, whether we like it or not, that there is no other practical way of avoiding under modern conditions the extremes of chaos or dictatorship than to accept a considerable extension of the functions and activities of government, it will be evident that there could be no fallacy more disastrous in its consequences than to think of the representative process as primarily designed to neutralise, checkmate, or obstruct the activities of government.  There <Col N="1899" /> are the strongest reasons why we should welcome, under almost any conceivable circumstances, the possession of a strong and constant majority in Parliament by whatever properly - constituted Government happens to be in office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a calm and philosophic consideration of the problems of government in modern times by a man who knows intimately the conditions here. I asked at the elections for a strong Government.  I asked for a consecutiveness of government in order that policy might be carried out and I am no more dictatorial in mind than is that author.  I stood for that for the same reason as he does.  What the Opposition seems to want at every stage is to reduce the Government to impotence so that it will be ineffective and cannot do its work, possibly hoping that by that means another Government will be got into office.  We do not propose to allow ourselves, if we can help it, at any stage to be reduced to the position of the old man and his ass in the fable which used to be in the school-books in the old days.  We believe there are certain things which ought to be done and we want to have the machinery by which we can do them.  We want the majority by which we can do them and, so far, we have been supplied with that majority.</P>
    <P>Any proposals coming from the opposite benches designed to make democratic control more effective will certainly be considered and if at all possible adopted by us.  I am anxious to see this Assembly, as representing the people, effectively in control, in control all the time and I can see no better way of achieving that than by the Government's delegating&mdash;it has to delegate its executive functions&mdash;in so far as it is necessary its legislative functions, on the understanding that it can hold those who make these Orders responsible.  No suggestion of any kind has been put up in the debate to enable us to deal with that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that no new suggestion has been put <Col N="1900" /> up because that is not a new suggestion. It is one of the safeguards referred to in the Donoughmore Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Even before that, it was suggested in this House as a remedy.  It is worth examining and I shall give it some consideration.  I also sympathise with those&mdash;I think it was Deputy Dillon made the suggestion &mdash;who say that there should be more decentralisation.  I believe in decentralisation and I should like to see it in operation.  The only trouble about it is that the machinery for it, on account of the work that would be involved, would have to be generally so elaborate that it would become very costly, because you would have to give to the local authorities, if they were going to be effective, all the machinery which would enable them to deal with various problems and it would become very expensive.  Whether we should stop just at that is another question. I deplore&mdash;I do not know whether Deputies who accuse me of dictatorship would believe me but it is true&mdash;the fact that we are driven by modern conditions to centralise more and more because I regret that human beings who have to be dealt with, should be simply names in pink files. I dislike that but I cannot help it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are dealing with, say, the petrol position in the country, nobody can suggest that you can deal with it by allowing each particular person to plead as an excuse for a breach of the regulations that he was using his motor car for a good purpose.  I have seen a case where a doctor appealed and stated&mdash;there is a possibility that the statement was true&mdash;that he went to a race meeting in his car for the purpose of attending a case there or some excuse of that kind.  That may be true; I do not know, but how would it be possible for the Department to deal with affairs, if it had to examine cases like that in detail and test them out to see whether in fact the excuses given were genuine or not?  We have a problem, and we cannot deal with it otherwise than in the manner in which <Col N="1901" /> we have been dealing with it here.  These Statutory Orders are simply something that has evolved out of the complexity of modern life.  The objection taken to that is that they have been evolved unsystematically.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of examination with a view to having greater system in the procedure, and various suggestions have been made. My own belief is that the best safeguard we can have is that when a Bill comes in here which gives the right to delegate powers, it should be scrutinised carefully, that the nature of the powers should be carefully examined, and that those who are opposed to giving such powers should give their reasons for opposing the delegation of those powers.  It is at that stage that the most effective control can be exercised, and if the powers are abused, the person who abused them can be called to account by the House.  I cannot see any other way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other matter, I have already seen it in the Donoughmore Report, and have given a certain amount of consideration to it personally, but I have not discussed it with my colleagues, and have not come to any decision as to whether or not it would be practicable.  As Deputy Dillon said, in speaking of it, it obviously can be abused by those who want to checkmate the executive&mdash;to use the phrase from Professor Hogan's book&mdash; and prevent it from being effective.  If it were used as Deputy Dillon proposed, a great deal of the dangers would disappear, but one has to face the other possibility.</P>
    <P>I think the mover of the motion has done everything he wanted to do by getting this matter discussed.  There would be nothing new to be learned by setting up a committee.  The Deputy probably has not had an opportunity to read this report.  If he reads it, he will find that, on account of the similarity of circumstances, practically everything that would suggest itself to him as a thing to be examined has been examined, and conclusions have been arrived at.  I think he will agree that <Col N="1902" /> the conclusions arrived at are the same conclusions as we would arrive at here.</P>

All I can say is that, as far as we have seen it, and with regard to the particular question we have here at issue, that committee, composed of Lord Donoughmore, Professor Laski and a whole range of people with different political views on various matters, having examined all the circumstances thoroughly&mdash;and they were not different from our own circumstances&mdash; arrived at conclusions which are supported by such arguments as to convince anyone who reads the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think honestly that it would be a waste of time to set up a committee to find out to what extent the present procedure here is inconsistent with the powers which the Oireachtas should exercise.  It does not seem possible to have now the day-to-day control which was possible in former times.  The only question that arises is whether there are any methods of control we can adopt to keep closer contact with what is being done and supervise it better. Is there some better supervising machine than we have at the moment? If any members of the Opposition have a proposal to make, they can make it, but the only suggestion I have heard is that from Deputy Dillon.  I have been considering that point and I think a committee has already been set up in Britain to consider it.  It is a matter for consideration as to whether we should follow their example in that regard.  Apart from that, I do not think anything would be gained by an inquiry such as the Deputy suggests.  I would not wish to have a division on this motion and I urge the Deputy strongly to be satisfied with the discussion that has taken place and with the fact that he has drawn attention here to a thing which undoubtedly is dangerous.  He might leave it at that and leave the Government an opportunity to consider whether it is possible to adopt <Col N="1903" /> the proposition with regard to some committee or other.</P>

      <P>I agree that Deputies Anthony and Byrne have done a good service by introducing this motion.  It is principally lawyers who are afflicted by the provisions of Statutory Rules and Orders, but it is the public who are affected by them.  Some Deputies may not realise that, under emergency powers legislation and under Statutory Rules and Orders, the provisions contained in those Orders have the full effect of law.  Time and again, individuals are brought before the court and find themselves arraigned on charges under these Orders.  The duty then devolves on the individual's legal advisers to ascertain the provisions of the law on a particular point.  It was said lately that it was practically impossible to ascertain what the local government law in this country is at the moment. That is perfectly true.  Most of the local government laws are contained in statues enacted either by the British Parliament or by this Parliament. Deputies who try to consider what the law is, as enacted by various Orders, will realise that it is very complex and difficult.  The local government law and the rent restrictions code are two very different spheres in which the law is widespread and affects almost daily a large number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is practically impossible to ascertain precisely what the law is on a particular point.  Most Emergency Powers Orders run something like this: &ldquo;Emergency Powers (No. 20) Order, 1940 (Second Amendment) Order, 1942.&rdquo;  Not even a lawyer has the slightest idea what that Order deals with.  He has to look into the Order and then sees it begins: &ldquo;In this Order, the expression &lsquo;the principal Order&rsquo; means the Emergency Powers (No. 20) Order (S.R. &amp; O., No. 2), 1940.&rdquo;  Deputies who have had occasion to look for these Orders in the Oireachtas Library will find there is there an admirable system of filing Orders, alphabetically and numerically. It is easy for Deputies to realise that the Librarians are there for that purpose, but outside this <Col N="1904" /> House, not even in the Law Library, there is nowhere such an efficient system of filing and there is difficulty in ascertaining the law on a particular point.</P>
    <P>You cannot look the Orders up alphabetically because &ldquo;No. 20 Order, 1940&rdquo; conveys nothing, not even to a lawyer, until he ascertains the provisions. People affected are placed in the difficulty of securing both a numerical and an alphabetical compilation. There is even one case where there is an Emergency Powers Order No. 41 (f) of 1941, signed by the Taoiseach on the 31st December, 1941. It was a most drastic Order, by which the Government, in exercise of the powers conferred on them by the Emergency Powers Acts, 1939 to 1941, named four persons then in custody and ordered them to be brought before a court.  Under another Order, they were indicted on a certain charge.  As far as I am aware, that Order was never on sale and was made out only in typescript.  There is not a printed form of that Order available either in the Oireachtas Library or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I think there is a strong case to be made.  That is, possibly, an extreme example, but still it is an example of an Order which placed certain people in custody and ordered them to be tried before a special court.  That Order was signed by the Taoiseach on the 31st December, 1941.  It was not tabled in the Dáil until the 28th January, 1942.  Deputies will realise that almost a month had elapsed and the provisions of the Order could have been completely carried out within the month before the members of this House would have had an opportunity of drawing attention to the gravity of an Order of that kind and the fact that it had not been made available to Deputies or to the public.</P>

      <P>I will give Deputy Anthony his chance and, with a few more sentences, I will conclude.  We have heard many lectures on democracy here and it strikes me that the Fianna Fáil Deputies are like Hamlet when he said: &ldquo;The lady doth protest <Col N="1905" /> too much.&rdquo;  I would refer those Deputies to a speech made by the present Soviet Foreign Minister on democracy. It was made within the last month and in that speech he said his Government was one of the most democratic Governments in the world. I am sure he is as convinced of his opinion, and the soundness of it on that policy, as Fianna Fáil Deputies are on theirs.</P>

      <P>As regards this motion, which was put down in the names of Deputy Anthony and myself, I may say that we felt that the supremacy of Parliament was being undermined and that its powers were being minimised by the rapid growth of legislation by means of delegating powers.  In an effort to stop that growth and the continuous minimising of Parliamentary powers, we put down this motion.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera to-day used the Donoughmore Report to a great extent to support his claims.  He and others quoted that report as a great authority.  I believe it is a great authority, but yesterday the Minister for Local Government tore the Donoughmore Report to pieces and said it was not a document that had been accepted as reliable by the British Parliament.  Now, members on the Government Benches cannot have it both ways.</P>

I think this motion will result in some kind of good being done.  We were encouraged by the Taoiseach's statement to-day.  I believe the time that the House has given to this motion has been time well spent.</P>

      <P>I have only five or six minutes in which to reply.

I was prepared to reply effectively, but now I find I have only five or six minutes in which to make that reply.  Of course, that is due to my generosity in giving way.</P>

      <P>I am quite encouraged by the fact that this motion has given rise to a very important and illuminating debate, which was conducted without any recriminations and without any heat being introduced from any side.  I had intended to refer to the way in which the administration was carried out during the time of the British occupation and I intended to draw attention to the legislation by which our country was governed at that time, particularly with relation to local government.  Those Acts were amended from time to time in our own Parliament, and we took away whatever little liberty was possessed by the citizen even under the British régime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the British House of Commons orders are made from time to time and they are known as Orders in Council. They correspond somewhat to the Orders made under the delegating powers which our Ministers have been given.  I am not against the idea, under the conditions mentioned by the Taoiseach a moment ago.  I am not opposed to the delegation of certain powers under modern conditions.  I want to reject the insinuations made by some members of the Fianna Fáil Party that offence was intended or given to civil servants.  I have the greatest regard and respect for our Civil Service.  The members of that service are second to none in any country in the world, and I want it to be made quite clear that there was no intention on the part of any Deputy speaking from this side of the House <Col N="1907" /> whether as an Independent, as a member of Fine Gael or the Labour Party, to cast any aspersions on the civil servants of this State, as such. They are the servants of a system imposed upon them by this Government.</P>
    <P>I was encouraged by the way in which the Taoiseach met this motion. He has at least given some kind of hope, as he favours certain reforms along the lines indicated in the motion, though he is not prepared at the moment to make any drastic changes in this method of power delegation. Perhaps he may not be unwilling to undertake the responsibility, as has been done in other countries, of lessening the amount of delegated power.</P>
    <P>I suggested in my opening speech on Wednesday that a body such as our Committee on Procedure and Privileges might be made use of to fulfil the purpose that the council in Britain fulfils, the body that issues Orders in Council.  I said, as an alternative, that if there was any emergency situation arising you could have a Committee of the House set up, representative of all Parties, the members being resident within easy reach of Dublin, so that they could be summoned at ten minutes' notice&mdash;or they might live in the City of Dublin, if necessary.  I threw out that suggestion because I feel that some body of that nature should be established.</P>
    <P>I was further encouraged when I read a recent report of the debates in the Seanad.  I saw the Taoiseach's reception of a motion that was submitted there and I was interested in his comments.  I will refer now to the debates in the Seanad, columns 152 and 153 of the Parliamentary Debates of 24th January, 1946.  The Taoiseach was speaking there on a matter somewhat analogous to the subject-matter <Col N="1908" /> of this motion&mdash;it bears some relation to it, at any rate&mdash;and he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As for the future, on the broad question of the giving of powers to Ministers and to the Government to make Orders of this kind, it will be for the Dáil and the Seanad to see that such powers are given in a restricted form, if that can be done. In particular cases, there may be special difficulties and it may be necessary to insert an omnibus clause but a time restriction could be inserted. If powers were given, for example, to enable an Act to be put into operation, it might be provided that the initial part would be done in a certain time and then any difficulties likely to crop up would show themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is, I think, the operative sentence:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You could also have a safeguard in the provision that Orders be laid before the Dáil and Seanad and be open to discussion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a lot of explanatory matter, and it is open to members of the Dáil to read this report for themselves.  I do not want to take any of the sentences out of their context.  In view of the attitude of the Taoiseach and the manner in which Deputies, speaking generally, have received this motion, I do not intend to press it to a division.  I have consulted with my colleague, Deputy Byrne, and I do not think there is any necessity for putting it to a division.  I have to thank the Taoiseach, especially, for the liberal manner in which he interpreted what was behind the minds of the two Deputies who submitted this motion.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 6th March, 1946.</P>
