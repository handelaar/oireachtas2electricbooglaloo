      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that considerable delay has taken place, within the last few months, in the allocation and delivery of timber by Timber Importers, Limited, to Dublin merchants, with resulting delay in the delivery to builders, and that building operations have been thereby unnecessarily retarded; if he will have inquiry made into the cause of this delay; and if he will take steps to see that allocations and deliveries are effected by Timber Importers, Limited, with as little delay as possible after the arrival of the timber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The system of central purchasing of timber which had to be adopted to secure supplies has undoubtedly created difficulties of distribution which did not prevail under prewar trading conditions.  It has been found very difficult to load timber so that it will arrive in Irish ports at timely intervals, with the result that the work of sorting and checking is impeded.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that Timber Importers, Limited, are making every endeavour to distribute the timber with as little delay as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that all red deal, <Col N="1472" /> which is regarded by many Dublin builders as essential for the manufacture of joinery, is being imported by Timber Importers, Limited, through the ports of Cork and Limerick alone, thereby involving unnecessary cost to Dublin builders; and if he will state the reasons for this arrangement, and whether he will take steps to see that some of the red deal supplies are brought into the port of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed. All red deal is not imported through the ports of Cork and Limerick alone.  In fact, this year's purchase of red deal has not yet been shipped.  A considerable proportion of it will be imported through Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that a considerable amount of avoidable cost and unnecessary waste is caused to joinery manufacturers in Dublin by reason of the fact that they are compelled to use three-inch spruce instead of two-inch red deal as no two-inch timber is imported into Dublin; if he will state the reasons for the restriction on the import into Dublin of two-inch timber; and whether he will cause steps to be taken to remove the difficulties under which the joinery manufacturers are working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is no T.V.O. oil available in County Tipperary, as a result of which most of the tractors in the county are immobilised, thereby impeding threshing and ploughing operations; and if he will state what steps he intends to take to ensure that supplies of this commodity are made available immediately.</P>

      <P>I have received no recent complaint of shortage of tractor <Col N="1473" /> vaporising oil in County Tipperary and inquiries I have made do not bear out the Deputy's allegation.  Whilst stocks at the local depot of the oil distributing companies serving the county vary from time to time they are speedily replenished as required and I do not consider that the present position calls for any action on the part of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the basis on which Messrs. Fuel Importers (Eire) Limited, supply turf by road transport from the Phoenix Park to bellmen in towns and villages in County Dublin; and if he is satisfied that the system in operation is fair inasmuch as bellmen in some villages are obliged to go a journey of six miles to the Phoenix Park dump, whereas bellmen in other villages at a similar distance are supplied by road transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The general practice of Fuel Importers (Eire) Limited, is to supply bellmen and other licensed fuel merchants in County Dublin towns and villages by diverting turf to them which would otherwise go to the dumps.  The turf is ordinarily delivered by rail to the nearest station but road deliveries are made when transport considerations so require.  I am satisfied that the present system of turf distribution by Fuel Importers (Eire) Limited which has developed from practical experience over a long period is in its general application as fair a system as can be devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Dundrum, an area which has a rail service, is served by road by Fuel Importers, Limited, that Rathfarnham, which has no train service, is not served by road, and that Balbriggan, a considerable distance away, with a very adequate train service, is served by road while villages such as Castleknock are not so served?  Would the Minister look into it again, and see if it is possible to divert some of the road transport which is not absolutely necessary <Col N="1474" /> to certain areas where there is no means of transport other than by road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Rathfarnham is in the city area and the arrangements in the city area are different from those prevailing in the county area.  In County Dublin, the bellmen are regarded as independent fuel merchants and treated as such.  In the city area, the bellmen are attached to fuel merchants and the system of distributing turf to them derives from the system under which they drew coal before the war. It would not be practical to introduce in any part of the city area a system of distribution similar to that operating in County Dublin.  So far as Dundrum is concerned, distribution is ordinarily by road and to send turf to Dundrum by rail would, I think, necessitate its being sent from the North Wall to Bray and then back to Dundrum. I am not familiar with the position concerning Balbriggan, but either road or rail is used by Fuel Importers, Limited, according as transport requirements necessitate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can understand, the difficulty is that Fuel Importers, Ltd., have adopted a system under which Dundrum is served by road transport, although a train service is available.  Rathfarnham cannot avail of a train service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that there is a train service to Dundrum suitable for turf distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It was used for a while, but when coal supplies and train services were restricted, it was abandoned and they reverted to the road. The position is that Rathfarnham cannot avail of any train service, and I ask the Minister to make representations to Fuel Importers, Ltd., to alter the system and to serve places which have no train service by road and places where a train is available by rail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Fuel Importers, Ltd., would run into a lot of difficulty if they departed from the borough boundary as the line of demarcation between the two systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A portion of Rathfarnham <Col N="1475" /> is in the city area but the bulk of the area is in County Dublin, and I think the same applies to Dundrum.</P>

      <P>Outline proposals for the improvement of the water supply at Caherciveen, prepared by a consulting engineer, have been submitted to my Department for approval.  It is proposed to take a supply from the River Ferta, the estimated cost of this scheme being £14,300.  Before approval can be given to a scheme of this magnitude it is essential that the adequacy of the source shall be established without doubt, and the local authority were informed last March that gaugings of the river should be taken during a dry period.  The summer months are normally the most suitable for taking such measurements, but in view of the heavy rains which were experienced during the summer and autumn months of the present year readings taken during those months cannot be regarded as an indication of the flow to be expected in a very dry or even in a normal year. The local authority was, therefore, asked to continue the gaugings during the next period of dry weather.</P>

As also mentioned in my statement, the price to producers for all classes of poultry had been increased as from 2nd September last by 3d. per lb.  This increase in the case of turkeys will be maintained over the season as announced by my Department in a recent Press advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While an appropriate Price Order does not yet appear to have been made, I understand that for Irish turkeys the maximum price to consumers will be fixed at 3/6 per lb. for plucked birds and 4/9 per lb. for drawn and trussed birds and the maximum <Col N="1482" /> price to retailers at 3/1 per lb. for plucked birds.  On the foregoing basis, the price receivable by Messrs.  Eggsports Ltd., should be 3/1 per lb. less commission.  Messrs. Eggsports Ltd., have been instructed to pay shippers 2/7 per lb. dead weight for turkeys delivered to Great Britain, which should enable the producer to be paid approximately 2/1 per lb. live weight.</P>

      <P>I have seen a reference in the public Press to the case in question.  In the newspaper report it was stated that one of the girls was able to read in English although she managed better in Irish, and that the other girl stated she could not read or write.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made and have ascertained that the two girls in question attended a national school during a period of about nine years.  One of the girls is a member of a large family in poor circumstances.  She attended school very irregularly after she passed the fourth standard, but in spite of her irregular attendance was considered by her teachers as well up to the sixth class standard when she left school. The other girl was much below the normal standard of intelligence, was difficult to control and to teach, and she made practically no progress during her school life, even in penmanship.</P>
      <P>It is permissible under the regulations for children to be enrolled in national schools up to the age of 18 years, and if the parents of these two children desire to have further primary education provided for them they should make application to the manager or principal teacher of the national school which they desire that their children should attend.</P>

The terms of reference of the commission are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  To examine and report on the extent and causes of unemployment amongst young persons of school-leaving age and under 20 years, and, having regard to social, economic and financial considerations, to make recommendations as to the most practicable and desirable measures (a) to prevent and remedy such unemployment, (b) to guide such persons in their choice of a vocation, and (c) to secure for such persons the most appropriate and efficient training to fit them to take a useful part in the economic life of the country.</P>
      <P>2.  To make recommendations as to control of the conditions of employment of young persons for the purpose of promoting their spiritual and physical welfare and their efficiency as workers and of giving them opportunities of equipping themselves for more highly skilled work.</P>
      <P>3.  To make recommendations as to the most practicable and desirable measures for promoting the religious, intellectual and physical development of young persons.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  An application was, however, <Col N="1487" /> received from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union on the 17th October, 1946, to extend to this Department's labourers at Fermoy the terms of a bonus Order permitting payment of a bonus not exceeding 10/- per week to building labourers employed within a radius of six miles from Fermoy Post Office.  This application was favourably considered and payment of the relevant bonus was authorised on the 16th November, 1946.</P>
      <P>Carpenters employed by this Department at Kilworth Camp are in receipt of a bonus at the rate of 12/8 per week and labourers at the rate of 6/- per week.  The bonus of 12/8 could not be extended to the grade of general labourer as that grade was not included in the Schedule to the relevant Order.  Arrangements are being made, however, to increase the rate of bonus (6/- per week) payable to general labourers employed by this Department in the Kilworth area to the rate applicable in the case of building labourers in the Fermoy area, i.e. 10/- per week with effect from the 1st May, 1946.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the wages of forestry workers range from 43/- in County Wexford to 47/- in County Dublin for a 48-hour week; that these rates are subject to reduction in respect of time lost through bad weather or for any other reason; that, in some areas, work is stopped on Church holidays, the men being deprived of a day's pay; that they are not provided with protective clothing or rubber boots, even when working in exposed situations or in marshland; and further, whether it is his intention to amend the existing regulations so as to provide a proper income for these men and to make available to them an issue of protective clothing and boots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's information regarding the rates of wages paid to forestry labourers is not quite correct.  These rates are related to the rates payable to agricultural labourers under the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Orders promulgated from time to time, and in fixing the rates of wages of forestry labourers cognisance is taken of the various groups into which the country is divided for the purposes of these Orders.  The rates were last reviewed in June, 1946, consequent on the promulgation of the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) (No. 2) Order 1946, and the new rates of wages payable since the 24th June, 1946, vary from 43/- a week in most parts of the country to 49/- a week in County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On days on which normal outdoor work is not possible owing to wet weather, payment of wages is made where the labourers attend for work at the appointed time and remain available for alternative work so long as they are required.  If no alternative work is available and it is reasonably certain that normal work will not be <Col N="1491" /> possible in the afternoon, the labourers are paid for the first half of the day only.  Every effort is made to provide alternative work for the labourers on wet days.</P>
    <P>The question of work on Church Holidays is usually governed by local custom.  Any stoppage of work on such holidays is due to the voluntary action of the men themselves.</P>
    <P>Rubber boots are provided for the use of forestry labourers engaged on operations for which such footwear is required.  The provision of other protective clothing is not considered necessary.</P>
    <P>The existing regulations in regard to the wages and conditions of service of forestry labourers are considered satisfactory and it is not my intention to amend them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to <Col N="1498" /> confine the powers sought by the Minister in Section 5&mdash;that is, the power to retire existing officers at a particular age either by way of general rule or by fixing an age limit in a particular case.  Under the section as it stands the Minister, in addition, seeks power to suspend officers and also to dismiss officers.  As I pointed out, both on the Second Stage and on the Committee Stage of the Bill, the powers now sought by the Minister are a drastic encroachment upon the rights of existing officers.  Those rights were guaranteed to the transferred officers in particular by Section 99, subsection (3) of the 1930 Act.  In 1944 the Minister sought to remove the protection given by Section 99, subsection (3) of the 1930 Act but, as he told us on the last occasion when this measure was being discussed, he was advised that he must get specific powers to ensure that the provisions of the 1944 Act would apply to the transferred officers.</P>
    <P>The Minister also told us that he had sought legal advice and that that advice was to the effect that it was not clear that he could exercise the powers of the 1944 Act in relation to transferred officers; but he also told us that he was more concerned with getting the power to retire officers at a prescribed age rather than to acquire drastic powers for either suspending, removing or dismissing officers.  It is a reprehensible principle that when this House confers by Act of Parliament a statutory protection upon a body of servants the House should subsequently be asked to remove that protection by subsequent enactment.  By law and by statute of this House these officers were given a measure of protection under the 1930 Act.  That measure of protection is now sought to be removed.  While the Minister has no particular concrete case in his mind, he says that it is desirable that he should have these powers.  I have pointed out repeatedly that it is a violation by statute of the contract which these officers hold and under which they function.  If an ordinary individual sought to violate the contract in this manner he would find himself before the courts for breach of contract but the Minister wants to <Col N="1499" /> violate the contract and have the protection of the statute to cover such violation.  The principle sets out a very, very undesirable precedent and to my mind it is futile for this House to pass any enactment to give statutory protection to any body of State, or semi-State, or local authority servants if subsequently the Minister can come along and ask to have that protection removed.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I seek to amend the Minister's powers here, to give him the powers which apparently are desirable and necessary to remove officers at a prescribed age limit, and to withdraw from him the powers which he now seeks to get of removing, suspending or dismissing officers of vocational education committees.  The House should realise that in dealing with this body of servants we are not dealing with State servants.  We are dealing with a body of officers who are the employees under the Act of 1930 and under the existing law&mdash;and even under the law as it will exist after this measure is passed&mdash;of the local vocational education committees and who hold their contracts from these committees.  As in the case of the primary teachers so also in the case of the vocational teachers, because the State puts up a certain amount of money to enable the local authorities to function and to implement their schemes of education, the Minister steps in to give himself an arbitrary power which he may exercise either generally or in a given case. I hold that that is an encroachment of the contract as between the individual and the committee.  I hold that in the contract that does obtain there is a contract between that committee and the individual and that in no sense can the Minister be regarded as a party to the contract.  If my memory serves me correctly, I think in the case of the primary teachers, who contested the Minister's right to do certain things, it was found that the courts took the view that the Minister was not a party to the contract and could only act in a merely supervisory capacity.  The courts did not question his right to make regulations and they did not question his right to prescribe conditions or qualifications.  To my mind they did question whether he <Col N="1500" /> had the right in given circumstances to alter conditions of the contract as between the individual and his manager.</P>
    <P>Now the contract here is not made between the manager and the individual teacher.  It is between the local committee and individual teacher and the Minister here wants to give himself rights over the heads of that committee, if he sees fit to remove, suspend or dismiss an officer.  The protection of the local inquiry, as far as I can recollect, is still available to the individual concerned, but these powers may be exercised in an arbitrary fashion&mdash;I am not saying that they are about to be exercised in an arbitrary fashion by the present Minister&mdash;by a future Minister.  They may be exercised on the prejudiced report, if you like, of an individual inspector. We all know that in the operation of schemes of this kind human conflicts will arise, personal conflicts between individual inspectors and individual teachers or C.E.O.'s.  Some of these individuals may have very peculiar characteristics or idiosyncrasies.  The human element enters into the matter very much and it is possible for an individual to be placed in the position in which he has no redress against a biased inspector or chief inspector who has the ear of the Minister.  For that reason, I think the powers sought by the Minister should not be given to him.  If he needs powers to retire individual officers on grounds of age, by all means let him have them, but there is no need for these extra drastic powers of removal, suspension and dismissal which he is now seeking. He told us previously that he sought these powers to meet a hypothetical case and that he has no concrete case in mind.  I put it to him then, and I put it to him now, that powers of this kind should not be sought unless there was a concrete case which could not be disposed of in any way other than by the exercise of these drastic powers or that such a serious condition arises in vocational education that the Minister cannot operate in any other way.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out before, the Minister has already ample powers on the initiative of the local committee to suspend, <Col N="1501" /> remove and dismiss officers of local committees but here the power and authority of the local committee are being pushed on one side.  The independence of the local committee is being undermined and whatever views the local committee may have as to the fitness or otherwise of an officer, these may be swept on one side and the Minister may, on the advice of his own advisers in the Department, ignore local committees, and proceed to exercise these arbitrary powers against an individual officer.  The two elements that strike me as most reprehensible in this matter are the drastic interference with the existing contract under which these officers hold office, the drastic withdrawal of the protection which was given transferred officers in the Act of 1930, and the encroachment on what should be the peculiar preserve of the local vocational education committee who were after all the employers of the particular officers in question.  The contract of appointment is made subject to the Department's regulations, subject to the prescribed qualifications drawn up by the Minister, by the local committee. The power of dismissal is vested in the local committee subject to the Minister's sanction.  The suspension of an officer is already vested in the local committee subject to the Minister's sanction.  Surely these powers are sufficiently ample to enable any Minister to exercise his functions in relation to any particular officer. Surely a case has not arisen anywhere &mdash;I questioned the Minister on this and he told me no case had arisen&mdash;in which a local committee has set up its will in favour of a particular officer as against the Minister or his Department. No case has arisen where an attempt has been made by a local committee to hold on to a particular officer who was regarded by the Minister as unfit for his office.</P>
    <P>When we pressed the Minister on these points in the Committee Stage debate he said that his principal worry and concern were to have his powers to retire officers on the ground of age clarified.  I put it to him then as I put it to him now that the House is prepared to give him these powers but it is not at all agreeable to give him <Col N="1502" /> the extra additional powers of suspension and dismissal which he seeks.  I submit that a case has not been made for these powers and I think that it is altogether improper to come to the House on a purely hypothetical case and ask for them.  Many of these officers as I have said have very long service.  They had definite guarantees from this House that the conditions under which they would continue to serve would not be worsened by reason of their transfer under the 1930 Act.  It is all very well to say that some of these men received promotion and got appointments which would not normally accrue to them.  I think that is beside the point, because the whole purpose of their transfer and the whole purpose of the Act was to enable these appointments to be made.  These men were transferred to the new service on the understanding that they would be in the running for promotion and new appointments.  It is beside the point altogether now to take advantage of the fact that they improved their position as an argument in favour of seeking these very drastic powers. I would appeal to the Minister to restrict the provisions of Section 5 to the powers which he requires to enable him to retire officers at the prescribed age limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this section is not to confer additional powers upon the Minister but to remove the doubt to which the Deputy refers.  I think that having regard to the debate which took place on the 1944 Act to which I would refer the Deputy, there can scarcely be any doubt as to the intention of the House in the matter.  We had a discussion in which the position of these transferred officers was adverted to and finally the measure was passed. I think there is no ground whatever for any suggestion that Sections 6, 7, 8, in that Act refer to transferred officers as well as to other officers of vocational education committees. That was the intention of the Oireachtas and if there is a doubt in the matter as there seems to be, the object of Section 5 is to remove that doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan suggests that there <Col N="1503" /> are powers there already.  We had discussed the matter fully in the 1944 debate&mdash;the matter of the removal of an officer from his office and the question of an inquiry.  That section replaces the appropriate section in the 1930 Act.  We either have to accept the position laid down in Section 8 of the 1944 Act or not.  That is the law at present, but, as a doubt has been raised, I think it should be dispelled in relation to Sections 7 and 8, as well as Section 6.  I went fully into the question of inspectors at the time and it is not necessary to pursue the matter.  The vocational education committees are aware of the procedure which has to be followed by inspectors when cases arise of such seriousness that the officer's position may be endangered and he may be removed from office, in connection with teachers in particular, and I have not heard any complaint as to the procedure laid down and conveyed to the committees.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the matter of the suspension of an officer and, if we had not got that section, there would be no power in the vocational education committee to suspend an officer pending an inquiry into the charge against him.  That power was there under the Act even preceding the 1930 Vocational Education Act&mdash;in Section 11 of the Local Officers (Employees) Act of 1926&mdash;and in the 1944 Act we merely revived that power of suspension. The Deputy bases his case very largely on the ground that protection is being taken away from these transferred officers and that some injustice is being inflicted upon them.  We had that also in the debate on the 1944 Act.  If the contention is that some special privilege was being given to these officers over and above other officers employed by local authorities, I say that there is no foundation for it.  What they were given was an undertaking that the service into which they were being transferred, that is, under the vocational education committees, their remuneration would not be less nor their conditions of service less beneficial than they enjoyed in the service they left.  No one has contended that their remuneration has suffered&mdash;quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> As regards the terms and conditions of service, apart from remuneration, when the 1930 Act was passed, these officers were in the same position as all other officers of local authorities. The vocational education committees were then committees operating under parent local authorities and the officers were in precisely the same position as other officers of local authorities. Under Sections 25 and 27 of the 1941 Local Government Act, the Minister for Local Government took powers to exercise precisely the same powers as the Minister for Education and the vocational education committees exercise under the 1944 Act regarding vocational education officers, under Sections 7 and 8 of the Act.  Therefore, if there had been no Vocational Education Act, and if these officers were subject to the same conditions in the service from which they were transferred, they still being in that service, as before 1930, they would be subject, presumably, to the new code and the new legislation which the Minister for Local Government has introduced.  In any event, the Deputy has stated that their condition has been worsened by the amending legislation I have introduced, but he has not shown in what respect their position has been worsened.  I suggest that there is no ground for the allegation and that the House, if it accepts the section, is simply confirming the intention which it endeavoured to express clearly in the section of the 1944 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a question of attempting to confer a privilege on any existing body of officers and to give them conditions of employment with which the conditions of any other body of officers in the service would compare unfavourably.  All I was seeking was to preserve to them the existing conditions they held by virtue of an Act of this House&mdash;by Section 99 (3) of the 1930 Act.  The Minister says <Col N="1505" /> we are not doing anything in this measure to worsen the conditions of their employment, that apparently that was done in 1944.  That may be so, but despite the good intentions of the Department in 1944, they found that, though they thought they had given themselves all these drastic powers, they had not clarified their own position in relation to the exercise of these powers in respect of transferred officers.</P>
      <P>I do not say that this measure worsens their conditions in the sense that it specifically provides for these drastic powers for the first time, but I say that the 1944 Act was a statutory violation of the conditions guaranteed by law to these officers in 1930.  Following the debate here I would remind the Minister that the measure succeeded in passing the Upper House by one vote, showing clearly that the Seanad took a very serious view of the encroachment upon the rights and conditions of employment of transferred officers, and that, in itself, is sufficient to indicate to us now that this measure should have received more consideration from the House as a whole than it did receive.</P>
      <P>I can only say that it is a very bad precedent to set up and I hope the Minister will not again come to the House to give himself further powers to remove, suspend or dismiss officers. He says he has not got these powers, but I say that, under the 1930 Act, he had all the powers that any reasonable Minister would need to exercise in relation to any officer regarded by him or by a vocational education committee as unfit, by reason of age or inefficiency or misconduct, for the performance of the duties of his office.  I see no case for this measure, and I want to be taken as protesting vehemently against the statutory violation of a contract guaranteed to this body of public officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As Deputies, I think, will agree, this is a rather simple Bill and does not require very much explanation. I probably will hear more about what is not in the Bill than what is in it.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to safeguard the public from dishonest auctioneers and house agents.  At present auctioneers are required to take out licences under the Auctioneers Act, 1845, and house agents who deal in houses with an annual rent over £25 are required to take out licences under the Revenue No. 1 Act, 1861.  Any person who pays the appropriate licence duty can obtain a licence, however. The duty on a licence for an auctioneer is £10 and the duty on a licence for a house agent is £2.  In view of the fact that property and money are regularly held in trust for their clients by auctioneers and house agents, the Government consider it desirable that untrustworthy persons should be excluded from the profession, and that auctioneers and house agents should be required to give security.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes that in future an auctioneer's licence or a house agent's licence should not be granted or renewed unless the applicant obtains a certificate of qualification from the District Court and lodges a deposit of £2,000, or a guarantee bond for that amount, with the accountant of the Courts of Justice.  It provides that a single deposit or bond will suffice for a firm irrespective of the number of partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago a private Bill was brought in and the principal matter in connection with that was that the auctioneers themselves desired to have a council which would control the business.  That was turned down.  I think I am right in saying that the last Government were not prepared to agree to it.  This Government was not prepared to agree either and the Minister for Finance, I think, indicated that in the Seanad in 1932 or 1933 <Col N="1507" /> Before deciding on the provisions of the present Bill, therefore, I gave careful consideration to representations which were made to me for the establishment of a council with powers to control the auctioneering business in the same way as the Incorporated Law Society controls the solicitors' profession.  I came to the conclusion that there was not a good case for empowering a vocational body to control entry into the auctioneering business.  I feared that the establishment of such a body would tend to make the business a &ldquo;closed borough,&rdquo; no matter what safeguards were provided. I felt that there was not the same necessity for insisting on technical qualifications in the case of auctioneers and house agents as there is in the case of solicitors; and furthermore, it seemed to me that, on account of the variety of the work performed by auctioneers, it would be very difficult for a council to fix a uniform standard of competency for licensing.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me that a council would at least require a period of apprenticeship before admitting any person to be an auctioneer.  I am doubtful as to whether such a requirement could be justified, however.  For instance, there is no doubt that many farmers, who have never been apprenticed to the auctioneering business, would make better auctioneers of farms and farm produce than persons who have served apprenticeships in the offices of auctioneers who specialise in other classes of business.  For these reasons I formed the view that it would be unwise to attempt to regulate the auctioneering and house agency business, except in so far as is necessary to prevent untrustworthy people and &ldquo;men of straw&rdquo; from entering the business.  I think the auctioneers themselves will be at one with me in that matter.  They are very concerned at the situation that exists, as there is nothing to prevent even a person with a criminal record from becoming an auctioneer as things stand at present.</P>
    <P>The deposit of £2,000 is not intended to provide complete insurance against frauds.  It is intended to provide a minimum guarantee, in order to ensure that newcomers to the business will not be tempted to make away with the <Col N="1508" /> first few hundred pounds which come into their hands.  I am glad to be able to say that in recent years we have not had a single case where an auctioneer of long standing was found guilty of fraud.  Nearly all the cases which came before the courts were cases of men who went wrong at the very start and in nearly all cases the sums converted amounted to only a few hundred pounds.  The matter was recently referred to in the Dublin Circuit Court and I think the judge expressed concern at the fact that untrustworthy people could become auctioneers.  I think that the £2,000 deposit should be sufficient to ensure against defalcations of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that I welcome this Bill as far as it goes.  My only regret is that it does not go far enough.  The Minister made it clear that his concern and the concern of the Government was to safeguard the public.  Unquestionably, in the Bill before us the Minister goes a certain distance to do that.  My quarrel with the Bill, and I think it is the quarrel of the auctioneers' association, is that it does not go far enough, not nearly far enough, to protect the public.  I want to make it clear that this Bill does not confer a single benefit on auctioneers.  In fact it imposes on them considerable financial obligations and a good deal more trouble and expense in various ways. So far as I know, there is no reputable auctioneer in the country who objects to anything that is contained in this Bill, with the few minor exceptions that I hope to have set right on Committee Stage.  In fact, as the Minister and, I think, the House, know, the Auctioneers' and Estate Agents' Association have been pressing for legislation for at least 15 or 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble about this Bill is that it talks about an auctioneer or a person who wishes to take out an auctioneer's licence obtaining a certificate of qualification. It is not a certificate of qualification because there is no test whatever in the Bill as to the applicant's competence to carry out all or any of the duties which an auctioneer usually has to carry out in the course of his business.  Therefore, may I suggest that it is not right to talk about the <Col N="1509" /> certificate as being a certificate of qualification?</P>
    <P>It is merely a certificate of personal fitness and any person who may go before a court and who is a respectable, decent man in the ordinary way, but who might be entirely unfit, for one reason or another, who may not have the remotest idea of the value of anything from a chair to an estate, must get a certificate and the court would not be carrying out the intention of this Bill if it refused to grant him a certificate.</P>
    <P>That is the main objection of reputable auctioneers to this Bill.  It is the main objection of the association, so far as I know it and, certainly, from whatever experience I have, personally, it is my objection to it also.  It is quite legitimate for anybody to say to me: &ldquo;What experience had you when you started or what experience had any of your colleagues when they started?&rdquo; Frankly, I had no experience beyond whatever little common sense I may possess and, of course, as I grew older in the business and acquired knowledge and experience I began to realise how little in fact I did know about the business when I started.  It is for that reason that I can appreciate all the more that an incompetent auctioneer or valuer may unwittingly be responsible for severe and heavy losses to a person who entrusts his property to him either for sale or for valuation. I do not wish to weary the House by quoting actual cases which came under my notice, particularly cases of valuations being made, where property was valued in such a way as to entail severe financial loss to the person whose property was valued or, as happened in very many cases, severe financial loss to the revenue.  That is the main objection.</P>
    <P>The Minister said&mdash;and, speaking from recollection, I think he is correct when he says that the Government's predecessors had the same view&mdash;that one of the reasons why the Government refused to agree to the council or to registration was that it would tend to make the business a closed borough. There is no such intention so far as the auctioneers are concerned and so <Col N="1510" /> far as the auctioneers' association is concerned.  To give the House some idea of the right of the association to speak for auctioneers, I may say that there are over 500 auctioneers members of that association and those 500 are spread over the country, not confined even to the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of misunderstanding of this Bill.  There has been a good deal of misrepresentation. I know about the misrepresentation and I know the reasons for it and I know the people who are responsible for it.  They are the very people against whom this legislation is aimed. They are the people who are setting out that if we got registration or a council it would mean a closed borough, that it would be a matter of holding it for the big fellows.  There is not a shred of truth in that.  The original suggestion was that there should be a council set up, that the members of that council would be nominated by the existing licensed auctioneers in the country and that a number of the members of that council would be nominated by the Minister; that the regulations for admission to practise in the business of auctioneer and valuer would be drafted by that council but would have to be submitted to and sanctioned by the Minister so as to ensure that that council would not impose any impossible regulation or any regulation which would keep any ordinary person who was entitled to engage in the business from engaging in it.  I want to make that clear.</P>
    <P>Another piece of misrepresentation and, to some extent, misunderstanding is on the question of the deposit.  We are told that the deposit of £2,000, either by way of cash or securities or insurance bond, is brought in deliberately to keep the small man out. You can take it from me that if that were so I would not be supporting this Bill because I am one of the small men who probably would be kept out myself. Another point in connection with that that is put abroad is that the cost of the premium for such a bond would be severe.  So far as I am given to understand, the Auctioneers' and Estate Agents' Association have been assured by a number of reputable <Col N="1511" /> insurance companies that the annual premium on a bond of £2,000 would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £10.  I suggest that is not an undue burden to be placed upon any man who proposes to engage in this business and I further suggest that any man of any standing, in the country, city, or anywhere else, will have little difficulty in obtaining a bond from any registered insurance company operating in this country.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the criticism I have heard of the Bill.  The other side I have heard is that the amount fixed for the bond is not sufficient. Some people say it should be far higher.  If it were fixed at a far higher figure, there would be perhaps some truth in the criticism that it would keep out certain people who legitimately ought to be allowed to act as auctioneers, estate agents, house agents, valuers, and so on.  Two thousand pounds are not going to be, as the Minister has stated, a complete cover or guarantee for people whose money is held in trust by auctioneers.  To those who would be inclined to object to the deposit I would like to point out that auctioneers&mdash;and I speak now not merely of the few men at the top of the business or profession but of auctioneers generally throughout the country&mdash;hold in their possession from time to time very, very large sums of money.  In some sales deposits run into considerable amounts.  In other sales, if any legal or technical difficulties arise regarding title or anything else, deposits may remain in the hands of the auctioneer for a considerable time.  I think it is only right that there should be some protection afforded to those people to whom such money belongs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has very truly said that there have been very, very few cases where reputable auctioneers have done away with money, the property of their clients.  As far as I know, in those cases where money has been embezzled, it has been by auctioneers whom I can only describe as &ldquo;a mushroom growth.&rdquo;  An absurd position exists under the present law whereby any person with £2 in his pocket can <Col N="1512" /> walk in at any time and purchase a house agent's licence just as easily as he can purchase a 2½d. stamp.  Having done that he can hold himself out as a house agent.  He can canvass an owner for a house and he can tell that owner that he has a buyer.  Perhaps he may produce a buyer.  He receives a deposit of £200, or £300, or perhaps £500.  Now that house may be the only asset that the person who is selling it has in the world.  That person may never see that £500.  If a man has £10 in his pocket he can walk into the office and get a licence which entitles him to hold himself out as an auctioneer, an estate agent, or a valuer.  He need possess no qualification of any kind and nobody will ever raise any query.  The system in operation at the present time is absurd.  I admit that there have been comparatively few cases where fraud has taken place.</P>

      <P>That is what I say; it is not a very large number. But, even though the number is not large, it is desirable that this House should put a check upon it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that one of the principal reasons why they would not agree to registration or to the setting up of a council was because it would be difficult to fix a standard of competence. I cannot see where the difficulty arises. As long ago as 1931 a suggestion was made that a council should be set up consisting of existing auctioneers throughout the country together with a certain proportion of members nominated by the Minister himself. The purpose of such a council would be to draft regulations governing entrance into the profession and the qualifications required before a licence would be issued.  These regulations would have been submitted to and sanctioned by the Minister.  In my opinion, that would have provided a full safeguard and would have ensured that the profession could not be made a closed borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this Bill takes us only a certain distance, and a very short distance at that.  Only partial protection is given under it and that partial protection consists of the £2,000 bond or <Col N="1513" /> deposit.  The question of competence does not arise at all.  Until such time as some definite regulations are made regarding competence there will not be a sufficient safeguard.  Those of us who are in the business&mdash;even in a comparatively small way&mdash;realise that every day one comes up against problems as to the value of a house, the value of an acre of land, the value of a farm, the value of a piece of furniture and a hundred and one other items.  The person who asks to have a valuation made of such property is completely dependent upon the valuer for a just and equitable valuation.  On the competence of the valuer will depend whether that person is going to get a just price or suffer a serious loss.  I regret that the Minister has not seen his way to accept even in principle the question of registration.  If that had been accepted, then it would have been a simple matter to adjudicate upon competence and it would have been comparatively easy to frame a section, or sections, in such a way as to ensure that nothing could arise in the nature of a closed borough.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Minister and assure the House that, so far as the auctioneers and estate agents are concerned, it is not the intention and never was the intention to make this profession a closed borough.  While I do not suggest that we are absolutely or completely blind to our own interests in the matter, I must say to the credit of practically every member of the association that their main consideration at all times is to protect the public and, in protecting the public, to protect their own good name.  We know that in every profession there are a certain number of black sheep who appear in our law courts from time to time, and the tendency is for the public to paint every member of the profession in identical colours.  I am not satisfied that it is beyond the capacity of the Minister to fix a standard of competence which would meet with general approval.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as far as it goes, but I regret that it does not go far enough.  There are, I think, a few points requiring clarification.  In the title of the Bill there is no mention made of valuers at all.  As everybody <Col N="1514" /> knows, the usual title is auctioneers, valuers and estate or house agents.  I do not know whether there is any point or any significance in that omission.  I want to refer the Minister to Section 7, sub-section (2) (c).  That seems to me to introduce something which cuts across the whole principle of the Bill. A person who may be engaged for a week, or two, or ten weeks, or ten months as a rent collector is brought in under the Bill, but he will avoid all the obligations that are placed upon every auctioneer and house agent under the Bill.  I do not think that is helpful. It might be a question of one house, or it might be a question of 20 houses, or it might be a question of a very large estate.  I do not think that any person, merely by virtue of the fact that he has been appointed a rent collector, should be armed with the full powers of a house agent without having to go before the courts or take out the necessary licence.  Unless the Minister has a very strong reason for that, I think it would be better if it were omitted altogether from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with a rather new feature.  It deals with auction permits as distinct from auction licences.  I am not at all clear whether only one individual in a firm can get a permit to conduct an auction.  Let me put it this way to the Minister.  There may be an auctioneer working on his own, and either because of the fact that he is doing a very large volume of business, or because he may not be in the very best of health himself, he may require for the successful and efficient carrying out of his business, to have one, two or even three members of his staff qualified and competent to conduct auctions.  The section as it stands at the moment is certainly not very clear to me.  Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An application under sub-section (1) of this section shall be accompanied by the excise duty payable on an auction permit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what the amount would be there.  I know what the amount is for a licence but what is the amount for an auction permit as distinct from the licence?</P>

      <P>It is the old story of cutting a stick to beat yourself.  This is certainly a stick to beat ourselves. There are one or two other matters to which I would like to refer.  There is one rather serious matter-at least we look upon it as very serious&mdash;dealt with in sub-section (4) of Section 19.  The sub-section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any member of the Gárda Síochána may, at the request of an officer of customs and excise, arrest without warrant any person conducting an auction who, when requested by the said officer so to do, fails to produce and show forthwith to such officer an auctioneer's licence or auction permit under which he is authorised to conduct the auction or in lieu thereof to deposit immediately with such officer the sum of £10.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those of us who drive cars know that we occasionally go out without our driving licences in our pockets.  The licence may have been paid for and left at home inadvertently.  I can quite readily conceive myself conducting an auction having forgotten my permit and certainly not having £10 to hand to an officer in lieu of the production of my licence.  I think that to give a customs officer authority to command the Guards to arrest me or any other auctioneer without a warrant, and to take me away forthwith, perhaps in the middle of an auction, is going a little too far.  Mind you, if you remove an auctioneer in the middle of some auctions you might have to send for a squad of Guards to look after the stuff left behind by the auctioneer.  I should like the Minister to look into that matter again.  These are just a few points with which we shall deal more fully on Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up my remarks, I should like to emphasise again that this Bill does not confer one single benefit on any existing auctioneer.  There is again a misunderstanding on a further point. Some people seem to think that when this Bill becomes law, it will not be necessary for existing auctioneers to go through the procedure laid down in the Bill-to go to a District Court in order to obtain a licence.  The fact is that any person who wishes to carry on an auctioneering or house agent's <Col N="1516" /> business after the Bill becomes law will have to go through the procedure set down.  That is why I say it does not confer a single benefit on existing auctioneers.  It is going to inflict obligations on auctioneers, perhaps for some auctioneers very substantial financial obligations, but so far as I know there is no reputable auctioneer who objects to any of the obligations which the Bill proposes with the exception of the few items which I have mentioned.  On the contrary, not only do we welcome it but we have been urging the passage of a Bill like this for the last 15 years. Secondly, I would direct the attention of the House to the fact that there is not a single provision in the Bill directed towards the question of a person being competent in any degree either as an auctioneer, house agent or valuer.  There is no question whatever of any test.  I have already suggested to the Minister and to the House that it is wrong to talk in this Bill about a qualification certificate. The certificate has nothing whatever to do with the person's qualifications to be an auctioneer.  It is merely a matter of personal fitness.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt sufficiently clearly already with the question of the deposit.  The fact is that no person of any standing whatever, whether in the city or the country, should have any difficulty in obtaining the necessary guarantee bond which the Act requires for a sum of £2,000.  I think it will be found that that deposit will be of value, particularly to the small owners of property.  These are the people to whom a loss would mean far more than to a person who has other property or means.  I think I have covered as many points as it is possible for me to cover. I have tried to make the position of existing auctioneers as clear as I can. We welcome the Bill.  We regret that the Minister has not found it possible to include sections which would give some guarantee of competence.  However, I can assure the Minister of our utmost help and co-operation in his efforts to strengthen the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill. I consider it a measure that is long <Col N="1517" /> overdue, but I am rather disappointed with some of the terms of it.  There is no doubt that there were some people &mdash;I will admit they were very few&mdash;who obtained auctioneers' licences who should not have received them.  It is obvious that when this Bill becomes law more supervision will be exercised in the issuing of auctioneers' licences. As I say, I welcome the Bill, but I am disappointed that it has not gone far enough.  The only protection it gives to the public is that the applicant for a licence must apply to the courts and anyone who is interested can object. A deposit of £2,000 must be paid or an assurance bond must be given in lieu of it.  The sum of £2,000 in my opinion, is too high for auctioneers who carry on business in rural areas, but, on the other hand, it is too low for auctioneers who carry on business in the cities and larger towns.  In my constituency in South Kerry there has been no great increase in the price of land.  The farms are small and, with the exception of good pockets of land or land in the proximity of towns, the average-sized farm could be bought for £500.  Then it must be remembered that auctioneers carrying on business in rural areas carry on such business as a side-line.  They have other businesses and other interests.  If these auctioneers are compelled to take out a bond for £2,000, it will be putting them to extra expense for which there is no necessity.  A bond of £500 would be sufficient to meet the case.  Small farms do not realise very much money and, as the auctioneers only hold deposits, there is not justification for asking those in rural areas to provide bonds of £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Morrissey, I am very disappointed that the Minister did not introduce a section compelling an applicant for an auctioneer's licence to show that he has some knowledge of the business, that he is familiar with the value of house property and of land, and has some knowledge of the law.  I have seen people acting as auctioneers who knew nothing about the value of land.  They were unable to advise clients in that respect, and were scarcely able to fill in the contract in the conditions of sale.  I am <Col N="1518" /> not suggesting that the District Courts should be turned into examination bureaus, but I have no hesitation in saying that the Minister should be able to find a means by which persons applying for licences should show that they had some experience of business.</P>
    <P>I am not in agreement with the procedure to be adopted.  There is no necessity to compel an auctioneer to go to the court every year for a renewal of a licence.  It is right that an applicant for a licence, in the first instance, should go to the court, but I do not see the point in requiring a man to go there every time he is seeking a renewal. Everybody familiar with court work knows that when an application goes before a district justice, he asks the superintendent if he has any objection, and if he has not, the licence is granted.  I suggest that the procedure for renewal should be that the qualification certificate should be signed by the superintendent, and if he did not do so, the applicant should have the right to appeal to the District Court. That would be sufficient to meet the case.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that this Bill was brought in in order to protect the public.  As far as I am aware, an applicant for an auctioneer's licence had to pay £10 but under the new procedure it will probably cost £24. Seeing that the amount is being increased no protection is needed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very silent on one matter which, I think, is of importance. Deputy Morrissey did not refer to it. It concerns the amount of fees paid to auctioneers.  At present they are paid a flat rate of 5 per cent.  There is discontent throughout the country about the fees, as both vendors and purchasers consider them to be too high.  I cannot see any reason why auctioneers should be paid at such high rates.  It should be remembered that solicitors' fees are fixed on a sliding scale.  I do not see any reason why a similar method should not be adopted for auctioneers' fees.  They receive 5 per cent. on a £1,000 sale, and the same rate on a £20,000 sale.  There is no justification for that, and the Minister would be well advised to bring <Col N="1519" /> regulations placing some restrictions on fees.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Morrissey that sub-section (4) of Section 19 should be removed.  There is absolutely no justification for giving an officer of customs and exise power to arrest an auctioneer if he has not his licence in his possession. A situation might arise where a respectable auctioneer, conducting a sale, might, by an oversight, not have the licence in his pocket and in order that he would not be arrested, he would have to borrow £10 from someone. The provision set out in the section is not sufficient to prevent arrest in such a case, and the Minister should be very reluctant to give such power.  I cannot see any value in that sub-section, because the auctioneer can avoid arrest by handing £10 to the officer of customs and exise and then carry on.  Looking at the matter in that way the sub-section is not of any value.</P>
    <P>I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that fresh fish sales are excluded by the Bill.  I have seen cured fish sold by auction on a few occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill is designed to remove a number of serious defects that now exist it is bound to meet with general approval. The overriding consideration must be the public interest and, as far as I can observe, that protection is given, particularly in Section 14, by the bond of £2,000 which is to be provided.  It is true that there is a certain amount of uneasiness among small auctioneers, who think that a bond of £2,000 might be prohibitive, and calculated to put them out of business.  My own view is that that is a misunderstanding.  They seem to be under the impression that they will have to make a physical deposit of £2,000, whereas the Bill provides a way out, a bond from an insurance company, involving only a premium.  In that respect I might point out that rate collectors are entrusted with public moneys, and have to have a bond.  Apparently the Minister is applying the same system here.  There is a good deal in the view expressed that there might be a grading of the amount of the bond as within rural areas, <Col N="1520" /> small towns and cities.  The volume of business transacted in a small town is obviously not on a par with that dealt with in an office in Dublin.  There is room for grading there, so as to make it equitable, and in accord with the amount of business transacted, especially when we see the value to which house property has soared.</P>
      <P>The main weakness in the Bill is that adverted to, that Section 13 does not prescribe any standard of efficiency in respect to individuals to whom licences are granted.  I should like to ask the Minister how a district justice would decide that an applicant was a proper person to be an auctioneer.  Is it to be presumed that he is a fit and proper person because he is of good character, and in a position to provide a bond for £2,000?  In the world we see around us to-day, obviously that is not sufficient. He may be an excellent man by repute, and may be in a position to provide a bond, but he may be hopelessly unsuited to a position which is highly complex and exceedingly responsible. The only way in which the standard of efficiency can be prescribed is by a system of apprenticeship.  And referring to apprenticeship, may I say that some firms in this city might improve their standards?  Those of them who take fees ought to ensure that the individuals from whom they take the fees will have an opportunity of learning their business as they should learn it during the period of apprenticeship. I am informed that some of these young men are engaged for most of their time on routine office work and that they never, or rarely, get an opportunity of learning the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I adhere to the principle of apprenticeship as a solution of the problem of competency.  A condition should be prescribed by which the young man who goes into this very important business will undergo an examination, the same as in any other business, at different periods, with a view to the ascertainment of his standard of efficiency.  There is no provision for that form of apprenticeship in the Bill. Section 13 merely prescribes that an individual shall go to the District Court and will get his licence if he fulfils the conditions, and, incidentally I might suggest to the Minister that <Col N="1521" /> that section, as drawn, might be very unfair to certain applicants in that there is no provision for appeals.</P>
    <P>Returning to the matter of apprenticeship, I feel that the only way in which a system of apprenticeship can be operated&mdash;and naturally I am viewing this whole matter in the light of what I see around me in the City of Dublin rather than in the rest of the country&mdash;is under some organisation such as that which already exists in relation to the auctioneering business and which has done exceedingly well over a number of years.  I have seen the case made by the association for a council of registration and council of control, and, unless the Minister has very grave objections to it on the lines that it might lead to what might be termed a closed borough, the case will stand a good deal of argument.</P>
    <P>The auctioneers have an association for a considerable time, the members of which are men of repute, and in that association, with suitable safeguards whereby the Minister would have complete and absolute power, I see the ideal way of dealing with this matter of apprenticeship.  It is a tribute to the people engaged in this business that there has been such a very small number of defaulters in the last dozen years-something like 13 in 12 years.  That is an excellent record. As I say, I have read their case and find it very hard to combat the arguments they put forward for registration and a council of control, particularly as it would concede to me the point, which I think is most important, of competency being achieved through a system of apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>A good deal might be said on the question of licences, but obviously it is linked with the matter of the bond. We have the rather archaic position in which a house agent at present can set up in business in relation to furnished premises by paying a premium of £2, whereas the individual who wants to deal with unfurnished premises need pay nothing at all. There is, however, the rather more serious question&mdash;and I am not so sure that the position is remedied by this Bill&mdash;that an individual convicted of <Col N="1522" /> fraud during the period of his licence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

I should like to support the view expressed with regard to sub-section (4) of Section 19.  Reading that sub-section, it struck me that the Minister embodied it for the purpose of seeing how the House would react to it.  The procedure is of a rather cut and thrust type and I have no doubt it will be suitably amended in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that auctioneers have a great responsibility to the community and more particularly to their clients makes it necessary that this Bill should receive serious consideration.  Deputy Morrissey has adverted to the portions of the Bill which might require strengthening and I should like to support him in that view, primarily on the question of qualifications.  A rather commendable procedure is adopted in the Bill which will make it incumbent on an applicant for an auctioneer's licence to go before the District Court and involve himself in the publicity which the 28 days' notice must give him, with the result that anyone who knows any reason why he should not receive a licence will be afforded both time and the opportunity in which to oppose the granting of that licence but assuming that there is no opposition and that the superintendent of the Guards accepts the applicant as a fit and proper person in every way to be granted a licence, I consider that that individual may be entirely unsuitable for carrying on the business of auctioneering and estate valuing. The certificate which the District Court will give him will be only a certificate of personal fitness, and I suggest to the Minister that, if he does not accept the suggestion made by Deputy Morrissey, which, I understand, is the suggestion adopted by the Auctioneers' and Estate Agents' Association, that a council should be set up to consider future applicants, <Col N="1523" /> at any rate, he should prescribe certain statutory conditions which an applicant would have to fulfil before getting the licence.</P>
      <P>Section 13 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An application for a certificate of qualification may be refused on any of the following grounds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that the applicant is not a fit and proper person to hold a certificate,</P>
      <P>(b)  that the applicant is an undischarged bankrupt,</P>
      <P>(c)  that the applicant is disqualified under Section 18 of this Act from holding an auctioneer's licence or a house agent's licence,</P>
      <P>(d)  that an auctioneer's licence or house agent's licence previously held by the applicant has been suspended or cancelled under Section 18 of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Section 18 disqualifies anybody convicted of fraud or dishonesty, the other qualifications imposed by Section 13 are entirely inadequate, and the Minister should well consider the desirability of setting out clearly certain qualifications.  I think that any person engaging in the auctioneer's business should have served some period of apprenticeship.  It is quite true that when many big auctioneers, men with a good name established by reason of many years of satisfactory and honest service to the community, started originally, they had no particular qualifications and, as Deputy Morrissey said, they acquired their qualifications after years of experience, years, possibly, which involved in some degree losses to their clients, not through dishonesty, fraud or neglect but by reason of the fact that the individuals concerned were not fully able to give expert opinion on the value of property.  By reason of their inability to give that expert opinion, the individuals whom they advised were at a loss or were obliged to sell property at prices lower than those they would normally have fetched.  Of course, it is true to say that if property is put up at auction the value is very often stated to be what the vendor can get for it.  When the auctioneer holds <Col N="1524" /> the auction and there are sufficient bidders, it may make its value or it may not.  At any rate, the auction has been held and the vendor has had a full opportunity of having his property put before the public.  The prospective purchasers have had an equal opportunity of deciding what they consider a fair end proper value for it. But, in view of the fact that no qualifications have ever been required for any person acting as an auctioneer, I think the Minister should seriously consider the desirability of having a council of advisers, or, at any rate, inserting certain statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I should like to refer is the question of the bond. The question of the bond has been received with mixed feelings in the House.  Some people consider the amount provided for is not sufficient. Some people probably consider that for certain areas the amount is too big. The bond certainly may work inequitably. An auctioneer in a remote rural district or in one of the smaller towns will be dealing with property of far less value than an auctioneer in one of the bigger cities or towns.  Nowadays property has appreciated so much in value, however, that what was formerly regarded as a large sum of money is not now so regarded. Formerly, £2,000 was regarded as a big sum, but, with the great appreciation in prices and values, it is not now so regarded.  I suggest to the Minister, however, that, instead of a bond being required from auctioneers, all moneys received by auctioneers should be regarded as trustee moneys; that moneys paid to auctioneers or by auctioneers to clients for property should be treated as trustee money; that the auctioneers should be under a legal obligation which would leave the client in a position to demand that the money should be placed to a trustee account.</P>
    <P>At the moment, I understand that banks keep trustee accounts for minors and wards and manage trustee business, if so required, but that would not mean that banks would undertake the management of trustee accounts under this Bill.  It could, however, be overcome, if necessary, by amending the law to enable banks to treat all moneys coming into the hands of auctioneers, <Col N="1525" /> or anyone who is in a position similar to an auctioneer, who has a responsibility to the vendor to see that he is paid his money and a responsibility to the purchaser to see that the money which he deposits goes into the proper hands, in such a way that both parties are effectively safeguarded so far as the transfer of the money from one to the other is concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, if he adopts a proposal which would allow both the purchaser and the vendor or anyone dealing with auctioneers to require the auctioneer to put the money to a trustee account, it would prevent the possibility of fraud.  While it is very satisfactory to know that there have been only 13 cases of fraud in about the same number of years, it would certainly guarantee the money for the vendor and the purchaser and, at the same time, it would free auctioneers from the burden of taking out a bond for £2,000 or whatever sum is decided upon.  From what Deputy Morrissey says, it is obvious that a very small expense is placed on a person who wishes to take out a bond. If you can get a £2,000 bond for £10 or £12, then the financial commitments of the auctioneer are limited.  I certainly suggest to the Minister, if he is keeping this provision in the Bill and proposes to stand over it, that he should not reduce the amount of the bond because property nowadays has appreciated so much that a £2,000 bond is not by any means an excessive burden on an auctioneer.</P>
    <P>As to the question of fees, I suppose anyone who is not in business imagines, when he sees a person in any line of business doing well, that the fees are excessive.  Lay people probably imagine that lawyers get excessive fees. Lawyers probably imagine that auctioneers get excessive fees and I suppose auctioneers consider that lawyers get excessive fees.  But, by and large, I think that the fees are reasonable.  It may be that fees should be on a sliding scale.  Where a certain fee is payable on property of a limited valuation and then, as property appreciates, the same fee is payable, there may be something to be said for a sliding scale.  But, on the whole, I <Col N="1526" /> think fees are fairly reasonable.  While considerable objection may be made by those not actually acquainted with the business, it must be remembered that there are expenses which auctioneers are obliged to undergo for advertising, etc., which must be met out of whatever fees they get.  Of course, in certain cases I understand that auctioneers make it part of the bargain that they will be refunded all expenses.  While other values in the community have increased considerably in later years, all forms of professional fees have, I think, remained more or less static.  If a revision is necessary, then a revision of fees in general and of all forms of payment for services rendered should be undertaken.  Subject to these remarks, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction and is welcomed by every auctioneer of repute in the country.  The Bill is a recognition of their profession, because it is a profession. They deal with large sums of the public's money and the public must have great confidence in those to whom they entrust their money and upon whom they depend to see that they get good value.  Therefore, I say that it is a profession which is worthy of the recognition which the Government is giving to it.  The public are also being protected.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on the effort he is making to protect the public.  I do not see much difficulty with regard to newcomers into the business and I do not believe that this will drive out the small men.  It would not drive out the small man.  The Minister is not insisting on a cash deposit or on a security. An insurance bond or a fidelity bond, as is taken out by rate collectors and other public officials, will be sufficient and that can be secured for anything up to £25 premium for £2,000.  Personally, I regard it as a very proper safeguard.  The applicant for a licence should be recommended by his local Gárda superintendent as a fit and proper person to hold a licence and to practise in the business and, having been accepted as a fit and proper person, thereafter his fee should be accepted, in the same way as a <Col N="1527" /> publican pays his licence duty, unless there is a conviction recorded against him or unless the Gárda superintendent knows of something he has done that is not in accordance with the regulations.  I do not think it would be right to ask a member of the profession to apply to the courts every year for a licence.  All that should be required is the first application and the granting of a certificate of fitness.</P>
      <P>The Minister in regard to Section 9 referred to a permit being applied for. I want to know what is the meaning of that.  Why should there be a permit to auction if there is already a licence to auction?  I earnestly hope that it does not mean that a person outside this country can come to this country and make an immediate application for a permit to carry out some very big auction and then to leave the country. In my opinion, the only person who should be allowed to auction in this country are those with at least five years' residence in the country and who have the high recommendation of the Gárda superintendent.  I do not think there is any danger of an outsider coming to this country to hold an auction but it is possible that the representative of a large concern across the Channel might be appointed to wind up an estate here or to auction off ground rents, and I do not think that should be permitted.  There should be at least a five years' residence qualification.</P>
      <P>Three or four months ago a woman came to me to complain that the £100 deposit that she had paid on apprenticing her boy to an auctioneer could not be recovered.  What would be the first claim on the £2,000 in case of default? There should be some priority.  What would be the position of the apprentices in the case of a firm that defaulted where the apprentices had paid £100 or £200 fee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be treading on dangerous ground and I trust that Deputy Morrissey and others who are interested will bear with me, but I think there is room for more provisions in the Bill regulating the business of auctioneers. There is always an odd black sheep who attempts poaching.  Poaching in the auctioneering world is not new.  A prominent <Col N="1528" /> firm of auctioneers may be asked to sell a particular property and his bills will be put on the property. and he may advertise the property. Another auctioneer may find out about the property and may interview a prospective buyer.  There may be difficulty in the case where the buyer has interviewed two auctioneers and the question then is which auctioneer is to receive the commission.  I know that the code of honour in the profession is very high, as high as in any other profession, but there is a possibility of such a case arising and I would ask the Minister to see that rules and regulations are laid down.  I hope Deputy Morrissey and the other speakers will not mind my drawing attention to that matter but I know it has happened more than once that a buyer had the misfortune to interview the representatives of two firms and that a dispute arose.</P>
    <P>Personally, I welcome the Bill, but I would almost go so far as to ask the Minister to withdraw it and to bring in a fuller Bill.  The Bill before the House does not deal with all the points that have been raised in the past few years and, as the Minister anticipated in his opening remarks, more fault has been found with what is not in the Bill than with the provisions in the Bill. I congratulate those who have shown the Minister the necessity for bringing in such a measure and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it in.  It is a step in the right direction and gives certain protection to the public but perhaps not to the extent that is required.</P>

      <P>The Bill before the House that has been brought in by the Minister for the protection of the public has received rather a good welcome.  The only criticism of most of the speakers on the opposite benches was that the Bill falls short of what they would like to have in it. Personally, I should not like to see any more in the Bill than what is now in it.  I think the Bill goes far enough. I do not agree with Deputy Morrissey or other speakers that the Minister should legislate for efficiency of the individuals in the profession.  I do not think it is the Minister's duty and I do not think he is called upon to legislate <Col N="1529" /> for efficiency in any business or profession.  I do not think he is called upon to legislate for the efficiency of any particular business or any particular profession.  It is a purely commercial undertaking, and I cannot see why the Minister or the State should be called upon to legislate for the efficiency of the individuals who seek a livelihood in such a profession. I think the Minister has gone quite far enough.  I would remind Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Cosgrave that their own Party refused to adopt such a measure.</P>

      <P>Like everyone else.  At any rate, they were not prepared to adopt such a measure.  I am sure that the Minister is not prepared now to make this profession a closed borough for the people who are already in it or for those who may go into it in the future.  I think it would be quite wrong to do that.  The public are very quick to judge the competency of the people in that particular profession and people do not remain very long in the business if they are not competent.  It would be impossible for the Minister to lay down standards of competency. No matter how competent a person may be, that does not necessarily mean that such a person, because of his competency, is incapable of fraud. No Government could legislate for the honesty of its citizens.  It is not the business of a Government to do that.  The Minister is seeking in this Bill merely to provide a safeguard to the public whereby auctioneers, who handle large sums of money, will make good any cases of fraud that may arise.  That is all that the Bill is intended to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> With regard to the certificate of competency, I think some alteration is necessary there.  Provided an auctioneer has got a certificate of competency, that should be sufficient, so long as he complies with the section which lays it down that he must procure a licence each year.  The one certificate should be sufficient.  If anything goes wrong it will be brought to the notice of the proper authorities very quickly.</P>
    <P>There are some sections in the Bill which, I think, require amendment. Section 19, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, does need amendment.  In the definition section, I think the Minister should define what a Dutch auction is.  In regard to the section which deals with fraud, it would be open to a district justice under the section, as at present drafted, to convict an auctioneer for fraud because he did not stamp insurance cards and to say that he was not a competent person to hold a licence.  I do not think that is intended there.</P>
    <P>Most of the provisions of this Bill have been taken from the old Act. Section 19 has been taken almost word for word from the old Act.  I do not think it should be permissible under this Bill for a revenue official to demand the arrest of any person without a warrant.  I think that is entirely wrong.  Apart from the sections dealing with the bond and the certificate of competency, the rest of the Bill is a repetition of the Act already in force.</P>
    <P>With regard to the bond, there is an acute difference of opinion as to whether it is too high or too low.  An auctioneer doing a small business in a rural area might consider a bond of £10 or £12 too high.  An auctioneer doing a large business in the city might consider the present bond too low.  However, I do not think that the bond is such as will prevent anyone from going into the business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy objects to the fees which auctioneers charge.  Solicitors charge certain fees to their clients and solicitors will charge auctioneers when they go into court.  I would like to point out that an auctioneer does not charge a client a fee of two guineas <Col N="1531" /> every time he interviews him.  He does not charge him 10/- or a guinea when he writes a letter for him.  I do not object to the fees which solicitors get.  Their work is just as onerous as that of auctioneers on occasions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Cosgrave that auctioneers should be compelled to put the moneys they handle into a trustee security, or a bank, I want to point out that the auctioneer is himself the trustee for the money which he handles We must trust somebody in this country, otherwise business will come to a standstill. Auctioneers have proved themselves fully competent to handle large sums of money.  Auctioneers have been in existence since the beginning of time and long before Christendom.  At one time an auction was held for the Emperor of Rome.  The Emperor was appointed as a result of that auction. Two armies were camped outside the walls of Rome and each army was headed by a rival prince.  The princes were held up to auction and the prince who provided the most money was made Emperor of Rome.  I take it the army subsequently divided the &ldquo;swag&rdquo; between them.</P>
    <P>Another system was in operation too in those early days which I think might be adopted with some advantage at the present time.  No man could get married unless he got his wife in the auction ring.  It was a very good idea.  I do not say it would be a good thing for this country, but the system was that the wealthy man had to pay heavily for his bride, while the poor man was given £1,000 to take away his bride.  The wealthy man paid £5,000, we will say, for a good-looking wife, and the poor man was paid £1,000 to take away an ugly one.  I merely say this to show that auctioneering goes back almost to pre-historic times.  It has been carried on most successfully in this country by the people engaged in it and the standard of the profession is very high.  The amount of fraud which has taken place is comparatively small when one considers the enormous sums of money that auctioneers handle day in and day out.</P>
    <P>The price for agricultural produce and for land is very little different, <Col N="1532" /> not more than 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. from that which prevailed before the war.  In the city, on the other hand, there is a boom in house property and in business premises.  It must be remembered, however, that there is a very large number of auctioneers in the city and when the business is divided amongst them, it can scarcely be said that they are overburdened.  None of them has a monopoly.  I hope the Minister will not agree to the suggestion made from the Opposition Benches that he should allow a council to determine who should and who should not be auctioneers, any more than we should ask a certain body to determine who should or should not be barbers. I think the Minister was wise in introducing the Bill.  With some slight amendments, I am sure the Bill will prove to be that safeguard for the public which the Minister desired to provide in introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the broad principle that the Government is a bad Government, that the Minister is a bad Minister, and that everything that the Government set themselves to do is bad, I should like to be able to describe this as a bad Bill.  However, I have read it fairly carefully, I have listened to the speeches that have been delivered in the debate, and I am satisfied that the Bill does not call for any drastic amendment.  I doubt very much if it can be improved in any of its sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes me that the deposit required is fair, is not excessive, and, that on the broad average, it is not fixed too low.  So far as the certificate required is concerned, I think it will serve a useful purpose inasmuch as it demands a certain amount of publicity before a person is admitted into the auctioneering profession. That publicity through the District Court, and through the intervention of the officers of the Gárda, will ensure that no exceptionally bad character will enter the profession.  Having regard to the fact that the profession has been open to all citizens at a very modest fee up to the present, it is remarkable that there have been very few defaulters in the business.  I think the standard of honesty and <Col N="1533" /> honour in the auctioneering profession of this country has been always very high.  That may be due to the fact that those in the business have set a high standard and have more or less forced everybody who comes into it to adhere to that standard.  I think that is satisfactory and, to a great extent, it is better to let well enough alone, so far as we can.  Therefore, I am against a very drastic change which would have the effect of restricting entrance to the profession.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan made a very able speech in which he advocated the advantages of apprenticeship.  There may be a considerable amount in what he has said, so far as the auctioneering business in the city is concerned. I do not profess to know anything about that business, therefore I cannot express an opinion.  It may be true that the obligation to serve an apprenticeship might be beneficial there but, so far as auctioneering in rural Ireland is concerned, I think that to compel a man to serve an apprenticeship before entering the profession would be an unnecessary restriction on ordinary human liberty and it might prove very objectionable because, as we know, there are not so many auctioneers concentrated in the rural areas and opportunities of serving an apprenticeship would be very limited. I can easily see that an auctioneer would be very unwilling to train a potential rival so that the opportunity of a person serving an apprenticeship would be extremely limited.  By insisting on an apprenticeship many very desirable entrants into the profession would be debarred.</P>
    <P>We all know that young business men, young farmers have entered the auctioneering business without serving any apprenticeship and have proved remarkably successful.  They have maintained a high standard of honesty and efficiency and transacted their business to the satisfaction of everybody concerned.  There might possibly be a case for some form of apprenticeship before a person is qualified to act as valuer.  That might mean dividing the two functions of auctioneer and valuer and prescribing that a man <Col N="1534" /> should act for some years as an auctioneer before he would be qualified to act as a valuer.  There might be objection to that and I just mention it as something which might possibly be an improvement on the Bill. Generally speaking, I think the business is a free commercial enterprise and that the maximum amount of freedom should be allowed to persons to enter it.  To close the profession to those who are already in it would be open to very serious objection and it might possibly lower the profession in the estimation of the general public.  Moreover, I have an objection to this matter of imposing tests upon people entering various professions.  There are certain professions in which it is necessary to apply tests&mdash;the learned professions, such as the medical profession and the legal professions, for instance.  It is necessary to pass examinations to enter these professions but we all know that in the legal profession there have been more defaulters in proportion to the number in the profession than there have been in the auctioneering profession, notwithstanding the tests applied to entrants.</P>
    <P>Another objection which I have to the proposal to apply a test before entering the profession is that if we were to compel auctioneers to pass some examination or serve some kind of apprenticeship, we might be establishing a precedent, and people would say: &ldquo;Why should a person be allowed to enter the Dáil without serving an apprenticeship or passing some examination&rdquo;?  I think the maximum amount of freedom should be allowed wherever it is possible.  I am not convinced that in a business such as this you will get any appreciable improvement by applying an examination or a test.  The possibility is that by restricting the number of entrants into the profession you might be lowering the standard instead of raising it.  We know that auctioneering, particularly in rural Ireland, is a spare-time occupation.  It is not a whole-time job and for that reason it would not be possible for the average person either to study for the examination or serve an apprenticeship.  In many areas the earnings of an auctioneer <Col N="1535" /> per year might not exceed £100.  I think, having regard to that fact, that it would be unnecessary and undesirable to apply any test.  I have sympathy with the view expressed by some Deputies, who said that the fees charged are high.  It is a common thing for people in every profession to say that people in other professions are allowed to get away with excessive remuneration.  The ordinary person considers that the legal gentlemen fleece the public.  Possibly ordinary people, who are not in the business, think that auctioneers get their money very easily.  I think it is accepted by everybody who is not in politics that politicians get away with a huge income to which they are not entitled. One has to serve in these professions in order to find that all is not sunshine. If Deputy Allen's suggestion were adopted, that auctioneers should enter into the matrimonial business, it is possible that such business would become lucrative, but the opening up of that branch might also bring some disadvantages, and headaches for auctioneers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was sorry I had not an opportunity of hearing the Minister's introductory remarks.  As far as I am aware, this Bill simply takes steps to protect the public against certain things that have happened&mdash;admittedly in a very small number of cases&mdash;in the auctioneering and house agency business. I have personal knowledge of a case where a man lost his whole life-savings through the default of an auctioneer.  While I am prepared to admit that a very small proportion of people engaged in the business was guilty of conduct like that, any man in the profession or any honourable man would agree that steps should be taken to try to protect the public from even an isolated instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey said that he welcomed the Bill so far as it went.  Even apart from the terms of the Bill, it has been alleged that this Bill will create its own standards.  Deputy Morrissey also stated that it had been alleged that if auctioneers got a council or the registration they looked for, the business was going to be a closed borough. <Col N="1536" /> It has been stated that this Bill would make auctioneering a closed borough. I cannot see anything in the Bill that would keep any man from going into that business.  I think the qualification clause is necessary.  Whatever way procedure may be regulated, it is necessary that the public should have some guarantee that those going into that profession are honourable people, and people of standing.  I cannot see any objection to the provision of a bond.  It is a common thing in business, in banks and in the insurance line, requiring people handling large sums of money to have a bond.  I do not see any objection to it.  Money could be lost other than by dishonesty, and for a person's own protection it would be well to have a bond.  Speaking from experience in Dublin, I think fixing the amount of the bond at £2,000 is altogether too low, but when one considers the position in the rural areas the amount is probably looked upon as being too high.  Maybe £2,000 is a happy medium, unless different local scales are set up, a procedure that, I think, would lead to trouble.  I am prepared to accept the amount in the Bill as the happy medium.</P>
    <P>One point in the Bill has been overlooked. Under Section 18 it is provided that the security bond can be called upon for offences involving, &ldquo;fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust&rdquo;.  I am thinking of a case of which I have personal experience, where an auctioneer received a deposit on a house and was later declared a bankrupt.  As I understand the position under the law as it stands, the owner of the house is only entitled to a composition on the deposit.  That point should be looked into.  I suggest it should be arranged that the deposit should be put into a special account. That might mean that a man would have to pay auctioneer's fees, distinct from the deposit, but the deposit should be kept in a special account.  The auctioneer should be bound by law to do so, and that account should not be touched for any personal debt but be a trustee account until the sale is completed.  Such provision would mean that if a man failed to put the deposit into a special account he would come under the provisions of Section 18.  I would not go so far as to say that the <Col N="1537" /> deposit should be handed over to the banks to deal with as, I understand, was suggested.  There should be a special account for keeping deposits.</P>
    <P>I think sub-section (4) of Section 19 is too drastic.  There should be some other way of dealing with a position where a man is not able to produce his licence.  The sub-section goes too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very little about this business but, as a casual observer, I wish to make a few observations on points that have been raised.  It strikes me that the question of deposits has taken up most time in this debate.  I agree that £2,000 might be a happy medium in certain places, and might suit people who conduct large auctions and have many more auctions than men in a small way in provincial towns.  I should like to make the suggestion to the Minister&mdash;whether it would be feasible or not, I do not know, but it is worth mentioning&mdash;that there should be a bond for each auctioneer in accordance with the amount of his previous year's trading.  That would, at least, be an improvement on this happy medium of £2,000, because, small as it may seem to some people and easy as it may seem to get this deposit, it certainly will hit some small auctioneers, and these, too, must be protected.  Along with making the auctioneering business a profession, we must have regard to the protection necessary for the small auctioneer.  If that suggestion is feasible, I think it would work for the small auctioneer and for the big auctioneer in Dublin who to a certain extent will enjoy greater protection than the small man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not quite follow the line of argument which Deputy Cogan put up. He spoke against the apprenticeship system rather than the deposit.  If the auctioneering business is to be made a profession, and that is more or less the general idea, as against a deposit by which an individual more or less buys himself into the profession, by apprenticeship you will ensure that you will have young men as auctioneers who know what they are going to do and who will make the auctioneering business more efficient from the point of view of the public.  As it is, a man who has a good reputation and who is financially <Col N="1538" /> sound can become an auctioneer, but would it not be a better state of affairs if we had men who were actually trained?  I do not like the word &ldquo;apprentice&rdquo; because my personal opinion is that all types of apprentices are exploited too much; I should prefer to use the word &ldquo;trainee&rdquo;.  The system would be better if a young man had to serve a number of years as a trainee before becoming a fully-fledged auctioneer. I suggest that if there are any possibilities in the suggestion I make, of basing it on the sales, as it were, of the auctioneer in the previous year, it would be far better than the system under which a deposit of £2,000 must be found.</P>

      <P>With other Deputies, I welcome this Bill, but I want to draw the Minister's attention, as it has been drawn by several of the speakers, to the fact that he has not included valuers in the Bill.  Valuations are so mixed up with the auctioneering and house agency business that I do not see how the Minister can escape bringing them within the scope of the Bill.  I do not suggest for a moment that it should be necessary to take out a valuer's licence and an auctioneer's licence, but it is a serious omission&mdash;I am afraid it would involve an alteration in the title of the Bill&mdash; because it is a very prominent part of the auctioneer's and house agent's business.  I do not know if there would be any attempt to carry on as a valuer and as a house agent <i>sub rosa</i>&mdash;I do not suppose it would be possible&mdash;but I suggest to the Minister that he should cover valuers in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 11&mdash;I am probably making some points which will be raised in Committee, but I suppose the Minister will not object to getting early notice of ideas which some members have&mdash;there is provision with regard to applications for qualification certificates.  These applications are to be made to a superintendent of the Gárda Síochána, but, in Section 4, it is provided that an ordinary member of the Gárda can object to the granting of such a certificate.  I suggest it ought to be the superintendent who will make the objection.  I do not suppose that a Gárda, on his own initiative, would butt in and object to a certificate being <Col N="1539" /> granted, but, at the same time, I do not think it unreasonable to suggest that, when the application must be made to a superintendent, an objection, if there is an objection, should be made by a superintendent.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I want to refer is the thorny matter of the certificate of qualification and the matter of the applicant's qualifications.  The Minister, in his opening remarks, said that auctioneers and house agents would have to take out a certificate of fitness and qualification, but I suggest that that is not what the Bill says.  The Bill, in Section 13, says: &ldquo;A certificate of qualification may be refused on any of the following grounds,&rdquo; and one of the grounds is that the person is not a fit and proper person to hold a certificate.  The only two real safeguards there are, are the provisions which set out that a certificate of qualification will not be granted if the applicant is an undischarged bankrupt or has served a term of imprisonment.  I doubt very much if a person will not be able to get a certificate of qualification, if he does not possess these two disqualifications.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that there have been 13 cases of default by auctioneers and house agents in the last 12 years.  I think I remember the case of an undischarged bankrupt who came here from another part of the country and who did not disclose the fact that he was an undischarged bankrupt.  I think he took the precaution of assuming another name, but I think you will find that a person who came from another part of the country, assuming another name, would probably be able to get into the auctioneer's and house agent's business.  I do not know whether the Minister thinks that information in a case of that kind would not come to the ears of the body which at present rules over the destinies of the house agent's and auctioneer's business.  If you want to get a man's character, you ought to go to the other members of his own profession or calling, because they will know a lot of things which it would be very difficult for anybody to prove in court, and in fact nobody might appear in court to make the objection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> Most of the other points that I could make have been covered by other speakers.  As I stated at the beginning, I wish to add my appreciation of this measure, which I think is an honest attempt to tighten up this business and make fraud on the public more difficult.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an attempt to turn the job of auctioneering into a profession so as to justify the racket which is being carried on.  We have heard talk about qualifications.  I wonder what the qualifications of an auctioneer are.  Should he have a good loud voice which could be heard? Should he have good hearing so that he would hear the bids?  Should he be a good judge of young ladies, as Deputy Allen alleges, so that he could sell them off?  I suggest that an endeavour is being made to turn this business into something like a profession and also to make it a kind of closed borough.  That particularly applies to this move with regard to apprenticeship.  What knowledge is required by an auctioneer?  I should like to see Deputy Dockrell, or any city auctioneer, going down the country to sell a rick of hay, just as I should like to see Deputy Allen selling furniture or house property in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that you must have certain qualifications.  How you are to get them by serving an apprenticeship I do not know.  Any ordinary farmer or anybody living in the rural areas can tell you the value of cattle or sheep or farm machinery.  They do not want to serve any apprenticeship to learn that. They learn it from buying and selling those things.  What qualifications has the city auctioneer for doing that?  I have seen them going to the farmer or whoever was in charge and asking: &ldquo;What do you think that would be worth?  How many tons of hay do you think would be in that rick and what is the value of it?&rdquo; In that way they endeavour to pick up the knowledge they are supposed to have.  Yet we are told that there should be an apprenticeship served.  I think the idea of apprenticing to a city auctioneer anybody who would be supposed to do rural business would be a bit of a joke.  The city auctioneer <Col N="1541" /> would not know anything about rural business and never has any hope of learning it.</P>
    <P>Then as to the question of a valuer, what does a valuer mean?  You see &ldquo;Auctioneer and Valuer&rdquo; over the doors of premises in the city or after the names of people advertising in the newspapers.  If you bring one of these people to a farm he will know nothing about the value of cattle.  This is neither a trade nor a profession.  It is only a racket.  I do not see how else you can describe it except as a racket for getting money for being a good "shouter" for half an hour or an hour. This is an endeavour to justify the enormous fees charged by auctioneers by calling auctioneering a profession. It is nothing else but an endeavour to justify a racket.  There is no justification for the enormous sums which these people earn in a day or sometimes in an hour or half an hour.  This question of apprenticeship is an attempt to turn it into a closed borough into which a lot of other trades have been turned.  You cannot be a carpenter unless your father was a carpenter. Now you cannot be an auctioneer unless your father was an auctioneer before you.  That is the meaning of this apprenticeship proposal.  Although it is not in the Bill, you know what will be read into the Bill.  There will be no apprentice admitted unless he is the son of an auctioneer.  It will be a closed borough.</P>

      <P>I see no justification for this proposed apprenticeship.  I do not see to what a person is to serve his apprenticeship.  I do not know what knowledge he can acquire from an auctioneer.  As I said, 95 per cent. of the city auctioneers who carry out auctions of farms, farm machinery and stock know nothing whatever about them.  They only go down to inspect. The same thing would apply to auctioneers from the rural districts coming to Dublin.  I should like to see an auctioneer from Cork coming up to sell property in Dublin.  He knows nothing about it.  In the same way, a Dublin man would know nothing about the value of property in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he did, and perhaps after Deputy Corry, for all I know.  Deputy Corry has described this measure as an attempt to put a legal cloak around racketeering, an attempt to create a big profession and a closed borough in that profession. He quarrels with the principle of apprenticeship or training for the profession. I wonder how Deputy Corry would like these ideas to be applied to farming and to agriculture, about which he is wont to wax so eloquent in this House from time to time.  I wonder how he would reconcile the case he has made to-day with the case he has made on several occasions in this House for a prices tribunal, or how he would reconcile his pronouncements this evening with his demand, made last week, for the right of the farmer to pile up prices against the community, when he told us that he did not give a hoot how high the rates would soar so long as the farmer had <Col N="1543" /> the right to tax the community as he felt fit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry's statement is utterly irresponsible and, of course, he is running away with it.  He has not the courtesy or the courage to stand and take his medicine.  He talks of enormous fees earned in less than an hour or half an hour&mdash;fees which he described as scandalous.  I cannot claim to have any intimate knowledge of the auctioneers' profession but, as an individual who has some idea of ordinary business, I realise that an auctioneer's fee is not intended to cover the mere presence of the auctioneer at the auction, seeking to get bids and to sell the particular property which is under the hammer.  An auctioneer has his expenses of canvassing, travelling and particularly advertising.  Whatever fee he may charge is intended to cover these out-of-pocket expenses and, in many cases, the auctioneer, who has to foot all these expenses, finds himself at a loss because the expenditure in canvassing and advertising may go for nothing.  Very often a client may not pay anything.  I do not think it is pertinent to the discussion of this measure to drag in this question of fees.  We are not regulating the fees of auctioneers under this Bill and we do not intend, as far as I can see in the measure, to set up a system of control of auctioneers' income in any way.  Most of the business of an auctioneer is done by way of private treaty, in which case the fee is half that which is earned at a public auction.</P>
      <P>The fees of the legal profession have been dragged in by several speakers. All I can say on the question of fees generally is that auctioneers' fees, solicitors' and counsels' fees were fixed 50 years ago.  Certainly in the case of solicitors and the profession which I represent, the fees were fixed away back in 1888 and 1891 and they have not been revised, except in a very small way.  About the year 1920 there was a revision, which was a very limited revision and related to fees earned by chancery lawyers.  But, taking fees by and large in the legal profession, they are as they were some 50 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> On that point, I want to say that the lawyer who has the job of dealing with conveyancing, the examination of title and all the correspondence that arises in relation to sales of property, has a very big task to perform.  The auctioneer, likewise, has a very big task. We see him standing on the mart but we do not realise the amount of work that may have been put into the preparation for the auction before he comes out to the open.  Correspondence, interviews and expenses of all kinds are incurred.  It is very easy for a man like Deputy Corry, who is completely ignorant of the implications in this matter, to make such an attack as we have listened to.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to take cognisance of fees at all, and I do not suggest that he should, I would suggest seriously that if there is to be a prescribed scale of fees for the profession of auctioneer, valuer and house agent, the law should be so extended as to make it possible for these gentlemen to recover their fees from unsatisfactory clients and should prescribe some ready method by which the unsatisfactory client can be dealt with as well as the unsatisfactory auctioneer.  Like Deputy Allen, I am sceptical as to the effectiveness of any law passed here to promote honesty.  It was said long ago that you cannot legislate for the morals of the people. You cannot make them more moral by legislation.  I do not believe that, with the present tendency here and elsewhere, you will make our people any more honest by legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards this particular measure,</P>
    <P>I would have preferred to see this problem approached in an entirely different way.  It is right and proper that a profession such as this is, despite Deputy Corry's disparaging remarks, should have some means of regulating the conduct of its members. I would prefer that that conduct should be regulated by a system evolved by the profession rather than by a sort of police measure, which is the framework of this Bill.  In all these trades and professions it would be much better for the profession itself to set up its own code of etiquette and conduct, its own system of registration and that these professions should have power to set <Col N="1545" /> up councils or boards to regulate these matters and to deal with professional misconduct.</P>
    <P>In that way the profession would itself be able to weed out all the undesirables and would be in a position to guarantee to the public that those who were entering into the profession, or who were actually engaged in the profession, were <i>bona fide</i> persons whom they considered to be fit and proper persons to conduct the business of auctioneer, valuer or house agent.  I believe in that connection that there is a necessity for evolving a scheme of apprenticeship or training.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry, and other speakers, questioned the need for an apprenticeship in this profession.  I think anybody who knows anything of the duties imposed upon auctioneers at the present time must realise that there is a grave need for prescribing some minimum standard of qualification and knowledge so that every kind of quack cannot go around the country valuing property.  The valuation of property involves a certain amount of technical knowledge.  Whilst a certain amount of that knowledge can be acquired by a system of apprenticeship and training the only real test is, of course, in the school of experience itself.  Nevertheless there is a grave need for some system of training for people who are about to enter that profession or who are thinking of adopting that profession as a career in the future.</P>
    <P>We would be able to overcome many of the difficulties raised by Deputies in this House if we had a system of registration under which existing auctioneers, who have been established in business for three or five years, would automatically become registered. We could then prescribe some system of training and an apprenticeship period for the future entrants to the profession.  I think where you have men handling huge sums of money from time to time it is only right and proper that they should be given the status of a profession.  Their work involves a considerable degree of trust and confidence and integrity and we should have in that profession only men of the highest integrity and trustworthiness.</P>
    <P>With regard to the bond, I think it is <Col N="1546" /> too small.  There may be some case for differentiation as between the rural auctioneer and the city auctioneer. Some limitation of the bond may be necessary there.  But I think in the case of the city auctioneer a bond of £2,000 is very little guarantee of security against some of the gentlemen who have been operating in this country. I had a personal experience of one of them.  He opened an office in Dublin; he had an office in Dundalk and an office in Wexford, and I think he had offices elsewhere.  He committed wholesale frauds in this city.  I am glad to say that he is now &ldquo;doing time&rdquo;.  That is no consolation to me, however, because I was at the loss of the property entrusted to him for sale. In that particular case that gentleman sold the same property three times over and defrauded three different people in turn.</P>
    <P>Now we want to prevent that kind of gentleman operating.  A two thousand pound bond is a poor guarantee against a gentleman of that kind, who operated only in the large cities and towns.  I think the Minister ought not consider any reduction of the bond but rather that he should consider whether the bond cannot be raised to a more substantial figure.  We have been told that a two thousand pound bond can be secured for a ten pound premium.  A five thousand pound bond, therefore, could be secured for something like twenty to twenty-five pounds, or perhaps less.  I do not think that is too much to ask these people to pay if they want to hold themselves out as auctioneers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the granting of a certificate of qualification, I agree with the other Deputies who have spoken on this matter.  The approach in the Bill is by way of a negative approach.  We are told the grounds upon which the court may refuse a certificate, but no specific grounds are laid down upon which the court may grant a certificate. Speaking as a lawyer, I can see considerable difficulty in deciding the first ground of refusal, namely, that a person is not a fit and proper person. That is, if you like, a very arbitrary way of refusing an application for a certificate.  Is it his fitness and propriety as a citizen, or is it his fitness <Col N="1547" /> and propriety as an auctioneer, or what fitness and propriety is the court to take as a test of the merits of the application?  I can see considerable difficulty arising there.</P>
    <P>Unlike other measures where we enable courts to grant licences there is no positive test of fitness here.  I would suggest that the Minister should consider, between this and the Committee Stage of the Bill, the introduction of some statutory grounds to enable the court to grant certificates.  One of these should definitely be practical experience and the technical training and qualifications of the applicant, particularly his qualifications as a valuer. We, who have any experience of courts, know that valuers are daily giving evidence in court and that they are men who have acquired a very high technical knowledge and skill in valuations. It is essential that a district justice, hearing an application of this kind, should have some evidence as to the skill, technical qualifications and knowledge of the applicant for a certificate. It may be that some exception will have to be made in the case of the existing occupants of the profession.  I do seriously suggest, however, to the Minister that in regard to future applicants he should consider the introduction of some positive test.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Byrne that a superintendent of the Garda should have the right to certify on the renewal of the licence that a particular person is a fit and proper person.  I think that is altogether an improper function to give to the police and the less police mentality we have brought to bear on a measure of this kind the better.  I would prefer to see the profession doing this job as a matter of internal discipline within the profession.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen should realise that this is not a question of testing the honesty of the particular individual seeking a licence so much as the provision of certain safeguards for the community as a whole.  Whilst I agree with him that the less control we have in these matters the better, the Minister has not seen fit to give the necessary legal powers to the profession to regulate its <Col N="1548" /> own practice and control.  The less State interference we have the better. It is not correct to look upon this merely as a test of honesty.  It is a matter of safeguarding the community against an undesirable type of activity of which we have had experience here in Dublin in the past.  Any system we evolve is not going to prevent fraud or dishonesty.  The man who is going to defraud, rob and embezzle will continue to do so despite any system we set up here.  It is only right and proper, however, that we should attempt to regulate the profession in some way.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the manner in which the Minister has chosen to regulate the profession.  I would have preferred a measure on vocational lines which would give to the profession itself a certain measure of control, within the law, which it could exercise over its own members.  In given cases then we could give the right to certain people to go to the courts if necessary. On the question of the certificate, it may be possible for the Minister even yet to consider whether or not he would allow the council or board regulating the auctioneers' profession to give some sort of certificate to applicants which they could produce in court as to their trustworthiness, technical efficiency and knowledge so that the district justice would have something before him upon which he could judge the merits of the application.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dockrell has pointed out, he may refuse, on certain statutory grounds: that the applicant is an undischarged bankrupt, that he is disqualified under Section 18 by reason of being convicted of an offence involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust, or that he had previously held an auctioneer's licence and had been suspended by the council.  It would be necessary, in addition, to give the justice positive evidence of the fitness, in a professional way, of the applicant for the licence and perhaps of his fitness, in a financial way, to a certain extent. It might be necessary even to consider, despite all that has been said about closed boroughs, to regulate the numbers of those gentlemen who may come into this particular business in a certain area.  It has been done in the case of other professions.  For example, <Col N="1549" /> when the bookmakers sought the protection of this House by legislation, the Minister agreed to regulate the number of bookmakers who might set up in business throughout the country.  It was considered desirable that that provision should have been made, and it might also be desirable that some system to regulate the numbers of entrants to this profession in particular localities should also be considered.</P>
    <P>I feel that if this profession is open to all and sundry, despite the measure of protection that is being given to it, you will still have undesirables coming in who are prepared to pay both the licence fees and the premium on the deposit.  What will it matter to one of those gentlemen if a fidelity guarantee bond is attached by the court?  He will get away with a simple payment of a few premiums.  For these reasons I would seriously suggest to the Minister to consider any representations which may be made to him on the Committee Stage by way of amendment from this side of the House.  The measure so far as it goes is a step in the right direction but it will require a considerable amount of amendment in order to provide that safeguard for the public which we should all like to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. R. Walsh Mr. R. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>An argument has been advanced by the last speaker and other Deputies in favour of curtailing the opportunities for entrance into the auctioneers' profession.  In regard to the question of apprenticeship, I agree with Deputy Corry that there is nothing to be apprenticed to.  Some of the best and most successful auctioneers I have known have been men with a very limited education, men who learned their business in the hard school of experience and who gave 100 per cent. satisfaction to their clients.  We have been told that it is necessary to safeguard the public.  One would imagine listening to some of the speeches that every day there were numerous cases of auctioneers defaulting.  I do not think in my whole lifetime I have heard of three auctioneers west of the Shannon defaulting, and I think that would apply to most other parts of the country. I think the record of members of this profession for integrity compares very favourably with that of any other <Col N="1550" /> walk of life in this country, especially that of the legal profession.  I have heard, and heard often, of members of the legal profession defaulting.  We hear nothing about their having a security bond or deposit to safeguard their clients.  In fact, from what I have recently heard, there appears to be less security in this country in that direction than there is in Great Britain. I understand that the Incorporated Law Society in Great Britain has the right to go in periodically to examine the No. 2 account of any member of the legal profession&mdash;that is the account in which money belonging to clients is kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corry in regard to the impossibility of providing a uniform standard of examination for auctioneering.  For instance auctioneering in Dublin is quite different from what it would be in County Mayo, County Tipperary, or any rural area. The man who might be a very successful auctioneer in Dublin for selling house property, etc., might not be very much of a success in a rural area inasmuch as he might not be very efficient in valuing a farm of land.  I agree with Deputy Coogan in the statement that valuing is an important part of the auctioneering business, for which a man must have experience and judgment.  It is not a thing lightly to be dismissed. I think that there is something in Deputy Colley's suggestion that deposits paid by purchasers at auctions should be immune from seizure and should not be considered as part of a debtor's assets.  I think that there should be some scheme to safeguard purchasers who have paid a deposit and the Minister might consider that suggestion of Deputy Colley.  I believe also that there is something to be said for raising the amount of the security required.  I would not at all accept the suggestion put forward by Deputy Corish that the amount of the security should vary with the amount of the business done because I think it would be impossible to regulate it in that way.  At the present time we have sufficient crafts and trades which are closed boroughs.  Anybody who has any knowledge of this city knows that there are at least six or seven trades and crafts that are absolutely closed <Col N="1551" /> boroughs.  There may be something in what Deputy Corry stated that if this is made a profession the tendency amongst auctioneers, if they have the power to regulate entrance to that profession, would be to confine the business to their families.  They are only human like everybody else.  I think the Bill as a whole is a step in the right direction and is worthy of the support of the House.  For that reason I intend to vote for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of experience of auctioneers, perhaps more than any other Deputy in the House except those who are themselves auctioneers, and I should certainly like to pay tribute to the high standard of integrity, courtesy and efficiency I have always experienced in dealing with auctioneers.  Anyone who has had the experience of dealing with auctioneers in other countries will admit that the standard of integrity amongst our auctioneers compares very favourably with the standard in other countries, particularly in Great Britain.  I welcome the Bill because I understand the auctioneers have been asking for it for many years.  Why the auctioneers should want a Bill of this kind I cannot understand.  It seems to me to impose upon them a great hardship.  Take the case of a man who has been an auctioneer for many years, and who has given good service to the public.  To tell that man that he must provide a guarantee of £2,000 each year, and have to go to court to get a certificate that he is a qualified person, is rather hard. Perhaps that aspect of the matter might be got over by exempting auctioneers who are already in business, or who have been in business for a certain number of years.  That is a point I ask the Minister to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the provision requiring a deposit of £2,000 will turn the auctioneering profession into a closed borough.  Any man who has any chance of getting on as an auctioneer will be able to have a bond for £2,000.  I submit that there is no case whatever for imposing that obligation on people who are now auctioneers.  I do not think the public need that protection.  There are many ways in which people could be <Col N="1552" /> robbed much more easily than would be possible in this business.  If an auctioneer goes mad, and decides that he is going to keep money entrusted him, or to spend it for any purpose, the £2,000 will be available to satisfy in some part the claims of those who were dealing with him.</P>
    <P>If there is any case for a deposit or a guarantee, this should go the whole way, and there should be a provision so that any money entrusted to an auctioneer would be recovered.  I cannot suggest how that position is going to be brought about, but it should be one way or the other.  If there is a case for a guarantee there is a case for that guarantee going the whole way.  If not there is no case for a guarantee of £2,000 or any other fixed sum.  I suggest to the Minister that that needs consideration.  There is no provision by which the claims of persons who deposit money with auctioneers, and do not get it back, will be a first charge on the fund, before revenue charges or loan charges which, in the ordinary way, have priority.  I assert that such charges should be set aside in favour of people who were dealing with a man as an auctioneer.  Many other considerations arise out of that.</P>
    <P>With regard to auctioneers' fees, I do not think there is any necessity to deal with them in this Bill.  The commission that auctioneers get is well earned. People are inclined to forget that auctioneers may have only one auction in a month, and out of their well earned commission, they have to keep their offices open, so that the commission they get is not all profit.</P>
    <P>The section which deals with the annual application to the District Court is one of the most objectionable features in the Bill.  I do not know what auctioneers think of it as I have not had any conversations with them, but it appears to be most undesirable that they should have to go before a District Justice, where anyone who wishes can make a charge against them without prior investigation. There should be some safeguard against applications which would tend to make little of auctioneers, as was the case in the past.  I would prefer if a council of auctioneers were given <Col N="1553" /> some discretion in determining who would be admitted to the profession.  I think the Minister might also suggest to auctioneers some way in which to protect the public, other than this method of a deposit of £2,000 or a guarantee bond.</P>

      <P>The first question raised by Deputy Morrissey concerned qualification.  I think the Deputy stated that I said that a person would require fitness and qualifications.  What I said was &ldquo;fitness or qualifications&rdquo;.  The idea was to have persons of integrity.  It was not a question of technical qualifications. That point may be cleared up as I will consult the draftsman about it.  It could be held that a person applying should be able to show technical qualifications.  That was not intended. The matter has been dealt with fairly fully in the debate.  I mentioned difficulties that I saw would arise in the sale of different articles. Deputy Corry, in his own crude way, referred to that matter.  There are so many different things at auctions that some men could not get sale for all of them.  A man might be first-class at selling articles in Dublin, but if he went to the country he might find himself in difficulty.  That is the difficulty I see about apprentices.  I do not see how a man could know the value of every article he might be called upon to auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a layman, I think a great deal depends upon the personality of an auctioneer.  I heard of a case where a man did not recognise his own property because the auctioneer gave such a glowing account of it.  It will be found that one man would be able to make a far better case for an article than another man.  It is up to the public going to buy to say what they are prepared to pay.  Deputy Corry mentioned machinery, but it is purely a question of demand, and how anxious people are to get certain things when at an auction.  If a person needs a particular article at an auction upon which his heart is set we all know very well that he will go to a very high price for it, while other people will think him mad to do so.  The person buying it is the best judge, and the auctioneer will do <Col N="1554" /> his best with his clients, while not cheating the buyer.  Those who have considered the question will admit that it is a very difficult one.  I think it is a good thing for auctioneers to have an association.  I have no doubt about that.  If auctioneers through the country were members of an association, it would add to their prestige locally, and the association would not accept people if they were known to be untruthful.  Of course, they could not be expected to know all about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the association would.  As to auctioneers having to go to court, I can understand well established people objecting to that.  I see that position plainly but the trouble is where to draw the line.  It may be that there is some case for not asking a man to go to court a second time, once he has a certificate.  On the other hand, there might be very shaky people, and if they got through and had not the fear of going again, they might take a chance, so that there is a case for requiring an annual application.  It will be only a matter of form in most cases, I should imagine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thing is to protect the public and, incidentally, the auctioneers themselves.  They have been asking for a Bill.  I know that this is not the Bill they want, but there is one thing in it which they do want, that is, that there will be no possibility of a person convicted of any fraud being able to engage in the business of auctioneering again.  I know that we cannot make people honest by legislation, but we can provide that, if a person has been convicted of an offence, he will not operate as an auctioneer again.  That is one big feature of the <Col N="1555" /> Bill, and, in future, that will not be possible.  We have heard a lot of talk about the bond.  Some Deputies said it was too large and others that it was too small, but, on the whole, I think it is fair enough.  I have been told that an average of about £10 per year would be about the amount required and any person who could not get the £10 ought not to be in the business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey raised a question about valuers.  The reason valuers are not included in the Bill&mdash;and the omission was deliberate&mdash;is that they do not hold money as valuers.  They are called in as experts able to give an expert opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  If a person sets up as a valuer, he is not required to take out a licence.  There may be people who never conduct an auction, but who may be called in to value.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Another point was raised as to the number of people who could get an auction permit.  The position under the Bill is that a person who has a licence can get a revenue permit for any other person he sponsors.  He becomes his responsibility then, but that person need not go to the court for the permit.  He can get it on the request of a person who is an auctioneer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not exactly my point.  I understood the position up to that point.  What I wanted to know was if it is possible for an individual auctioneer, or a firm of auctioneers, to get more than one permit. The Minister will appreciate that a firm operating in a large way might require to have two or three members of its staff with permits to conduct auctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do so.  With regard to the section enabling a member of the Gárdaí to arrest, that section is taken from the 1845 Act.  I was not inclined to put it into the Bill, but it was embodied at the request of the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not think the power was ever used to any great extent, but I can see a reason for it&mdash;some &ldquo;chancer&rdquo; setting up in some part of the country.  I do not know whether there is any need for it, but I will look into it again.  It seems objectionable, but it is a revenue requirement, and I shall have to consult the Minister for Finance to find out if there is any case for its withdrawal. The Revenue Commissioners seem to think there is reason to have it in the Bill, but I shall have the matter examined again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Healy wants us to differentiate in the amount of the bond, but we could not do that.  He also mentioned the auctioning of fish, and the position in that regard is that the Minister for Agriculture will be bringing in a Bill dealing with the auctioning of fish.  Deputy O'Sullivan who spoke about apprenticeship&mdash;and I have dealt with that matter&mdash;says there is no provision for an appeal if a man is turned down.  There is provision for appeal.  Unless there is a section in some statute debarring a man from going to the other court, he has the same right of appeal to the Circuit Court against a refusal to grant him a licence as he now has in any other case.  Although it is not specifically mentioned, that is the ordinary law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Colley, although not dealing with quite the same point, had the idea that we should have some trustee account in respect of these fees.  The trouble about that is that it could easily be a costly affair.  The funds would require auditing and the machinery for enforcing such a provision would be rather difficult to devise and, I think, rather expensive.  I scarcely think it is necessary. I did know a very hard case of a man who sold cattle&mdash;he was a cattle salesman&mdash;and the money was closed on by the bank, but it is very hard to deal with these matters.  I will look into it, but I think it would be very costly and very hard to enforce.  If a person wants to be dishonest, he will get away with it once, no matter what you do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is payable to a trustee account, he could not get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless you have an auditing system, how are you to find out whether he is being dishonest or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same as money payable in the ordinary case to a trustee account.  If the money is payable to it, the bank will not pay it out, except on the authorised signatures of the trustees.  A similar arrangement could be made in this case by which no money would be payable from that account except on proper authorisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We did consider something of the kind on my own suggestion, because I had personal knowledge, as I say, of a case in which a man sold his cattle and the cheque was put into his account and then the bank closed on him that day.  I was very keen on it and I had the matter examined, but I found it very difficult to deal with it.  We can, however, consider it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to auctioneer's fees, both points of view were expressed. Some Deputies said the fees were reasonable and others said they were not, but I do not think it is for me to fix fees.  I do not think it is my job, <Col N="1558" /> and I have no intention of doing it. Taking into consideration, however, the expenses of auctioneers and so on, I expect they are fair enough.  I do not know whether it is publicly known or not, but there was always a suggestion that if a big auction was to take place, an arrangement was made by which the fees are not as big as people think. I do not propose, however, to deal with fees here.</P>
    <P>On the question of priority and of who should have first claim on the deposit, I suppose that would have to be left to the court to decide.  Deputy Allen thinks that one application should be sufficient, and he also wants Section 19 amended in relation to the power given to the police to arrest a man who is unable to show his licence. As I have said, I will look into that matter.  Deputy Dockrell thinks that some person of the rank of superintendent should be the person to object to the granting of a certificate, and not an ordinary Gárda.  He might go as far as the rank of inspector, but I will look into it.  Down the country, it might not always be possible to have the superintendent there, but I suppose he thinks there would be something <i>infra dig</i> in a Guard making the objection.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Where a contribution in lieu of rates on agricultural land occupied by a State authority for the public service is made to the council of a county out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas and, in reckoning the amount of the contribution, credit is taken for the amount of the allowances to which the State authority, if it were the rated occupier of the land, would be entitled under this Act, the Minister for Finance may <Col N="1560" /> make to the council as part of the additional grant referred to in sub-section (2) of this section a grant of an amount equal to the amount of such allowances.</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section the expression &ldquo;State authority&rdquo; means an authority being a Minister of State or the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is to enable the Minister for Finance to pay the county council an agricultural grant in respect of the land in each county occupied by State authorities for public purposes.  As the House is aware, it has been customary for the State to make a payment, sometimes described as a bounty in lieu of rates, in respect of property occupied by the State, which property is not rateable property and therefore is not rated.  The position is that several Ministers hold land for public purposes in various counties and, unless statutory authority were given to enable the Minister for Finance to contribute towards the rates which otherwise would be payable in respect of that land, no grant on account of it would become payable to the county council.  This amendment is to enable the Minister for Finance to pay the county council an agricultural grant in respect of land held by Ministers for the purposes of the State.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not in for the Money Resolution.  The Minister may have given his explanation as to my difficulty in regard to sub-section (2) of this section.  On the Second Reading, I raised a question as to the way this money was to be provided. At the time, the Minister suggested that I was in error as there were precedents for it.  The Minister mentioned tuberculosis and housing.  So far, I have not been able to find any precedent in any Acts bearing on the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Section 3 (2).  The Minister said he would give an explanation <Col N="1561" /> on the Money Resolution.  Subject to whatever he may have said, I should like to press this matter further, because I can find no Act of this House or its predecessor which gives the power to be given under this sub-section. Every Housing Act contains an upper limit beyond which the aggregate of the grants under it cannot go.  There is only part of a Housing Act which seems to give some authority for this and that is the provision with regard to loan charges in the 1932 Act.  Even under that Act, the schemes have to be approved by the Minister and there is a maximum of 66? per cent. with regard to the percentage of loan charges which the Minister is empowered to pay.  If, for instance, he found that the amount he was called upon to pay was unnecessarily high, he could reduce the percentage below 66? per cent.  My contention is that some safeguard appears in every Act which empowers money to be given from the Central Fund to local authorities by way of grant or anything else.  So far as tuberculosis is concerned, the 1908 and the 1913 Acts do not contain any provision for grants.  All the money for tuberculosis under these Acts has to be found by the local authorities.  Grants are made, but these are made by way of an Estimate presented to this House.</P>

      <P>So far as I can see, every grant is estimated for in advance.  In this case, we are being asked to guarantee that we will pay whatever amount of money may turn up next year.  That is not an estimate. No one can give an estimate of the amount required for next year under this sub-section.  It will depend on the rate struck by 26 different county councils.  The Minister shakes his head.  He started off, first of all, by ignoring this, and then, when I pressed it, he dismissed it with a wave of his hand.  Then he got to the point that he was to give an explanation on the Money Resolution.  It looks as if there is something at the back of it.  I do not want to go any further, because I am more or less repeating what was said on the Second Stage and I would prefer to hear some explanation <Col N="1562" /> from the Minister as to the precedents for this.</P>

    <P>There is precisely the same provision. Deputy Sheldon tries to imply that there is an essential difference between the provisions of Section 6 of the Housing Act of 1932 and the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the present Bill because, he says, there is an overriding limit fixed as to the total amount of expenditure incurred under the Act of 1932.  That is quite true but then the Act of 1932 was an Act which was intended to operate over a long period of years in circumstances which the Oireachtas, when that Act was passed, could not foresee with any sort of reasonable assurance.  It has been in operation for 14 years now and during that period the limit fixed by the original Act has been increased several times.  But the Act which we are now dealing with relates only to two years&mdash;the current year, in respect of which the total amount required could be assessed with very close accuracy&mdash; so closely, I think, has it been assessed that, when the final account comes to be struck, perhaps about £29,000 more than the £1,000,000 which was originally contemplated, may be required&mdash;and the next year.  Next year, unless there is a complete revolution in the attitude of the ratepayers and representatives of the ratepayers on the local authorities generally, we may assume that the obligations to be met by the Exchequer in respect of this Act will not be considerably more than they were this year.</P>
    <P>But, at any rate, the amount of that obligation will be readily determined some time in February of next year, in time to permit of the Estimate, which Deputy Sheldon rightly thinks is an essential element in this matter being brought before the Dáil.  It is essential, because without the Estimate the moneys cannot be voted by the Oireachtas, and if the moneys are not voted by the Oireachtas the Minister for Finance is powerless to implement the sub-section and, of course, it falls to the ground.</P>

      <P>The Oireachtas is always the final judge of the circumstances existing at the particular time that its consideration has to be brought to bear upon a particular problem; what the Oireachtas does to-day in respect of present circumstances does not necessarily affect its judgment or fetter that judgment in any way when it comes to deal with the circumstances of to-morrow.  But we can assume that it is reasonably probable that the Oireachtas next year will adopt the Estimate necessary to give effect to the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 3.  To try to get back, that puts the Oireachtas in relation to the sub-section in exactly the same position as the Oireachtas was in relation to the Act of 1932 because, though there was an overriding limit put as to the total amount of money that could be advanced under that Act when that Act was passed, the amount of money being such as was considered necessary to enable the programme which was in contemplation when the 1932 Act was passed to be carried out, nevertheless, if the Deputy will look at the Estimates for my Department he will see that every year there is included a sub-head dealing with the obligations which have to be met under Section 6 of the Act of 1932.  Not only that, but he will also see there other sub-heads dealing, for instance, with the grants to be made under the Tuberculosis Acts or dealing with the grants to be made under the Acts regulating the treatment of venereal disease, and so on.  So that there is nothing unusual in the provision which is being made here.  It is not necessary for us to put in an overriding limit in this case.  It is not necessary because we can reasonably foresee what are the commitments of the Oireachas in relation to this section.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to say that in respect of the current year the total amount that will be required to implement that is not likely to exceed £1,030,000.  It may be more or it may be less next year, because, after all, there are certain factors operating to vary the situation either way.  It is quite possible, I think, that in relation to a number of materials which we require for the construction of roads and perhaps even for the construction of houses, that there may be a fall in price.  If there is, naturally, the estimates of the local authorities will be correspondingly reduced.  On the other hand, if the present trend continues, it is quite possible that the rates may be a little higher, but, provided that the local services continue to be administered with present-day economy, even if that leaves a considerable margin for further economies, and provided also that the Government in respect of, say, the road-making activities of the local authorities, continue to give them the same generous assistance next year as they did this year&mdash;and they have already undertaken to do that&mdash;I do not anticipate that there will be any very considerable increase or any real justification for any very considerable increase in the rates of the local authorities next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I had half-hoped that the Minister had a case but, if he has a case, I have not heard it.  He suggested that the only difference is one of degree between this provision and the provisions of the 1932 Housing Act.  My difficulty at the moment is that the Minister's statement bristles with so many errors and inconsistencies that I hardly know on what to seize.  The Minister read out the enabling section of the 1932 Act. It begins by saying that &ldquo;the Minister may with the sanction of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;, and he asks me to believe that that is only slightly different in degree from &ldquo;the Minister shall make&rdquo;.  The one is permissive. The other is mandatory.  It is entirely wrong to suggest that what we are doing now has any relation to cash. <Col N="1566" /> Later on we can turn around and say: &ldquo;We will not give you the money.&rdquo; In other words, the local authorities have nothing on which to go because this House is sovereign and it can turn around and change its mind next April or May, or whenever the financial provisions come before it.  As far as the promise in the Bill is concerned it is not worth very much.</P>
      <P>I think that what is really wrong is that we are trying to make something work which at the present time does not work too well.  The present system creaks and we have to bring in this extraordinary provision.  The Minister cannot find a similar section or sub-section in any other Act.  He quotes the grants given under the Tuberculosis Acts.  There are no grants under the Tuberculosis Acts.  The word grant does not appear in those Acts. When the Minister quotes the wording of his Estimate I would remind him that the wording of his Estimate is inaccurate because it specifically says grants under those Acts and, in fact, the Acts make no grant at all.  What the Minister really means is that he asks the House and the House makes the grant in respect of expenses to local authorities under those Acts, but the grants are not given under the Acts.  No statutory provision is made. There is no statutory provision anywhere for anything comparable with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that we need not anticipate anything revolutionary.  I am afraid he is underestimating our local authorities.  My argument really relates to next year because nothing can be done this year.  Taking the figures for the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties the total valuation on agricultural land which received abatement last year under the old Act was £6,991,919.  A few simple calculations will show that on that basis&mdash;and, of course, the valuation of agricultural land in the Twenty-Six Counties is not going to vary very much&mdash;we discover that out of every shilling increase in the rates the Minister for Finance in this House will be asked to pay back 6d.  That is general over the Twenty-Six Counties.  If you take any particular county&mdash;Donegal, for instance&mdash; on this year's figures out of a total <Col N="1567" /> warrant of £234,000 odd the State's contribution will be £120,555, which is about half, or perhaps a little more than half.  Now if the Minister for Finance thinks the Donegal County Council are not going to see that out of every shilling they put on the rates in the next year the State is going to pay 6d.&mdash;if they can get away with a shilling increase which is going to cost the taxpayers 6d.&mdash;he is being very optimistic indeed.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter with some other Deputies and I tried to get them to see my viewpoint.  They all sheered off because as members of local authorities they wanted to keep quiet. They thought the local authorities were going to make a very good thing out of this and that it would be better for them to keep quiet.  The Minister says this applies to one area and that is so.  But it is increasing and the next step will be that the present Minister, or some other Minister, will come in with a Bill and say: &ldquo;Look what you did in 1946; you gave the E.S.B., or the C.I.E., or some other semi-State bodies power to go and spend money and you contributed half of it.&rdquo;  That is all right.  The authority was given in 1946.  The Minister quoted the 1932 Act as a precedent for this and I shudder to think what this may be quoted for as a precedent in the future. If you allow the same divergence you will be running into grave extremes.</P>
    <P>The whole trouble I see about this is that it is impossible to amend it without stultifying the whole procedure.  I am only too anxious to see a good measure of relief given to the rates on agricultural land.  If this section were amended the Act would cease to have any meaning at all&mdash;if it has any meaning, since the Minister considers that it does not bind us at all.</P>
    <P>We can turn around and tell the local authorities that we have no authority to give them that amount of money.  I am trying to get the Minister to admit that this is an extraordinary way in which to deal with this matter.  I have made my protest and if in the future anybody endeavours to use it as a precedent there will be something to show that <Col N="1568" /> it did not pass without protest and that it was passed as an extraordinary measure to meet an extraordinary set of circumstances.  Therefore, it should not be quoted in the future.  The Minister tries to justify it by saying that these other grants are given on the same basis.  That argument does not hold water.  He relies on the 1932 Act but in the 1932 Act there is a marked difference between the two enabling sections.  As far as the housing grants are concerned the amount to which the aggregate grants could attain was definitely laid down.</P>
    <P>It is only under the loan charges that the Minister has a shadow of a case and under the loan charges they are, first of all, permissive; secondly, the Minister has to make regulations which are laid before this House; and, thirdly, he can mend his hand by changing the percentage grants.  I would not have so much objection to this if someone were made answerable to this House for the money.  The Minister has no control and neither has anyone else over the amount of the rates.  Under the Local Government Act of 1946 the Minister can see that an adequate rate is struck.  The Minister has no power to go to any local authority and tell it that its rate is too high.</P>
    <P>One other slight difficulty that I see in this matter is that the Minister has said that in February next we will have a fairly good idea as to what we have promised now.  No doubt that will be a great consolation to us.  But under the 1946 Local Government Act we may not have a fairly good idea.  There is nothing to prevent the county manager going to the local authority in the following January of 1948 and saying: &ldquo;I require a supplementary rate of 5/- in the £.&rdquo;  I can see this measure giving the Department of Finance and the local authorities a lot of headaches before they are finished with it.  Even in respect of this year there are a few headaches already.  The local authorities are wondering who is going to pay the interest on their overdrafts in respect of the amounts they have lost on the collection of the rates by issuing credit notes.  The Donegal County Council have issued credit notes somewhere in the region of £23,000.  They <Col N="1569" /> are now in the position that they have an overdraft of £23,000 more than they should have had.  That position is common all over the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the Minister too great an opportunity of following a red herring.  I would prefer that he would deal with this by admitting that he has had to take an exceptional way out of an exceptional set of circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty in discussing this matter at all is that I do not know at which bird Deputy Sheldon is pointing his gun-barrel, because I thought the only issue between us was the very narrow one as to whether the terms of the sub-section were unprecedented. I quoted to the Deputy a section which I thought very fully answered that.  Deputy Sheldon said that that is no answer because sub-section (6) begins: &ldquo;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make grants out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;, whereas sub-section (2) says &ldquo;the Minister shall make&rdquo;, and he tries to deduce from that, as I must admit with some reason, that Section 6 is permissive and that sub-section (2) is mandatory.  Unfortunately for Deputy Sheldon's contention, and for the view which I once took as Minister for Finance, the courts have held that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; used in another section with a similar context is not permissive but mandatory. The Supreme Court held that in a case arising under the Military Pensions Act, 1934.  If the Deputy will study perhaps the last Local Government Act of 1946 he will see that a certain amount of circumlocution has to be used wherever the Minister is given discretionary powers and where the provisions of the statute are intended to be not mandatory but only permissive&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister shall in his own judgment, etc.&rdquo;, or some such phrase is used.  So that, as far as the difference between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is concerned, in such contexts as this, I think there is very little to choose.  Of course, the Housing Act of 1932 is not the only precedent I could quote.  I do not want to weary the House by reciting the rather involved phraseology of some of our statutory provisions but there is the Public <Col N="1570" /> Health (Medical Treatment of Children) (Ireland) Act, 1919, sub-section (7) of Section 1 of which provides: &ldquo;Any expenses incurred by a local authority in the execution of this Act ... shall be paid to the local authority out of moneys provided by Parliament&rdquo;.  As I say the phraseology is not the same but the purpose is the same.  The purpose is to pledge the credit of Parliament just as the purpose in sub-section (2) is to pledge the credit of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be in the Medical Treatment Act, but that does not make it any different because we approve of the scheme in the Bill here by legislating it.  The scheme of rating relief provided for in the Bill is approved of by the Oireachtas.  It is the Oireachtas which is framing the scheme of relief.  The scheme here is approved of by the Oireachtas.  That is one of the characteristics of this procedure, that by an Act of Parliament we solemnly indicate our approval of this system of relief for agricultural land and we pledge, as far as we can, that the Minister for Finance so long as he has the support of the Oireachtas, a fact which will be signified by the Oireachtas voting this money, will implement the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, sub-section (2) of Section 7 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1919, relating to the power to recoup losses, provides that in the case of a scheme carried out by a local authority, the regulations shall provide that the amount of any annual payment shall be determined on the basis of the estimated annual loss resulting from the carrying out of any scheme or schemes to which the section applies, subject to the deduction therefrom of a sum not exceeding the estimated annual produce of a rate of one penny in the £, levied in the area chargeable with the expenses of such scheme or schemes.  So I think we can take it that there is nothing novel in the undertaking written here in sub-section (2) of Section 3.  As to whether that is the best way of dealing with the problem or not, I do not think that is <Col N="1571" /> a matter that can be raised at this juncture.  It is a matter that might have been raised on the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand the Deputy's point in relation to the overdrafts of local authorities.  The Deputy said that some local authorities have issued credit notes in anticipation of the Bill going through and that by reason of that fact, they have had to lie out of, for example, £23,000 in the case of Donegal, pending the implementation of the Statute.  Surely the Deputy is aware that very considerable sums under the old agricultural grant have been released to local authorities?  I think a sum of £1,400,000 has already been released to local authorities so that I think the overdraft problem is not worrying them unduly.  I do not think that we can debate at length now all the matters that have been raised by Deputy Sheldon.  I hope that perhaps on a more suitable occasion he will raise the issue in a more formal way.  Then we can go over the whole ground, not by way of speech and rejoinder, but by reasoned statements which perhaps, while they may not convince either of us, will educate both of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I am not raising this point in any contentious way.  All I want is to have it made clear that this provision will not be used as a precedent in a more extraordinary way.  I must say that I am not convinced by the Minister's quotations from other Acts because, as far as my recollection goes, there is generally some provision in these Acts by which the Minister is made responsible for the money.  In this case I do not see that arising.  However, I do not see the House getting excited about it and having made my protest I am content.  I am glad the Minister cleared up the point about the overdraft. I did not know anything about the moneys that had accrued to local authorities but if no undue overdraft expense has accrued through the delay in bringing in the Bill, I think that is fair enough.  I think the Minister will agree that if by any chance any local authority has had to find overdraft accommodation and been put to further <Col N="1572" /> expense, something should be done about it because it was not the fault of these authorities that the Bill was delayed from July until October.  If this Bill had been brought forward, as the Minister said, some time in July the difficulty would not have arisen. What the difficulties were that delayed a small Bill like this from July until October I do not know but that is beside the point.  The best I can do is just to say that I agree to differ with the Minister as to whether this is or is not a precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>A difficulty will probably arise here.  Is it not going a bit too far to make provision in respect of next year?  I think difficulty will be created in the offices of local authorities, as it will now be possible for an employer to delay putting in his claim until 1st February, 1948, and a certain amount of extra work will devolve upon the officials.  I was wondering if the Minister on the next stage would bring in some provision to deal with the matter.  I think the officials may be faced with claims for abatements in 1948, while the amount of the grant that the State is going to make will not be determined until 1st February next. I wonder if there is a case to be made for next year?  After all, everybody knows the value of the abatement that is made for employment.  It is all right to make provisions for this year, but we should take special precautions to see that there is a safeguard, as otherwise the accounts of local authorities might be left in a state of chaos in 1948.</P>

      <P>The Deputy voiced quite a number of doubts which I had before I yielded to his perverseness on a previous occasion, and included in the Bill sub-section (3) of Section 7. It is quite true that the provisions of that sub-section may induce people to become a little more careless than they ordinarily would be.  On the other hand, suppose they do not put in claims in time, then they will receive an assessment greater than would have been the case if the claim had been put in early.  The rate collector might <Col N="1574" /> perhaps be more difficult to convince in the case of a late claim than in the case of one put in in due time, which enabled him to investigate it properly. In any event the Bill is, to some extent, an experimental measure.  As the Deputy knows it will run only for two years.  I think we might try out the provisions of sub-section (3) of this section in a more normal year to see how it works.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1947, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>There are three or four headings in this Estimate with which I might deal. The first is sub-head E (2)&mdash;veterinary research&mdash;for which we are asking £15,000.  That sub-head is also divided into parts.  When introducing the Estimates for my Department for the year 1945-46, I mentioned that it was the intention to make provision for veterinary research on an adequate scale and a sum of £7,000 was included in that year's Estimate for the purchase of a suitable farm on which a veterinary research institute of adequate size could be established.  No lands suitable for the purpose became available in that year, but early in the present financial year an opportunity arose of acquiring a very suitable farm which has been purchased by my Department at a cost of £22,000.  This farm, which is known as Brownsbarn, Clondalkin, is 7½ miles from Dublin on the main Naas Road and comprises some 412 acres of land of good average quality, with little or no waste, and suitable both for tillage and grazing purposes.  Owing to existing lettings and leases, the effective area available for the purposes of veterinary research is about 380 acres.  It will be necessary to erect special buildings as a research institute, the plans for which are being prepared, but the existing farm buildings, with some alterations, repairs and additions will be utilised and are of considerable value.</P>
    <P>As a sum of £12,000 was provided in the Vote for the current financial year, a further sum of £10,000 is now necessary for the completion of the purchase of the farm, of which possession will be taken at the end of the present month, November, 1946.  A further £5,000 will be required to purchase implements for the ordinary working of the farm, to take over at a valuation existing fodder crops on the farm, to purchase live <Col N="1577" /> stock, seeds, etc., and to pay the wages of the farm manager and workmen up to the end of the financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Immediate use will be made of these lands, in conjunction with the present research laboratory at Thorndale, Drumcondra, in extending immunisation experiments on contagious bovine abortion which are at present in progress and also to initiate new work which could not previously be undertaken owing to limitations of pasturage and housing accommodation. This will include experimental work in relation to bovine mastitis, the treatment of liver fluke infestation in cattle, hoose in calves and the immunising value of vaccines in louping-ill disease of sheep.</P>
      <P>The farm will also enable the research laboratory to build up and maintain a foundation stock of cattle and sheep for the breeding, for experimental purposes, of calves and lambs the exact histories of which will be known with respect to health, age and breeding.  A gradual re-division of the lands will have to be undertaken to provide paddocks of suitable size and supplied with water for the grazing of the breeding stock and experimental animals.</P>
      <P>When the proposed research institute is erected and equipped, it will be utilised for research on various diseases and other conditions of economic importance affecting animal health and also for the preparation of biological products such as vaccines, anti-sera and diagnostic agents used in the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of disease. It will also act as an advisory centre and may conduct preliminary investigation work on individual farms in cases of illness and mortality the causes of which are obscure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sub-head E (3), the sum of £13,670 under this sub-head is <Col N="1578" /> required for payment of a year's subscription to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations&mdash; 53,000 U.S. dollars&mdash;or £13,167 14s. 0d. plus the expenses of my Department in respect of the delegation to the Copenhagen Conference.</P>
    <P>The Food and Agriculture Organisation had its beginning at a Conference of the United Nations which was held at Hot Springs, Virginia, in May, 1943.  This conference set up an interim commission, which drew up a constitution and rules for a permanent organisation, and these were adopted at the first conference held at Quebec in October, 1945.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the organisation are: (1) to raise levels of nutrition and standards of living; (2) to secure improvements in the efficiency of the production and distribution of all food and agricultural products, and (3) to better the condition of rural populations, thus contributing towards an expanding world economy.</P>
    <P>Governments, in accepting the constitution of the organisation, pledged themselves to promote the common welfare by furthering separate and collective action for these purposes, and to report to each other on the progress achieved.</P>
    <P>Among its many other functions, the organisation proposes to collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture.  It intends to promote and, where appropriate, to recommend national and international action with respect to scientific, technological, social and economic research relating to nutrition, food and agriculture, the improvement of education and administration relating to nutrition, food and agriculture, and the spread of public knowledge of nutritional and agricultural science and practice.  It proposes to concern itself with, <i>inter alia,</i> the improvement of the processing, marketing and distribution of food, the adoption of policies for the provision of adequate agricultural credit, national and international, the adoption of international policies with respect to agricultural commodity arrangements, and it also proposes to furnish, particularly in undeveloped <Col N="1579" /> countries, such technical assistance as Governments may require.</P>
    <P>In the early part of this year, the Food and Agriculture Organisation arranged to take over the functions of the International Institute of Agriculture, Rome, a body of which this country had been a member for about 40 years.  The institute had concerned itself mainly with the collection and publication of statistical, technical and economic information regarding agriculture. It was proposed that these services should in future be provided by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, whose functions are, however, to cover a very much wider field than those of the institute.</P>
    <P>Both from the long-term aspects, that is, because of the statistical, educational and research services which the organisation will provide, and because of its interest in the allocation of food and supplies for immediate consumption, the Government considered that membership of the organisation was of importance to this country.  Accordingly, it was decided to apply for membership and to send a delegation to the second session of the conference, which was announced to be held at Copenhagen in September last. As the Dáil had adjourned for the summer when this decision was reached, it was not possible to discuss it here before the conference.  I was head of the delegation to Copenhagen, and I was assisted by officials of my own Department and of the Departments of Industry and Commerce, External Affairs and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The agenda for the conference comprised a number of items of importance to us, such as consideration of the present world food situation and of the food situation next year.  The main item on the agenda, however, was the proposal for a world food board.  This had been prepared by the Director-General of the organisation, Sir John Boyd Orr, at the request of a special meeting of the organisation, to deal with urgent food problems, which had taken place in Washington in May of this year.  Before dealing further with these proposals, I should like to state that the Copenhagen Conference was attended by representatives of some 41 <Col N="1580" /> countries, including all the larger agricultural and grain-exporting countries with the exception of Russia.  Four new applications for membership were submitted to the conference, viz., from Portugal, Ireland, Switzerland and Italy.  Of these, Switzerland and Italy were elected unanimously, and Ireland and Portugal received 24 of the 26 votes cast.  The Polish delegate had previously stated that he was unable to vote for our admission, as his country had no diplomatic relations with ours.  At the end of the conference, Hungary also applied for and was admitted to membership.</P>
    <P>The Standing Committee on Financial Control, one of whose functions it is to determine the contribution to be paid by each member country, decided that this country's contribution should, as a temporary measure, be placed at a figure of 53,000 United States dollars.  Although the organisation's budget for the present financial year is about 5,000,000 United States dollars, I consider that this contribution is rather high, and it is proposed to take steps to have it reduced when the matter comes up for consideration at the next regular session of the conference.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are probably aware from the publicity which the World Food Board proposals have received, the functions of the board, as visualised by Sir John Boyd Orr, would be:&mdash;(1) To stabilise prices of agricultural commodities on the world markets, including provision of necessary funds for stabilising operations.  (2) To establish a world food reserve adequate for any emergency that might arise through failure of crops in any part of the world.  (3) To provide funds for financing the disposal of surplus agricultural products on special terms to countries where the need for them is most urgent.  (4) To co-operate with organisations concerned with international credits for industrial and agricultural development and with trade and commodity policy, in order that their common ends might be more quickly and effectively achieved.</P>
    <P>These proposals were discussed very fully at the conference.  The Director-General, in presenting them, explained the need for a board such as he proposed, <Col N="1581" /> and said that the agricultural problem in peace time was to find a constant market at a remunerative price.  Half the population of the world suffered disease, physical disabilities and premature death owing to lack of food, while at recurring periods enormous surpluses of unmarketable food brought ruin to farmers.  Even now, farmers feared that agriculture would again follow the same disastrous course it followed after the first world war, and the problem could only be solved through an international agency capable of dealing with the food question as a whole.  Delegates from many countries accepted the proposals in principle, but all referred to the need for further study and elaboration of details before they could commit their respective Governments to final acceptance. It was finally decided that a preparatory commission, representative of 16 countries, should be set up to examine the proposals in detail, and that it should present its report to the organisation, which would then send copies to all Governments for consideration and call a special meeting of the conference to discuss the result. This preparatory commission, composed of the following countries:&mdash; Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, France, India, Netherlands, Philippine Republic, Poland, United Kingdom, United States, is now sitting in Washington.  It is expected that its report will be presented to the organisation within a few months.  Invitations to take part in the work of the commission were also sent to Russia and the Argentine.  It is understood that the latter accepted.  An observer, who is holding a watching brief for this country, is attending the meetings of the commission.</P>

      <P>Our economic representative in Washington, Mr. Commins.  If one may judge from public statements and Press reports which have appeared in this country in recent months, many people are under the impression that these World Food Board proposals, if finally accepted in their present <Col N="1582" /> form, would immediately provide a solution of difficulties which farmers in this and other countries experience from time to time.  I should like to take this occasion to remove any unjustified optimism that may exist in this respect.  While there is no doubt that the &ldquo;ironing out&rdquo; of fluctuations in the prices of agricultural commodities is eminently desirable, it is not improbable that a country like ours would, in effect, contribute more for the purposes of a World Food Board than we should ever gain from its operations.  We are, as is well known, large importers of grain and exporters of highly perishable commodities.  It may transpire that the grain we import may be subject to the operations of a World Food Board, which will keep the price at a relatively high figure.  On the other hand, the highly perishable commodities which we export may not come under the operations of the board, and we may conceivably find ourselves in the position of having to &ldquo;buy dear and sell cheap&rdquo;.  This, however, is not to be taken as condemnation of the World Food Board proposals, but rather as a note of warning against unduly high hopes as to the benefits this country is likely to derive from the acceptance of them.</P>
      <P>I should also like to point out that one of the functions of the World Food Board, as visualised by Sir John Boyd Orr, would be to provide funds for financing the disposal of surplus agricultural products on special terms to countries where the need for them is most urgent.  This, it will be appreciated, may have very considerable financial reactions for us, if we should be called upon to provide a portion of these funds, and our natural desire to help less fortunate peoples must be conditioned by our ability to provide the necessary finances.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated, the decision of the Government that this country should join the Food and Agriculture Organisation was made at a time when the Dáil was in recess.  I am now asking the Dáil to confirm this decision by providing a sum of £13,670 for payment of a year's subscription to the organisation plus the cost of sending the delegation to the Copenhagen Conference.</P>

      <P>A year's membership is £13,167 and there would be, roughly, £500 for the expenses of the delegation. The next sub-head of this Estimate concerns the National Stud.  There were considerable delays in transferring the National Stud from the Department to the new board; in fact, the transfer did not take place until 31st August, 1946. We must provide for the expenses of running the stud from the end of the financial year to the 31st August.  We have provided here for that purpose £9,390.  Against that we have the appropriations-in-aid, which came in during that period&mdash;£4,550.  That completes the sub-heads of the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Dáil will be unanimous in approving the purchase made by the Minister so far as a suitable farm for veterinary services is concerned.  It is a much-needed requirement and I think we can compliment the Minister on the purchase of the farm and its situation.  I believe it will prove a tremendous asset to our live-stock industry.  As a matter of fact, we were very deficient in the matter of veterinary services.  We were backward when we compare the services we had with other services.  Our opportunities for research were almost negligible and our live-stock activities are so vital to our national welfare that it seems extraordinary we were so poorly served in the matter of adequate opportunities for research.  There is no doubt the mortality resulting from disease in this country is very high.</P>
      <P>That could be substantially reduced and whatever cost may be incurred as a result of the plans that are being made for research, I believe it will be returned possibly a hundredfold; there will be a very high return, at all events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned some of the diseases that are prevalent, such as contagious abortion, mastitis, sterility, hoose and louping ill.  These constitute <Col N="1584" /> a major problem all over the country and they require urgent attention.  Then there is the question of preventive treatment to which the Minister referred and that is, if anything, more important.  There were some Parliamentary Questions addressed to the Minister some time ago as to what experiments were being carried out in the use of Strain 19 for contagious abortion.  The Minister indicated that he hoped to produce a vaccine at least equal to Strain 19, and possibly it might be better.  I am surprised the Minister did not give us some information as to what is being done in that direction.  We would like to know something of the experimental work in connection with contagious abortion, whether we are proceeding on an independent line or are we merely carrying out some research work so far as the products of the United States and other countries are concerned.</P>
    <P>On behalf of this Party, I may say we are very pleased to learn that so much progress has been made.  We feel satisfied with the selection of the farm.  Because of its size, ample opportunities ought to be provided there for necessary and urgent research work.  The natural corollary to that must be efficient veterinary services for the country.  I think certain recommendations were made by the post-war planning committee in that regard. The committee urged the importance of providing efficient veterinary services.  I have no doubt the Department has turned its attention to this problem and, now having provided a farm, it is to be hoped that their attention will be immediately directed to the provision of a veterinary service which is so essential to our live-stock interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked for money to defray the expenses and the fee for joining the Food and Agriculture Organisation. He told us a decision was made while the Dáil was in recess.  As a matter of fact, long before the Recess the Minister was urged to apply for membership of the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  He ended in a rather pessimistic mood on the success or otherwise of the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the extent to which <Col N="1585" /> our interests might be served by the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  I am more alarmed about the future of the Food and Agriculture Organisation for a reason altogether different from that which the Minister mentioned. Judging by the attitude of the United States, there may be a note of interrogation put to the whole scheme of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. Unless the United States is prepared to fall into line with other countries, the prospects are not so rosy at all.  I am not inclined to agree with what the Minister said.  It was obvious to any man for a number of years that the position of the primary producers in the world was a common interest.  So far as the prosperity of the world is concerned, it is obvious from what economists have said that that prosperity must rest on a prosperous agriculture. We must fully appreciate that when we realise that 75 per cent. of the world's population is engaged in food production.  So far as the industrial section of the world is concerned, the purchasing power for the goods produced by the industrial section comes from agriculture.  Any scheme, or any international organisation, that can help to maintain the prosperity of the agricultural community throughout the world will help to bring a higher measure of prosperity to the world generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated the aims and objects of the organisation, namely, to raise the nutritional standards, to provide a decent standard of living for all the people of the world, to provide an adequate diet for all the people of the world.  That adequate diet, of course, must be well-balanced diet which will make for normal vigorous health and go a long way to eliminate disease.  We know that this organisation was set up originally as a result of resolutions passed by the Hot Springs Conference and the aims are very laudable and praiseworthy.  As the Minister pointed out, there may be difficulties in the implementation; but, so far as the necessity for such an organisation is concerned, I think it is beyond question. Between the two wars, primary producers suffered to a terrific extent from fluctuations in prices which brought <Col N="1586" /> about a great measure of instability and insecurity.</P>
    <P>It is not generally appreciated that a very high percentage of the world's population is under-nourished.  In fact, over 50 per cent. of the world's population is under-nourished.  While a considerable number of people got what might appear to have been sufficient food, they did not get food of the right type.  They did not get nutritious food, they did not get a well-balanced diet. With that shortage of food, we had huge surpluses in the world.  We had huge surpluses of wheat.  So far as the primary producer was concerned, we had wheat being sold below the cost of production.  The cause of that was that price was the regulating factor.  Price governed production, and not the human requirements of the world.  In the approach to this whole problem, it is the human requirements of the world which should control production, and not merely price.  Price retarded production. The primary producer's margin was so narrow that he was restricted in his production.  There were millions of people who did not get an adequate diet.  The result of that inadequacy was that disease was rampant. In our discussions here on local government and other matters, we continually stressed the necessity for adequate incomes.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the solution is not by any means a simple one.  But this organisation is a States' organisation.  It is an organisation of Governments, or representatives of Governments.  It has a counterpart in the Federation of Primary Producers. The Federation of Primary Producers is an international organisation of the primary producers of the world.  They propose to help and to co-operate with the Food and Agriculture Organisation. While agreeing with the Minister that it is not by any means a simple matter, the real solution of this whole problem, of course, is for all the Governments that are members of this organisation to co-operate to try to provide adequate purchasing power, effective purchasing power.  An effective purchasing power really means adequate incomes for all the people.  So far as the primary producers of the world are concerned, the best and the most effective <Col N="1587" /> way to stimulate production is to provide that adequate income which is necessary for a family to purchase adequate food for its maintenance.  It is well to appreciate that the primary producers of the world as an organisation cannot do very much in that respect.  An organisation such as this, representing States or Governments, can help very much by its deliberations.</P>
    <P>When the Minister points out that we produce highly perishable commodities, I want to say that, while this organisation may improve cereals, it might be easier to solve the problem by attacking the price of highly perishable commodities.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that, if a food-producing country suffers from depression, it has repercussions in other countries.  That is inevitable.  If the aim of the Food and Agriculture Organisation is to raise the general standard all over the world, and if the general standard of the primary producing countries is raised, I think we may feel satisfied that we will not be left on a lower level, particularly when we remember that we are equipped in a particular way for the production of protective foods containing proteins and vitamins.  They are the highly valued foods.  I think it was Sir John Orr who pointed out that, if adequate food for all the people of the world is to be provided, an increase of from 20 to 40 per cent. in the calorie foods will be necessary, and that an increase of nearly 200 per cent. in the protective foods will be essential.  It will take a great many years to reach that high level so far as the protective foods are concerned.  We fall into that category in a particular way.  As I said, we are particularly interested in the production of the protective foods and we are equipped in a special way for the production of them.  We are amongst the few countries that have a very high surplus for export.  For that reason, we are particularly interested in the operation of an organisation of this sort.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that, in my opinion, one of the things which has resulted in chaos was the fact that countries were ignorant of each other's plans, the effects of their plans on other countries, and the repercussions likely <Col N="1588" /> to result from their plans on the world as a whole.  When States enter into an international organisation such as this they can tackle international problems. They can appreciate the plans, the aims, the objects, and the ideas of other countries.  They can adapt to their circumstances new ideas that they find in association with other peoples.  Therefore, while I agree with the Minister that the problem the Food and Agriculture Organisation has set itself is a very big one, bound up with economic considerations, considerations of adequate and effective purchasing power, related to the incomes of the people of the world, as an inter-State organisation it can deal with every aspect of the problem. That problem can be divided roughly into two categories.  The first is purchasing power, because that is the stimulus to production.</P>
    <P>Production may appear to be a comparatively simple question because surpluses existed in the world before the last war, but economists, like Dr. Bennett of the Soil Conservation Organisation in the United States, are satisfied that the arable land in the world is only barely sufficient to produce the world's food requirements and that it must be farmed on a high nutritional basis if it is to produce all the protective foods that are essential for good and healthy life.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am very pleased that the Minister and the Government have decided to join this international organisation. I feel that we are vitally interested.  I should be terribly disappointed if the Minister is right, that the Food and Agriculture Organisation will merely deal with the supply of calories and neglect the foods the Minister referred to as highly perishable commodities, the foods that are so vital to life that they are known to be protective foods&mdash;proteins and vitamins. In my opinion, they would stultify themselves if they were merely to deal with the production of calories. One could understand their being concerned with the production of wheat and grain, at present, because of the acute shortage in the world, but that is a comparatively simple problem which will correct itself in the next two or three years.  It will take a long period of years before the world will <Col N="1589" /> have a supply of the foods that are so necessary to life, and I am sure the Minister and his Department are aware of that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the future activities of the organisation, I should be much more pessimistic if the United States is not prepared fully to co-operate and, judging by statements that have been made recently by representatives of that country, their attitude appears to be rather doubtful.  I would be rather pessimistic if they are not prepared fully to co-operate, because of their tremendous capacity to produce and to dominate world conditions and to provide purchasing power.  The mighty dollar would be a very effective factor.  If their co-operation is secured, this organisation can do a lot of very useful work in helping the primary producer of the world.  The primary producer gives the most vital service to the communities of the world.  The first essential to life is food.  Food is supplied by the primary producer, yet no one can deny that he is probably the lowest paid worker in the community.</P>
    <P>That has its repercussions on every section of the community because 75 per cent. of the world population is engaged in agricultural production and industry can only be prosperous if the purchasing power for industrial production exists in the agricultural sections of the world.  When depression occurs in the world it always occurs in agriculture. If purchasing power in agriculture fails, depression is inevitable.</P>
    <P>In considering these problems we must appreciate the tremendous field of activity there is for an organisation of this sort.  We must also realise that, no matter what effort was made in the past by individual countries, failure was inevitable because depression in any country has its repercussions externally as well as internally.  The aim of an organisation like this must be a general uplifting of the primary producers of the world, to encourage them to produce to the maximum degree, so that the world's requirements in food may be provided.  That can only be done by ensuring effective purchasing power on the part of the consumer, which means an adequate income for the consumer.  It is therefore essential that the organisation to <Col N="1590" /> tackle the problem must be a State organisation.  An organisation of primary producers only would have little or no effect but if there is an inter-State organisation such as this, if it is given ample power and if its plans and decisions are accepted by the countries and Governments it represents, I think we can be optimistic instead of pessimistic in regard to the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told on very reliable authority that a sum of £7,000,000 is lost annually to the farmers of this country because of disease in live stock.  Various agricultural bodies and public bodies have been urging the Government, for a very considerable time, to make some effort to stem the ravages of such diseases. We have been jealous of other progressive countries who have made great progress in that direction.  For some reason, our Government have been very lax in respect of veterinary research, with the result that many diseases amongst live stock, particularly in dairy cattle, such as contagious abortion, mastitis, sterility, and other diseases, have caused very severe losses to farmers.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, a great pleasure to me and to others vitally interested in live stock to find that the Government have decided to establish a proper research station and we are very sure that any money spent on such research will be well repaid.  The losses in live stock are colossal and it is time that something was done in a practical way to remedy the position.  Therefore, we welcome the statement of the Minister and I am sure the Dáil will unhesitatingly vote any money he requires for the farm he mentioned a while ago.  We are glad that the Government have decided to join the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  That should be for the betterment of all sections of the community. I think we have good reason to be optimistic about the results.  It gives us great pleasure this evening to give a cordial welcome to the statement about Ireland's joining the Food and Agricultural Organisation and I am sure that it will have the approval of every Party of this House.</P>

      <P>I join with the other <Col N="1591" /> Deputies in supporting the passage of this Estimate particularly in so far as it relates to the association of this country in the future with the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  I believe we should be associated with all these international organisations especially in present-day circumstances.  We may not gain very much, perhaps, but we shall learn a good deal in the school of experience and we shall benefit by our education later on.</P>
      <P>May I take it that by the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate we shall have in the near future a complete re-organisation of the veterinary section of the Department of Agriculture? I feel that some such re-organisation should be associated with the introduction of an Estimate of this kind and particularly with the purchase of a farm for the purposes mentioned by the Minister.  I was furnished with a list&mdash; an amazingly long list&mdash;of positions in the Civil Service where the occupants have been granted an extension of their usual period of service.  Amongst the names appearing in that very long list was that of the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Department of Agriculture. I am not personally acquainted with the gentleman but I am sure that he, like every other civil servant who was lucky enough to get an extension, has given good and faithful service to the State.</P>
      <P>In present-day circumstances, however, and with employment in the state in which it is amongst the professional classes as well as every other section of the community, it would be just as well if these people were retired within a reasonable period after reaching the maximum of the retiring age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Davin has raised a rather important point.  All I can say is that some re-organisation in regard to the veterinary service so far as research is concerned must necessarily follow.  One of the reasons why we cannot extend the personnel of our Veterinary Research Department is because we have not got accommodation. As soon as we can supply more laboratory accommodation we shall necessarily have a bigger veterinary staff for research purposes.  It will take some years, however, to erect suitable buildings on this new farm.  From this on they will be able to do better work than they have done in the past.  Two things were holding them up.  One was they had no land where they could keep animals for experiment and the other was the lack of laboratory accommodation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Halliden spoke of the severe losses in our live stock through mortality. Deputy Halliden quoted a figure of £7,000,000 per year.  It may be something less than that.  The general opinion is that it is somewhat less.  If we could make any substantial reduction in that&mdash;even to the extent of 20, 30 or 40 per cent.&mdash;the money will be very well spent on this research work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes dealt fairly extensively with the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  I do not want to give the members of the Dáil a false impression.  I do not want to be in any way pessimistic about the future of F.A.O., as it is called, but I do want to sound a note of warning because some people seem to think that great benefits will accrue to this country as a result of our going in to that organisation.  Whatever the benefits may be there are likely to be onerous obligations at the same time.  I do not wish to go any further than that.  But I think they are obligations we should willingly undertake because they will make for improvement all over the world and they will help to bring up the standard of living of those people who have a lower standard than we have ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Hughes pointed out, the objects of the Food and Agriculture <Col N="1593" /> Organisation are laudable and praiseworthy. I quite agree with that and I have no hesitation whatever in asking every member of the Dáil to agree to our becoming members of that organisation by passing this Estimate.</P>
    <P>In introducting this Estimate I said that there was a danger, purely from the economic point of view, that this organisation might increase the price of grain.  We are importers of grain. At the same time it may not deal with processed animal products and we are exporters of processed animal products. In that way we may find ourselves worse off as a result of the operations of Food and Agriculture Organisation.  My reason for saying that is because I think it is fairly certain that the Food and Agriculture Organisation will deal in the first instance with bread foods, including grain products.  It will be some time before they will deal with other products.  In fact they may find it difficult to deal with animals at any time.  The machinery for dealing with grain is comparatively simple.  It is possible to take stock of the world supply of grain.  It is possible to find out where grain is required and where there is a surplus.  Where there is a surplus of grain it is an easy matter to store it.  From every point of view grain is an easy product with which to deal and there is no doubt the Food and Agriculture Organisation will deal with grain first.  If the effect of that is to keep the price of grain up that will naturally affect us here, but we are not going to complain about it.</P>
    <P>Animal products, such as meat, bacon, butter and condensed milk, are not nearly so easy to deal with from the point of view of the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  For one thing, there will be no surplus of animal products for a long time to come and, therefore, the Food and Agriculture Organisation will not have an opportunity of dealing with it.  If there is a surplus of animal products it is not an easy matter to store meat or butter over a long period.  In so far as the Food and Agriculture Organisation succeeds &mdash;and I hope they will succeed all the way&mdash;it is more than likely that they will deal effectively with grain but not so effectively with animal products. <Col N="1594" /> That is why I said that from the narrow economic point of view the operations of Food and Agriculture Organisation may place more obligations upon us than they will confer benefits on us.  I shall leave it at that.  However, the objects of the organisation are very good and I think we should have no hesitation in voting the amount which is necessary to become members of the organisation.  I do not think any other point was raised on the Estimate.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £12,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1947, for Compensation and other payments in connection with Injuries to Property caused by the dropping of bombs from foreign aircraft and by kindred incidents while the State is not engaged in war (No. 24 of 1941).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the original Estimate for 1946-47 was being prepared&mdash;about this time last year&mdash;it was thought that, even though the war was over, some further incidents might occur in which property would be damaged by the explosion of drifting mines on the coast and so forth and, to meet any claim for compensation arising from such incidents, a provision of £250 was included in the Estimate&mdash;sub-head A. (2).  Needless to say it was not anticipated that damage on the scale <Col N="1595" /> caused by the mine explosion at Dalkey on the 12th March, 1946, would have to be reckoned with.  From 200 to 250 houses were injured to some extent or other and the indications are that the total compensation payable under the Act to make good the damage will reach about £15,000.  Some of this, however, will probably not have to be paid until after the 31st March next.  Allowing for that and for an element of saving on other items in the Estimate, a sum of £12,000 should be adequate to cover all payments on foot of Dalkey claims failing to be met within the current financial year.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Dalkey incident, 149 claims for compensation under the Act have been received to date.  Of 109 offers of compensation already made, 100 have been accepted; so far, no offer of compensation has been refused.  Eighty-three cases have been finally disposed of by payment of compensation and in six further cases where the offer of compensation was subject in part to a reinstatement condition, the unconditional portion of the compensation has been paid.  Other accepted offers are subject to conditions that the total amount of the offer shall be expended on reinstatement and payment will be made on the submission of evidence that the condition has been fulfilled.  To date, the Dalkey payments total £3,279 10s. 7d.  Claims may be made up to the 12th March, 1947&mdash;the anniversary of the date of the incident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that this Estimate is due to damage to property in Dalkey caused by a mine explosion.  I do not know whether the Minister has received any offer of compensation from any outside  ource or whether we are just to regard that incident as an act of God.  I take it that other explosions have occurred around the coast due to drifting mines. I do not know if the Minister is in a position to tell us if they resulted in further damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question which I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;I do not know whether it is appropriate on this Estimate.  It refers to losses suffered by people in this country due <Col N="1596" /> to loss of property that had been sent to foreign countries for repair.  That is now gone and the Government have also called upon these people to pay debts which were due to that country so that the people concerned have suffered the loss of their property and have had to make good to the Government accounts which were due to those foreign countries.  I think in all fairness the Minister should consider the case of people who suffered a double loss of that kind.  I am certain that people in England similarly circumstanced were not asked to suffer a double loss.  They would have had their claims against foreign countries collected in reparations or under some other heading.  I should like to ask the Minister how far he considers it just that our people should have to suffer a double loss in such circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question put by Deputy Dockrell is that this is the only incident which caused damage in this financial year for which we have got any claim to date.  In regard to the other question, as to the alleged double loss suffered by people who sent goods abroad to be repaired, who lost the goods and then had to pay certain accounts in here to the Exchequer, I have not heard of any such case.  First of all, the matter does not come under this Estimate, but I just want to say that I have not heard of any such claim.  No such claim has ever come to my attention and if the Deputy has received such a claim I shall look into it.</P>

    <P>This motion has been reached rather unexpectedly to-day and I regret that the chief sponsor of the motion, the leader of this Party, is unavoidably absent.  I did not anticipate that the motion would come before the House to-day and there are some facts which I should have liked to produce in support of it which are not available to me at the moment.  I feel, however, that the <Col N="1598" /> case for the motion is so strong that it does not require very great eloquence on my part or the production of a great volume of statistics or other material to convince the House that it ought to be passed.  It may be contended that in putting forward this demand, we, on behalf of the farmers, are making an undue demand on the rest of the rate-paying and taxpaying community.  It may even be suggested that we are endeavouring to shift the just burdens which the farmers should bear on to his neighbours.  Those who had the misfortune to read the article in the last issue of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> by Mr. P.S. O'Hegarty, would no doubt be in a frame of mind to resist a demand of this kind.  I have always admired this particular writer on economic and national questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My admiration has to a very great extent been dissipated by reading this article which he produced so recently.  There is no question whatever of farmers seeking to pass any portion of their just burdens on to any other section of the community. I think simple justice will demand and insist that, so far as direct taxation is concerned, each section of the community and each individual member of the community should contribute according to his means, and if we take the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure recently produced by the Minister for Finance, we find that the total national income of the State for 1944 was £252,000,000.  Agricultural income for the same year was £88,000,000, so that the agricultural income was 35 per cent. of the total national income.  One would assume from these figures that the rateable valuation of agriculture would, therefore, be approximately 35 per cent. of the total rateable valuation of the State, but if one were to base any calculations on that assumption, one would be gravely mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total valuation of all lands and other property in this State for the last <Col N="1599" /> year for which figures are available was £12,393,000.  The valuation of land in county health districts is approximately £7,000,000 and the value of buildings, £1,600,000.  I have been unable to unearth figures showing the valuation of agricultural buildings, but I think I should be quite safe in assuming that the valuation of agricultural buildings would be approximately £1,000,000.  The total valuation of agricultural land and buildings therefore is £8,000,000, or 66 per cent. of the total valuation of the State.</P>

      <P>I read the Report of the Commission on Derating so many years ago that I am afraid I have forgotten most of it, but I think the figures I have given are substantially correct; but even if they were not, even if there was a slight margin of error, the fact still remains&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to make as good a case as he can for the motion and I should like to point out that so far from putting the figure of £1,600,000 as the valuation of out-offices, the Commission on Derating estimated that the total value of out-offices attached to farm buildings was £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with an entirely different matter.  The figure I have given is not the figure for farm out-buildings.  It is the total valuation of farm buildings, including dwelling-houses, and I think the Minister will find if he has any sources of information available to him, that the <Col N="1600" /> total valuation of agricultural dwelling-houses and out-offices is close on £1,000,000.</P>
      <P>The point which I am making is that the valuation of land is £7,000,000, and that the valuation of agricultural buildings is approximately £1,000,000. Therefore, the total valuation of farm houses and out-offices and farms is in the region of £8,000,000 which is approximately two-thirds of the total valuation of all the property in the State.  Now, you have the position that the farmer, with an income which is little more than one-third of the total national income, bears a valuation which is two-thirds of the total valuation.  Thus you see that the whole basis on which the rates and the finances of the local authorities are founded is false and unfair to the agricultural community.  In so far as the central Government have recognised the injustice of the basis on which taxation is levied, they have sought to amend it to a certain extent by agricultural grants of various sorts.  What I resent, and what the farmers bitterly resent, are the frequent attempts which are being made to represent the agricultural grant as a gift or benefit conferred on the farmer by other sections of the community.  The real fact is that rateable valuations are fundamentally unfair to agriculture, and the State makes an inadequate attempt to remedy that injustice by means of grants.  That is my answer to any case which the Minister may make on the ground that such a proposal as this would be too generous to the farmer, and it is my answer to the case which is made by Mr. P.S. O'Hegarty.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself, in one of his lectures on local administration, expressed this view which is reported, I think, in the <i>Independent</i> of January 23rd, 1946:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have in this State a superstructure of local administration as progressive and democratic as any in the world, the foundations of which are greatly overburdened for they belong to a past age.  Unless these foundations are drastically overhauled and modernised, the day will come when local authorities, under the stress of post-war conditions, will find great difficulty in discharging <Col N="1601" /> even their present liabilities under the law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>So that the Minister is not satisfied with the foundations upon which local administration rests.  He is not satisfied, I presume, with the system of valuations which places upon the agricultural industry a valuation which is two-thirds of the national valuation, notwithstanding the fact that the income of the agricultural industry is less than one-third of the national income. Therefore, I hope that there will be no suggestion in the course of the debate on this motion that the farmer is looking for anything excessive or anything unfair from the rest of the community &mdash;from the other taxpayers or other ratepayers of the community.  He is asking for nothing more and nothing less than simple justice.</P>
    <P>Now, in addition to rectifying and equalising the burden on agriculture, as compared with other sections of the community, there are very strong and pressing reasons why farm buildings should be exempt from rates.  Farm buildings are part of the equipment which the farmer uses in production on his farm.  They are as essential to production as is the plough, the mower, the reaper, the harrow and other machinery which the farmer employs in carrying on production, and since nobody would seriously suggest that there should be an annual tax levied upon ploughs, harrows, spades, reapers and machinery of that kind, I fail to see how anyone can seriously contend that these other items of equipment should be taxed.  In the Third Minority Report of the Committee of Inquiry into post-emergency Agricultural Policy, Dr. Henry Kennedy, referring to housing on the farm, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Housing for farm animals is, as a general rule, neither adequate in scope nor suitable in design.  Any programme for more economical production, which can be effected only by increased production, will call for more and better housing and yard accommodation for farm animals.  The new views on grass husbandry, which insist on the importance of &lsquo;sparing&rsquo; the pastures in late autumn and early spring, imply greater accommodation for house or yard feeding of cattle during the winter.  Control of <Col N="1602" /> disease and more hygienic conditions for milk production, which in the future are inevitable, will make it necessary to provide new byres with appropriate water supplies on most farms.  Storage for grain, feed, potatoes, etc., will be essential. Modern practice in pig and poultry husbandry has rendered obsolete most of the farm buildings used for these purposes.</P>
    <P>Over and above mere material considerations, well-designed and adequate housing will have a profound psychological effect on farmers and farm workers.  It will render life on the land more attractive, as it will render labour more productive.</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate and suitable farm buildings will mean a vast capital expenditure.  For this reason, it is essential that all steps should be taken to ensure that the buildings may be designed with a view to the maximum degree of labour saving in the farmyard, and the minimum of cost of construction.  Investigation is needed on the design, layout and construction of farm buildings, and an advisory service to farmers is needed.  In view of the magnitude of the problem, such a service would save an enormous amount of wasted effort and wasted capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In those paragraphs, Dr. Henry Kennedy stresses the urgent need for enlarging and extending farm buildings of every kind.  That need, I think, will be appreciated by everyone.  I had intended to produce in this debate, if I was aware that it would be taken this week, figures showing the extent of farm buildings in Denmark as compared with this country.  Speaking from recollection, I believe that the amount of capital invested in farm buildings in Denmark is more than three times the amount invested in farm buildings here.</P>
    <P>That shows what an enormous field there is for expansion in this direction. It shows how necessary it is for farmers and those who plan for farmers to think along the line of extending, improving and modernising farm buildings.  Surely, if it is in the national interest that the farmer ought to increase his capital outlay on farm buildings on every kind, we ought not <Col N="1603" /> to discourage him, to dishearten him by piling heavy taxation upon those buildings.</P>
    <P>There are various grants given to assist the farmer to improve his out-buildings. There are various schemes, semi-State schemes, for the provision of loans to enable the farmer to enlarge his farm buildings.  But all those grants and loans are offset by the fact that when the farmer has erected a new byre, a new haybarn or some piece of modern agricultural architecture which is so necessary to his industry, he finds that in the course of a few years the valuation inspector will increase his valuation and he will have to pay a heavy annual sum.  We must remember in this connection there is no agricultural grant in respect of the valuation of an agricultural out-building.  The farmers must bear the full rate imposed upon them by the local authorities.  That is a very strong discouragement and, because of it, the farmers go slowly in regard to extensions and improvements of their buildings, even if they had the capital to carry out the work.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that when the Agricultural Derating Commission made its report the valuation of farm out-buildings was somewhere in the region of £300,000.  The fact that that sum is, in the Minister's opinion, low in relation to other buildings, indicates that we have not half enough farm out-buildings in this State.  I think there is no productive effort into which money could be poured with an assurance that it would repay in the long run better than the improvement of farm buildings.  Dr. Henry Kennedy mentioned that better farm buildings make for better and more efficient agriculture. That is, of course, quite apparent to anyone who has even the haziest knowledge of agriculture.</P>
    <P>We know that live stock of every kind, if not properly housed, cannot thrive.  We know that farm buildings which are too enclosed do not provide adequate ventilation.  If they are draughty or cold or wet it means an annual loss to the farmer in the matter of production.  It is not necessary to refer to the great loss suffered annually throughout the length and breadth of <Col N="1604" /> the country in our haggards&mdash;the loss of grain, hay and other feeding-stuffs owing to the fact that there are not sufficient covered buildings to protect our produce from the weather.</P>
    <P>In the poultry industry there is a vast field for improvement.  As Dr. Henry Kennedy pointed out, an improvement of farm buildings will not only make for greater efficiency in the industry and a higher output, but it will also have a psychological effect upon those engaged in agriculture.  Visualise the difference it would make to the farmer's wife if she can walk out to a piggery constructed in modern fashion and feed the pigs there without having to go into the building where they are and, perhaps, risk being knocked down by these animals.  Visualise the comfort which would be provided by covered buildings for the various foodstuffs which the farmer and his wife require on the farm and contrast that with the conditions under which they have to keep those foodstuffs at the moment.  Think of the advantage it would be to them to have these foodstuffs properly protected from the weather.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister, on some occasions, has observed a farmer's wife or daughter going to a potato-pit in cold, wintry weather to obtain sufficient potatoes to feed the live stock or for family use.  There is drudgery associated with that work now whereas, with ample housing accommodation, a supply of potatoes and other vegetables could be kept under cover.  That is one of the aspects of agricultural life that ought to receive careful consideration. If a girl has to choose between marrying a farmer and facing all this drudgery which is associated with unsatisfactory out-buildings, and marrying a business man, a professional man or a craftsman and living in the sheltered conditions of the town, she will inevitably leave the poor farmer there.</P>

      <P>All this makes for discouragement in the agricultural industry. The Minister, if he has any heart at all, will be sympathetic to this motion.  It aims at encouraging an improvement in farm buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> That is its chief objective.  It seeks to give the farmer the necessary inducement to go ahead and improve his homestead.  In addition to that, it will have the effect of removing a longstanding injustice, namely, that the farming industry bears an excessive share of the rates owing to the antiquated system of valuation under which we labour.</P>
    <P>I believe that, if Deputy Corry were in the House, he would follow the same line which he took in regard to the Bill for the relief of rates and would say that it does not matter what burden the farmer has to pay so long as he is permitted to pass it on to other sections of the community.  There are two answers to that contention.  The first is that the farmer is not permitted to pass his burden on to other sections of the community.  At present the farmer has to bear whatever direct charges are imposed upon his industry.  He cannot add the cost of production on the price of the produce and thus pass it on to other sections of the community, as the manufacturer and the businessman can do to a great extent.  The farmer must bear whatever direct tax is imposed upon him.  Even if the farmer were in a position to pass this heavy burden of rates on to the rest of the community, it would mean passing it on to the poorest section, to the food consumers. It would mean adding to the cost of food.</P>
    <P>One of the first duties of a Government should be to see that the cost of food is reduced to the lowest minimum. It was because the British Government realised so far back as 1928 that the cost of producing food in the home country should be reduced to the lowest possible minimum that they decided completely to derate both agricultural land and buildings.  The Minister, when he talks about the antiquated system of valuation, the antiquated system of local administration and the antiquated foundation on which it is built, should take a lesson from a country which is not by any means very progressive, but which is at least 16 years in front of this country in the matter of rates on agricultural land and buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan told us a lot about the benefits that would accrue from providing better out-houses for farmers, mainly the houses where live stock are kept.  He did not tell us why farmers wanted better housing for live stock.  He did not say whether it was from love and affection towards these animals or whether it was because the farmers might make more money out of them if they had better houses in which to put them.  Farming is a business.  I cannot say whether or not it is a good business, because I never had anything to do with farming. But there are facts which can be learned from the outside which would suggest that farming must be a profitable business.  I have never heard of a farmer asking someone to take over his farm from him or putting in an advertisement saying that he could not make a profit out of his farm, and asking some kind friend to come and take it from him so that he would not be burdened with it any more.  On the contrary, we have the undoubted fact that the price of farms is almost doubled.  If you wanted to buy a farm now you would have to pay twice as much for it as you would have paid before the war.  That is altogether inconsistent with the story that there is too much taxation levied on farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan did not say who was to bear the burden of these rates. Would he put it on the workmen in the towns and villages or would he ask it to be taken from general taxation? Only this year the Government has provided the huge sum of £1,000,000 for the relief of agricultural land. During the year there has been an increase of 3/- in the £ in the rates in the City of Dublin.  The Government displayed great anxiety to make these financial concessions to the farmer. The people of the city are beginning to think that the Government have gone too far in that direction.  There is an ever-growing anxiety in the minds of the people of Dublin at the continued high cost of living, and it is noted with concern that the inflated prices apply to the same degree to our home-produced food as to the food we import from abroad.  One could understand an increase in the price of commodities, <Col N="1607" /> such as tea, which have to be brought from abroad; but people cannot understand why there has been such a great increase in the price of meat, milk, vegetables, turf, and other products which are produced by our own farmers, and that at a time when the expenses which the farmers have to bear have not increased to the same extent.</P>
    <P>The people of the city are complaining that the Government are going too far in their efforts to placate the farmers and that the time has come when the plight of the city workers should be considered; that the plight of a man who is trying to rear a family in the City of Dublin, to give them decent food and to keep a decent home over their heads, is very bad, and that there does not seem to be any sign of improvement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan made one statement with which I am in agreement, namely, that the Government should see that the cost of producing food is reduced to the lowest minimum.  Instead of that, the Government, in order to satisfy the farmers, have been fixing prices for their produce and that has inflated the prices which the people have to pay for food.  Visitors from England during the last year have remarked to me how surprised they were at the price of food here, particularly meat, milk and butter.  The Government have maintained these prices so as to allow the farmers to make a decent income.  Instead of appreciating that, the smaller section of farmers represented by Deputies proposing this motion are asking for relief from taxation.  As soon as one concession is gained, they come and ask for another.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that he has gone quite far enough in that direction and that it is time the people of the city got a little more consideration. It is time that an effort should be made to bring about a considerable reduction in the price of essential foods.  It is time that some effort was made to stabilise the rates in the cities.  Reference has been made to rates on agricultural land being a tax on raw material.  The rates which a city dweller pays are a tax on his home. <Col N="1608" /> Whatever kind of a structure it may be, whether a cellar, a garret, or a luxury flat, it is part of a building which he uses to protect himself and his family from the weather.</P>
    <P>Surely the tax on a home should be reduced to the lowest possible minimum, but the Deputies proposing this motion are more concerned with the taxes and rates on the homes of the live stock than they are with the taxes on the homes of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan stated that 35 per cent. of the total income comes from agriculture.  He did not deal with the portion of the total taxation which is borne by agriculture.  He did not mention the subject of income-tax.  Many people who have to pay the heavy income-tax consider that a better effort should be made by the Government to collect income-tax from farmers, that they should be induced to keep proper accounts and that proper assessments should be made upon them.  It is a well-known fact that farmers do not pay income-tax.  Even on their deposits in the bank they seem to get away with it.  People in cities cannot do that.</P>
    <P>There is nobody has so much respect for the farmers as I have.  I believe that they are manly, decent, forthright men, the backbone of the nation, but I prefer to think of them as men who are willing to meet their obligations and who would not support the miserable whining and wailing we hear here on their behalf and these efforts to free them from the rates and taxes of which they should bear their just share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Cogan has made a good case for the motion. I support the motion.  I am surprised at the references that have been made by Deputy O'Connor in regard to the demands made by the farming community. Deputy O'Connor said that he never heard of any farmer asking his neighbour or anybody else to take over. That may be so.  Every man who has been reared in a particular walk of life will cling to it.  Very few business people, shopkeepers or others have called on their next-door neighbours to take over their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor said that the price of land has increased considerably.  I <Col N="1609" /> say that the price of business houses has gone up considerably, in the country as well as in the City of Dublin. The costs of running the farmers' business have also increased very considerably. The cost of labour has increased. It has not increased to the extent to put the labourer in a position to meet the cost of living but it has gone beyond the capacity of the farmer to pay.  If the Government accept this motion and thereby help to reduce the overheads on the farmer's home, they will help to increase production.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that in a very short time we will reach the position when there will be very little farm produce for consumption by our people.  I wonder does Deputy O'Connor, or any other city Deputy or even the Minister for Agriculture know the problem that confronts the farmer and the people in connection with the production of milk? Some time ago I stated, and I maintain that, instead of having butter available for the people, in a couple of years' time there will not be milk for the people to use in their tea because of the fact that milk is supplied at a price much below the cost of production. Deputies from all sides of the House are asking for a commission to inquire into the costs of production for the farmer and to see that he gets a profit.  The farmers seem to be the victim in all cases.  Even during the summer, his costs increased 100 per cent. because of the fact that many of his employees had to be paid during the wet period in order to ensure that their labour would be available when the weather was fine.  The farmers realised that everything possible should be done to save the grain for the nation.</P>
    <P>If this motion is accepted, it will give the farmers encouragement to re-build and to improve their holdings.  At present, when buildings are erected, after a very short period they are subject to further costs.  That makes the farmer very chary about carrying out any improvement in his buildings.  For the last ten years there has been from all parts of the country a flight from the land.  That is because the conditions on the farm and in the farmyard are such that the young people do not want to stay there.  There would not be such a flight from the land if the farms and <Col N="1610" /> farmyards were well laid out with proper protection for stock and for the workers.  Every effort should be made to provide the reliefs asked for by this motion.  I hope the Minister in his judgment will see fit to carry this motion into effect and to ensure that the costs on buildings on agricultural holdings are reduced to the very minimum and thus help to increase and to improve production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a motion like this is best approached with a business-like attitude of mind.  It is a serious question, relating to the economic life of the community, and it is not a subject that should be used for any purpose other than to try to find the best solution from the economic viewpoint.  What I mean by that is that it should be approached as part of the problem which concerns us vitally in this House of the general economy of the country: how this country is going to live from day to day, in the same way as how a man is going to live from day to day given certain circumstances of living, income, and so forth.  I think the best way of approaching a motion like this in the way I have indicated is to look at it from the point of view that a Government who will be responsible for taking action in regard to any such matter would approach it.  Just how would you expect a responsible government to face up to a matter like this?  As I conceive it, this is not the only way it would come before them but let us suppose that there have been certain suggestions thrown out by people that the question of rates on agricultural out-offices should be considered, that representations are made to some Minister who is interested in the matter. The first thing he will do is to have the problem examined in order to find out what will be involved.  Ultimately it will have to be considered by the Cabinet and the reason why the Cabinet will have to consider it is because it is a question of balancing. When it reaches that point then it becomes a question for the Minister for Finance and his Department.  It is a very good thing, therefore, at the very outset to look at this from the point of view from which a financial expert <Col N="1611" /> would look at it.  He will look at it from the point of view that there are certain services which must be maintained and which must be catered for in this State.  Money must be found for these.  Some of them are vitally essential and the money involved in them cannot be varied.  Other items may be susceptible to a certain amount of variation.  The first step, then, is to tabulate these things in order to find out where you are.  The next is to find out what your income is and the source from which you can obtain this money, and strike a balance between the two. After that, you will take your particular problem and see if you can fit it in.  You will find, however, that your income is limited because certain essential services take priority and must be accounted for.  You can only supply money, therefore, for the proposed new service at the expense of either increasing your revenue by taxation or decreasing some other service.</P>
      <P>In the case of a motion like this the practical problem is that if you derate land and out-offices you are going to take away a certain amount of money hitherto available for financing other schemes in the State and that sum must be made good somewhere else.  The net result is that if you derate agricultural land and out-offices you sacrifice a certain sum.  In doing so, a certain amount of money is lost or, if you like to put it in a more positive way, you make a present of a certain amount of money to those farmers who own out-offices.  In relieving the farmers of a burden, all the other circumstances remaining unchanged, you are giving them a present of so many hundreds of thousands of pounds. I am not quite clear what the actual figure is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question immediately arises then from where is that present to come. That is the question which the Minister for Finance must ask himself and that is the question to which he must find an answer.  That sum of money must be taken from some other section of the community, otherwise the farmer himself will have to pay it and the farmer Deputies should remember that when they support this motion.  You are going to make a present to a certain <Col N="1612" /> section of the community.  One of two things will happen.  Some other section of the community will have to pay for that or the recipients themselves will have to pay for it.  If other sections of the community have to pay for it, then we must consider the fairness of it.  If the farmer has to pay for it then we must consider the futility of it.  I do not see any benefit to the farmer if his out-offices are derated and that sum has then to be made good either through rates on the remainder of his holding or by direct or indirect taxation.  There can be no benefit whatever to the farmer in that.  In effect, there is a disadvantage, because if special schemes or special provisions are introduced for the derating of out-offices, then administrative machinery will have to be set up and more administrative expense will be involved. The additional administrative expenses will have to be borne by the farmer, together with other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that you are not going to pass the burden on to another section of the community, the farmer must pay for it himself and the additional administrative expense involved will leave him worse off than he is at present.  We should be very clear on that point.  It is an easy and tempting thing to adopt a slogan without considering its full implications.  Some farmer may make a specialised case to his local T.D. in regard to his rates but he forgets that there are other demands made upon him for the support of the State.  The particular person who takes up that case forgets it too and forgets that an equitable solution may involve that farmer not in any relief but in the payment of something more than he is paying already.</P>
    <P>My view is that, as long as we have rates, the simplest and most straightforward scheme one can adopt is the best one because such a scheme will not involve extra administration, will cause less confusion and will probably work out more equitably.  I see no particular benefit to the farmer in this motion unless you are going to pay for this relief either through the Central Fund or in some other fashion.  What does that alternative mean?  It means, <Col N="1613" /> in effect, that the farmer and the rest of the community will have to pay for this new relief.  It is questionable whether that is a fair burden to place upon the rest of the community.  It is more questionable still if you endeavour to ensure that the relief is a clear relief to the farmer.  That is to say, if you take steps to ensure that the farmer gets that relief and, at the same time, does not have to pay for it in some other way.  That is the most unfair position of all because the net result is that the cost of that relief will have to be borne by some other section of the community.  I think these arguments are unanswerable.  Is it fair in present circumstances to pass other burdens on to any other portion of the community?  What do we mean by &ldquo;other portions of the community&rdquo;?  Broadly speaking, it would mean people in the towns and cities.  It would mean industry, and up to the present moment, up to this year's Budget, I think that no one can say that industry has not been sufficiently taxed.  Let anybody look at the balance sheet of any company in this city and see the sums paid into the Exchequer as taxation, and I think he will allow that industry has carried its fair share of taxation.</P>
    <P>Coming to the people in the towns whom Deputy O'Connor mentioned, are they in such a favourable position that they can afford to carry any further burden for the benefit of any other portion of the community?  If any of the farmer Deputies here are interested in the matter, as a Dublin Deputy I should like them to come and just see what the conditions in the city are in that regard.  I should like them in particular to consider and to visit people living in the city who have jobs in the city, particularly, say, the skilled tradesman, the clerk in an office, the journalist, the civil servant and all those relatively lowly-paid workers in our cities and towns and just see can they afford to bear a heavier proportion of the general burden of the community.  I, for one, having seen the conditions am perfectly satisfied that they can not. They, as Deputy O'Connor has pointed out, pay their full quota in income-tax. <Col N="1614" /> The very accounting systems to which they are subjected make sure that there is no evasion and very little relief for them.  The payment of rates weighs just as heavily on them as it does on the farmer.</P>
    <P>To say the least of it, the rates in Dublin do not compare unduly favourably with the rates in any other part of the country, particularly the agricultural part of the country.  Under the Rent Act passed in this House within the past year, every tenant of a house in Dublin, every such worker, is paying a rent for his house&mdash;very often it is not a house; very often it is just a flat&mdash;and is paying rates which are calculated in his rent, in addition to taxes.  So on the question of actual payments in rates and taxation the city man and the town dweller are in no more favourable conditions than the farmer.  If any case is to be made for relief I do not think that the farmer has any greater claim than those workers, tradesmen and other people, particularly white collar workers on the lower scale in the cities.  If there is any relief going I repeat that they have at least an equal claim with the farmer.</P>
    <P>In addition to that let us remember this&mdash;getting back to one fundamental point which perhaps our country Deputies cannot quite appreciate&mdash;in the country, no matter what the price of food is, in the main the farmer and other members of the agricultural community will always manage to get a sufficiency of the foodstuffs necessary for life.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that they get luxuries or anything of that kind; I am not even suggesting that they have a prolific meat supply, but they will be able to get potatoes, milk and eggs and at least they will be able to maintain a healthy bodily state without undue cost.  In the city, on the other hand, the workers to whom I have referred and the poor, in spite of the State aid which they have been given, have to bear the full increase in price of foodstuffs. I think I am putting it mildly when I say it is not so easy to maintain a standard of nourishment for these city dwellers as it is for country dwellers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" /> We approached this motion on all sides&mdash;at least those Parties present in the House&mdash;in, I take it, a contemplative fashion, to quote a certain opera. I am not making these statements just to uphold one end or to belabour the farmers because I happen to represent a city constituency.  I am trying to look at it from the point of view of a Deputy in this House who has, after all, a responsibility to the community as a whole&mdash;to look at it from the point of view of the community as a whole. The reason I make this point is that I think there is no further case for specific relief for the farming community as long as conditions in the towns and cities remain as they are.  In other words, in opposing this motion I do so on the grounds, firstly, that it means more money, that that money has to be found, and that I do not think it can be found.  At any rate, it cannot be found without either taking it from the farmer in another form or penalising somebody else.  I am opposing it on the grounds that even if we could afford such further relief at the moment, I would be against relieving the farmers now in priority to any relief that we could give to the ordinary hard-working, wage-earning tradesmen, the clerk, the journalist, the lower paid civil servant, the teacher or any of these classes I have mentioned in the cities and towns.  After all they are entitled to consideration and they are not just there to be drained financially for the benefit of anybody else.  These are the reasons why I cannot support this motion at the moment.</P>
    <P>The question of course arises, and it was more or less suggested by the mover of the motion, whether there would be any <i>quid pro quo</i> for this relief to the farmer.  Deputy Cogan, in moving the motion, made the insinuation, rather than the actual statement I think, that if rates went down and living were made easier for the farmer, the price of food would go down.</P>
    <P>I look at the matter from two points of view.  From the point of view of the townsman, I should say: &ldquo;Very well, if the price of food is to go down <Col N="1616" /> more than I shall pay for this relief then, by all means, give the farmers the relief,&rdquo; but I should want to be assured that the price of food would go down.  But, on the other hand, I put this to the farmer Deputies: how would the farmers like if they were told that their out-houses would be derated but that their prices would be cut?  They cannot have it both ways.  I ask the mover of the motion, following the insinuation that he made&mdash;if it was not made, I shall completely accept his word&mdash;are the farmers willing to cut their prices and to give their grain at a lower price, so that the price of bread will go down in the cities?  If I were a farmer, I wonder what answer I should give to that question.  From the point of view of the unfortunate town dweller, it would be a godsend if prices were to go down.</P>

      <P>I simply pose that question.  If you do that, what use is the relief to the farmer?  A motion like this is utterly futile unless you can arrive at a solution by which you give a clear present to the farmer of that £300,000.  If you do not do that, it means nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>I did not move the motion; neither am I the Minister in charge.  Therefore, it is not competent for me either to withdraw the motion or to do anything else in relation to it. If the benefit is not clearly given to the farmer, what use is the motion?  If the benefit is given to the farmer, who is going to pay for it?  I am suggesting that, if it is given to him, the unfortunate classes I have mentioned will pay for it.  My constituency happens to be mostly populated by that type but I am trying to look at the matter from the national point of view and from the point of view of the general benefit of the community and I think that it would be wrong to adopt the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it would also be wrong from the farmers' point of view because, when you go beyond a certain stage with one section, you will reduce their purchasing power and the farmer will eventually pay for their poverty. <Col N="1618" /> I should not like to suggest that this is a type of motion that appeals to an opposition party&mdash;something that will afford benefit to some classes without the movers having the responsibility for putting its provisions into effect.  I do not want to make any suggestions like that but I suggest that, when such motions are brought before the House, the movers should do something more than urge that relief be given.  It is up to them to give an indication of a feasible line which could be adopted.  I should like, for instance, to hear the mover of this motion, or a member of the Party responsible for it, make a suggestion as to how the result aimed at could be achieved and how the matter could be financed without involving the other sections of the community in expense.  If they could do that, I think that the suggestion would be welcomed and the motion would be accepted.  As I see the matter, the difficulty of the Government in the case of such a motion would be in implementing it or giving it proper effect at all.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, perhaps it would be well to look at what has been done in regard to financial allotments this year.  The Deputy will remember that, in the Budget of this year, the Minister for Finance found himself able to give certain substantial reliefs.  Amongst the outstanding reliefs he gave was a reduction in the price of turf to city dwellers.  On the other hand, he gave a relief in rates on agricultural land to the farmers.  It is of interest to look at the sums involved.  In apportioning his reliefs, he gave £250,000 towards reduction of the price of turf in urban areas and he gave £1,000,000&mdash;four times as much&mdash;to the farmer by way of relief in rates.</P>
    <P>In view of all the care and regard shown by this House for the farming community, it is clear that if there is one thing on which we are on all fours, it is an appreciation of the importance of the farmer to the communal life of the country.  If there is one subject on which this House is united, it is the conviction that agriculture is the basis of our economic life.  We are all agreed on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the fact has been realised by everybody. It has been borne out by the emphasis laid by all Parties in the House since its inception on agricultural matters.  I have pointed out the latest provision whereby four times the sum of money was allotted for the relief of the farmer as was allotted for the relief of town dwellers.  I have not dealt with taxation and rates borne equally by the farmer and town dweller because they are borne equally, and there is no reason why these things should not be borne equally because, as I have said, the stage has long ago been reached in which the town dweller has been reduced to a position in which he is no more advantageously placed than the member of the farming community. Therefore, I feel that, as a matter of reason and practical approach to such a problem as this, the motion should not be accepted.  If, on the other hand, a practical plan could be shown by which that money could be secured without the drawbacks I have mentioned, it would be another story, but no such plan has been put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to go a little further and to point out that there is a certain danger in approaching subjects like these in this way.  Suppose, next week, a group of people living in certain types of houses in towns want relief and you grant such relief as this.  There would then be no case for not granting relief to other <Col N="1620" /> groups.  Other groups will then apply, and, before we know where we are, we will find ourselves up against the problem of financing the State from the air, because the money on which the State runs comes from the people. It is the people who have to pay for the ordinary running expenses of the State for the year.  We may borrow for capital purposes and arrange for repayments&mdash;that is very proper&mdash;but for the ordinary year to year running of the State, with the incidental expenses and expenditures involved, including our much expanded social services, subsidies and so forth, an effort must be made to live within the national income.  The money you spend in these ways will have to be collected from the people in another way and the only way that money can be collected is through rates and taxes, whether a direct tax like income-tax or an indirect tax like the tax on spirits, or something of the kind.  I reiterate that the time has come for us to be very careful about preserving the balance in fairness to all sections of the community and whereas this motion aims only at benefiting the agricultural community&mdash;and I have no objection to that, as I should like to see the farmers benefiting&mdash;when it comes to payment, it will be collected from other sections if it is not collected from the farmer himself.</P>

      <P>To my mind, this motion is rather difficult to follow and it is difficult to see how it is to be put into practice.  It is rather interesting to note the anxiety of all the different sections in the House in relation to the proposal contained in it&mdash;a proposal <Col N="1621" /> for the derating of a section of the properties held by the farming community and the reaction of the city Deputies to it.  I have said that it is rather difficult to follow the implications of this motion and how it is to be put into practice, and why, for instance, the mover of the motion confines his proposal of rates exemption to out-buildings.  I can see as much justification for including all buildings, dwelling-houses and all other buildings, on an agricultural holding.  I can quite appreciate the point of view of those Deputies who officially represent the farming industry, but why should there be a preference in favour of out-buildings for the housing of cattle and so on as against buildings for the housing of individuals, such as farm labourers, small farmers and so on?  I consider that the dwelling-houses of those engaged in agriculture should exert as strong a claim on the community for relief of rates as those buildings for the housing of cattle and the storage of agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> I am quite prepared to accept the argument used in recommending this motion&mdash;that it would make for better production and would ultimately mean a probable reduction in the price of goods produced on the farm.  There is no doubt about that.  I believe that a very substantial effort should be made by the people, and subsidised by the Government, to improve housing conditions on farms in respect of the storage of grain and the feeding of cattle and other live stock, but, again, I think this argument could be extended to include not merely buildings on agricultural holdings but all buildings utilised for the production of farm products of any description, whether glasshouses, piggeries or poultry-houses, in the vicinity of cities, in the towns and elsewhere.</P>

    <P>It may be added, for the Deputy's information, that, during the period covered by the question, 161 applications for revision of turbary valuations were dealt with by the Valuation Office.  As indicated in the table, valuations were increased in 16 cases; in 31 cases there was no change and in the remaining 114 cases the valuation was reduced.  The revisions resulted in a net reduction in valuation of approximately £700.</P>
