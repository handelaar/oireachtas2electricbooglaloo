      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is prepared to consider the introduction of proposals for legislation with a view to enabling a workman entitled to a bonus payment under Emergency Powers (No. 260) Order to take civil proceedings for the recovery of the amount of bonus so awarded in any case where the employer refuses or fails to pay such sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that along the extensive seaboard of south-west Cork there is no wood fuel available, and the turf available, which has to be brought from distant bog areas, is of poor quality and difficult to purchase; and whether, having regard to these circumstances, he will endeavour to make an allocation of kerosene available for cooking purposes to farmers, cottiers and others who posses cooking stoves, in this isolated area stretching from the Old Head of Kinsale to Dursey Head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the fuel requirements of the area mentioned by the Deputy cannot be met in full from local sources.  Supply difficulties arise in the South West Cork area from time to time but I have received no representations recently in regard to either the quality or quantity of turf available there.  Any merchants <Col N="2012" /> who are unable to secure their requirements should advise my Department of their difficulties and steps will be taken at once in the matter.  Kerosene supplies are so limited that it is not possible to grant special allowances for cooking purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can now give an assurance to farmers that the price of the new season's wool will be not less favourable to producers than last year's price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could give an assurance when the price of wool was going up.  He controlled the price then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state why, since he fixed a maximum price when the price of wool was rising, he declines to fix a minimum price now that the price of wool is declining?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the circumstances justify the fixation of a minimum price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that agricultural prices are to be allowed to decline to whatever extent external circumstances may demand, regardless of the cost of production?  Is the cost of production not to be taken into consideration at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to all the Deputy's supplementary questions is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister should give some explanation as to why he refuses to interfere now.  Two years ago, he interfered for the first time and fixed a maximum price.  Now, he comes along and refuses to fix a minimum price when the price of wool is going down.  Surely he will give some reason why he withdrew the control. He said that it was for the sake of the producer he introduced the control. Why does he withdraw it now?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Export of Hides and Skins.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the existence and nature of any special conditions affecting the import into Great Britain, during the years 1940 to 1945, of cattle hides, calf skins and sheep skins; and if he will state what were the conditions affecting exports of such hides and skins from Éire, in the years stated, to Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The imports of hides and skins into Great Britain were controlled for some years prior to 1945 and during that year.  So far as my information goes, the only special condition attached to the grant of import licences was one which required some exporters from this country to despatch their cattle hides and calf skins to members of a Hide Improvement Society in Great Britain.  In the case of sheep skins, it was a condition that all skins exported from this country should be pickled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The export of cattle hides and calf skins from this country has, since 1940, been prohibited by Emergency Powers (Control of Export) Order, 1940, save in accordance with licences issued under that Order.  Licences under that Order are granted for the export of limited quantities of hides to Great <Col N="2014" /> Britain in return for which the Irish tanneries receive supplies of foreign hides and tanning materials.</P>
    <P>As regards the conditions affecting the export of sheep skins, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given in Dáil Éireann on 30th January, 1946.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of persons to whom licences for the export of cattle and calf skins, granted under the Emergency Powers (Control of Export) Order, 1940, were issued, in each of the years 1940 to 1945, inclusive; the number of persons to whom such licences were refused; the number of persons to whom registration was granted under the Emergency Powers (Hides) Order, 1944, in the years 1944 and 1945; and the numbers or physical quantities of hides and skins exported, the value of such hides and skins exported in each of the years 1940 to 1945, inclusive, and the country of destination declared for export purposes from this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is in the form of a statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.  The statement is as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he proposes to increase at an early date the allowance of petrol to motorists; and if he is aware that the present allowance is not regarded as sufficient to warrant the registration and insurance of many motor vehicles at present lying idle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the supply position in connection with petrol primarily due to world scarcity of that commodity or to scarcity of hard currencies here wherewith to pay for supplies which are available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The question arises out of the question put by Deputy Byrne. He asked the Minister if he proposed to increase the allowance of petrol at an early date.  Doubtless, the Minister considered that question and made up his mind that he could not do what Deputy Byrne asked.  He must have had some reason for that decision but he just will not tell us the reason.  He is a charming, gentlemanly creature and his manners grow better every day.</P>

Lyons, 29 Larkfield Park, Dublin (National Health Insurance No. 143040), who has been ill and under the care of a doctor since 22nd January last, has not been paid any insurance benefit notwithstanding the fact that medical certificates have been furnished by him to the National Health Society; and whether, in the circumstances, he will take steps to have benefit paid to Mr. Lyons immediately, and, also, if he will state the cause of the delay.</P>

      <P>The National Health Insurance Society received no claim for benefit from Mr. Lyons until the 13th March, 1946, when a medical certificate covering the period from the 22nd January, 1946, was submitted.  On the 15th March, he was notified by the society that, owing to his failure to notify the illness within the statutory period of seven days from its commencement, no benefit could be paid for the period previous to the date of <Col N="2018" /> notice, in the absence of satisfactory evidence that he was not reasonably able to give notice earlier.  It was not until the 28th March that the member explained that his failure duly to give notice was due to ignorance of the regulations.  Although it was not convincing, the society accepted the explanation and, in view of the period involved and the fact that only one medical certificate had been furnished, requested the member on the 1st April to secure a note from his employer indicating the period of incapacity.  The note certified incapacity up to the 10th April and sickness benefit to the amount of £8 covering the period to that date was then paid by the society.  Payment in respect of the period from the 10th April to the 23rd April, when Mr. Lyons was certified fit to resume work, has since been made.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the delay in payment of benefit in this case rests entirely on the member himself.</P>

The necessary amendment of the Reciprocal Arrangements, which <Col N="2019" /> will have effect from the 1st January, 1943, has recently been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if it is his intention to implement forthwith the recommendations in the interim report on the cattle and dairying industries issued in August, 1943, by the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy, and, in particular, the recommendations suggesting (i) that <Col N="2024" /> supervisors of cow-testing associations should be paid a minimum standing salary; (ii) the discontinuing of the payment of fees by farmers, and (iii) an alternative proposal for financing the cost of the cow-testing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the recommendations in the report referred to have already been implemented.  The recommendations in regard to cow testing have been accepted.  The implementation of these would, however, involve an increased demand for cow-testing facilities in new areas, and such expansion is not at present practicable owing to emergency shortage of equipment necessary for associations. The scheme will be reorganised on the basis recommended in the interim report as soon as such action becomes possible.  In the meantime a temporary increase of pay to supervisors of the existing cow-testing associations has been in operation since January, 1945.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 18, 19, 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made that there are large quantities of seed potatoes, particularly in West Offaly, for which there is no market.  I am informed that the total quantity of seed potatoes which are surplus to home requirements is relatively small. Throughout the season there was an export market available, capable of absorbing all surplus seed potatoes of the prescribed standard.  Export licences were issued for 12,280 tons but actual exports fell short of this amount by 3,828 tons.  There is a limited quantity of surplus ware potatoes in the country and arrangements are being made for their disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it likely that they will be relieved so far as ware potatoes <Col N="2026" /> are concerned but there is no further sale for seed potatoes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the 600 tons of potatoes in West Offaly are to be permitted to rot in the pits, despite the fact that there is a good market abroad for such potatoes? Will the Minister consider granting permits to have these potatoes exported rather than allow them rot in the pits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the merchants in this area who have secured 600 tons of potatoes apply for export licences, will the Minister see that such export licences will be granted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Title>Tourist Traffic (Amendment) Bill, 1946, Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The House, I think, is aware that the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, which established the Irish Tourist Board provided for the making of a total advance from the Exchequer to the Tourist Board to a limit of £600,000.  That Act conferred certain powers on the board, and gave it certain duties and functions to perform. The duties of the board, as set out, included the establishment, equipment and operation of hotels, guest houses, hostels and camps; the giving of financial assistance in the provision of services and facilities calculated to improve holiday traffic in the country; the undertaking of publicity, including guide books and similar publications, in connection with the development of holiday traffic; the provision of schemes for training persons in hotel work and other special services, as well as the maintenance of registers of hotels and guest houses, and the laying down of standards for admission to these registers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the war the activities of the board were curtailed.  The House will remember that the Act was passed in 1939, and did not, in fact, come into effective operation until after the war had started.  The Government then decided to direct the board to curtail its activities, because of the circumstances created by the war.  During the earlier war years the board was, in fact, confined to the preparation of plans of one kind or another, plans for the organisation of its work, as well as plans for the development of holiday resorts, and it kept to that work of planning until 1944, when the Government was of opinion that the end of the war was in sight, and directed the board to extend the scope of its activities.  During these planning years the board prepared schemes for <Col N="2037" /> the development of a number of holiday resorts, and for the development of holiday business generally.  These schemes were subsequently submitted to me by the board for approval. Although some action has been taken upon the approved schemes, it has not yet been found possible by the board to complete its plans, owing to the abnormal supply position still existing.</P>
    <P>In 1944, part of the Act dealing with the registration of hotels was brought into force, and during that year and 1945, the board was engaged in the establishment of the hotel registers, and the inspection of hotels and guest houses, with a view to their admission to them.  These matters, to which I am now referring, were dealt with in the White Paper circulated to Deputies.  I assume that Deputies have read the White Paper, and that it is not necessary to repeat, in introducing this Bill, matters which are contained therein.  The White Paper gave not merely the general historical background to which I have referred, but referred also to various resort development schemes which the board prepared and which have been sanctioned. The primary purpose of this short Bill is to raise the limit fixed in the original Act of the amount of advances which can be made to the Tourist Board.  As it happened, the schemes already sanctioned will, it is estimated, cost slightly more than the £600,000 provided under the original Act.  It is considered desirable, therefore, at this stage, that the Dáil should be so informed and asked to raise that limit.  That step might have been delayed.</P>
    <P>Although schemes which will, ultimately, cost more than £600,000 have been sanctioned, the total amount advanced to the board is only £122,000. This Bill proposes that the limit to advances to the board under the Act of 1939 should be raised to £1,250,000. The purpose of the amendment is to enable schemes which have been already approved to be completed, and further schemes undertaken.  The House, I think, is aware that there is no element of subsidy in respect to that part of the board's work.  Before <Col N="2038" /> an advance can be made for resort development work, it is necessary for the board to certify that a scheme submitted by it and approved is of a profit-earning character.  I know that there has been a suggestion that the board had avoided to an undue and unreasonable extent publicity in connection with these resort development schemes. I am sure, however, that the House will appreciate the difficulties of the board in giving any detailed publicity to its plans, because of the nature of the work on which it is engaged.  The avoidance of publicity was due to the fact that, in the main, the resort development schemes of the board involved the acquisition of property.</P>
    <P>It is true that the board were given, under the Act of 1939, certain powers of compulsory acquisition, but these powers were of a cumbersome kind, and ordinarily the board would desire to purchase property by negotiation rather than resort to compulsory powers.  On that account it has been anxious to avoid publication of details of its plans, so as not to shove up the cost of property which it would acquire against itself and to facilitate the voluntary acquisition of such property at a reasonable price.  The profit-earning character of these schemes very largely depends on the enhancement of the value of the property acquired by the board as a result of the development work done by the board and clearly the ability of the board to bring any of these schemes to a profit-earning stage would be impaired if it had to pay unduly inflated prices for the property acquired by it before the development work was undertaken.</P>
    <P>I will deal later with the details of the various schemes which have been approved and give the Dáil the available information concerning them; but before getting on to those matters of detail I am anxious to express certain views upon the general work of the board and the policy by which that work is directed.  In discussing the merits of the plans of the Tourist Board for the development of the holiday business, or the particular schemes which it has devised for the improvement of holiday resort facilities, it is <Col N="2039" /> necessary to keep in mind the main purposes of the board's work.  The primary aim of the board is to develop and improve the natural amenities in this country available to the Irish people, so that Irish people may have full opportunity of satisfactory and enjoyable holidays in this country. The board has also the purpose of developing the potentialities of the business of selling holiday facilities to persons coming from other countries.</P>
    <P>On occasions during the past year or so, on reading comments in the Press on the work of the Tourist Board, I have felt that it was a mistake to have given it that name in the first instance. People have come to interpret the name of the board as implying that its main, if not the sole, attention was to the work of selling holiday facilities to persons coming from other countries. That is neither the sole purpose of the board nor its primary purpose.  I have said that its primary purpose is to develop the holiday facilities available in this country for the enjoyment of our people.  That I would regard, and always did regard, as the more important aspect of the board's work.  The board is engaged in a business undertaking. I have sometimes felt that the nature of the work upon which it is engaged and proposes to engage in future has been misunderstood.  It is necessary to emphasise in the clearest possible way that the main purpose for which the board was set up is to organise on a better basis in this country a business which has become one of major economic importance in every country.  The economic importance of the holiday business has grown with the improvement of travel facilities and with the alterations in general social conditions and in conditions affecting the employment of workers.  In all countries in the world it is becoming an enterprise of major economic significance.</P>
    <P>There are some people who have got a superiority complex about this business of providing holiday facilities. They regard it as a type of occupation which is unsuitable, as one which involves menial work.  That is a completely false conception of the business. <Col N="2040" /> Not merely is it one of major economic importance, but it provides the possibility of remunerative and suitable employment for a very large number of persons.  I certainly do not agree that there is any personal humiliation to be experienced in the sale of holiday facilities which would not apply in the sale of other commodities.  Apart altogether, then, from the possibility of attracting business from outside the country, and assuming the sole effect of the board's business is to improve the holiday facilities available here, it is one which should be undertaken and one which, because of its nature, requires some central directing organisation if it is to be done properly.</P>
    <P>The development of hotel facilities, restaurant facilities and, to some extent, recreation facilities, might be left to private individual enterprise.  It is through private enterprise that the facilities now available were first provided. The development of holiday resorts might, perhaps, be left to the local authorities of the areas in which they are located; but I think it will be agreed that, without some central planning and directing authority, the efforts of private enterprise and of local authorities would not be co-ordinated, nor would the best results be secured. It is for that reason that the Government decided that the Irish Tourist Board should be established, with certain powers and resources to enable it to do its work.  I do not want any misunderstanding to be created by my remarks as to the importance of the business of selling holiday facilities to persons from abroad.  That is an export business which has become of major importance in many countries and which may become one of great importance to this country.  The business of selling holiday facilities to citizens of other countries has immense potentialities for us and has potentialities now, because of circumstances existing elsewhere, greater than ever it had before, provided we are in a position to use them.  We can add substantially to the national wealth, and particularly to the balancing of our international trade, by the development of the business; and although it may not be possible to do so in the immediate future to the <Col N="2041" /> extent that might ultimately be possible, we should not leave out of our minds the economic importance of the business in the future of the country.</P>
    <P>I said that the extent to which the business of selling holiday facilities to persons from other countries can be developed in the immediate future is limited.  It is limited by reason of the inadequacy of our existing hotel accommodation and the curtailment of travelling facilities in present circumstances. I know, from articles which have appeared in the newspapers, that some people feel there is objection to the attraction of tourists to this country in the present year, because of the continuing scarcity of some commodities. I would like to make it clear that the Tourist Board is not taking any positive steps to attract business from outside this year.  At a recent meeting, under the auspices of the Tourist Association, I expressed the view that it would be bad for the ultimate development of the tourist business here if an unduly large number of visitors were to come now, before plans for the development of resorts and hotel accommodation could be put into operation.  On the whole, I think we should limit any publicity or other work abroad designed to bring tourists here until we are satisfied that we are ready to deal with any business that might result.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I want to make it clear that the argument against allowing visitors to come to this country in this year, based on the supply situation, is not very strong.  In so far as certain foodstuffs are rationed&mdash;tea, sugar and butter&mdash;the supplies which any hotel may receive are restricted, and will not be increased because of increased business secured by that hotel.  The other foodstuffs, such as meat and eggs, are not rationed here, and there is, in respect of these other foodstuffs, a substantial export business. It seems to me that it is obviously a much better policy to sell meat and eggs in the form of cooked meals to people coming here from abroad than to export them raw.  I do not think that we need at the moment unduly concern ourselves about that aspect of <Col N="2042" /> the matter, because the number of tourists that can come here in this year from outside will be restricted in any event by curtailed travel facilities and will be doubly restricted by reason of the inadequacy of the hotel accommodation available to them.  At the same time, as I have already said, we should keep in mind that there are special circumstances existing in the world at the present time which give us opportunities of development on these lines which may not recur and which we should have in the back of our heads not merely in regard to the immediate situation but to the long-term advantages which may accrue from the development of the business.</P>
    <P>I have said that the general plan of the board can be considered under three main headings.  First of all, the board has placed upon it the obligation of improving the hotel accommodation available in the country.  As the House is aware, the board controls the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;, and only premises which are admitted to the register of hotels maintained by the board and are regarded by it as being in every respect entitled to be described as hotels, can be so described.  A similar qualification applies in respect to the term &ldquo;guesthouse&rdquo;. The importance of developing our hotel accommodation and of ensuring proper standards of cooking, cleanliness and other facilities in hotels will be obvious to anyone who has given any thought to this business.  No facilities in the form of natural beauty of scenery or the development of resort facilities or of sporting, shooting or fishing facilities will popularise holidays in Ireland either amongst our own people or people from other countries unless there is proper hotel and restaurant accommodation available to them.  The board, in addition to its obligation of supervising and raising the standard of hotel accommodation, is empowered to undertake the work of developing holiday resorts.  A list of the resorts for which development schemes are ready is given in the White Paper.  I shall refer to it later.  Similarly the board has the obligation, which is not of immediate importance but which will at some stage become a major feature of its activities, of publicising <Col N="2043" /> at home and abroad the facilities available for holidays here.</P>
    <P>An amendment has been tabled to the Second Reading of this Bill.  That amendment suggests that the Dáil decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill until a committee has been set up to inquire into and report on certain matters therein mentioned.  I am not accepting that amendment.  I think that the information which the proposed committee would require can and should be given to the Dáil, and that it is here it should be examined.  In order to avoid any suggestion that there has been a withholding of information from the Dáil, I propose to deal with these matters in the order in which they are contained in the amendment, and give to the House such information as the committee might hope to obtain as a result of its inquiries.  The first item mentioned here is the work already carried out by the Irish Tourist Board.  I have, of course, already informed the Dáil that the work of the Tourist Board from 1939 until 1944 was very largely confined to the planning of its future activities.  It was planning not merely its own organisation and work but preparing detailed plans, with the aid of its engineers and architects, for resort development schemes.  It was only in 1944 that it began actively the work of improving hotel accommodation and of establishing a hotel register.  It is only now that it is beginning the business of resort development. The number of hotels registered by the board is 900.  The board's officers inspected 1,396 premises, described as hotels, and accepted for registration only 900.  The other premises which were not registered as hotels were regarded as not conforming to the standards set by the board either in respect of accommodation, cooking facilities, cleanliness or otherwise.  A number of these premises which were not registered as hotels were regarded as suitable as guest-houses and registered as such. Six hundred and two premises, described as guest-houses, were inspected, but of that number only 271 were registered.  It is contemplated <Col N="2044" /> that a number of the hotels and guest-houses which were not registered will be able to qualify for registration at a subsequent stage when certain improvements, indicated by the board's inspectors, have been carried out.</P>
    <P>During these preparatory years the board, as I have already said, carried out a survey of all tourist resorts in the country and prepared, in relation to each resort, where it conceived it to be practicable, a scheme for the development of the amenities there. It has already submitted schemes for improvements and development at 18 resorts.  The total cost of the schemes which have been approved provisionally was estimated at £662,000, and it is because the total cost of the provisionally approved schemes reached that figure that this amending Bill has been introduced.  As I have already indicated, the actual expenditure to date has not exceeded £122,000. That expenditure was undertaken at the following centres.  I will give them in alphabetical order and not in the order of importance.  At Ardmore in the County Waterford the board purchased the lands, buildings and effects of the Irish College there.  A certain sum has been expended on professional fees in connection with proposed internal reconstruction.  The price paid for the lands, buildings and effects of the college was £3,162.  It is estimated that the cost of reconstruction will be about £6,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The work of reconstruction has not yet been put in hands.  These premises when completed will be used for holiday accommodation for persons who may desire to associate their holidays with the study of the Irish language.  Ballinahinch Castle lands and fisheries have been purchased for £20,000 and the Recess fisheries have been acquired for £15,000.  It is intended to use these properties as a fishing centre and hotel.  A further sum of some magnitude which cannot be precisely estimated as yet will be expended on the improvement of the property.  It is expected, however, that Ballinahinch <Col N="2045" /> Castle will be opened as a hotel this summer.  At Bundoran it has been decided to purchase the urban district council park, houses, shop, cafe, amusement park, a vacant site and a piece of land in the vicinity for their conversion into a swimming pool, tennis courts, amusement parks, car parks, public parks and similar amenities. So far, the total expenditure undertaken has been a sum of £1,330 on the acquisition of the urban district park.  A further sum of £4,500 has been expended on the construction of a breakwater and the provision of certain sports facilities.  A further scheme for the development of Bundoran is contemplated by the board. It is estimated that the total expenditure which will be incurred in that area when the whole work is completed will be approximately £30,000.  At Courtown, County Wexford, the board has acquired the Courtown Estate which consists of Courtown House and a house called Levuka. The cost of these properties was £16,000 and a further substantial sum will require to be expended on the conversion of the houses into hotels and the farm building into a hostel, together with the provision of roads, recreation centres, and other facilities At Killarney, the board has acquired a derelict hotel, the Royal Victoria, with a parcel of land known as Mahony's Point, and further expenditure is contemplated on the acquisition of land in the Killarney area and the provision of new buildings, such as club premises, sports pavilion and restaurant, with a view to development of the facilities there.  It is estimated that the total expenditure which the board may incur in the Killarney area in the immediate future will be about £65,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Lisdoonvarna the board has acquired the Queen's Hotel, Lisdoonvarna, for £8,000 and is engaged in reconstructing it.  The total estimated cost of the reconstruction of the hotel is £15,000, of which about £4,000 has already been made available.  The board also made a loan to the Lisdoonvarna and Rooska Spa Wells Trust for the development of the spa and the board has been authorised to make a further loan of £4,100 to the Trust for <Col N="2046" /> the completion of bath houses, reconstruction of tennis courts and the provision of other amenities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>£3,700.  The board contemplate further expenditure in that area and their total expenditure in the Lisdoonvarna district may amount to about £78,000.  It is expected that the hotel which has been acquired there will be open to receive visitors in the coming summer.  At Newtown, Termonfeckin, the board has acquired the house and lands known as Lentaigne Estate for a total sum of £15,000 and these premises are being reconstructed for use as a hotel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a figure.  At Portmarnock, County Dublin, the board have purchased the house known as St. Marnock's with adjoining properties for approximately £14,000 and has already expended £3,000 on the reconstruction of the property.  Further work of reconstruction as well as the development of the property generally as a pleasure resort are contemplated.  It is intended to use the house as a hotel and it is expected that the hotel will be open for business at some time in the present year.  At Tramore, County Waterford, the board had already expended £25,000 on the acquisition of lands and premises with the object of developing a pleasure park with the usual amenities of a seaside resort, car parks, cafés, tennis courts, etc.  The object of the board's activities at Tramore is to add to the present amenities.  It is estimated that the total cost of the work of reconstruction and development which the board will undertake in the Tramore area will be about £105,000.  These developments include a swimming pool and public baths as well as a cinema, recreation hall and restaurant.  The board has lent a sum of £2,500 to Gaelachas Teoranta for the <Col N="2047" /> enlargement and expansion of premises at Garryvoe which are designed to provide accommodation for persons learning Irish in that district.</P>
      <P>The next item on the list contained in the amendment is the further plans for development prepared by the board.  The board contemplates as one of its main activities in the early future the granting of fixed term loans to hotel keepers for the improvement of the accommodation provided by their hotels.  It is considered that the time has arrived when it is practicable for hotel proprietors to improve the standard of their hotel accommodation and to enlarge the accommodation available. In a number of cases that work will be facilitated by the granting of fixed term loans by the board.  It is not contemplated to put any limit on the total amount of loans which may be granted by the board for that purpose, but of the £1,250,000 which will be available following the enactment of this Bill, it would be possible for the board, in addition to completing the various development works which are in contemplation, to issue approximately £100,000 to hotel keepers in the form of loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already mentioned the schemes on which work has been carried out by the board.  The board, I should say, contemplate further developments at those centres and also at other centres and the other centres, which I have not yet mentioned, are as follows:&mdash;At Arklow, County Wicklow, the board propose to acquire certain properties and to expend money upon the reclamation of these properties and their development as sites for hotel and other holiday facilities.  It is thought that the total expenditure which will be undertaken in the Arklow area will be about £27,000.  The board also contemplate acquiring certain properties at Dollymount, County Dublin, and the erection of a pavilion, café, dressing-rooms and other facilities. I understand that the board have discussions in progress with the Dublin City Manager, and that, to some extent, the development of the Dollymount area for recreational purposes <Col N="2048" /> will be undertaken by the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>At Glengarriff the board proposes to acquire certain properties and to develop existing recreational facilities and provide new ones at a total cost of about £10,000.  There is also a plan for the development of facilities at Kilkee involving the acquisition of land and the construction of a central pavilion, the total cost of which will be about £20,000.  At Rosses Point, County Sligo, the board proposes to acquire and develop a site and to erect thereon a restaurant, dance hall, and other facilities.  The total expenditure contemplated by the board in the Rosses Point area is approximately £60,000.  At Salthill, County Galway, the board's plans provide for the acquisition of certain houses and the erection of a café, baths and other facilities at a total cost of about £50,000.  At Skerries, County Dublin, the board proposes to acquire ground for an amusement park and provision for general recreational facilities at a cost of about £8,000.  At Youghal, County Cork, the board has proposals for the acquisition of a site and its development so as to provide hot sea water baths, cafés, and certain other facilities, to a total cost of about £50,000.</P>
    <P>I have dealt now with items 1, 2 and 3 in the amendment, the work already carried out by the board, the further plans for development prepared by the board, and the development schemes which have been sanctioned in principle. No. 4 relates to the acquisition of properties by the board.  The actual properties acquired by the board to date are: the lands, buildings and effects of the Irish College at Ardmore, Ballinahinch Castle and Recess fisheries; the Urban District Council Park at Bundoran; Courtown House and Levuka House, Courtown; Royal Victoria Hotel and parcel of land at Killarney; the Queen's Hotel, Lisdoonvarna; the Lentaigne house, lands and effects at Newtown, Termonfeckin; St. Marnock's, Portmarnock; lands, houses and cafés at Tramore.  The total cost of all these acquisitions was £105,982.</P>

      <P>The only hotel in operation as a hotel which has already been acquired is the Queen's Hotel, Lisdoonvarna. The board has also acquired the Royal Victoria Hotel at Killarney which was in fact closed.  Item 5 relates to the assistance given by the board to stimulate and assist private enterprise.  The board has formulated a scheme for assisting private enterprise by means of loans to hotelkeepers who cannot otherwise secure the requisite financial assistance.  So far loans have only been made in the two cases I have mentioned, the Irish Hostel at Garryvoe, and the Lisdoonvarna spa development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item 6 asks whether the board is undertaking or is planning to undertake work which should be left to private enterprise.  It is the policy of the board not to undertake any work where there is a reasonable prospect that private enterprise is likely to do it.  The board has made is clear, and in that connection it is also the policy of the Government that it should be made clear, that reliance will be placed upon private enterprise to provide increased holiday facilities.  Experience has shown, however, that in a number of important schemes special measures involving the board's direct intervention are necessary.  It is for that reason that the board's plans include proposals for the conversion and enlargement, <Col N="2050" /> for use as holiday accommodation, of buildings already acquired by it or to be acquired by it.  The intention of the board is to establish an interim company to take over and to manage these properties and ultimately offer them to the public.  The offer of the interest in these properties will be made to the public when the preliminary development work has been completed and the results secured are sufficient to justify the board in believing that it can make the offer on terms satisfactory to it.  While the board has acquired these properties that might otherwise have gone derelict or been left unused, it proposes to develop them before selling them to the public. It is, at the same time, the policy of the board to encourage private enterprise, to develop existing properties and to acquire new properties for development purposes, and, generally, to rely on the private initiative of individual firms and persons to get the results desired.  Where necessary, it is prepared to help private interests by making financial facilities available to them in the form of advances.</P>
    <P>The seventh and last item mentioned in the amendment is the nature of the administrative machinery established by the board.  That position is governed by Section 11 of the 1939 Act.  I would not find it practicable to give a clear picture of the scheme of organisation of the board's staff, but I can give the Dáil all the information which may be considered relevant to enable them to understand the nature and dimensions of the staff which at present is undertaking the board's activities.  The cost of the board and its staff is provided for in Section 15 of the Act of 1939.  The total cost in the present year is estimated at £38,000.  Of that £38,000, £18,000 is earmarked for publicity and advertising, and the balance is made up as follows: the board's fees, £2,300; staff salaries, £10,000; travelling expenses and subsistence allowances, £1,400; consultants' fees and expenses, £1,500; office expenses and supplies, £700; rates, rents, establishment charges and general expenses, £3,400; furniture and fittings, £300; contingencies and sundry expenses, £400.  It is, of course, possible that the <Col N="2051" /> staff in the service of the board will require to be extended as the work of the board becomes enlarged and particularly as it has the responsibility of supervising the carrying out of numerous works involving construction in various parts of the country, but, generally speaking, the administrative expenses of the board will be small in relation to the total outlay contemplated under the whole scheme.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to give the Dáil all possible information.  The Bill itself is one which can usefully be discussed on Second Reading only.  There is no scope for Committee Stage discussion, because it is practically a one-clause Bill, and, in passing the Second Reading, the Dáil would, in fact, be giving approval to the general scheme which the board is carrying out.  I should have liked to have deferred the introduction of the Bill until the work which the board had planned during the war years had further advanced and until Deputies could see for themselves the type of work the board is undertaking and the centres at which that work is being done.  A number of these resort development schemes have been delayed by lack of supplies and equipment, but it is hoped to commence activities on most, if not all, this year, even if only to a limited extent.</P>
    <P>The Bill is being introduced here now for the technical reason that the actual estimated cost of the approved works exceeds the limit provided for in the 1939 Act and it was considered desirable on that account that the Dáil should be given this opportunity to deal with the matter, even though we are not yet in a position to say that the board's work has progressed to the point at which it is possible to estimate its ultimate value to the country or the skill with which it has been directed.  I think, however, it will be generally agreed that this resort development work and the other activities of the board in raising the standard and improving the adequacy of our hotel accommodation are work worth doing, that it must be done by some such organisation as this board and that the State can legitimately take a real interest in it because of <Col N="2052" /> its ultimate economic importance to the country.  If that point is agreed, although there may be criticism of the detailed administration of the board, I think the House will have little difficulty in enacting the measure.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Tourist Traffic (Amendment) Bill, 1946, until a Select Committee, to be appointed by the Committee of Selection and with powers to send for persons, papers and documents, shall have inquired into and reported upon:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the work already carried out by the Irish Tourist Board,</P>
      <P>(2)  the further plans for development prepared by the board,</P>
      <P>(3)  the developments schemes which have been sanctioned in principle,</P>
      <P>(4)  the acquisition of properties by the board,</P>
      <P>(5)  the assistance given by the board to stimulate and assist private enterprise,</P>
      <P>(6)  whether the board has undertaken or is planning to undertake work which should be left to private enterprise, and</P>
      <P>(7)  the nature of the administrative machinery established by the board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While rather disapproving of the approach of the Minister to this matter and regarding it as a complete reversal of the approach which he indicated when dealing with the 1939 Act when it was going through the Dáil, particularly in relation to the acquiring, building and carrying on of hotels, it is satisfactory that he has taken this amendment as a basis for giving a certain amount of information to the House on certain aspects of the Tourist Board's work.  If there is one thing more than another which has characterised public opinion generally with regard to the work of the Tourist Board, it is complete dissatisfaction <Col N="2053" /> with the amount of information which it was possible to obtain on what the board was doing, the principles upon which it was acting and the relationship between the board and the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Finance.  There has been complete failure on the part of the board to do anything to assist the ordinary professional people who were carrying on the hotel and catering business and the tourist business generally, and it has been impossible to find out how the board's staff was organised and how it worked.  There has been a general complaint that the whole administrative working, the whole planning and the principles upon which the board was working, were absolutely and completely shrouded in secrecy.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement to-day will have lifted the veil of secrecy from the scene a little, but it will not have in any way assured people who have been alarmed by and opposed to the tendencies they have seen in the carrying on of the board's work, because the statement of the Minister to-day shows that in regard to a very important matter&mdash;the taking over of hotels, the organisation of hotels and the running of hotels directly by the board&mdash;he has completely departed from the outlook which he indicated he was going to adopt in respect of the lines upon which the board was to work when it was originally set up.  The criticism has been put forward that the board as at present constituted and as it has been constituted has not amongst its personnel anybody with any contact with or experience of the hotel, catering, or tourist business generally. Apparently one of the results of that, and perhaps a very necessary result, is that the board has kept itself away from the ordinary fabric of enterprise catering for this class of work in the country and has set out on a particular line entirely on its own.  It has in a very large number of cases set out to acquire, to purchase and actually to run a considerable number of hotels of either a large or a small kind.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was dealing with the proposed provision of £600,000 <Col N="2054" /> under Section 16 of the original Act, he indicated, in column 178 of the Official Reports of 27th April, 1939, the headings generally under which it was expected that amount would be spent. He indicated that (1) approximately £150,000 would be used as loans for the extension and improvement of existing accommodation; (2) £250,000 as loans to, or investments in, new hotels and guest houses, including provision for hostel accommodation for industrial holiday-makers; (3) £150,000 for resort improvements through the medium of loans and investments; and (4) about £50,000 for other loans and investments not covered by any of the other three heads.  When the Minister comes to deal with the duties of the board, we find that he places in the forefront of his statement the establishment, equipment, etc., of hotels and guest houses.  In the very forefront of the board's duties is given the establishment and equipment by the board of these places.  We find that being done at a time when, looking over the various accounts and particularly the accounts presented by the board&mdash; meagre as the information in them is &mdash;in which we are given certain information with regard to the assets held by the board at the end of March, 1945, as a result of its expenditure of money received by it under Section 16, we find the whole assets represented by £32,023 for development when the total provision for loans was £620,000 odd.</P>
    <P>I take it that a substantial part of that amount was represented by the loan for the assistance of the Gaelic hostel at Garryvoe, so that, up to March, 1945, and, so far as we know, up to date, no part of that £150,000 expected to be expended on loans for the improvement of existing accommodation and no part of the £250,000 to be expended on loans to and investments in new hotels and guest houses, including provision of hostel accommodation for industrial workers, has been expended through private channels.  In my opinion, there has been a complete turn-back on the whole idea which the Minister impressed upon us when the 1939 Bill was being dealt with regarding assistance to private persons who <Col N="2055" /> had been carrying on this business and who will be carrying it on in the future. There has been no expenditure whatever by way of assisting those persons. The Minister winds up the White Paper by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Its success will depend on the manner in which those engaged on it rise to their opportunity by enterprise, efficiency and the provision of facilities on fair terms for holiday-makers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister was there referring to hotels, restaurants and general services for holiday-makers.  In reply to Deputy Cosgrave, who questioned him originally in connection with the building of hotels in particular places, particularly Rineanna, the Minister said he was perfectly sure that 99 per cent. of the persons who were engaged in the hotel, restaurant and general catering business for holiday-makers, would be only too glad to avail of the financial accommodation which would be provided by the board.  While the Minister was of opinion that 99 per cent. of those engaged in the business would welcome financial assistance from the board, no arrangement has been made to give that class of persons any assistance, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly reminded the House that, when war broke out in September, 1939, we approached the Government and indicated that, in our opinion, the military situation was not then such as would have a direct impact on this country but that, in our view, the economic situation would be a serious one.  We asked to have a body of experts set up which would review in a detached way what was happening in the world and relate that to the position here, so that we could take advantage of any opportunity which offered to prepare for the future and to deal with any weaknesses in our economy which might be brought about by world conditions.  That was rather brushed aside by the Government. An Act had, however, been passed giving control of the tourist industry to a body which was in a position to look at affairs in the world and <Col N="2056" /> to see what the trends were and what our weaknesses might be.  They had been provided with £620,000, a very considerable part of which was intended to provide financial assistance for persons engaged in the service of holiday-makers.  We find that nothing has since been done about that.  Even the work of registration, with which we are not concerned so much here, was left completely in abeyance and no steps were taken to deal with even the preliminaries to registration until some time in 1944.  In the meantime, money was being spent yearly under Section 16, so that, by March, 1945, there had been a total expenditure of £41,840 on salaries and other expenses of a non-repayable kind.  Between 1939 and March, 1945, £29,435 had been paid out in salaries and wages and £12,405 in other expenses.  After the annual report and statement of accounts, issued for the year ended March, 1944, there were rumblings as to what exactly was going on.  We find that what was going on was that properties were being bought up by the State in various holiday areas.  The board was knuckling in on the running of a rather widespread and elaborate scheme of State hotels.  That is a complete change from the principles put forward by the Minister on Second Reading and in Committee when dealing with the Bill in 1939.  On the 23rd May, 1939, Deputy McMenamin objected to a clause in the Bill which gave the board power to erect hotels.  In reply, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I merely want to repeat what I said on the Second Reading Stage, that it is not the intention that the board should enter into competition with private concerns....  When I say that it is not the intention of the board to enter into competition with private individuals, what I mean is that the board will, in no circumstances, undertake commercial activities which it can prompt private enterprise to undertake.  It will be the normal function of the board to interest itself in the development and expansion of hotels by means of loans and investments and not by building and operating hotels.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2057" /> In column 60, he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not want to leave the House under any misapprehension with regard to this particular paragraph. While I think it is desirable that the board should have the power to build and operate hotels and while I think the possession of these powers will strengthen its general position in relation to private interests and make it easier for it to get its main job done, I would regard it as definitely contrary to the public interest that the board should unnecessarily engage in any business enterprise of this kind.  Their main function must be to stimulate private enterprise and, if they do not succeed in stimulating private enterprise to provide better hotel and other holiday facilities which the country requires, then, they will have failed in their main job and we shall have to consider the position again, but the affording of that stimulus to private enterprise is their main function.  It will be only when all attempts to secure the development desired through private commercial enterprise fails that they will contemplate exercising the powers conferred by the section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In column 62, he stated, after a question had been raised as to whether a board itself engaged in running hotels was the proper body to grade hotels:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If that should arise, we shall have to consider the matter afresh, but I do not contemplate any development of that kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He did not contemplate a development of a kind in which the board would be running hotels.  That was the Minister's attitude as reiterated on Committee Stage.  He had dealt with the matter on Second Reading and was then equally emphatic.  On the 27th April, he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not intended that the board should undertake the construction and operation of hotels in competition with existing enterprises but it is desirable, I think, that the board should have the power of doing so. There are two reasons for my saying that.  There may be cases&mdash;I can think of one immediately&mdash;where private enterprise will not, for <Col N="2058" /> obvious reasons, provide a hotel or similar accommodation which the national interests might demand...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to speak of Rineanna and the possibility of acquiring a hotel there.  Ennis or Limerick would not do.  I do not know whether it is now contemplated that a hotel should be built at Rineanna but there are indications of a proposal to set up an elaborate hotel in the City of Limerick, of which the board will be part owner.  If that is so, it conflicts entirely with the Minister's opinion at that particular time when the question of the possibility of requiring a hotel to be built at Rineanna&mdash;he did not say &ldquo;probability&rdquo;&mdash;was discussed by the Minister as one of the kind of cases in which the board might build a hotel.</P>
    <P>The other type of case about which the Minister spoke, in which they might have to intervene directly in the running of hotels, is dealt with in column 1255:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There may be an odd case, where because of lack of initiative or enterprise it may be impossible to get, through the persons who are now engaged in the catering business in particular localities, a proper standard of accommodation in these localities and it will help the board, in its efforts to stimulate enterprise, to get the initiative and the results it desires, to have the powers which the Bill gives to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He pressed for the powers in the spirit in which there was not going to be any direct interference with private enterprise. The board was to be stimulated to do what was then regarded as the most important thing, that is to encourage and help the people already in the industry to carry on the industry successfully.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the board has bought a certain number of properties which will be run in future, and may be run this year, as hotels. The chairman of the Tourist Board has already referred to this matter.  I do not recognise any similarity at all between the establishments as described by the Minister and as described by the chairman of the <Col N="2059" /> Tourist Board.  The chairman is the person who is spending the money and doing all this work, whether it be under the direction of the Department of Industry and Commerce or not, I do not know.  We have been given to understand that the board is an independent board but the Minister has indicated that, at any rate on two different occasions, the Government directly intervened&mdash;to tell the board to stop on the one hand and to tell the board to go on, on the other.  The chairman of the board has rather indicated that the hotels that are being taken over are being run by the board for an entirely different class of persons from those for whom the Minister said the Bill is intended specially to cater.  The Minister as a matter of principle&mdash;and I think rightly&mdash;stresses that the activity that we require in the development of the tourist business should be aimed at enabling our own people to enjoy their increasing holidays and the leisure with which a proper organisation of society here would bless them, in a convenient and comparatively cheap way in their own country and in their own natural surroundings. I think we should all like to subscribe to that theory and we should all like to see the theory put into operation on a more extended scale.</P>
    <P>Again I should like to say that I do not understand the Minister's difficulty regarding any reflection that any persons may try to cast on holiday services in this country as being in any way mean.  We are as much dependent upon what our organised neighbours can do for us in the hotel, restaurant and general holiday services way as we are dependent on those neighbours who make our boots, cut our hair, put our motor cars together, make our furniture or cater for us in a general business way.  It is news to me to hear that there is any section of public opinion that is animadverting in any way on the respectability of, or the absolute social necessity for, persons engaged in the occupation of hotel-running or the running of amusements services in their various forms.  I do not think we or the Minister need delay <Col N="2060" /> to consider suggestions of that kind.  It is essential in general social and economic interests, that in the division of our labour, we should find people who are as willing, in an honourable and self-respecting way, to engage in this service as to find people for any of the other services, in the management of a business of any other kind or the doing of the detailed work which these businesses are established to help.  It is absolutely essential that we should have these services, and the more we become better socially organised here, the more leisure we would expect everybody here to have, the more we should wish to be socially and commercially organised to enable people to make a profitable use of their leisure.</P>
    <P>The necessity and the ideal of which the Minister speaks seem to be absolutely and completely lost sight of by the board when we consider the various ways in which the moneys the Minister mentioned as being placed at the disposal of the board are being expended.  He mentioned Ardmore, Ballinahinch, Bundoran, Courtown Harbour, Killarney, Lisdoonvarna, Termonfeckin, Portmarnock and Tramore. He mentioned these as the first nine places where development has taken place and indicated that in Lisdoonvarna and in Portmarnock hotel accommodation would be opened this year. The chairman of the Tourist Board, discussing these matters, put a completely different complexion on the matter.  He said that these hotels would not compete with local business, because they would be equipped and furnished on a far more luxurious scale than would normally be found in resorts of this sort and that they would cater for a wealthier class of tourist.  In fact, he said that acquisition of the hotels and the acreages which accompanied them was an attempt to make these resorts much more fashionable.  As a matter of fact, he described them as hotels-de-luxe. He indicated that it was only a body such as the Irish Tourist Board that could take a longer view than private enterprise; it was only a body like that that could afford to acquire this property and develop it, if it were confident <Col N="2061" /> that it would eventually yield a handsome profit.  So that, as regards the carrying on of all this work, the words used in the published statement made by the chairman are such as to show that they are entirely at variance with the statement the Minister makes, but they seem to be somewhat in the spirit in which the Minister generally approaches the control of things.</P>
    <P>When we dealt with the Second Reading of the 1939 Bill I had occasion to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that a few days before he had been indicating that the more the State was able to control and direct things the better things would be in the country. He said, on the 12th May, 1939, in column 2366, on the General Resolution in connection with the Budget:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A great part of our future development depends on the willingness of the people in this country to entrust to the State their savings or their capital for expenditure upon capital undertakings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I intervened to say: &ldquo;And the State is going to be the developing machinery.&rdquo; The Minister then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It does not matter whether the State is going to undertake all the capital expenditure which the future development of the country requires or whether private companies or private individuals are going to undertake that expenditure.  Unless there is confidence in the State, in the credit and the stability of the State, that money will not be available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But we have, in fact, in the working of the board, a complete reversal of the Minister's outlook as expressed to the House when dealing with the original Bill.  We have a complete discrepancy between the function that the Minister indicates these hotels, large or small, are going to have in the country, and the function as explained on 7th November, 1945, by the chairman of the Tourist Board, and we have the position that after expending, over the last five years, £41,840 on salaries and the running of an office, there is nothing to show for it at the end of March. 1945, but some moneys spent in developing a site at Tramore, purchasing property <Col N="2062" /> there, and purchasing certain other properties throughout the country to the extent of £32,000.  There was nothing done good, bad or indifferent from the time this Bill was passed in 1939 up to March, 1945, to assist the persons this board was set up to assist &mdash;that is, those who were carrying on the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that arrangements are now being made to grant loans to persons who are carrying on the business in various parts of the country, but in the neighbourhood of, say, Dundalk, they are very much behind-hand in their development, and priority in materials and in money is being given to the development of a new hotel at Termonfeckin.  The same applies to Portmarnock.  What type of hotel development by direct action of the board is being carried on, or is contemplated, at Portmarnock that is not being, or could not be, carried on by private persons in the same neighbourhood? After the board have set up a new hotel at Portmarnock, does the Minister think that that is the moment to approach those already engaged in the development of Portmarnock and offer them financial assistance to improve their position there when the board has already, as it were, cut them out and is attempting to take the cream of the wealthier visitors to Portmarnock, taking them to build up the board's property?</P>
    <P>The same applies to Courtown.  The board have described the Termonfeckin hotel as a de-luxe one and they have described the hotels at Portmarnock and Courtown in the same way.  The same remark would apply to Lisdoonvarna. I do not understand what type of development will take place at Killarney. I would have thought the Killarney situation was fairly well developed from the hotel point of view and that, if there was any additional development to take place there, the Killarney people were fully capable of carrying it out.</P>
    <P>The Minister's policy has been completely overturned.  I suggest that his attitude in the House is in conflict with the principles that are being put into operation.  I suggest that the Bill <Col N="2063" /> is not being used for the purpose for which it was intended&mdash;that is, to help and stimulate people who will have to carry on the business and who are at the moment carrying it on.  The additional information given can only draw more public attention to the facts. Whether it will sufficiently develop public opinion among those interested in having holiday facilities of a cheap and reasonable kind, or those people who are interested in the development of holiday services in a proper way because they belong to that avocation, and whether it will enable them to hold up the objectionable tendency that has taken place in the working of the board, is another matter.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it will require a tremendous focussing of public attention on the working of the board to see that the principles which the Minister wishes to stand by will be held safe in practice.  The Minister's statement is satisfactory in that he has allowed a little more light on the situation, but as a statement of policy it is utterly at variance with the things that we think are required in the country.  We think what are required are not so much de-luxe hotels as a concentration on the type of hotel we have at present, and particularly the extension to the less populous parts of the country, where there are natural holiday features, of smaller hotels and guest-houses that can accommodate a small number of guests who will have the advantage of sporting and fishing and that type of holiday that has been so remunerative to a large number of people.</P>
    <P>In the more popular centres the holiday-makers require a holiday of a definite type.  It would be fantastic to have the board butting into these centres and developing luxury hotels, the only purpose of which can be to raise the price of holiday-making in these areas, because where you get an hotel of that kind catering for the wealthier classes the result will be to drive up the cost of holiday-making. That would be an unnatural development, an artificial development.  The fact is, there is a board, and it has no one on it in any way connected with the <Col N="2064" /> hotel or restaurant business.  It is dependent on consultants and experts, called in during the past five years, and up to March, 1945, they were paid £1,448.  It has already been suggested that what is wanted is a board that will, to a considerable extent, reflect the experience and the ability of people engaged in that business.  Until we get that board there is bound to be an artificial development of this kind, and we are going to have an attempt to strengthen the grip of the State on activities which should be left to ordinary private enterprise.  For that reason I consider that the House should pass the amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that this is the proper place to discuss this matter. This is the proper place to discuss it and to come to a final conclusion, but it is hardly the place where the real facts can be properly brought out.  It is not the place where the tendency disclosed by these facts can be fully thrashed out.  The Minister has indicated that that is not the kind of discussion we could have on Second Reading. To some extent that is true, although I hope on Committee Stage we can go backwards and forwards and have a more informative discussion than is possible on Second Reading. This is the place for discussion and the place for decision.  It is not the place where we can get the facts, to see them in their full perspective and importance, or where we can discuss the principles.  That is why I suggest we should not agree further to increase the amount of money provided until we have reviewed the matter.  The only way it can be properly reviewed is by having a committee of the kind I suggest to see what is being done at present, and where it is leading us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Having heard the Minister it strikes me that he and his advisers are in a state of perplexity. They are quite obviously experimenting with the people's money in this enterprise, but have not yet made up their minds whether they are going into the hotel business to stay there, or merely as a temporary experiment, so as to set an example to the hoteliers of the country.  If these hotels <Col N="2065" /> and these various institutions which have been purchased by the Tourist Development Board had been purchased, shall we say, as experimental institutions, to set an example to hoteliers, as to what might be done in that business to attract tourists from abroad, I could appreciate the merits of the enterprise.  I certainly cannot endorse a system by which we go into the enterprise now, in the hope of making it pay, and then selling it back to private enterprise, particularly when we consider that the Tourist Development Board itself is constituted by a personnel which have neither training nor experience directly in the hotel business.  So far as I am aware no member of the Tourist Development Board has had any training whatever as a hotelier.  Some are civil servants, or quasi civil servants, but none of them has at any time had to earn his living in the hotel business.  These are the people who, apparently, are to undertake the task of directing the country on this vast scale.  The vocational commission in its findings had reason to find fault with that system of enterprise, and the President, when speaking last year as Minister for Finance, in his Budget statement, said quite frankly that State intervention carried us too far towards totalitarianism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are embarking on another enterprise now, whereby the hotel business of this country will have to depend for its existence upon State sanction, endorsement and approval.  In the first place, a hotelier must depend for registration of his premises on the board's officers.  If he has need to seek a loan for the development of his business, he must apply to the board and depend upon the goodwill of the board to consider his application.  The Minister indicated that something like £100,000 of the money will be allocated for fixed term loans to hoteliers.  He also indicated that there is no limit to the amount of loans which may be granted by the board to hoteliers.  As far as I can see the roof is off.  It is not only a question of raising the amount from £600,000 to £1,250,000, but the House may be asked to advance any fixed term loans if it sees its way to do so. <Col N="2066" /> Already some 900 hotels and 271 guest-houses are registered, and it is quite obvious that if any considerable percentage of these institutions were now to look for a loan, they could not hope to get more than a very small loan. In the event of any considerable number of our hotels or guest-houses seeking loans from the State the ultimate figure will be collosal.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to that aspect of the matter, because all advances under the Tourist Traffic Act of 1939 may be wiped out if the Minister for Finance agrees with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to wipe them out.  Not only the principal and interest, but all advances may be wiped out.  It is important that we should realise that when we are asked to pass this extra £650,000.  Every advance made to the board under Section 16 of the Tourist Traffic Act of 1939, together with the principal and interest, may be waived. So we get the position that, if the board continues to advance moneys to people who are no mark for them and if they cannot recover the amounts from the various hoteliers, we have to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Minister, through the board, is going into the hotel business.  If he were doing that merely to set a good example and induce hoteliers to follow it and develop on those lines, I would endorse it. There is grave necessity to bring our hotel business into line with other countries.  Those with any experience of the Continent realise that we are only tinkering with the business and need to learn a lot.  It is there that I quarrel with the way in which the board has functioned since 1939.  Certainly, they have not exercised the powers they might have exercised under Section 16, that is, to bring the standard of hotel menus and hotel food generally up to a proper level.  A good deal could have been done in those years to bring those hotels to the level of a decent table.  Compared with the pre-war standards on the Continent, we have a lot of leeway to make up and we are very far behind in the development of a purely Irish menu that would <Col N="2067" /> be capable of attracting visitors and establish for ourselves in the tourist business a national tradition and a national reputation.  We have done nothing at all to develop on that line and, so far as I know from my experience in travelling around the country, there has been very little change in the matter of menu from the old days.  Many of them are still in the bacon and egg stage and many of them seem to have no desire to get away from that.  That is a serious commentary on our business after all those years of publicity and attempted development of our tourist traffic.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I would like to see some effort made, perhaps in conjunction with the Department of Education, to develop a hotel service through our vocational schools.  In other countries there is no inferiority status or social degradation attaching to people going into the hotel business. The biggest people in the land start at the bottom and work their way up.  Even the sons of hoteliers in Switzerland, France, Brittany and Italy go into the hotel business as a matter of course, just as the youth of this country go into an ordinary profession. They do not start at the top: they start to learn the business in another institution, away from home and in another atmosphere, and they start at the bottom and go through the mill.  We need to rid ourselves of our superiority complex and get down to bed rock.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an approach made, first of all, by the Department of Education through the vocational schools to develop hotel servants of a proper standing &mdash; qualified waiters, waitresses, chefs, cooks, and so on. We have great need of some such service in order that we may reach a reasonable standard.  In addition to what is done under that heading in other countries, they have, in France, for example, yearly championships in the hotel trade&mdash;a championship of chefs, for instance.  You will find in France a championship every year for the South, for the West, and different provinces of France, and eventually a national championship for the best chef <Col N="2068" /> of the year, another for the best chef in Brittany, the best chef in the South, and so on.  We could have been doing something on those lines if it is the Minister's view that this is to become a permanent feature of our economic life.  It is useless to go into this trade if we are merely going to cash in on the present emergency conditions. Undoubtedly, there is an opportunity at the moment to take advantage of the shortage of food and hotel accommodation on the Continent and make a good profit, within the next few years, out of the people who otherwise would go to the Continent for holidays.  Are the Minister and the Tourist Board satisfied that that trade is going to remain with us in the post-emergency period?</P>
    <P>Even in the past week, I have been speaking to a distinguished officer of the Czech Army, who has been in various businesses and has had wide experience of hotel life on the Continent. He assures me, from his experience here, particularly within the past month, that if our hoteliers are allowed to continue doing their business as they are at the moment, and continue fleecing the foreigner as they are at the moment, it is very unlikely that the trade will remain with us.  In the first place, his quarrel is that the table is very, very poor, as compared with the continental table pre-war.  No effort is made to cater for the taste of the continental visitor, no effort is made to learn the type of food a particular foreigner coming to this country may need.  That is his first grouse.  Everybody who has been on the Continent knows that you do not give a Frenchman bacon and eggs for breakfast.  He has no breakfast&mdash; merely coffee and rolls, but if we look at the coffee and rolls some of our hotels serve, I am afraid there is a very poor opinion of what is necessary. These are small matters, but they are the basis on which the hotel business on the Continent was built up.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that I am not at all satisfied that that trade is likely to remain with us, unless we can provide the same amenities in the way of food, hotel accommodation, sport and amusements that people will get <Col N="2069" /> elsewhere.  I know that the board is aiming in that direction, but before we spend money on all these enterprises we should consider a lot of basic facts which affect us here.  The first of those facts is our weather.  Given a choice of holidays, any citizen of any country will take the sunny climate in preference to the wet one, he will take the place where he is sure of constant sea bathing in constant sunshine during a regular period of clear weather.  We cannot guarantee that here.  We have to consider, in all this matter, the background of our peculiar climate, its fickleness and changeability.  It does definitely affect our position in the business and, therefore, if we are to counter the disadvantages of our weather conditions, we have to provide the indoor attractions and amusements which will keep our people here at seaside resorts in inclement weather.  That is a great drawback. How soon we can reach that position I do not know; certainly not in the next five or ten years&mdash;and by that time we shall have lost the opportunity of the present emergency.</P>
    <P>Again I quarrel with the board for not having foreseen the position and not having been ready to jump in. What we are doing now will not have material results for four or five years, in many cases.  Only a few places will be ready for visitors this year and we have no indication as to when visitors will be welcome in other resorts where developments are about to take place. The Minister has said that it is the policy of the board to discourage tourists this year.  I find it hard to reconcile that with the statement made quite recently by Mr. Barry, Secretary of the Tourist Association, who very strongly appealed to all Irish citizens to take their holidays now in May and June, as there was no hope of accommodation for any Irish tourist in any Irish seaside resort in July or August.  I am sure Mr. Barry must have been speaking from definite information of bookings in hotels.  It is also the individual experience of many people to whom I have been speaking that it is impossible to-day to book in any recognised hotel in any of the principal resorts.  I know people who have been going to the <Col N="2070" /> same hotel year after year and this year they have been refused accommodation for themselves and their families and have been told it has been booked by English or Scotch visitors. I question whether it is wise that our people should be put in that position. The first consideration, as the Minister indicated, is to provide holidays at home for our own people.  That should be the primary policy underlying the work of the board.  To-day the position is that very few people will be able to get holidays in any decent Irish resort.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say in what order of priority the applications to the board for these fixed-term loans will be dealt with by the board.  How is the board to decide as between A. and B. in a particular locality where you have resorts? Which of them is to have prior claim for consideration?  Is it to be a question of an individual applicant's enterprise and acumen in securing a loan, or is the decision to be based on the needs in a particular locality where an applicant makes application for such facilities?  Many people at the present time will quarrel with any policy which would permit an invasion of tourists, particularly having regard to the existing European food situation. They would feel that if there was a surplus of food to be given to such an army of visitors that, instead, it should be sent where it is most needed&mdash;to the starving peoples of Europe.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in conclusion, that I am a bit sceptical about all these schemes.  I feel that when a State, or a semi-State, Department goes into business there is a great tendency to slack up, to drift indefinitely, to swing the lead, to mark time and to take it easy.  In practically every country in the world, that has been the experience in regard to State enterprises.  We want to be very careful indeed in this, having regard to that fact, that we are not merely creating a number of soft and easy jobs for various people in the country, but a situation whereby it will be essential to secure that public funds are not going to be squandered.  You have as a background to all this business the fact that all these advances <Col N="2071" /> may be wiped out.  I am sure there would have to be very good reasons indeed before the Minister for Finance would agree to wipe out any advance, but, nevertheless, that is there as a background to all this.  That may help to create the impression among people who succeed in getting loans that they have nothing to worry about: that they can hold off the Tourist Board and prevent it from enforcing its power in regard to loans as against them, and that the State will eventually blue-pencil the loans granted.  That is a dangerous background to envisage.</P>
    <P>We should be very careful before we agree to hand out so much money.  As I see the position at the moment, there is no end to the amount of money that this House may be asked for in this matter of loans.  There is no limit to the loans.  In these circumstances, there should, first of all, be a thorough investigation as to the soundness of the security obtainable before a loan is granted.  In other words, the principle in regard to advances of this kind should be strictly the principle which any reasonable lender would exercise towards a borrower who has reasonable credit to offer.  There should not be any attempt either on the part of the Minister to overlook the board's activities, or of the board itself to advance money to people with derelict concerns, to people who ordinarily would be regarded as bad marks for the money they were seeking.  If people in this business have shown individual enterprise or if they have a record or a tradition behind them, they can, to my mind, get all the facilities they want in the ordinary way through the banks. Any man who is in the hotel business, and has made a success of it, has not had to go elsewhere for his backing. There is the danger, however, that we may have all kinds and conditions of people going to the board, simply because this is a semi-State institution, looking for money for nothing on the plea that they are helping in some way the tourist traffic in their particular area.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I have to say beyond again emphasising that I am sorry the Minister did not see fit to adopt the recommendations <Col N="2072" /> of the Commission on Vocational Organisation on this matter, and to set up a development board which would be composed largely of people who had practical experience in the hotel business. It would, of course, only be right to couple with such personnel representatives of the Minister on the board. I feel that at present the board is weighted entirely the other way.  So far as I know, there is no member of the board who has had any training or experience in the hotel business.  That is an extraordinary commentary on the position which we are now creating: that we are setting up a board which is to go into the hotel business, and is to encourage and develop tourist traffic, and yet that we have not on that board one member who has had experience of the business.  I think that if the Minister is wise he will rectify that position and alter the personnel of the board so as to ensure that people who are making their living directly out of the tourist traffic will have full and proper representation on the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is an amending Bill, with the one function of enlarging the financial provisions of the Principal Act, there is not very much scope for discussion on it.  The Bill does, however, afford the House an opportunity of reviewing the activities of the Tourist Board over the period of its existence, and of making recommendations for the future development of the tourist trade.  It think it is unfortunate that the Bill has been introduced at this stage for the reason that, during the emergency, there was not much done by the Tourist Board in the way of development.  In that situation, it is difficult for the House to decide definitely whether the work of the board has been proceeding on the right lines or not.  Up to the present, there has not been very much activity on the part of the board, and as I say it is difficult for Deputies to judge whether the board's work has been carried out efficiently or otherwise.  I think the House will agree that some machinery, such as that provided in the Principal Act, is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was necessary to have some system of registration of hotels and <Col N="2073" /> other catering establishments so as to have some definite standard.  That was overdue.  It is also necessary to provide for development work in tourist areas.  There is certain development work which private enterprise is not in a position to undertake.  The provision of parks, bathing facilities and so on, can rarely be undertaken on a large scale by private enterprise, and local authorities often are not in a position or not properly constituted to undertake them.  Therefore, on the main principle, there was need for such a body as is provided in the Principal Act and it is rather soon for this House to decide definitely whether or not the board has failed in its activities up to the present.</P>
    <P>The amendment which has been tabled has served a useful purpose in so far as it indicated to the Minister the type of information which the proposers of the amendment were anxious to obtain.  The Minister made a reasonable attempt to meet the amendment in as far as providing information is concerned. He stated a considerable number of facts in regard to the work of the Tourist Board up to the present and in regard to their proposals for the future.  I was interested in the number of development schemes in regard to which preliminary investigations have been carried out.  I was disappointed that County Wicklow was not included in the schemes which have been prepared although the Minister did indicate that it is proposed to embark upon considerable expenditure in regard to Arklow.  What is the order of priority in the provision of development schemes in respect of the various areas?  Assuming that development schemes are of benefit to the areas concerned, I should imagine there is a demand from the various areas that the board should undertake work of development and I am anxious to know how the board decide as between the claims of the various districts and what standards or what qualifications are required in order to satisfy the board that a scheme should be introduced.</P>
    <P>As far as development and improvement are concerned, the House will agree that such work is desirable and, also, that it is desirable that it should <Col N="2074" /> be undertaken by the board but, when there is a board intervening in work which can be carried on by private enterprise as, for instance, the management of hotels and such establishments, one is inclined to question the wisdom of that course.  It is generally agreed that wherever private enterprise can be successful the State should not intervene. There may be areas, and I am open to conviction that there are, where it is necessary that the State should intervene in order to provide hotel accommodation.  There may perhaps be two types of hotel accommodation which private enterprise cannot readily provide, very expensive or luxurious accommodation desired by foreign tourists and, perhaps, very cheap accommodation for workers in our cities and large towns for whom holidays are provided.  It may be that in those two extremes the State through the Tourist Board, may be able to provide the most suitable type of accommodation. The greatest care should be exercised to avoid intervening and competing where private enterprise can deliver the goods.  That is particularly necessary by reason of the fact that the Tourist Board acts as a supervisory body, regulating the affairs of privately owned hotels, and it seems somewhat irregular and unjust that a body which regulates the affairs of private hotels should also compete with them in a rival capacity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that it is intended to provide for very considerable expenditure on tourist development in Arklow.  There is no doubt that in that district there is an urgent and long-felt need for a general improvement.  It is certainly capable of development and, if improved, will certainly be one of the best holiday resorts on the eastern seacoast.  As far as hotel accommodation is concerned, private enterprise in that district would be quite capable of providing all that is required.  There is scarcely any provincial town which has a larger number of enterprising business people than there are in Arklow.  I am interested to know if it is proposed to do anything in regard to the Liffey Reservoir at Poulaphouca.  A vast new lake has been created there which is a great national asset in the matter of <Col N="2075" /> the provision of electricity and water supply and which would also be capable of development as an excellent tourist centre.  I am not suggesting that such a place could ever be a bathing resort, it might possibly be used for boating, although I am not so sure of that, but I think it is a good fishing centre and, with improved facilities, could be a first-class tourist resort, being situated not too far from the city.  Again, the question of priority arises and I am anxious to know in regard to what standards the board decide whether a particular area should be developed or not.</P>
    <P>With regard to loans for hotel keepers it is difficult to know why there should be a special necessity for such loans.  So far as most businesses are concerned, the banks provide very adequate credit facilities.  However, there may be some special case for hotel keepers.  I would, however, be interested to know what rate of interest it is proposed to charge on the loans provided.  Will they be given at a higher or at a lower rate than those provided by the banks?  I would also require some information as to the existing system of recruitment of employees by the board.  Will it be by open competitive examination?  I think that is the most desirable method. At the present time, we have more and more State-owned public boards being set up.  These boards provide a very considerable amount of employment and it is essential that there should be no favouritism in regard to the recruitment of employees for such bodies, any more than in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I think demands consideration is the training of staffs engaged in the various hotels and catering establishments and in holiday resorts generally.  I am aware that facilities are being provided in our schools, particularly in our vocational schools, for the training of people who will be employed in hotels.  I think there should be some definite, recognised certificate of merit which could be obtained by students and which would give them a definite standing in the profession whatever particular branch it may be, whether as chefs or <Col N="2076" /> other employees in hotels.  There should be some definite standard fixed through our educational establishments to give these employees at least a definite standard.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the tourist industry is one which must be developed. There can be no question of its being a burden on the community or something which is nationally undesirable. The stress of modern employment requires that workers should have a certain amount of recreation and, so far as possible, it is essential that we should be able to provide within this country recreation for our people instead of having them going abroad to seek recreation.  In addition to that, it ought to be and will be a source of national revenue to attract to this country in normal times tourists from other lands.  As the Minister pointed out, it is better to dispose of our surplus food supplies as cooked meals rather than shipping them as foodstuffs to other countries.  We have not yet, I think, reached the stage where it is undesirable to export anything.  Since we have to export, and food is the main commodity which we have for export, I think it is better to export it in the most profitable manner, and that is, by bringing tourists into this country and letting them spend their money here.</P>
    <P>I think the House will be prepared to provide the additional sum which is required.  The Minister has outlined schemes which it is intended to undertake. He has informed the House that the amount of money already provided has been earmarked for special schemes and that additional money is required for further development.  Unless the House can be convinced of either of two things, (1)  that the board has failed completely in its duty, or (2) that tourist development is unnecessary and undesirable, I think the House will be prepared to vote for this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two points to which I want to advert. I gathered from the Minister's statement that the Tourist Board are still seriously interested in the question of development in Dollymount.  My understanding of the position is not exactly in line with that view.  The <Col N="2077" /> Tourist Board were originally interested in the development of the Bull Island at Dollymount and had, I understand, a considerable amount of negotiation with the officials of the city council.  But the corporation, having examined the whole position, decided, for a variety of reasons, that they would undertake the development themselves.  Plans, in fact, were drawn up for a ring road, making connection with the coast road by means of a bridge at the northern end of the island.  Further developments of an extensive character are in view, as far as the development of the island is concerned, with the purpose of ensuring that the citizens of Dublin can have a place of recreation and enjoyment.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make in connection with that is, that originally the board decided, apparently, that they would expend a considerable sum of money on the development of that island.  In view of the fact that the corporation are now undertaking work which is practically on the same lines and certainly with the same object, I should like to ask the Minister if the funds of the board will be available, by means of a substantial grant to the municipality, for the carrying out of that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board never spends money on a project of that kind unless it can see the prospect of getting its money back with profit.  There is no question of a grant.  The board might acquire a property and then develop it and then sell the property, or sell sites on the property, to get its money back, but it would have to get its money back.</P>

      <P>I grant you that it will be, in certain respects, of a revenue-bearing character.  In that respect, I understand the board will be interested.  I wanted to get the point cleared up because it will be of interest to the committee engaged in that work.  The second point that I want to refer to is that made by Deputy Coogan.  I should like to ascertain <Col N="2078" /> what is the method of approach by the board towards the development of one area against another.  I have in mind the health resorts of County Clare, and, as is well known, the three outstanding health resorts there are Kilkee, Lisdoonvarna and Lahinch.  As described by the Minister to-day, development has taken place in connection with Lisdoonvarna and it is proposed to undertake development work in connection with Kilkee.  I happen to have some knowledge of the district, and, so far as I know, no survey has been made in respect of Lahinch.  Lahinch has delightful natural amenities, but, because of neglect for a number of years, the place is gradually assuming an atmosphere of decay.  It is a pity that that should be so, because it is a delightful health resort, and there are periods during the season when Kilkee is overcrowded and the natural relief for tourists in the country is obviously Lahinch, but the accommodation there is grossly inadequate.  The residents would like to see the board taking up development work there and are somewhat disappointed that positive steps in that direction have not been taken.  That brings me to the point of asking what precisely is the basis of the board's approach in respect of one centre as against another? I should like the Minister to tell us.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I am very interested in this amending Bill.  It all depends on how the board will run these hotels and how the various other interests will look after their side of the picture, because if the board does its work in the running of these hotels well and sets an example, it may, in the long run, tend to improve the quality of Irish hotels.  I have been trying to picture myself as a tourist coming to Ireland.  The first points which such a tourist must consider are how he is to get to Ireland, can he get information on the subject and are the travel facilities to the country and in the country adequate.  I am aware that the Minister is very interested in this subject, but I keep coming back to the King Charles's head of Rineanna.  Rineanna <Col N="2079" /> is a very fine place, very well run, but extremely difficult to get out of and extremely difficult to get into.</P>
      <P>The tourist is up against the difficulty that the transatlantic air companies like to have their planes filled with people from Cairo to New York, and to get off at Rineanna is simple enough, but the person who gets off there wants to feel that he stands more than a reasonable chance of getting a seat for the continuation of his journey. That is the difficulty every tourist is up against and I have found myself up against that difficulty quite recently in relation to making a journey from Rineanna.</P>
      <P>The other difficulty with regard to Rineanna is the lack of accommodation on the spot.  I am not quite sure if the Minister said it is proposed to build a hotel at Rineanna, and I should like to ask him whether the board or the Government definitely intend to build a hotel there, because such a hotel is very necessary.  Planes arrive and depart at all hours of the day and night, and if there is a hotel available, a person getting off a plane at 3 o'clock in the morning will certainly avail of it.  At present&mdash;I presume owing to petrol difficulties&mdash;it is very hard for a person who has got off a plane to get a bus from Rineanna.  These are temporary difficulties and I imagine they are being dealt with.  I mention them merely to show that if we want to build up a tourist trade with the outside world, the ease with which the intending tourist can get into Ireland and get out of it again is of paramount importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has considered going on a continental holiday, even in peacetime, knows that very often the deciding factors in relation to going to a certain place or certain country are the facilities for getting to it.  I am aware that plans are being made for making Dublin a terminal port and for establishing direct communication with the Continent by air and I regard that as a highly important point from the point of view of facilitating the nationals of this country who wish to go abroad on business or pleasure and also from the point of view of the intending tourist coming here.  It is always difficult to get on to a plane at any intermediate point <Col N="2080" /> on its voyage.  That is a difficulty which I think will always exist in connection with aviation.</P>
    <P>Aviation at present is the cheapest form of travel which any person can undertake.  Whether that position will continue in the future, I do not know, but at present, owing to high prices in all countries for hotel accommodation and meals and the uncertainties of land travel generally, travel by air has become as cheap as travel by train, and a great deal easier and more comfortable. I mention that point lest the House should think I am speaking entirely from the point of view of the wealthy visitor arriving by plane.  We are at the dawn of an era in which travel by air will be the cheapest and easiest form of travel for the ordinary citizen and it is from that point of view that I mention the matter of air travel.  With regard to our hotels, we have, like many other countries, good hotels, indifferent hotels and, before the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; was taken from them, I suppose we had bad hotels, and we want to see the Tourist Board doing everything it can to improve our hotel position.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,640 be <Col N="2081" /> granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1947, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Gaeltacht Services, including Housing Grants and the purchase and sale of Homespuns.</P>
    <P>Tá £2,680 níos mó ná mar a hiarradh anuraidh á iarraidh sa mheastachán so.  Is mó de £4,303 an caiteachas iomlán a bhfuil soláthar á dhéanamh dó agus is mó de £21,623 na fáltais a meastar a gheofar.  Ní thaspánann an meastachán aon laghdaithe taobh amuigh de na mírchinn a bhaineas le Sníomhachán agus Bréidín Baile.</P>
    <P>Tá £1,100 de mhéadú ar chostas an Cheann-Ionaid, agus sé is mó faoi ndear é sin ná costas breise an bhónais agus gnáth bhreisithe ar thuarastail.  Tá sa tsoláthar tuairim is £3,400 a bhaineas le foirinn atá ar iasacht ag Ranna eile Rialtais.</P>
    <P>Tá £1,886 de mhéadú ar thuarastail na dTionnscal Tuaithe faoi mhírcheann D (1) toisc soláthar a bheith á dhéanamh do phostanna mar Mhaoirseoirí Bréidín Baile agus mar Mhaor Cumrathóra.  Baineann na méadaithe beaga faoi mhírchinn D (2) agus D (3) le costas breise an bhónais éigeandála.</P>
    <P>Tá £100 de mhéadú sa tsoláthar do chostais taistil faoi mhírcheann D (4). Sé faoi ndear an méadú de £3,410 faoi mhírcheann D (5) ná soláthar atá á dhéanamh chun maisíní nua agus áiseanna do mhaisíní chur ar fáil don Tionnscail Cniotála.  Níl ach roinnt bheag á háireamh sa tsoláthar don ghléasra a bheas ag teastáil do na planndaí sníomhacháin agus snasála i gCill Chártha.  Loirgeofar tuille soláthair dóibh más gá é.  Ní rabhmar in ann na maisíní sa Tionnscal Cniotála a choimeád i gcóir cheart le linn an chogaidh agus sin é faoi ndear an soláthar bheith chomh mór anois.</P>
    <P>Soláthraítear abhair do na Tionnscail Tuaithe faoi na mírchinn D (6), D (8), D (9) agus D (11).  Taspánann na mírchinn sin le chéile go bhfuil £13,175 de mhéadú sa tsoláthar atá á dhéanamh.  Tá méadaithe ar gach <Col N="2082" /> mírcheann taobh amuigh den mhírcheann do Shníomhachán, agus sé faoi ndear an laghdú Shníomhachán ná athmheas a deineadh ar chumas na bplanndaí a bheidh á n-oibriú.</P>
    <P>Tá £8,184 de laghdú sa tsoláthar do Bhréidín Baile faoi mhírcheann D. 10. Nílimid ag soláthar don oiread slat i mbliana agus dar soláthraíodh anuraidh agus sin é faoi ndear an laghdú. Táimid ag cur chun an tionnscal seo a fheabhsú anois agus measadh nár mhiste bheith ag brath air go dtiocfadh laghdú éigin ar an dtáirgeacht ag féachaint don bhfeabhsú sin agus do chúrsaí an mhargaidh.  Táimid ag cur carda tuaithe in Ard an Rátha d'fhonn rollaí chardálta a chur ar fáil do na sníomhadóirí.  Fostófar Maoirseoirí chun cuairteanna a thabhairt ar no sníomhadóirí agus ar na fíodóirí le linn dóibh bheith ag obair faoi scéim na Roinne ach iocfar as an mbréidín a déanfar fé mar a deineadh go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú beag faoi mhírcheann E. 1 sa tsoláthar do thuarastail na foirne tuaithe a bhaineas leis na Tionnscail Mara toisc costais breise an bhónais éigeandála.  Tá soláthar a dhéanamh do mhéadú beag faoi mhírcheann E. 2 do chostais taistil na foirne sin.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag soláthar £7,450 níos mó faoi mhírcheann E. 3 don Tionnscal Ceilpe agus Feamna ach tabharfar faoi ndeara go mbaineann £5,425 den mhéadú sin le costas iompair.  Níor cuireadh aon tsoláthar isteach anuraidh i gcóir costais iompair na Ceilpe ná costais farthachta na slat mara. Níorbh fholáir ámh, faoi shocraithe na bliana seo, soláthar a dhéanamh dá leithéid, ach méadú dá réir a bheith ar na Leithreasaí-i-gCabhair.  Tá soláthar á dhéanamh i mbliana don mhéid chéanna ceilpe a ndearnadh soláthar di anuraidh .i. míle tonna. Tá soláthraithe á ndéanamh do thrí mhile tona slata mara i mbliana i gcoinne an dá mhíle tonna a ndearnadh soláthar dóibh anuraidh.  Níl sa tsoláthar don bhFeamain ach comhartha i gcoinne an sé céad tonna a ndearnadh soláthar dóibh anuraidh. Tuigfear, áfach, go ndéanfar an méid is féidir de na habhair go léir a cheannach do réir mar bheidh éileamh <Col N="2083" /> orthu.  Ceannaíodh tuairim is ocht gcéad tonna ceilpe agus míle agus cúig chead tonna slata mara anuraidh. Táthar ag leanúint i mbliana arís den nós imeachta a cuireadh i bhfeidhm maidir le ceannach na ceilpe, toise gur mar sin amháin is féidir féachaint chuige go mbeidh togha na ceilpe ar fáil mar abhar leasacháin.</P>
    <P>Tá £535 de mhéadú sa tsoláthar faoi mhírcheann E (4) don Tionnscal Cairrgíne. Ní déantar soláthar anseo ach don chairrgín a chuireann an Roinn ar an margadh i bpaicáidí mar abhar bídh.  Is oth liom a rá nach mór an glaodhach atá ar na paicáidí sin le tamall anuas agus níltear ag déanamh soláthair ach don mhéid a meastar a bheidh ag teastáil don mhargadh.  Is sa mhargadh thar lear a díoltar an chuid is mó den ghnáth-chairrgín agus déantear freastal ar an margadh sin trí ghnóluchta sa tír seo do cheannach agus d'onnmhuiríú na cairrgíne.  Ní leanfar i mbliana den nós imeachta a bhí i bhfeidhm anuraidh ar chúrsaí cairrgíne agus, mar sin, is ar na bainteoirí agus ar an lucht deighleála a bhrathfaidh sé caighdeán agus cáil chairrgín na tíre seo a choimeád agus a chosaint.</P>
    <P>Tá £1,212 de mhéadú sa tsoláthar faoi mhírcheann F (1) do thuarastail an Taisc-Ionaid.  Sé is mó faoi ndear é sin ná méadú ar líon na foirne sna stórlanna maraon le costas breise an bhónais éigeandála.  Tá méadú de £500 ar an soláthar d'Fhógránacht faoi mhírcheann F (2) agus tá méadú beag de £155 faoi F (3) d'Iolchostais an Taisc-Ionaid.</P>
    <P>Níl aon difríocht sa tsoláthar faoi mhírcheann G do Sheirbhísí Ilghnéitheacha. Níl sna méideanna atá á soláthar faoi na mionranna ach comharthaí taobh amuigh den mhéid faoi mhionroinn (5) a bhaineas leis an Séirbhís Báid idir Oileán Cléire agus Dún na Séad i gContae Chorcaighe.</P>
    <P>Baineann an méadú beag faoi mhírcheann H (1) le costas breise an bhónais éigeandála ar thuarastail na fóirne tuaithe atá i mbun cúrsaí tógála.  Tá méadú beag ar an soláthar faoi mhírcheann H (2) do chostais taistil na foirne tuaithe sin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> Tá £2,250 de mhéadú sa tsoláthar faoi mhírcheann H (3) do dheontais faoi Achta na dTithe (Gaeltacht). Méadaíodh an soláthar toise go bhfuil súil le méadú do dhul ar an obair a bheas á dhéanamh ar thithe amach anseo.  Níor deineadh aon athrú sa tsoláthar faoi mhírcheann H (4) do chostas deisiucháin na dtithe comhnaithe a ligtear ar chíos d'oidí scoile sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá mór-mhéid na bhfáltas a ndéantar soláthar dóibh faoi na mionranna (1) go dtí (3) de mhírcheann i bunaithe ar an soláthar a deineadh, ar thaobh an chaiteachais, d'abhair agus ceannacháin. Meastar, dá réir sin, go mbaileófar tuairim is £275,000 i mbliana as na tionnscail tuaithe go léir.  Is méadú de thúairim is £21,300 é sin ar an méid a measadh a baileófaí anuraidh.  Meastar gur mó de £6,200 a n-íocfar amach as na fáltais i mbliana mar pháigh oibre agus coimisiún díolacháin. Fágann san gur tuairim is £15,100 a meastar a bheidh de mhéadú sna Leithreasaí-i-gCabhair do na Tionnscail Tuaithe.  Meastar gur tuairim is £63,000 a híocfar mar pháigh oibre i mbliana i gcoinne tuairim is £59,000 anuraidh; £26,400 sa bhliain 1939; agus £9,800 sa bhliain 1935.</P>
    <P>Tá £6,337 de mhéadú sa mhéid a meastar a gheofar as Ceilp agus Feamain a dhíol ach baineann an chuid is mó den mhéadú sin leis an gcostas iompair a bheas le bailiú sa praghas díolacháin.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú beag ar an méid a meastar a gheofar as Cairrgín a dhíol i bpaicáidí mar abhar bídh.  Mar adúrt agus mé ag cur síos ar an mírcheann E (4) ní mór an glaodhach atá ar na paicáidí sin le tamall anuas.</P>
    <P>Baineann na mionranna eile den mhírcheann le hAisíoca ar Iasachta Tionnscail, le Cíosa ar Thithe Comhnaithe d'Oidí Scoile sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht agus le Fáltais Ilghnáitheacha. Tá laghdú ar an méid a meastar a gheofar i mbliana ó na hIasachtaí Tionnscail toisc an chuid is mó díobh a bheith glanta.</P>
    <P>Mar bhuille scoir, ba mhaith liom a rá nach mór a thuigsint nach féidir tábhacht na hoibre atá á déanamh faoin meastachán seo do mhuintir na <Col N="2085" /> Gaeltachta a mheas do réir an méid bheag atá á iarraidh as chiste an Stáit. Taobh amuigh den pháigh oibre a híoctar amach sa Ghaeltacht trí na Tionnscail Tuaithe, íoctar tuairim is an méid chéanna arís trí thuarastail na ndaoine eile atá ar fostú sa Ghaeltacht; trí bhréidín baile, móin agus ceilp agus feamain a cheannach;; agus trí dheontais faoi Achta na dTithe (Gaeltacht).</P>

      <P>Níl sé i bhfad ó bhí díospóireacht againn san Dáil ar staid na Gaeltachta agus dúradh a lán ar an cheist achrannach seo ar an ócáid sin.  Thrácht na cainteoirí ar an imirce a bhí ag bánadh na Gaeltachta; ar shlí-bheatha na ndaoine; ar a dteangaidh dhúchais agus na seoda eile a bhí ina gcúram agus an neamhshuim a bhí acu iontu. Dúradh gurb é an Ghaeltacht an ball ba luachmhaire de náisiún na hÉireann.  Rinneadh mion-scrúdú ar an scéal go léir agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh maitheas dá bharr.  'Sé mo bharúil féin gur ceist eacnamaíochta ó thús go deireadh ceist chaomhanta na Gaeltachta.  Sin an fáth ar mhaith liom beagán a rá ar an Mheastachán seo nó baineann sé go dlúth le slí bheatha na ndaoine seo.</P>
      <P>Tá fhios againn go léir nach dtig leo slí bheatha a bhaint amach ar na screabáin bheaga talaimh atá acu. Muirín ar bith atá i muinín an tailimh amháin sna ceantair bhochta seo níl i ndán dóibh ach an ganntanas faoi ocras, anás agus an uile chruatan. Ní thig linn a bheith ag éagaoin orthu faoin imirce.  'Sé Dia É fhéin a d'fhág caoi ag an chuid ba láidre acu imeacht go tíortha eile le cuidiú lena muintir a d'fhan sa bhaile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba é an chéad tárrtháil a tugadh ar na daoine bochta seo an uair a cuireadh iad faoi chúram an C.D.B. tá leith-chéad bliain ó shoin.  Rinne an sean-Bhord sin miorúiltí sa Ghaeltacht agus ní thig dearmad a dhéanamh choíche de na fir a bhí ar an Bhord sin, fir nár spáráil iad fhéin le feabhas a chur ar shaol mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Cheannaigh siad an talamh ó na tiarnaí tailimh agus thug locáiste do na tionónta.  Thóg siad tithe agus boithigh dóibh.  Rinne siad bealaigh mhóra fríd na sléibhte agus <Col N="2086" /> rinne siad céibheanna chois cladaigh. Chuir siad tionscail ar bun agus chuir siad feabhas ar na sean-tionscail a bhí acu.  Thug siad bádaí, líonta agus gléas iascaireachta do na hiascairí agus d'fhág bun mhaith ar an iascaireacht fá chóstaí an iarthair.  Labhraim mar dhuine a chonnaic obair an Bhuird seo agus ní thig liom ach an moladh atá tuillte acu a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Acht nuair a tharraing ár Rialtas féin obair an Bhuird seo orthu, bhí muid ag dréim le níos mó uathu. Cuireadh Coimisiún ar bun agus moladh siúd agus seo a dhéanamh. D'réir a chéile, le fiche bliain táthar a chur na molta sin i ngníomh.  Tá muid ag dul ar aghaidh go mall, righin, fadálach ar nós na seilide agus gach bliain atá ag dul tharainn tá an Gael agus an Ghaeilge ag sleamhnú ón Ghaeltacht.  An uile bhliain thig Meastacháin mar seo roimh an Dáil do Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta ach ní fheicim go bhfuil dul chun cinn mór déanta.  Taobh amuigh de chupla ceantar sa Ghaeltacht níl muid ach ag útamáil leis an obair seo.  Agus deirtear linn gur obair mhór náisiúnta Gaeil na Gaeltachta a dhaingniú i na ndúiche féin.  Admhaím go bhfuil oifigí na Roinne ar a ndícheall ach d'réir mar chémse an obair tá Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta cúnailte creapailte ag an Poinn Airgeadais.  Níor chreapail siad na hoifigí a chóirigh Rinn Eanaigh do na heitealláin.  Bhí an Roinn Airgeadais fial flaithiúil leo sin agus chuaigh an obair chun cinn gan aon mhoill.  Ach ní rabh an dlúthas nó an fiúntas sin le scéimeanna sa Ghaeltacht. Agus deirtear linn gurb í an Ghaeltacht an ball is luachmhaire de náisiún na hÉireann.  Is feasach dom fhéin go bhfuil muileann olla ar an bealach le deich mbliana i nGaeltacht Tír Chonaill.  D'féadfadh an muileann sin a bheith faoi lán-seoil roimh an chogadh acht cuireadh moill air ó bhliain 30 bliain.  Cailleadh na mílte punt ar siocair an neamairt sin mar nach rabh snáth olla le fáil sa tír ar feadh an chogaidh.  Agus níl an muileann sin críochnaithe go fóill agus d'réir chosúlachta beidh cogadh eile ann sul a mbeidh sé críochnaithe.  Dá mbeadh <Col N="2087" /> port Rinn Eannaigh deich mbliana ar an bhealach caidé an callán a thógfaí?</P>
    <P>Bhí lúcháir mhór orm fheiceál ar na páipéir an lá fá dheireadh go bhfuil comhlacht ar tí monarcha do bhréagáin luaidhe a chur ar bun i nGaeltacht Chonamara.  Tá súil agam nach ndéanfaidh siad aithris ar an Roinn Airgeadais ach go rachaidh siad ar aghaidh go tapaidh leis an mhonarchain seo.  Sin an spiorad a bheir misneach agus uchtach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Bheir sin in mo cuimhne tionscal ba chóir a bheith ar bun againn i dTír Chonaill.  Ba cheart iomlán-úsáide a dhéanamh de na bun-ábhar atá againn sa Ghaeltacht. Níl sárú ar ghaineamh Mhucaise mar ábhar ghloine agus táthar a thabhairt an ghaineamh sin rith an bhealaigh as Gaeltacht Thír Chonaill go Baile Átha Cliath.  Nach sa Ghaeltacht ba chóir iomlan an tionscail sin a bheith bunaithe ó thárla gurb ann atá an príomh-ábhar, an ghaineamh speisialta seo.  Is maith liom cluinstin go bhfuil Comhaltas Uladh ag cur suirbhéireachta ar bun ar na hábhair atá sa Ghaeltacht leis an inntinn seo.</P>
    <P>Níl bun-ábhar sa Ghaeltacht chomh fairsing leis an olainn.  Tá na sléibhte ann le hinnilt a thabhairt do na caoirigh.  Níl muintir na sliabh gan moltraí olla ó cheann go ceann na bliana.  Tá na sníomhnóirí agus na fídóirí i ngach baile agus tá céird na holla leo ó dhúchas.  Mar sin do ba cheart don Roinn claonadh leis an seantionscal seo.  Tá na mílte muiríneacha ag obair aige.  Rinne siad na milliún slat báinín baile don tír ar feadh an chogaidh nuair nach raibh fáil ar éadach ar bith eile.  Táim ag iarraidh ar an Roinn aire speisialta a thabhairt don tionscail seo, feabhas a chur ar an éadach más féidir é agus margadh a fháil dó sa bhaile agus i gcéin.  Agus impím ar an Roinn Airgeadais gan a bheith chomh doicheallach ceachartha nuair atá siad ag tabhairt deontais nó sínteanais do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Gaeltacht ought to be the most precious possession of our people, because in it is the only, and very slender, chance now of preserving <Col N="2088" /> Irish as a living language.  If the language ceases to be spoken by those who have it ón chliabháin in the Gaeltacht, it does not matter very much what we may do in the schools; it will be a dead language, and we all know that.  The plain fact is that, in the 25 years since this State was founded, the Gaeltacht has been reduced by nearly a half, and is shrinking rapidly.  The plain fact is that, in each succeeding generation born in the Gaeltacht, a larger and larger percentage of the young people want to get out.  I know it pretty well &mdash;the Donegal Gaeltacht in any case, and the Connacht Gaeltacht&mdash;and I think it is true to say what drives the young people out of it is their inability to secure work in the Gaeltacht which would provide them with a reasonable standard of living.</P>
      <P>Some 30 or 40 years ago, these places were so remote that the people living in them had no intimate contact with the kind of standard of living that people in the Galltacht of this country and in Great Britain ordinarily enjoy and so they were prepared to work terribly hard and live at a very low standard and be content, so long as they were able to scrape three meals a day and maintain a reasonably respectable appearance, based on the very modest resources of their own neighbourhood.  The fact is that the various modern methods of communication have brought the rest of the world into such close contact with them that they are no longer prepared to accept that, and they are going as quickly as they can to get, outside the Gaeltacht, that standard of living which appeals to most people and, going outside the Gaeltacht, they change their vernacular from Irish to English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they stay away out of the Gaeltacht altogether, that means so many Irish speakers lost to the country.  If they come back to the Gaeltacht, in the vast majority of cases, using English as their vernacular, they gradually destroy one small section of the Fior-Ghaeltacht and change it, at best, into a little Breac-Ghaeltacht of its own and, at worst, into an area where Irish is not spoken at all.  Frankly, I think it is too late to do anything about it but still, with that apprehension in my mind, I will make a suggestion, even <Col N="2089" /> though I have little hope of success.</P>
    <P>The only effort that will do any good is to establish, in the existing Gaeltacht areas, what remains of them, some form of occupation and, without any regard at all to economic considerations, stipulate that those who get employment in them will have a certain standard of wages, sufficient, together with the amenity of living at home, to rival the attractions of employment in Dublin, Cork, Birmingham, Manchester or, for those from Donegal, in Glasgow and its environs.  I know a good many of the Donegal people who have gone to Glasgow and, when I go down to places like Port Glasgow and meet Irish people living there, it is to me a source of bewilderment what brings them there, what economic considerations could persuade them to exchange West Donegal for Port Glasgow.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cafferky says &ldquo;bread and butter&rdquo;.  Deputy Cafferky ought to know.  Damn the much bread and butter they got in Port Glasgow when they were on the dole there and, when it suited the employers in the shipyards of Port Glasgow to throw them on the dole, they had no delicacy of feeling about doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose they thought they did, but, on the balance, those who have known hardships in the Gaeltacht probably did better in the long run than those who degenerated into the pale, emaciated, miserable creatures who lived for seven or eight years on the dole in Port Glasgow and places like that.  Deputy Cafferky, like myself, was born in the Breac-Ghaeltacht and grew up amongst people who, in my childhood, whatever about his, were all Irish speakers&mdash;the Kilmovee area of County Mayo.  When he says &ldquo;bread and butter&rdquo; he is probably saying in his own way what I am saying in another way.  They were drawn into those places like Port Glasgow because they felt they would get more luxury there than in the Gaeltacht.  I think they may be wrong, but they believe <Col N="2090" /> there is more money to be got in big centres of employment, such as the industrial cities of Great Britain.  I believe if there were employment centres established in the Gaeltacht which paid a minimum wage it is possible, though by no means certain, that a great many of them would never go away at all.</P>
      <P>I am a convinced free trader, but I do not believe in restrictive practices in industry from the purely economic point of view, and it may sound inconsistent for me to advocate this in regard to the Gaeltacht, but consistency is the bugbear of mediocre minds. In the Gaeltacht we are thinking, not only of economic considerations, but of the preservation of a very precious and imponderable asset, an asset that cannot be valued in terms of money because, were we to lose it, the expenditure of money would never buy it back again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is practicable to establish the kind of industry I have in mind and I am led to that conviction by a personal experience.  Seventy years ago, in the parish of Foxford, the problem arose of employing the people, giving them a source of revenue other than they could hope to extract from their miserable holdings.  The reasons making that course necessary and urgent were not quite the same as those affecting the Gaeltacht at the present time, but they were there.  One of the ladies was a relative of mine.  Neither of them had any industrial experience, but they made up their minds that something must be done, and against the advice of all prudent advisers these two old ladies took a house that was at their disposal and started, of all things, with woollens, neither of them having the faintest notion how to spin, never mind how to weave.  Unfortunately for their enterprise Foxford Woollen Mills enjoyed no protection of any kind and the market was largely built up by these old ladies, pottering around themselves in the early stages to sell the produce of what is now a great industry.  It did achieve in Foxford the purpose for which it was set up.  It did provide an alternative source of income for the young girls of that area and prevented other people who provided that enterprise in a different <Col N="2091" /> way having any success in their nefarious purpose.</P>
    <P>I believe that example is the only method whereby we can provide in the Gaeltacht a counter attraction sufficient to deter those with Irish from leaving the Gaeltacht, and destroying that unique source by which the language may be made to live again.  An enterprise such as I have in mind would be one with two or three industrial processes, to supply commodities in demand here, the manufacture of which would employ a large number of men.  What these commodities would be is a matter we have to consider very carefully.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the labour content in the manufacture of artificial manure is.  Supposing that the labour content of that industry were satisfactory, and calculated to provide employment necessary for our purpose, I think we should estimate the level of wages that it would be necessary to pay to provide a fair counter attraction in the way of industrial employment in the Gaeltacht, and to pay that rate of wages.  We should then ascertain the true cost of the product produced by labour paid at that rate, and also ascertain a third thing, the price at which it might properly be sold to the section of the community that would use that product.  Supposing it was superphosphate of lime, having ascertained the rate of wages we proposed to pay, and on that basis having ascertained the true cost of superphosphate, we should then ascertain the world price, and not one penny more, and charge that price for the product to our farmers.  The difference between that price and the price of the product of our commodity would have to be made up by the Treasury, and voted by this House as expenditure, not on the production of artificial manure, but on the preservation of the Gaeltacht as a permanent and desirable part of the life of this country.</P>
    <P>I am as certain as I am standing here that, unless we can provide industries, we can make up our minds, if we do not shoulder such expenditure, that in the lifetime of many people here the Gaeltacht will disappear.  There is not <Col N="2092" /> a Deputy from that area who has not seen large areas of it disappear in his own lifetime.  One of the fruitful sources of the destruction of the Gaeltacht has been the preparatory colleges. Wherever they have, instead of raising the children&mdash;I draw distinction between those run by religious communities and the colleges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suppose there is none for the promotion of industry.  In the preparatory colleges we believed we could send down large groups of English-speaking people, and by getting them to live in the centre of the Gaeltacht, make them into Irish speakers. What actually happened was that instead of making them Irish speakers they made the Irish speakers into English speakers.  Look at Tourmakeady. Twenty years ago one-fifth, or more likely one-third of the people there, would have some difficulty in carrying on a practical conversation in English.  Their natural vernacular was Irish.  Naturally if one went to live with them one would have to learn Irish if one wanted to stay there for a time.  Ask any of the people where English came from, and they will tell you it was from the preparatory colleges.  I know that there are people of goodwill who imagine, and who allow themselves to be persuaded, because they hear nothing but Irish spoken in and about institutions of that kind, that all the occupants continue to speak Irish when moving about the country.  I had abundant visual proof that nothing is further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair has been patient in allowing me to mention that matter.  I want to point out that were we to establish industries of the kind I have envisaged here, instantly we would be told that there was some defect in the fellows in the Gaeltacht, that they could not be got to work in a factory, and that some key men should be got in, in order to make the industries work.  If that is done it would only expedite the destruction of the Gaeltacht.  If you are going to establish industries in which anybody who speaks Irish will only be allowed to carry a hod, but that to get one of the good jobs you must come <Col N="2093" /> from Dublin or Cork, you simply convert the whole district into an area where English is spoken with a Cork accent.  We have got to face whatever difficulites there may be about lack of industrial experience in the people of the Gaeltacht until these industries are slowly and deliberately built up.  It is not going to be easy.  It may be very difficult indeed to establish firstly industries that will have a high labour content, and secondly, to find real Irish speakers competent to train personnel for these industries.  If we want to do it we can do it.  In regard to the Gaeltacht, I always feel that there has been very frequently a ready willingness to scatter money broadly, to dole it out to everybody, fistfuls of money.  But where there is a job to be done which would be useful, which is tedious, difficult, discouraging and calculated to excite criticism and disparagement, that has very rarely been embarked upon, although that is the only kind of job that is going to do valuable work for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>So much for that.  The other thing is this: that there has always been a great deal of potential employment in the Gaeltacht of a kind peculiarly suited to the social life which is an integral part of the Gaeltacht.  I have never seen that readiness on the part of the Department of Industry and Commerce to recognise it and encourage it in the way they ought.  I do not say that they have been antagonistic.  I do not think they have, but I think they have been rather impatient: that it was something that was beneath the dignity of mighty men who dealt in millions, who built mighty factories and talked to big shots in the industrial world.  As regards the production of knitted socks, has there been in the last three or four years when production was very urgent and necessary, any genuine attempt made to allot the bulk of that work to the knitters in Donegal, Connemara and Kerry?  I venture to say that there has not been.  Does this House know that knitting yarn coming into this country was seized, that all the good knitting yarn was sent to the factories, and that any woman who was making her living from knitting was told that she could use the article which was produced from domestic wool or do without: that her quota of botany yarn was <Col N="2094" /> so small that it was not worth the Department's while to segregate it.  It is true that it would have created a considerable administrative problem because the individual woman knitter in Donegal may, pre-war, have used 200 lbs. of knitting wool in the 12 months, while the total quota coming into the country was perhaps 5 per cent.  That would mean the giving to each individual woman 10 lbs., 7 lbs., or 3 lbs. of wool.</P>
    <P>The Department said that the administrative cost of doing that would be out of all proportion, and that what they would do was to take all the imported yarn and pass it over to the manufacturers who were using machines and then dole out the domestic yarn to the knitters.  If the Department were asked why it was giving all the imported yarn to the factories it would answer: &ldquo;Oh, well, the machines cannot use the domestic product; it breaks the machines,&rdquo; but they never went and asked the woman knitter if it broke her needles.  If they had done so she would have told them that it did.  She would also have told them that the people who buy hand-knitted garments are very much more choosey about a hand-finished article than the woman who pays 6/11 for a ready-made jumper to wear about the kitchen.</P>
    <P>The poor woman down the country whose market was for the choosiest customers in the country was told to knit garments out of the home produced wool, and that when it broke she could tie knots on it.  The Department might, with perfect propriety, have said that the bulk of this yarn coming in was small, but that the first charge upon it would be the Gaeltacht knitters, and that if anything was left over the factories could have it.  That was not done.  Then came the period when, with perfect propriety, we announced that we were prepared to send to suffering Europe a share of whatever we had, and amongst the commodities which we felt able to send was a quantity of knitted socks.  The prime consideration was to send clothing that would be warm.  How far have the services of the knitters in the Gaeltacht been availed of in that connection?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2095" /> I still get letters from women in West Donegal&mdash;I am sure that Deputy McFadden has received many more letters than I have to the same effect&mdash; complaining that they cannot get a supply of wool, although one can see wool selling at 1/9 in two-ounce hanks in Dublin.  One sees, too, that the factories have plenty of knitted goods.  One sees knitted socks being offered by the factories.  One hears of the factories being told to turn over their whole production for a given period to the production of knitted socks for export to the afflicted countries of Europe. Would it not have been legitimate if it was our purpose, our excellent purpose, to send knitted garments to those who are cold and destitute in Europe, to send a share of that wool to the women in the Gaeltacht and have it knitted to that end?  Would it have been wrong, or in any way dishonourable, if on that task we had sought no monetary profit, but had chosen to use the wool for the preservation of the Gaeltacht?  I feel that by losing money, by giving this product away, as well as gladly giving away whatever it cost, we could feel that we were recouping ourselves by providing those living in the Gaeltacht with an income that they otherwise might not have enjoyed.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that there are housing schemes for the Gaeltacht and that money is distributed in households there where the children talk Irish.  Some of those plans are good and some bad.  The only thing that is valuable is, what will keep the people in the Gaeltacht.  If I knew that I could succeed by doing so, I would spend almost any sum of money.  I would invest a great deal with the very slender hope that remains to us, and I still think it is worth a gamble.</P>
    <P>If we do not make that effort I am perfectly certain that there will be no need for a Gaeltacht Estimate, as such, in ten years' time.  The Gaeltacht that we know now can simply be incorporated with the congested areas.  For my part, I would save the Gaeltacht at any cost if I could.  If members of the House have any other alternative to offer I would be glad to hear of it.  If they have not, are they prepared to <Col N="2096" /> help in getting down now to do that which it will be too late to do in ten years' time?</P>

      <P>Is beag difir atá idir na Teachtaí a chuireann suim sa Ghaeltacht anseo, idir an Teachta Mac Pháidín agus mé féin. Bhíos buíoch de nuair a chuala uaidh go bhfuil áthas air féin agus a dheamhéinn ag muintir Chonamara nuair a bhí sé ag tagairt don rud a raibh scéal faoi ar an bpáipéar, sé sin, an mhonarcha atá le bheith ag déanamh na mbréagán luaidhe.  Níl ansin fós ach scéal, do réir chosúlachta, ach tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh sé i ngníomh.  Tá cuid mhaith den fhírinne sa méid adúirt an Teachta Diolúin i dtaobh sábháil na Gaeilge, ach tá baol ann don Ghaeilge sna cineálacha déantús agus monarchan is féidir a chur ar bun.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil sé mar príomh-dhualgas ar Fho-roinn Seirbhísí na Gaeltacht an Ghaeilge a shábháil, ach coinnítear é sin i gcuimhne i gcomhnaí nuair a bhíos tionscail á gcur ar bun.  Is minic a chuala mé ráite é: &ldquo;Má bhíonn an iomarca daoine le chéile i monarchain nó a leithéid, tagann an Béarla isteach do réir a chéile.&rdquo;  Chonnaic muid é sin i dtráchtáil taobh amuigh de mhonarchain. Cuirim i gcás anois na teagascóirí iascaireachta a chuir Bord na gCeanntar Cumhang amach chun forbairt a dhéanamh ar thionscal na scadán agus no ronnach.  Tá fhios agam áiteacha a bhfuil an Béarla anois níos láidre iontai ná an Ghaeilge de bharr an tionscail sin.  Cuireadh go dtí na háiteacha sin duine b'fhéidir a raibh ceárd na hiascaireachta ar fheabhas aige agus gan an Ghaeilge ar fheabhas aige.  San am chéanna, níl againn ach an dá rogha; slí bheatha a sholáthar san áit a bhfuil na Gaeilgeoirí, nó cuid mhaith acu a thabhairt amach as an áit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá mise ar an tuairim go mbeadh scéal na Gaeilge i bhfad níos fearr dá mbeadh cuid mhaith talamh ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus go mbeidís i ndon slí maireachtála a bhaint amach ar an talamh agus go mbeidís i ndon a muirighin a thógáil as an talmhaíocht. Sin é an saghas ruda is fábharaí <Col N="2097" /> don Ghaeilge.  Is fearr é ná aon déantús in aon mhonarcha.  Dúirt an tAire Tailte ar Mheastachán eile&mdash;nó thuigeas, ar aon chuma, as an méid adúirt sé&mdash;nach féidir an cheist a réiteach ar an dóigh sin.  Tá baint aige sin leis an Meastachán seo agus tá dualgas ar an Aire Tailte feidhm a bhaint as chuile shaghas cúnaimh agus cuidithe a thiocfas i gcabhair ar na daoine bochta seo.</P>
    <P>Aontaím leis an Teachta Mac Pháidín gurb iad na déantúis is feiliúnaí iad seo atá bunaithe ar bhunábhair na Gaeltachta fhéin ach, mar adúirt sé, níl mórán bun-ábhair tionscail le fáil ann.  Sé an chéad cheann acu agus an ceann is tábhachtaí&mdash;an olann&mdash;agus tá Fo-Roinn Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta ag déanamh a dhícheall leis an olann a oibriú ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.  Tá ábhar i gConamara ar nós an mharmair, ach tá cuid de na déantúis seo agus ní dóigh liom fhéin go bhfuil sé feiliúnach iad a chur faoi stiúradh na Roinne seo.  Tá cuid acu a gcaithfí na heolaithe a thabhairt isteach chun iad a chur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go n-éireodh leis an Roinn sa dea-obair atá beartuithe acu i gCasla.  Tá moladh mór ag dul do na daoine a bhfuil an obair seo á sheoladh acu agus tá súil agam go mbeidh barr feabhais ar an scéal.</P>
    <P>Is gearr ó fuair mé scéal i dtaobh na cúpóin is gá a thabhairt nuair a díoltar bréidín ag aon taspantás, cuir i gcás, an Taspántas Capailliní Conamara. Tá fhios agam nach é an tAire Tailte a riaras an rud seo, ach b'fhéidir go bhféadfadh sé a chur ina luí ar an Aire Tionscail agus Tráchtála beagán fábhair a thaspáint faoin cheist seo.  Ba cheart cead a thabhairt do lucht déanta an bhréidín é a dhíol ag an taspántas, nó ar ocáidí mar é, gan an trioblóid seo na gcúpón a chur ortha, chor ar bith.  Os ag cur síos dom ar an gceist sin, ba mhaith liom freisin a rá leis an Aire go bhfuil daoine ann ag déanamh cuid mhaith dá slí maireachtála as díol an bhréidín sna siopaí beaga.  Is mór an chailliúint dóibh féin agus do na daoine a bhí ag déanamh an bhréidín sin agus ní fheicim gurb aon mhaitheas é don Roinn Tionnscail agus <Col N="2098" /> Tráchtála an tionscal seo a stopadh. Tá súil agam go míneoidh an Roinn an scéal don Aire Tionnscail agus Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>Tá obair mhaith á dhéanamh sna hionaid chniotála agus ní fíor a rá go raibh aon cheal fostaíochta iontu le linn na héigeandála.  Tá sé ar eolas agam fhéin go ndearna an Roinn a seacht ndícheall leis an bhfostaíocht seo a choinneáil ar bun, mar bhí cuid mhaith á dhéanamh acu sar ar thosaigh an cogadh.  Tá fhios agam gur ceannuigh díol mór olann roimh an gcogadh agus mar gheall ar sin bhíodar indon tuille ionaid do chur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Ach is obair chruaidh ar chailín i agus dúradh liomsa gur ceart go ndéanfaí socrú le go mbeadh béile maith i lár an lae ag na cailíní seo. Ní bhíonn am acu lena ndóthain a ithe i lár an lae agus éiríonn cuid acu lag sul a mbíonn an lá thart.  Ba cheart, dá gcoimeadtaí an obair ar siúl níos fuide sa tráthnóna, más gá seal a thabhairt dóibh i lar an lae. Dúradh liomsa go bhfuil sláinte na gcáilíní seo i gcontúirt mar gheall air sin agus tá súil agam go mbreathnoidh an Roinn isteach sa scéal.</P>
    <P>Bhíodh scéim ag an bhFo-Roinn seo suim blianta ó shoin le seolta a cheannach d'fhíodóirí óga agus ba mhaith liom dá dtosófaí ar an scéim sin arís. Tá a fhios agam i dtaobh duine amháin ar a laghad&mdash;fear óg a scríobh chugam féin&mdash;nuair a bhí an cheárd foghlumtha aige ní raibh sé in ann an seol a fháil.  Tá sé ina chomhnaí in áit nach bhfuil aon fhíodóir ann agus dá mbeadh a leithéid sin de scéim ann chabhródh sé go mór le daoine óga mar sin.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist eile ann agus sin é ceist na mbád móna.  Tá, ar ndóigh, seantrádáil idir Chonamara, Oileáin Arann, agus Contae an Chláir, ach le blianta beaga anuas tá uimhir na mbád laghdaithe go mór agus tá cuid mhaith acu a dteastaionn deasú uathú, ach níl aon airgead ag na unaerí agus ní dóigh liom go gcuirfeadh sé mórán costais ar an Roinn beagán airgid a thabhairt do na daoine sin, agus b'fhéidir go dtúirfaidís iasachta do dhaoine a bhí ag gabháil don ghnó sin le fada le bád nua a cheannach.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon <Col N="2099" /> tuairimí nua agamsa ar an gceist seo na Gaeltachta.  Sean-cheist í atá ag éirí arís agus arís eile.  Mar aduirt mé i dtosach, ní fheicim go bhfuil le déanamh ach dhá rud-slí maireachtála a thabhairt ann nó na daoine a thabhairt amach as.  B'fhearr liomsa na déantúis a bhunú le go mairfeadh cuid mhaith acu astu.  Ní féidir a rá anois cé an áit in Éirinn is sabhálta atá an Ghaeilge.  Tá daoine ag ceapadh go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht níos sabhailta sna háiteacha iargúlta agus gurb é an iargcultacht a shabháil é. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon áit in Eirinn anois iargúlta.  Tá an oiread sin rudaí anois ag cur isteach ar shaol na Gaeltachta&mdash;tá bóithre maithe, busanna ag dul isteach, agus an oiread sin caidrimh ag na haiteacha iargúlta leis an saol mór anois nach áit iargúltach níos mó na Gaeltachta. Agus i ngeall air sin b'bhéidir gur shabhálta a bheadh an Ghaeilge i lár na hÉireann ar na tailte bána dá dtúgtaí talamh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ann ionas go bhféadfaidís slí maireachtala a bhaint amach as as a stuaim féin gan a bheith ag brath ar chúnamh Rialtais ná aon chúnamh eile. Rud eile dhe, táim lán cinnte dhe go gclaífidis go dlúth le chéile dá mbeidís thuas ansin.  Tá dream acu cheana a tugadh isteach ann agus tá siad ag déanamh go han-mhaith agus níor chuala me aon duine ag rá go bhfuil baol nó contuirt ar bith ann dá gcuid Ghaeilge.  Deirim an méid seo fá cheist an dá theangan&mdash;má tá daoine ag ceapadh go bhfuil siad ag sábháil na Gaeilge agus ag cur lucht na Gaeltachta ar an slí cheart le áit ann fhéin a dhéanamh den Ghaeltacht ar nós Indian Reservation, tá siad ag dul amú go mór.  Níl fonn ar bith ar lucht na Gaeltacht a bheith cruinuithe in aon National Park ná aon áit mar sin.  Teastaíonn Béarla uathú.  Foghlaimeoidh siad an Béarla ar mhaithe leo féin.  Is é mo thuairim féin má abrann aon dream údarásach sa tír seo gur dearmad an Béarla a choinneáil uatha&mdash;má abrann tú aon cheo mar sin le daoine na Gaeltachta&mdash;is é a fhreagrós siad:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Féach na daoine móra seo a thagas chun na Gaeltachta ag foghlaim na <Col N="2100" /> Gaeilge agus na postanna móra atá acu; inár n-amadáin, ag coinneáil na Gaeilge slán sábháilte ar mhaithe le daoine a thagas inár mease uair sa bhlian leis an oiread Gaeilge a fhoghluim agus a thiúrfas postanna maithe dhóibh.  Tá slí maireachtála ag teastáil uainn chomh maith le daoine eile agus tá Béarla ag teastáil uainn.&rdquo;  I ngeall air sin, má théann duine thart sa Ghaeltacht agus má chloiseann sé roinnt Béarla, ní comhartha ar bith é sin go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag fáil bháis ann ach tá mé fhéin ag ceapadh go bhfuil a lán daoine ag dul amú i dtaoibh cailliúint na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Tá siad ag breithniú na ceiste seo do réir an mhéid Béarla a chloiseann siad.  Dá fheabhas dá bhfuil an Béarla ag lucht na Gaeltachta is ea is fearr don Ghaeilge freisin.  Tá, ar ndóigh, go leor leor le déanamh fós leis an mbreathnú ceart, leis an oideachas ceart, a thabhairt do na daoine i dtaoibh na ceiste sin, ní mór a thaspáint dóibh go bhfuil meas ag lucht údaráis na tíre ar an nGaeilge agus go bhfuil brabach éicint le fáil acu féin dá barr.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liomsa go bhfuil siad ag iompó in aghaidh na Gaeilge ach tá ceisteanna eile ar ndóigh, ag cur isteach orthu.  Dá mb'fhéidir, fá choimirce na Roinne Oideachaís nó faoi choimirce éicint eile, siamsa a sholáthar dóibh sa Ghaeltacht, ar nós dramaí agus eile, tá mé ag ceapadh go ndéanfadh sé a lán maitheasa leis na daoine óga a shásamh.  Tá mé ag cuimhneamh ar áiteacha a bhfuil an saghas oibre sin a dhéanamh iontu agus sásaíonn sé na daoine óga.  Sin taobh amháin de.  Tá slí maireachtála ar an taobh eile den scéal ach, ar ndóigh, ní féidir an cheist a shocrú as an talamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Fágann sé sin nach bhfuil ann ach tionscail.  'Se mo thuairim gur bocht an scéal é cuairteoirí a bheith ag teacht i mease na ndaoine seo agus a bheith á ngríosadh, mura bhfuil rud fónta a dhéanamh ar a son.  Nílim ag rá go bhfuil an scéal níos measa ná mar bhí.  Deirim go bhfuil sé níos fearr ná mar bhí, go bhfuil caighdeán marachtála níos áirde acu ná mar bhí, ach má tá an Rialtas sásta airgead a chaitheamh is féidir leo craiceann níos fearr a chur ar an scéal.  Má fheiceann na daoine go <Col N="2101" /> bhfuil an Rialtas i ndáiríribh, bhéarfaidh siad cúnamh dóibh.</P>

      <P>Tá a lán pointe a bhaineas leis an nGaeilge ach ní bheadh sé in ordú cur síos orthu anois.  Is fíor, mar dúirt an Teachta MacPháidín, go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag sleamhnú siar ach do réir an Teachta MacPhárthaláin níl sí chómh lag in a lán áiteanna agus a cheapamar.  Pé ar domhan de, ba chóir go mbeadh ár ndóchas as an nGaeltacht lag go leor. Ba cheart dúinn náire a bheith orainn an scéal a bheith mar atá.  Ach tá seasmhacht éigin ag baint leis an nGaeilge, agus leanann an tseasmhacht sin tabharfadh sé seans dúinn machnamh éigin a dhéanamh arís ar stad na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Na rudaí go mba chóir dúinn cur síos orthu ar an meastacháin seo is rudaí iad a bhaineas le maireachtáil na ndaoine a bhíonn ina gcomhnaí san Ghaeltacht.  B'fhéidir gur ceart monarchain a chur ar bun anseo agus ansúd mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Diolúin.  B'fhéidir gur ceart cuid de na daoine atá sa Ghaeltacht a aistriú go háiteanna eile agus feirmeacha móra breátha a thabhairt dóibh, ach beidh daoine na gcomhnaí fós sna háiteanna ina labhartar an Ghaeilge go nádúrtha.  Gheibheann na daoine seo a maireachtáil as an talamh, as an bhfarraige agus as na déantúisí a dhéanamh ar son na ndaoine seo, atá san Ghaeltacht faoi láthair agus a bheidh ann go ceann 50 blian.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon fhonn ar na daoine seo Béarla a labhairt agus, mar gheall air sin, tá rud seasmhach againn sna háiteanna seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do chaith mé le déanaí deich lá i gCúige Mumhan&mdash;an Cúige is measa le tréigean na Gaeilge.  Casadh orm daoine i nDún Chaoin, i gcontae Chiarraighe, agus níl tigh san áit sin nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt ann agus nach bhfuil fonn ar na daoine Gaeilge a labhairt.  Bíonn siad ag obair ó mhaidín go hoíche agus i rith na hoibre sin bíonn siad ag caint. Mura dtagann rud éigin isteach ansin leis an mBéarla a láidriú, leanfadh an Ghaeilge dhá labhairt sa leathpharóiste sin.  Tá muintir na háite ag brath ar an talamh agus ar an <Col N="2102" /> bhfarraige le maireachtáil a fháil agus chuirfeadh sé náire ort bheith ina measc, na rudaí dob fhéidir linn a dhéanamh chun cúnamh thabhairt dóibh agus nach bhfuil á ndéanamh againn.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist na hiascaireachta, cur i gcás.  Tá na Blascáodaí trí mhíle amach ó chósta Chiarraighe ach an caladh atá san áit seo, tá sé chómh dona nach féidir leis na hiascairí úsáid a bhaint as.  An bóthar a théann suas ansin, tá sé an-árd ar fad.  Gach rud a thagann as na Blascaodaí caithfidh sé teacht ar an mbóthar sin.  Is ar éigin is féidir le fear siúl ar an mbóthar sin, tar éis ar thárla trí nó ceithre bliain o shoin.  Is féidir le bó dul suas ach ní féidir le bó teacht anuas.  Ní foláir fanúint leis an taoide agus dul thar na carraigeacha.  Chuirfeadh sé náire ort bheith ag féachaint air agus tá sé trí nó ceithre bliana mar sin.  Tá an iascaireacht á mhilleadh ansin toisc an caladh a bheith mar sin.  Bhí bolard thíos ag an gcaladh chun naomhóg a thabhairt isteach san áit sin.  Tháinig storm agus briseadh é agus ní féidir neamhóg a fhágáil ar an gcaladh anois agus ní foláir do dhuine atá tar éis teacht ó na hoileáin an neamhóg a thabhairt tríd an fharraige.  Ar chostas cúpla céad punt cuirfí an áit in ordú i dtreo go dtiocfadh leis na daoine dul amach agus teacht isteach.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt an Teachta Mac Phárthaláin agus Teachta Ó Diolúin, ta cuid de an Ranna eile agus níl siad ag déanamh dada ar son na Gaeltachta. B'fhéidir nach ar an Aire atá an milleán in aon chor, ach cuirim dhá cheist air: Cad na thaobh nach socraítear an calagh thíos i nDun Chaoin chun cabhrú leis na daoine a bhíonn ag iascaireacht.  Sa leathpharóiste sin tá cuid den talamh is fearr i gCiarraighe, cé go bhfuil sé ar aghaidh na farraige.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the adjournment of the debate, I was referring to the necessity which exists for good travel connections with this country in order to develop the tourist traffic.  I <Col N="2104" /> pointed out how important it was to have easy access to this country.  But, coming to the question of hotels with which we are more immediately concerned in this Bill, there is a great deal to be said both for and against the policy of public money being spent on hotels.  If the hotels which the Tourist Board proposes to run are conducted as model organisations, then I think that, in the long run, the expenditure of public money will have been justified to a large extent.  But they must, like agricultural colleges, be models, and I trust that that will be the case.  I understood the Minister to say that it was not the intention of the board to run these hotels permanently.  Am I correct in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the hotels will be run for a period by the board and then when they are making a profit&mdash;or, possibly, just the very reverse, but we will presume that they are making a profit&mdash;they will be sold. I should like, however, to mention to the House that when one of the countries with the largest tourist trade in the world, namely, Switzerland, some time in the last century was awakening to the possibilities of the tourist trade, a lot of hotels were erected all over the country.  It was found, however, that the hotels could not pay off the heavy capital expenditure and therefore the promoters, private individuals, who put their money into these hotels, had to sell them at a loss, not because they did not understand how to run the hotels, but because the capital charges were such that the industry could not carry them. Therefore, the people who put them up lost their money.  Other people came in and bought the hotels at bargain prices and were able to make a profit. I hope that in connection with these hotels which the Tourist Board are going to put up the State will not find itself in the unfortunate position in which the first hotel promoters in Switzerland found themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the misconception had sprung up in the public mind that the Tourist Board catered only for tourists, and I think wealthy tourists at that, and not for <Col N="2105" /> the ordinary holidaymakers in this country.  I am sorry to say that, even after his explanation, I was not entirely convinced to the contrary.  These big hotels which are contemplated in the West, such as the one at Ballinahinch, so far as I can understand, will be hotels for wealthy visitors.  The prices which these hotels will have to charge will place them out of the reach of the ordinary citizen.  In order that that misconception should not grow, I would say to the Minister that the board should publicise more than it has done what efforts it is making to cater for the ordinary citizens of this country and for the middle-income group, anyway, of incoming tourists. We live in an age which is called a democratic age.  Whether it is or not is perhaps open to doubt.  It certainly is rapidly becoming a middle-income age. Whatever possibilities there were in the past of making money out of luxury hotels, I think that day has gone.  The number of people who will be able to pay high prices for hotel accommodation is becoming fewer and fewer.  I hope this country will cater adequately for that class of holiday-makers, whether they are tourists or citizens of our own State.</P>
    <P>In connection with what I might call local attractions, we are all aware that the climate of this country is rather fickle.  That means, if we are to make a success of the tourist trade, that we must provide other attractions for the visitors coming here, apart from the natural beauty of our scenery and the various outdoor sports which can be indulged in, especially in the West.  If we want to cater for the type of visitor who is not a fisherman or who does not take an interest in outdoor sports we must organise local attractions; in fact we must more than organise them, we must practically create them, because they do not exist to any great extent in this country.  In fact, in the great majority of Irish resorts, whether seaside or inland, there is nothing whatsoever to do in the evening.  There may be a local picture-house, but, beyond that, there is practically nothing. There are no local orchestras and no bands.  There are very few parks.</P>
    <P>Somebody said to me earlier to-day in this House, mentioning one very <Col N="2106" /> famous Irish health or beauty resort: &ldquo;I do now know that we have even a proper circulating library.&rdquo;  These are all matters with which the Tourist Board should concern itself, and I hope that it will do so.  It certainly would have been interesting, and I think it would have been instructive, if we could have heard from the Minister what suggestions the Tourist Board is prepared to make to local authorities with regard to making their resorts more attractive to visitors.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another matter dealing with internal communications here.  I mentioned the necessity for proper communications with the outside world.  The same necessity exists for proper internal communications. The tourist should be able to get about the country easily and to get adequate and proper information regarding travelling facilities.  I remember an incident in which I was concerned myself some years ago when going to a well-known and extremely beautiful resort in Ireland.  It is one of our best-known resorts but the railway does not run to it.  The train stops about seven or eight miles away, and when one gets out at the terminus one has to wait for a bus which comes from a big city.  Nobody can tell you when you get out of that train, or indeed in the booking office before you get into it, whether you will be able to get even standing room on the bus. As it happened on that occasion, I think all of us were able to pile on to the bus, but there was a very considerable element of risk attached to it. That was about 11 o'clock at night.  It occurred, of course, during the emergency period when petrol was scarce but, as far as I could gather, at no time had there ever been a special branch line of buses running to that resort.  One had always to step out of the train and take one's chance of getting on the bus.</P>
    <P>That sort of treatment is all right when tourists are young and venturesome. They are then prepared to take risks, but older people&mdash;and it is older people who, in the main, make up the <Col N="2107" /> great body of tourists; they have money to spend on holidays and the majority of younger people have not&mdash; will not, if they can avoid it, subject themselves to the slightest risk or inconvenience when they go on holidays. I should like to place that aspect of the matter before the Minister because I think it is one of very great importance in considering the question of holidays in Ireland for Irish people or for tourists from outside.  I think the Tourist Board realise the value of comfortable clean hotels and good food. I am prepared to wait and see whether the propaganda which is being carried out along these lines by the Tourist Board will have the desired effect of improving hotels which are not up to the standard we should like them to reach.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Government is interesting itself in tourist matters.  I am not so certain that public money will not be lost eventually on these large hotels.  With regard to the question of loans for hotel keepers, I think the very greatest care will have to be exercised in that respect because hotel-keeping is essentially a business and, unfortunately, in business generally the weakest go to the wall. If a hotel keeper is not in a position to avail himself of the ordinary means available to every competent business man in the country, I think it rather points to the fact that he is not a good hotel keeper and if he is not a good hotel keeper, from the national point of view, we do not want him to keep a hotel in this country.  There are, of course, exceptions.  There are hardluck people who perhaps cannot get money to build additions and bring about improvements, but I think myself all the good hotel keepers are able to do that out of the profits they have made from their business.  That is the ordinary commercial experience in most businesses, and I do not see that hotel keeping differs so radically from any other commercial enterprise that what I might call the natural law changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming as I do from the West of Ireland, it is only natural that like many other Deputies I should <Col N="2108" /> be interested in the development of the tourist industry.  There is a good deal of substance in what Deputy Dockrell has stated in relation to accommodation in this country as anyone who has travelled outside the State will realise.  I am in agreement with the policy of the Government in trying to develop this industry.  If they see that by lending a certain sum of money to the Tourist Board, it will enable them to bring about an industry which sooner or later will be of benefit to the State, I think by all means they should be encouraged. Whilst we have very beautiful scenery in the south and west of Ireland, that of itself is not a sufficient attraction. People who come here from England, and still more people who come from the Continent, will expect other things&mdash;good accommodation, decent hotels in which to stay, hotels wherein they will not be exploited or charged over and above what is a reasonable figure for the accommodation provided. That is very important.  It is also important that our transport system should be modernised to a greater degree.  It certainly should be more hygienic and cleaner.  Take the case of a young lady travelling in mid-summer in a railway carriage. She may be wearing a white dress.  If the seats are not perfectly clean when she sits down what will be the condition of her clothes when she gets up? They will be all black and smutty. Perhaps the insides of these carriages have not been cleaned for a month, five weeks or two months.  Not only the seats but the window sills, the straps, the floor itself have not been touched for quite a long time.  That is not very attractive for people coming from other countries who believe in hygiene and who have been accustomed to cleanliness.  If they go into a lavatory they may find that there is no paper, no soap and the basin is in a condition in which one would expect to find a basin in a house in which the chimney has been swept&mdash; full of smut.  Everything is disgusting not only to middle-class people but to decent ordinary working people who may not have been accustomed to a middle-class life but who have been <Col N="2109" /> accustomed to cleanliness.  That has been my experience in travelling on Irish railways.</P>
      <P>I have travelled the length and breadth of England, Wales and Scotland and I have found that conditions were quite different there.  The conditions in a third class carriage were far superior to the conditions in our first class carriages.  I suppose they may have deteriorated during the war but if so there was a genuine excuse for that.  Certainly in pre-war days the accommodation provided in these carriages was far superior to that provided on our trains.  Again if you went into a railway station in London, Manchester or Cardiff you would immediately know the time of the departure and arrival of all trains.  There was an indicator to show the time at which each train was coming in and going out.  You do not need to make inquiries, but, if you do so, you receive every courtesy and consideration and you get an answer.  You have not that to get here.</P>
      <P>If we are going to develop this industry we must have these things side by side with our natural scenery.  We can add to that natural scenery.  God has given us many gifts and we can help to make our country nicer and more attractive.  We can encourage people to come here.  We could help to keep places beautiful by putting up notices asking people not to allow waste paper and rubbish to be thrown about our seaside and health resorts.  We can make our sea strands much nicer and our parks more beautiful.  Then we could devote some attention to the provision of suitable places where our young men and women can enjoy themselves. We can provide good dance halls and cinemas, and good transport services.  At the seaside we should have motor boats and amusements of different kinds.  There should be something more than mere walking along the sea coast.  People can get tired walking and they can get tired even sitting down.  You can get tired looking only at the strand.  You look for other amusements and, if they are not provided, you will not come back to that resort again.  If visitors are not satisfied they will not return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2110" /> In our hotels cleanliness and good food are important factors.  It is very important that a visitor should have good services.  You cannot have that if waiters and waitresses are not properly looked after and properly paid.  It is essential that they should not be overworked. In our swankier, first-class hotels some of the girl attendants are miserably paid.  They are carrying out important duties and I believe that the rate of pay ranges from £1 a week down to 10/-.  You cannot expect them to be courteous and to give good service if they do not receive adequate remuneration. These are some of the things the Tourist Board should look into.</P>
    <P>While I will encourage the Government to give every assistance, I agree that they must not be at any loss.  The only way they can safeguard themselves is by seeing that the industry is operated on proper lines.  They should see that the Tourist Board will carry out their duties properly.  We have a number of hotels that do not come under the Tourist Board and that have been disqualified.  In these circumstances we must prevent foreigners from going to that type of hotel, which cannot be very clean or hygienic.  There are very decent men coming to this country now, Allied officers and soldiers.  They are complete strangers to the country and they do not know where to go.  Sometimes they are accosted at the railway stations by people who tell them about their hotels. If they go to these places their impression of Irish hotels is not a good one. When they go to their own countries again they may not give Irish hotels a good name.  These are the things the Government should warn the Tourist Board about.  The tourist industry will eventually be the means of making this country more widely known and better understood by outside people.  The industry will give employment on a large scale.  It is only right that this measure should get the unanimous support and encouragement of Deputies.</P>
    <P>In the West of Ireland we have such well-known places as Galway, Tourmakeady, Achill and Blacksod.  These places should not be forgotten and the Government should do everything possible to help them.  If there is a necessity <Col N="2111" /> for better accommodation, that accommodation should be forthcoming. Being an ordinary worker, I have not travelled the country very much and I have not the money to live in luxury hotels.  I have travelled a little and I must say of some of the hotels where I have been that they are not up to the standard I would like.  I am not saying that they are not good, but I would like to see them better and more in keeping with hotels in other countries.</P>
    <P>The West of Ireland should receive as much consideration as places such as Limerick.  In the West there is beautiful natural scenery.  I have not seen as good around Limerick or any other inland town.  The Tourist Board should be encouraged in its efforts.  The industry will help to give employment in the West.  It will enable many people to remain at home.  Earlier we were discussing how to solve the problem of unemployment in the West and how to keep the people at home.  This would be one way.  We could help to keep our young men and women at home if they were employed in the tourist industry.  The Mayo County Council, of which I am a member, are desirous that the West should receive every consideration. The building up of the tourist industry is an important thing and we should all concentrate on it. We have a great opportunity, which would not have come were it not for the recent terrible war.</P>
    <P>Let us prove to Europe and to the United States and to other countries that this is a desirable country to visit. It will take many years before France and other countries that were engaged in the war will come back to normal. Their cities will not be attractive because they have been knocked down and there is nothing to see there but the aftermath of war.  Providence has preserved us from the terrible tragedy that has passed over Europe and other parts of the world.  We should avail to the full of our opportunity and do everything in our power to attract the attention of those people who have money to spend and who are interested in travelling.  Our country has wonderful scenic attractions.  We should <Col N="2112" /> do everything to encourage people here to view them.  We should give them decent service at a reasonable cost and then we will be able to put this country properly on the map.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many aspects from which one may approach this question of development which is envisaged in the Bill.  I was very pleased to hear the Minister stress that the primary purpose of the Irish Tourist Board is to provide amenities and suitable holiday facilities for our own people.  If we are to approach the problem from that angle, the first thing we ought to consider is what can be done with the big centres of population under this Bill.  At the present time a reasonable holiday in an hotel is beyond the reach financially of most workers and middle-class people.  They cannot undertake the expense of a holiday in any of the modern hotels. Other facilities must be provided if they are to avail of holidays.  The next thing is to provide within reasonable distance of the cities and towns such transport and attractions as will serve those who go away for a day's outing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you think that is what you are voting money for in this Bill?  Indeed you are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am criticising that aspect.  Take the city from which I come.  Most of the ordinary people go for a holiday on Sundays because they cannot afford, nor have they the facilities, to spend a longer holiday away from home.  Take the whole sea coast from Youghal to Glengariff. Mention has been made of Garryvoe and the Irish College there.  I think the Tourist Board made a good bargain there, seeing that they got a mortgage on the whole place for £2,500 at 5 per cent.  That was not a bad bargain. Before reaching Glengariff one passes Crosshaven, Cobh, Kinsale, and Courtmacsherry, which, in former days, were excursion centres from Cork. Nothing has been done to improve the existing state of affairs in these places. I am sure the same applies elsewhere. No doubt a good deal has been attempted, but it would be a false approach to think that the Irish <Col N="2113" /> Tourist Board could at one jump solve a problem which has developed for years.  I do not wish to approach it from that end or to criticise the board too severely.  At the same time, I say that workers in the cities and towns are the people for whom special facilities should be provided.  There should be good transport and reasonable development within reasonable distances, so that transport would not absorb the whole of the holiday money. These are things that ought to receive attention at the outset.  I do not think they are dealt with in this Bill.  It is all very fine to speak about going long distances to view scenery, but certain families only can afford to do that. The Tourist Board in my opinion is not getting down sufficiently to the most serious problem.  Looking at it from the point of view of development, it is all right to provide hotels for those who can afford to pay high sums, but we are doing very little to provide holiday accommodation for the more humble sections of our people.</P>
      <P>The development of inland fisheries has been mentioned.  That would provide a sporting holiday perhaps for some of our people as well as for those from abroad.  These fisheries have been very much neglected during the emergency.  I do not know whether anything has been done to improve them.  While I do not want to find fault with the Minister, because I have not sufficient knowledge of this subject, I think it would be far better, and more productive in the long run, to cater for the humbler sections than to provide hot-water swimming pools in Youghal or developments of that kind. I look at the matter from that angle. I think it is the angle from which it should be approached.  We are told that the board is not out to embark on competition with people at present engaged in catering for the tourist industry, but to develop areas in which there has been very little development and to aspects which would make these places attractive to tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very big sums have been mentioned in connection with these developments, for instance, at Tramore.  It may be all right to spend these sums over a <Col N="2114" /> term of years, but I doubt if it is a wise policy to concentrate on such centres and to spend huge sums of money without having a development of the housing problem to cater for those on holiday in the summer months. It may be said that I am arguing against myself because Tramore is within a reasonable distance from Waterford but I consider that sums spent in certain centres are unduly large.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Cafferky's views on transport.  In some instances fault may be found but considering the difficulties I think there is a reasonably good transport service and that what is there is clean and comfortable to a degree.  There is not sufficient of it and what is there is too expensive.  That is the principal fault I have to find with it.  Nobody wants a policy of stand still.  We want progress but the thing is to have progress on the right lines.  As far as the Tourist Board's developments in that direction go, I am sure it will have the support of the House.  In the past the Minister saw ahead of time on more occasions than one but perhaps people were inclined, as I am, to criticise the expenditure of money on certain developments. Afterwards, we saw that the Minister was right and that he was more farseeing than we were.  These are certain of the criticisms I have to offer in regard to this Bill and the developments it foreshadows that we would like to bring to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this whole Bill with the enthusiasm that Deputy McCarthy welcomed it and very little more.  I think the remarks he applied to the transport situation would apply to this Bill &mdash;we have not very much in the way of development and what we have is too dear.  What we are faced with in this measure is the voting of sufficient extra moneys to enable the Tourist Board to have at its disposal £1,250,000. What for?  Deputy McCarthy criticised it on the basis that it is going to cater for luxury visitors and not the population here.  That is sound criticism.  It was said a long time ago that the eyes of the fool are on the ends of the earth. <Col N="2115" /> We had many fools here and it was about time to focus our eyes on the natives and their needs.  What is the board that we are asked to vote £1,250,000 for?  It is a board that has been criticised by a commission that was set up by the present Government as a board without a single person on it who represents the hotel industry.  I go further and say that there is not a single person on it who has any experience of hotels.</P>
      <P>There is no one on it who knows anythink about the running of hotels.  I doubt if there is anyone on the board who has any knowledge of any language other than English and possibly Irish. There is no one on the board with experience except the chairman who took a trip at the public expense to America.  He knows nothing about hotel-keeping; he never had anything to do with it, and I doubt if he gained any experience in that connection.</P>
      <P>We have found it very hard to get from anybody connected with this whole business what the remuneration of the people on the board is, or what their qualifications might be.  I think we are entitled to conclude from the secrecy which surrounded their movements that their qualifications did not bear examination, and that their experience does not bear any investigation. We are going to give them £1,250,000&mdash;an extra £600,000, and for what?  To encourage tourists to come to this country.  What have we to offer tourists, or what has the new Tourist Board to offer them?  Has it anything better to offer them than what the original hotel proprietors had who tried to cater for tourists to this country? The members of this board have no extra fund of experience to draw upon. They have no special talent.  They have not travelled, except one of them who made a certain visit to find out what is done in other countries.  They have nothing to add that would encourage the development of tourism in this country on decent lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a motion on the Order Paper in my name and that of Deputy Mulcahy asking for certain information which should be put up annually.  We have got some of it to-day.  It took this <Col N="2116" /> motion to get it, and it will take some time to digest it.  What we have got does not make me feel that the prospect is any more attractive than it was when I was without the information. We have had hotels in this country. There are certain things that the tourist might regard as suitable for his pleasure and amusement and, possibly, his cultural education if he came here. Are these things going to be bettered by the particular group that the Minister has associated with this board?  I see no reason for believing that they are. We heard to-day in connection with certain places that hotels have been bought for large sums of money.  I would like to find out what particular profit these hotels showed before they were bought over and what money is going to be put into them, what improvements are going to be made in them, and what is their future prospect. Will these be any better than when the hotels were in private hands? I object entirely to the State running in where other people have been doing their best, where, with limited resources either as regards accommodation or attractions for tourists, a certain good had been done.</P>
    <P>I understand that, in connection with an area near the city, a sum of £14,000 is being spent.  Whether that has been spent on a hotel, or on some property adjoining a hotel, I do not know.  Let us take that as an example, that £14,000 has been given for some property.  Who owned it, and what profit was being made on it? Was it being run at a profit, and if it was not, is this board likely to be able to run it at a profit, or is the view taken that we are going to pay just for the edification of a lot of tourists? What do we want tourists for?  Is it to show them the beauties of the country and take them around at our expense, or is it that we want to give them a benefit they will approve of and will seek to buy at an economic rate?</P>
    <P>What hope is there that a board, such as this, will make a better job of this than people who have been in the hotel business all their lives?  What does the Minister know about the hotel business?  He does not pretend to know anything about it.  The civil <Col N="2117" /> servants, to whom he goes for advice, never ran a hotel in their lives, and cannot be expected to know anything about the business, while the group associated with him in this are significantly devoid of either experience or information in connection with the running of the tourist industry or of hotels.  What do they know of the amusements that people who come here may desire?  What examination has been made of the foreigners whom we are seeking to attract here?  In what better way is this board likely to cater for the amusement and the education of people who come here than the ordinary hotel proprietors of the country?  The Pope, in a late Encyclical, has said that &ldquo;What the individual man can do by himself and by his own strength should not be taken from him and assigned to the community.&rdquo;  Have the hotel proprietors shown themselves to be inefficient in any way?  These are some points that should be answered.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that, in voting this sum of money to this board, the board is not to be accountable in detail for it to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  In other words, it is not going to be put through the ordinary examination that any Department of State is put through. It is simply to get the money to spend it in whatever way it likes.  We did extract from the Minister the information that it will produce a report. The report for 1944 stated that it had a lot of development schemes, but that these were unspecified.  We all remember what happened in England&mdash; the big speculation that was there in what came to be known as the great South Sea Bubble.  One of the projects for which money was gathered in in those days was in relation to what a group of people said was the development of a project &ldquo;which shall be hereafter specified&rdquo;.  That was in the days of the great bubble companies when any amount of money was lost.  Here we find a Tourist Board saying that it has a lot of development schemes, but that they are unspecified, and must remain unspecified because it is not in the public interest even to disclose the identity of the <Col N="2118" /> resorts that are going to be developed by it.  That is the nearest thing to asking people to subscribe towards a project the details of which &ldquo;shall be hereafter specified&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy, after condemning the scheme, said that, nevertheless, we should trust the Minister, do the various things enumerated, hope for the best, and vote the money.  I do not mind voting money even as a gamble, but let us have some regard to the form of how those people disposed themselves in other positions.  What is the form of those people who have been put in to run this particular association? Anything that I know about them is not to their credit as people who would be asked to dispose of £1,250,000 of public money in a business in which other people had tried to make their livelihood and failed.  In that situation, how can we hope that people of unspecified qualifications will make any better success of it, especially when they know they have public money at their disposal and are not going to be asked to account in detail for it to the Comptroller and Auditor-General?  How can we expect the same endeavour from them as one would expect from people who had invested their own money in the business and knew that if the investment was not a success their substance was gone?</P>
    <P>I object to this being done in the way that it is being done.  I do not mind having a gamble even to the extent of £1,250,000 of public money if it makes for the development of the country.  As a public representative, I want to be told what the schemes of developments are and who the people from whom properties have been taken over are.  I want to be told also how those private people have done their job and if they have failed.  I would also like to know if an analysis has been made of the cause of their failure, and whether this board can do any better under the same conditions. Until all that information has been given to the House I do not think that we ought to be asked to vote even an extra penny for this board.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy raised another point.  What is the purpose of the <Col N="2119" /> whole board?  In addition to the public money that is being asked for here other public moneys have been voted. About the beginning of this month a statement appeared in the daily newspapers to the effect that the Commissioner for County Dublin had voted £25,000 for sewer extension development in the Baldoyle and Portmarnock area, including the property of St. Marnock's, which now belongs to the Irish Tourist Board.  That £25,000 will fall on the ratepayers of the County Dublin, but it would not have to be provided if that property were still in private hands.  Is that right?</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy should remember that not merely will there be this vote of £1,250,000, but that the ratepayers in other areas of the country will be asked to provide additional moneys to assist in the development of those areas.  What is the purpose of all that? Except what the Minister gave, the only other information we have is that which came from the chairman of the board when he was in America.  When he came home he said, speaking of plans, that it would be unwise to specify them, or to reveal the identity of the resorts which were to be developed.  But when he went to America he did reveal some of these matters and when he came home he gave the public a little more information in detail.  It was quite clear that the main object, so far as that gentleman was concerned, was the luxury hotel business.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy is very anxious about what is to be done to cater for the amusement requirements of the natives of this country.  I think we should attend to that.  Possible people will have read the article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 27th April, in which a very careful analysis was made of the most recent publication of the Statistics Department in relation to National Income and Expenditure.  There is one significant figure I think we should attend to in connection with tourist development.  We have here a 3,000,000 population.  They are not all earning; some of them are children who could not be expected to earn; some of them are people gone beyond the time when they might earn, though their pensions <Col N="2120" /> and emoluments are accounted in the national income; there are people attending to home duties and who in that connection are not earning money. We may take it that half the population is earning, that is, 1,500,000 getting moneys from some sort of service they give to the community, out of which they have to live and have to support the other 1,500,000. This publication divides the people into income groups&mdash;the first group is of people who get from nothing to £150, £3 a week and under; then you come up by £100 jumps to £250, £350 and so on, to the surtax classes and the £10,000 a year men.  A significant figure emerges, that if we divide this population into those who get £150 and under and those others who get over £150, we find that the £150 group includes 198,000 of our population.  That is, less than 200,000 people out of 3,000,000&mdash;or, if you take all the gainfully occupied, 1,500,000&mdash; are earning £3 a week.  What is the good of the luxury hotel, I ask Deputy McCarthy, if all but 200,000 in the community are on a family wage level of £150 or under?</P>
    <P>Then we are going to vote £1,250,000 for luxury hotels for the benefit of the big people who will come in from the other side.  That is what we are solemnly asked to do.  We are asked to allow this board to take over hotels, buildings, racecourses, cinemas and lands.  They have recently become proprietors, I understand, of a golf links. Deputy McCarthy may well ask what is being thought of the ordinary person in the community, the people who are not of the 198,000 and who have to support themselves, their wives and families on less than £3 a week.  When you get that picture, you get the proper framework in which to discuss this Bill.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do in the immediate future?  This is supposed to be a long-term plan.  We are going to get tourists here, entice them here by bacon, eggs, butter and beefsteaks immediately, in the hope that, if they come over here, they will be attracted, when half gorged, by our beautiful scenery and, in the years hence when they are able to get food at home, they will remember the scenery and forget <Col N="2121" /> the butter, bacon, eggs and beefsteaks. We will get a grand crop of tourists then to come over here, to look at what?  At the Wicklow Hills? At the resorts Deputy McCarthy talks about round the coast of Cork?  Were they not catered for before?  Did they not come in in some numbers, did they not come in in sufficient numbers, to enable private people, occupied in the way of private enterprise, to make money?  Is the scenery going to be improved by the Tourist Board?  What is the least benefit from this?  I can see none.</P>
    <P>I can see two immediate disadvantages to this country.  Firstly, in the next year and a half, the people who come here certainly are going to promulgate, so far as they are concerned, that this is a country living on the fat of the land.  I do not know that that is the position we want to have placed in the eyes of starving Europe.  We certainly do not want that to be placarded. That is a temporary matter and we can get over it.  What is the other immediate disadvantage?  These people are going to come to spend money, they are going to put up our prices, going to do even those who can afford to go to the hotels out of the reservations the people tried to make in those hotels.  That has been the fate of many people to my knowledge, revealed to them in the last fortnight or three weeks.  They are going to come in and eat all these foodstuffs, and they will not have much time to admire the scenery.  It is the same as if we exported an extra amount of our bacon, eggs, butter and beefsteaks.  For what?  For more credit, more goods sent on tick to the other side.</P>
    <P>I talked of this last year and was derided for my talk, but quite a number of people who laughed at the particular remarks I made last July are rather definitely approving of those comments now, since they find themselves suffering in person from the increased prices and lack of accommodation for themselves, to enjoy the little bit of amusement they felt they ought to have and that they were entitled to get and which has been crushed out by the Northern Ireland <Col N="2122" /> people and by the English, Welsh and Scotch folk who come here.  What do we get from them?  I have asked this question three years in succession and want to put it again.  We in this House &mdash;we may as well be honest about it&mdash; agreed to a proposal to stop the civil servants getting a bonus paid to them. We stabilised that at a certain point. That was all in the interest of the great programme to stop inflation.  Of course, we have inflation and no one denies it.  However, we all agreed to stop civil servants getting a bonus, because if they were paid that extra money and they purchased goods, the impact of that bonus money on our relatively small store of commodities was going to increase the prices.  If you look at the figure derived from the civil servants by the State in any one year, according to question and answer in this House, you find it is £1,000,000. That £1,000,000, if paid to the civil servants in the way of bonus, is inflationary, it is going to increase the cost of foodstuffs; but £1,000,000 spent by English, Welsh and Scotch visitors is apparently not inflation.  Why?  Why is £1,000,000 spent by civil servants apt to cause an increase in prices and the same amount of money spent by people who come in from outside is not inflation? Would anybody tell me what the difference is?  I have sought for three years to get an explanation of that simple question and have not got it yet.</P>
    <P>It can be said, of course, that by paying £1,000,000 to civil servants, we are, so to speak, getting nothing from them. Nothing of course, except the repayment of our own honour.  We pledged ourselves to give those people that money.  Not merely that, we told them at one time, through the mouth of the Taoiseach, that it would be their life and their safeguard at a time when prices would rise and their bonus would go up.  We docked them £2,000,000 in a number of years when the cost-of-living index figure fell and their salaries went down but the Taoiseach claimed that when it rose their bonus would be safeguarded.  Then we stepped in and said we would not give them the bonus.  We said: &ldquo;We know we made a contract; that is right, and as honest people we should pay; but <Col N="2123" /> we will not, and our argument is that it would put up prices.&rdquo;  We are under no obligation to tourists.  We do not owe them anything.  We have no contract with them, we never said we would pay them any money, and we never said that we would allow them to exchange their bad money into our good goods.</P>
    <P>Now we invite them over and they are going to circulate amongst our hotels and going to eat our relatively short amount of commodities, and when it is all over, we will not have satisfied the debt of honour that we might have satisfied towards the civil servants.  What will we have?  The old mania is again in the ascendancy. We will have £1,000,000&mdash;English pounds?  What is going to happen to the £1,000,000&mdash;English pounds? It will be packed up to our credit, frozen stiff, the way the £200,000,000 we have over there is frozen, and we will liquidate it when and at what rate nobody knows, least of all the Minister.</P>
    <P>I quoted in this House last year the financial, the Parliamentary, the scientific definition of a pound sterling, that it was a promise made by the Bank of England to pay at such time as the British Government decided such amount of money as the British Government decided it was worth.  Supposing tourists come here and spend £1,000,000, we are accumulating another million promises by the British Treasury that they will pay us at whatever time suits them so much money as they think it is worth while to pay us.  To get that, whatever it is worth, we are going to entice in, this year, to swarm through our seaside resorts, over our golf links, through our racecourses, to stay in our city hotels, all these hungry people from outside and they will eat all this food of ours &mdash;they will pay no attention to our scenery&mdash;and will do the native out of enjoying it and then we will have frozen credit at the other side.  We have far too much of it&mdash;two hundred millions of it.</P>
    <P>When I spoke last July on this matter, I spoke always on the basis that what was called the lend-lease <Col N="2124" /> arrangement between England and America would be wiped out, there would be a complete writing-off of the debts wherever those debts were in surplus over a credit.  Even in the end the situation was bad, and, judging by the last five or six years' experience, it is quite clear we were not going to get any return for all our credits on the other side.  It is bad enough to lodge your money in a bank when somebody gives you a hint which you do not entirely believe that the bank may not pay but, when the bank says to you: &ldquo;We are not going to pay you and look at our practice for six years: we have not paid you, and that is a practice we are going to continue&rdquo;, would not a man be a fool to put any more money into such a bank?</P>
    <P>That is the situation we face, and remember, in addition to that, time has rolled on and arrangements have been made and in these arrangements, although we were not present at the making of them, we are involved.  The Americans have now said they may grant a loan of something like a thousand millions odd to England. And on what conditions?  They said, very carefully: &ldquo;We are not giving you our good dollars to go and distribute to Egyptians and Australians and Irish.  That is not what we are giving you money for.  It is for your own trade and before you get any penny of this money from us you are to enter into arrangements with these countries that have sterling assets piled up with you, and the arrangements will have to be along each of these three lines: You will wipe out part of these moneys and say they are not going to be paid; in regard to another part&mdash;roughly, it was assumed these were going to be in thirds&mdash;you will fund it over a long-term period, pay back, say, over a generation, and the remaining third you will make convertible into dollars.&rdquo; That is the new situation, and while that is the new situation and when we know, not because the British like it but because to get money from the people from whom alone they can get money, they have been put under this obligation: &ldquo;Go to your sterling creditors, wipe out some part of your debt, freeze some other part of it, and let the rest be convertible,&rdquo; we <Col N="2125" /> invite in in this year a new lot of tourists to deprive us and our native population of what they may get for their amusement, for their physical benefit and for their education.  We deprive them of all that, and we get, say, another £1,000,000 in England on the terms, as we now know, that of that new £1,000,000, £300,000 may be wiped off, £300,000 funded to be paid over 33 years, and £300,000 to be made freely convertible into dollars.</P>
    <P>Why should we do that?  Why should we increase the prices on our own population here for the sake of giving benefit to these tourists who will pay us in a currency of which we have far too much and about which we are warned that we will only get payment when the British like and at such a rate as the British like to determine?  Supposing it was clear to this country, and that our people knew that what we were going to get out of this in the end was, say, 10/- for every pound, would we have the same enthusiasm about inviting in thousands of tourists this year, if we knew that while our prices were being raised on us and on our fellows by these people who were coming in, our pound was going to be convertible eventually into some sort of British currency, frozen for a time and then paid at the rate of 10/- for each 20/- value we gave them?  Is that what we want?  Yet that is what we are aiming at in so far as this board is trying to get tourists this year or next year.</P>
    <P>I say we should call a halt to that. I think this country ought to be freely open to the natives.  I think that in so far as there is any scenery or any other benefit of a more material type to be given the native ought to get first preference.  I say that the hotel keepers will not suffer if we circulate amongst our community the purchasing power we have so far withheld from them wrongly and dishonestly and in breach of contract on the false plea that we are going to prevent inflation.  If we circulate that, our hotel keepers would get as much paid to them as they would get from all the tourists that we get in but they would be getting it from native hands and not from outsiders. <Col N="2126" /> Why should not they get it from native hands and why should not whatever they have to give in the way of food or scenery, relaxation, amusement, building up of the person in any way, accrue to the benefit of the native population instead of to the outsider?  I think we should focus our eyes definitely on our own people.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy McCarthy's line and deal with it in another way, from the financial side.  Deputy McCarthy made a plea to-day for attending to the native, and particularly for attending to the native who has small resources and has to be catered for, not in a luxury hotel but in some sort of decent place where he could spend the few days he gets off from his work to try to recuperate in body and mind. I say he is being done out.  He is not counted in this scheme.  This £1,250,000 has no relation to him whatever but, apart from all that, Deputy McCarthy's native, deprived of his holiday and deprived of the place where he could get his holiday amusement, is going to find, because of the influx of tourists, that the prices he will pay, not in any seaside resort, not in any pleasure resort, but at home, will be raised because of the impact of this false purchasing power on the amount of commodities we have to sell.</P>
    <P>It is all part of the crazy economics we have been developing in this country for five or six years back on all this fictitious plea of preventing inflation, inflation being here and inflation going to be increased by whatever new money comes into this country through tourists in the season that is ahead of us.  We have taken many lessons from the British.  We copy their legislation in all sorts of ways.  We have taken their whole currency over here.  We have taken their whole financial system as really being ours.  They recently announced in the House of Commons that they would take no active steps to encourage any tourists to Britain before next year. There they are.  Instead of that, we are going to ask for them to come and we are going to ask that they bring in more of this bad currency of theirs, currency bad for the reason it <Col N="2127" /> is not going to be paid for at its face value and not going to be paid for at our demand.  They are going to bring all that in.  They are going then to put us, the natives of this country, who are not going to enjoy any benefit, in the position that we will suffer from this disadvantage that our purchasing power, whatever it may be, is going to have less effect than ever before because the prices of our scarce commodities are going to be raised.</P>

      <P>The Minister's answer to me last year was the very facile and idiotic one, when I talked about the pound sterling, &ldquo;the £ was worth 20/-.&rdquo;  Even Deputy McCarthy laughs at that and it was not meant as a joke.  That was the answer.  I talked about preventing these people coming in last year.  I talked distinctly about the advertising and the propaganda programme with the idea of bringing people in last year.  In any event, the Tourist Board's report for 1944 says: &ldquo;It is expected that this year and probably for some years to come the demand for accommodation will exceed the capacity of the industry&rdquo;. What have they done to stop this influx?  They have done nothing.  Are they not catering for it?  Are they not advertising and are they not doing their best to get people to come here? What has the Minister done, either by a finance policy or any other policy, to keep these people out and to let us have our country for ourselves at least for this summer?  The whole policy of the Minister has been to laud sterling assets, to say that they are of great benefit to us.  It was as if we were being given some great gift by these people in spending their money here.  We do not want it.  That should be stated vehemently and often.  I am <Col N="2128" /> glad the Minister, to some extent, agreed with me when I stated, and I repeat it now, that tourists should not be invited into this country while our commodities are scarce.  I ask the Minister to give people, such as civil servants, some of the money that he has withheld from them on a false plea, to enable them, at the end of seven years, to enjoy some part of the bonus withheld from them during that period. Let him give them one year's emoluments and let them throng to our hotels and seaside resorts and at least have the benefit of eating our own food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cafferky in his plea for the native Irish, the plain people.  So far as I can see, this Bill is nothing more than a Bill for the idle rich, the racegoers and the gamblers in this country and those who are flocking in here.  I view this Bill with great alarm.  I think it is going too far, that there is too much money involved in it.  It took us a long time to build up our own culture and now we are having an influx of foreign ideas.  This thing must come to a head sometime.  Are we to cater for Irish ideas or are we to become part and parcel of a European tradition which has gone rotten?  That must be answered sometime.</P>
      <P>I hold that it is time to stop this tourist business and to develop this country for ourselves alone.  We have nothing to learn from foreigners.  We have maintained our own culture for thousands of years and we are proud of it, while they have lost theirs.  We are bowing and scraping to everybody who comes in here.  We are doing everything we can for them.  We must leave the footpaths to the bigwigs whom we are begging to come in here.  It is said we cannot live without them.  I hold that the reverse is the case, that we do not want them.  They gave us very little help in the past and we got on our own feet despite them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to recast this whole Bill and this whole tourist development programme and let it be a programme for the Irish natives, the people living on £2 or £3 a week and those living on the dole, those who are not able to get a holiday at all.  If we have money to <Col N="2129" /> spend, why not spend it on the people's homes and give them some little comfort? We are to go in for spending millions on seaside and other hotels for the big monopolists.  We are calling on all these idle rich and gamblers and financiers from all ends of the world to come in here and have a good time at our expense.  When they go back their newspapers will laugh and joke at the ignorant and wild Irish.  I think it is time to stop all that.  It is time for us to maintain our own culture.  It is time that we made a real effort to save the traditions of our people.  We must stand for Irish culture and the Irish language.  We should keep this country for the Irish people and nobody else.</P>
    <P>I am glad that a member of the Government Party, Deputy McCarthy, spoke as he did.  Like myself, he lives amongst the people and knows their needs.  It is unfair to spend all this money for those people who are to get the benefit of it.  We know that the majority of our own people are not getting the benefit of it.  Very few of them are, except those who may be living near a seaside resort.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to review the whole position.  All we have done up to this is to create big jobs for people who are quite incompetent to do them. We have given the jobs to men who never served an apprenticeship to the tourist or hotel business.  They had the pull behind the scenes and they got the jobs.  I know many of them. I would not give some of them the job of leading out blind dogs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy McGilligan, and his speech was typical of his contributions to a number of debates in this House.  His whole speech was destructive from beginning to end.  He implied by his remarks that the hotels being built in this country by the Tourist Board were solely for people who come here from foreign countries. In pre-war days we were faced with the position that a number of our own people had to go to foreign countries to enjoy a holiday.  Those who were in a position to save money to have a decent holiday tried to get out of the country.  Their one cry was that there were not enough facilities for them in <Col N="2130" /> this country and the hotels were not as they should be.  Now when the Tourist Board tries to improve our hotels and to provide facilities we hear a responsible Deputy like Deputy McGilligan making the most destructive speech that any Deputy could make.  We heard about the workers in our own country and other remarks like that.  I do not see how this Bill will keep our own people away from these hotels or that it was ever intended to do so.  We heard about some frozen assets which are being built up in Great Britain.  I shall refrain from commenting on that.  If we are to develop our country on the lines of other modern countries which have enjoyed freedom for hundreds of years, at least we will have to see that our country has decent hotels and decent and up-to-date seaside resorts. It is most essential that we should do that.  Our own people will enjoy them and also will have the benefit of the money that is spent.</P>
      <P>There are some seaside resorts in this county which are all right during fine weather when one can undress and bathe in the open but in wet weather there is not even a shelter.  The Tourist Development Board has now come along and they are making a view of a number of seaside resorts with a view to seeing what they can do to help workers, and men of small means, who wish to enjoy a holiday.  My only regret is that they are not doing more in County Dublin.  The seaside resorts in County Dublin are adjacent to the city and I should like to see them developed to a greater extent, even for our own people, so that when they get an opportunity of going to the seaside they will be afforded facilities for amusement and enjoyment as well as enjoying the sea, fresh air and sunshine. We hope by developing these resorts along the lines which the Minister has indicated, that the resorts in this country will be provided with facilities equally as modern as those in countries which have enjoyed freedom for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to pay special attention to some of the better-known seaside resorts in North County Dublin such as Skerries, Malahide and <Col N="2131" /> Donabate.  There are great possibilities of development in these areas.  I know that the Tourist Board, as well as the county commissioner, have been making inquiries and investigations but I should like to impress upon the Minister again to ascertain what can be done in these areas because, as I say, they are in close proximity to the city and we should like to cater as efficiently as we can for people who come from the city as well as those who come from inland centres.  We have been told from time to time, as we have been told by Deputy Giles to-night, that we are not trying to save our Irish culture, our Irish traditions and various other Irish attributes.  We have been told by members of the very same Party periodically that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government showed that they were isolationists.  Now the boot is on the other foot and when it suits them to change the argument, they accuse us of being internationalists. It is very hard to blow hot and cold in that way.  I think that, generally speaking, the Tourist Development Board has done a good deal for the country and that they will do a good deal more.  If they did nothing more than to improve the hotels in the country, they performed a good service for natives of the country, for the man who has only a few pounds saved for holidays, in seeing that he will not have to pay an exorbitant rate for the time he spends at an hotel.  It is a good thing to know, when you go into a town that you can get the advice of the Irish Tourist Board as to the hotel to which you should go or the hotel which is likely to cater for you best. It is about time that a proper registration of Irish hotels was brought about.</P>
    <P>I have heard some references made here to the chairman of the Tourist Board.  I am very sorry that any Deputy should be so ungentlemanly as to attack a man in his absence.  The chairman of the Tourist Board, in my opinion, is an honour to the country and is worthy of the job he holds.  I do not know many of the officials of this board but the few of them I do know are worthy citizens of the country and worthy of <Col N="2132" /> holding the positions of trust in which they have been placed.  In conclusion, I have only to compliment the Minister on the advance he is making.  I hope he will continue on the lines suggested until we have this country as up-to-date as any country in the world and that we shall be able to cater fully, not only for our own people but that we shall still possess that old Irish courtesy and will be able to welcome to the country tourists from abroad and be able to provide them at least with decent hotels when they come into the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy stated in the course of his argument in favour of the amendment that the Act was being operated now contrary to the plan intended and announced when the Act was under discussion as a Bill in 1939.  That is correct.  The Act was introduced in 1939 in circumstances very different from those which prevailed during the past six years.  At that time, looking ahead and assuming the continuance of more or less normal conditions, it was contemplated that by far the greater part of the money made available to the Irish Tourist Board would be utilised for the improvement of hotel accommodation through the giving of financial advances to hotel proprietors and through the operation of the hotel registration system.  Only a small part of the total sum provided in 1939 was intended to be used for the development of facilities at holiday resorts but a change in plan was occasioned by the circumstances that developed. I explained to the House that when the Act began to function the war began also and the Government decided that the activities of the Irish Tourist Board should be confined to the planning of future development, which it was intended should be undertaken only when the war was over.  It was clearly not possible, therefore, for the board to proceed on the lines originally contemplated.  The improvement of hotel accommodation was not practicable because of supply difficulties, and hotel proprietors, in those times, were fearful of their own trade and were unwilling to enter into financial commitments on extensions of <Col N="2133" /> accommodation or the improvement of accommodation.</P>
      <P>The board, because it was confined to this planning activity, naturally concentrated upon the work of reviewing the facilities available at holiday resorts and the preparation of plans for the improvement of these resorts. At a later stage, when it appeared to the Government that the war was coming to an end, it was considered desirable that the board should be more active and the board was asked by the Government to bring forward as rapidly as possible the greatest number of these holiday resort development plans, not because we thought that was the most suitable way to develop the holiday business, but because the Government was anxious to have prepared by the Tourist Board, as it was anxious to have prepared by the Electricity Supply Board and other State and semi-State organisations, the maximum number of schemes with a high employment content.  None of these development schemes is being undertaken merely because of the employment given by them but the Tourist Board, like other similar organisations, was asked to put such schemes in the forefront of its programme so that after the war when the supply of materials began to revive and when work could be organised on a larger scale, the actual plans for the work would be there and no delay would be occasioned on that account. That is why the programme of the Irish Tourist Board at present appears to concentrate very largely on resort development projects and why a very high proportion of the total amount of money provided for the board will be used for such projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large part of the discussion here to-day related to what is a very temporary part of the board's activities, namely the acquisition of certain hotel properties with a view to their disposal later.  The main purpose for which this money will be expended is the development of resorts, the construction of public lavatories, the provision of public parks, bandstands and of recreational facilities which do not exist in many of these places at the moment.  If Deputy Giles wants a discussion of this matter against its <Col N="2134" /> historical background, let me tell him what the historical background is.  A generation ago holidays were the prerogative of the very wealthy classes. The great majority of the people in this or any other country never had any holidays at all.  In this country, for reasons to which it is not necessary to refer, the wealthy classes were, in the main, people of an alien extraction who preferred to spend their holidays outside the country.</P>
    <P>On that account the natural facilities available here for pleasant and enjoyable holidays were never fully developed. This country is extraordinarily backward in that regard. We have seaside resorts with unrivalled beaches; we have excellent fishing and shooting facilities and inland resorts of exceptional beauty, but in no case have they been developed as similar resorts elsewhere would have been developed, not primarily to attract tourists but to provide the people of the country with ample opportunity of enjoying these amenities.</P>
    <P>If we are to make good these arrears in national equipment, clearly the task of doing so must be organised in a systematic manner.  We could possibly leave that work to local authorities and hope that gradually and out of the local rates they would make good these deficiencies, but in the present circumstances it would be too much to hope that local authorities could devote money to that purpose and, therefore, the Government thought it desirable to set up a central organisation and give that organisation certain funds for the purpose. These funds are not being expended merely by way of grant or expenditure designed to provide facilities for the public.  It is hoped that the moneys expended by the Tourist Board will bring a profit to the board.</P>
    <P>Let me explain how the board works. In a particular holiday resort, such as Tramore, there was a large area of ground adjacent to the town, an area that was subject to flooding.  It was located behind the promenade and was ideally situated for development. It was undeveloped and was really little better than a swamp.  The board <Col N="2135" /> has spent a large amount of money on the reclamation of that land.  It employed the Construction Corps and provided a very useful scheme for the employment of that corps.  It has reclaimed that land and is now going to develop it in the form of a park, with recreational and amusement facilities. It hopes to make that property available for people who may want to provide hotels, cinemas, dance-halls or restaurants.  It will lease or sell portions of that property to people who will construct these buildings and in that way it will recover, in the sale price of the land so disposed of or by way of the rents that people will pay them, the total cost of the land, plus a profit.</P>
    <P>Deputies have asked on what basis development schemes have been given priority, why one resort was selected instead of another.  Not every resort lends itself to the type of development that the board has in mind.  The board must see some prospect of getting back its money.  Going to a seaside resort in order to build a promenade or a bandstand or make a public park or other useful amenity is not sufficient for the board unless it can acquire possession of adjoining property which its work will enhance in value and enable it to sell at a profit, thus recovering the whole expenditure.  The board selected for the preparation of development schemes the resorts obviously suited to operations of that kind as well as resorts that are well known and, therefore, likely to attract private enterprise in their development.  There are a number of places in this country, in County Cork, as Deputy McCarthy pointed out, and in other counties, where there are exceptional facilities at the seaside or inland, but where the development work may be a second stage development of the board's activities because at present it can most usefully engage all its funds and energies on the particular resorts I have named.</P>
    <P>I want to bring that particular aspect of the board's work into the picture, because it has tended to become obscured by the reference to hotels.  The board has acquired certain properties which it will hold for a few months.  Before this year is out it will <Col N="2136" /> have disposed of those properties to a new company which is to be established on an interim basis.  It will have no capital except what is required for the particular purpose of developing these properties.  It is intended, when the properties are developed, and when it is practicable to go to the public, that the company will be sold to the public on a basis which the board considers reasonable in all the circumstances.  The board was asked to acquire these properties because, during the war, they became available. They might have been, if not acquired by the board, acquired by other interests, or they might not have been acquired at all; they might have gone derelict.  In each case they were ideally suited for a particular type of hotel development.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that the board will engage in hotel business.  The board will develop these properties as hotels and get rid of them to the company which, at some stage, will be a public company with shareholders, managed by a board of directors elected by these shareholders.  These properties&mdash;there are only four or five&mdash;are located in areas where the only hotel business that can be undertaken is a holiday business. They will not be commercial hotels.  A commercial traveller will not go to Newtown Termonfeckin or Ballinahinch in the course of his ordinary commercial travellings.  Clearly the hotels in these places will be holiday hotels attracting people interested in fishing and shooting in the one case, and, in the other case, in seaside facilities and, therefore, the type of business these hotels will do will be determined by their location.</P>
    <P>The particular properties the board has acquired at the moment and is developing are not in competition with any private interests of a similar character in the same area.  The only actual hotel which the board has acquired&mdash;listening to Deputy McGilligan one would think that board had gone out to buy hotels all over the country, whereas it has bought only one hotel&mdash;is the one in Lisdoonvarna. There was a special reason for the acquisition of that hotel, why it should be acquired and developed on a considerable scale.  The board is financially <Col N="2137" /> interested, apart from its official functions, in the development of the Lisdoonvarna Spa.  There are considerable potentialities in developing the tourist traffic in Lisdoonvarna and the board considered that the expenditure of money in the construction of baths and the provision of other facilities would be of little purpose unless there was a good hotel, with adequate accommodation, in the immediate vicinity.  It acquired this hotel voluntarily and is expending on its development and enlargement a very much larger sum than the actual price paid for the original hotel.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the business of acquiring and developing hotels is a very small part of the board's activities, and a very temporary part.  In so far as hotel accommodation is concerned, the board's function is to stimulate private enterprise, to get private enterprise to provide hotels and supervise the accommodation provided, so that the name hotel will not be associated with any premises unless it is one that is worthy of being so described.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of the register. The board controls the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;, and only premises registered as hotels with it are entitled to describe themselves as hotels.  The board originally established a comparatively low standard of the accommodation required in order to acquire the use of that name. It will raise that standard.  It will insist on proper kitchens, proper lavatory accommodation, proper bedroom accommodation, and a standard of cleanliness and comfort that might reasonably be expected in places describing themselves as hotels.  It is prepared not merely to encourage hotel proprietors to develop to a higher standard, but is prepared to assist them with technical advice.  It has a staff of engineers and architects who are at the service of hotel proprietors to advise them on the lay-out, design and equipment to be provided.  It is prepared also to help them financially.</P>
    <P>I will have to deal more fully with the question of financial help to hotel proprietors.  This whole business of developing holiday facilities will not <Col N="2138" /> succeed unless private interests can be stimulated to provide, not merely hotel and restaurant accommodation, but all the other amusement facilities that one would expect to find at holiday resorts. The board can assist private enterprise. It can provide general amenities and facilities in resorts which will attract people to them.  All that will fail unless private initiative is there and is developed on right lines.  I stated that I wanted to deal more fully with the financial help to be given hotel proprietors.  The original scheme contemplated that the board would be in a position to make advances of money to hotel proprietors for the purpose of improvement.  I think it is true, as some Deputies stated, that very few hotel proprietors would want financial help of that kind at present.  They could borrow money probably from the banks as cheaply as the board might lend to them.  The board can only get the money it advances from the Exchequer and the Exchequer will have to be recouped at least the rate of interest and the board will need to add something to cover administrative costs.  It is probable, in fact, that the type of assistance the board could best give hotel proprietors is the guaranteeing of loans made to them by banks or by way of debentures issued in the ordinary way, rather than by direct cash advances.  I am having examined the adequacy of the board's powers in that regard.  I think most Deputies who know of the facilities for procuring money for development purposes at a low rate will agree that, in present circumstances, the hotel industry could best be assisted by guaranteeing advances, which would reduce the rate of interest, rather than making direct cash advances.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the establishment of a hotel in Limerick.  The board is naturally anxious to have a large well-managed hotel in Limerick, but it is endeavouring to get that hotel established by local enterprise.  It is prepared to assist financially by an investment in preference shares in a company formed for the purpose, but it is hoped that the hotel will be financed in the main by Limerick capital and by private enterprise.  If <Col N="2139" /> private enterprise in Limerick does not do so, if the board cannot stimulate it to provide the hotel accommodation that is required, the board must take more direct action.  It seems from discussions that have proceeded in Limerick that local business enterprises will do the job adequately, assisted by the board, not merely in a financial way, but, as I indicated, also by technical advice of one kind or another.  Similarly, in other areas, the board is endeavouring to stimulate local enterprise to get done what the board thinks should be done.</P>
    <P>I was asked if it was intended to build a hotel at Rineanna.  I do not think the board intends to build a hotel at Rineanna.  There is some difference in views as to whether a hotel in Rineanna is what is desired. The operating companies appear to think that transatlantic passengers staying overnight, or a couple of days, at the Shannon airport would prefer to reside in a hotel at Limerick or Ennis than a hotel at the airport. There are certain attractions in a city or a town where there are cinemas and other amusements rather than in a comparatively isolated country district. It will be necessary, however, for the airport authorities to consider the provision at the airport of overnight accommodation of a limited kind.  That problem of accommodation at the airport is having the attention not merely of the Government and of the Department, but of the operating companies at the present time.  There appears to be no doubt that, if the development of these transatlantic air services to the Shannon are associated with the development of the tourist business in that locality, that there will need to be a considerable development of hotel accommodation in the vicinity of Limerick, Ennis, Kilkee and other neighbouring towns.</P>
    <P>It has been an objection to the Irish Tourist Board that it does not include a hotel proprietor or a hotel manager. The Vocational Organisation Committee regarded that as a criticism, that it had not a hotel proprietor or a hotel manager on it.  Deliberately it was decided that such persons would <Col N="2140" /> not go on to the board.  The board was set up to control hotels, to establish a standard of accommodation, to see that hotels conformed to that standard, and to deny the right of the use of the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; to any hotel that did not conform to a standard considered reasonable.  Generally, it was to exercise supervision over the whole hotel industry.</P>
    <P>It was considered that the one class of person who ought not to be on the board was a person who himself had a financial interest in any form in any hotel or hotel company.  The board has got expert advice on hotel equipment and, on the basis of that advice, takes decisions concerning individual hotels. But the board is free of the charge, because of its composition, that it can be influenced in its judgement in relation to individual enterprise by persons financially interested in the hotel business. My advice to anyone responsible for nominating persons on it is not to put on the board anyone financially interested in the hotel business.</P>
    <P>The members of the board were picked because of their general suitability and for the particular qualifications which the individuals possessed.  I am quite certain that if any member of the Dáil had to pick people willing to act in that capacity he could pick as good a board which would contain as good members as the existing board. That does not condemn the existing board.  The chairman, Mr. J.P. O'Brien, was director of the Irish Tourist Association and has probably more experience than any other person of the tourist business.  At the time Mr. Thomas Condon was appointed he was chairman of the Irish Tourist Association. Mr. Joseph Gannon is an engineer as well as a business director, and because of these qualifications is particularly suitable to be on the board. Lord Monteagle was put on the board because he has had considerable experience in this and in other countries of matters with which the board is dealing. An Fear Mór has the reputation of running a very successful summer Irish college at Ring, County Waterford, for a number of years, and has had much experience of organisation of that type. These are the five people of whom Deputy McGilligan stated that anything <Col N="2141" /> he knew about them was not to their credit.  I am astonished at Deputy McGilligan making such a statement.  I know of nothing to their discredit.  I do not think anyone here knowing them could say anything of them in their personal capacities or as to their suitability for the board which would in any way reflect upon them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy and other Deputies complained that the board has been too reluctant to give information concerning its activities.  I think there is some basis for that criticism.  Perhaps the board was unduly cautious in their policy.  Certainly, I have not followed the same policy to-day.  I endeavoured to give the Dáil all the information that I could possibly give concerning the various activities of the board.  The board had reasons for its policy.  I explained already its method of operation. It goes to a particular resort with the idea of developing an area of that resort.  Having first acquired all the land in the vicinity selected and developed parks, promenades, bandstands, and amusement facilities, the property acquired would increase in value and the board would be able by sale in relation to the increased value to recover its expenditure.</P>
    <P>Now, clearly, they would not succeed in acquiring easily and cheaply the land adjacent to the land that was going to be developed if they announced in advance what they were going to do. Their reason for not publicising in detail their schemes was to prevent speculation in that land&mdash;driving the price up against them, and thus depriving them of the benefit of their investment.</P>
    <P>They have compulsory powers, it is true, and these compulsory powers may have to be used in certain cases, and may have to be used more extensively because of the information given to-day. The powers given in the principal Act are of a rather cumbersome character and the board have been reluctant to resort to these powers.  Instead of proceeding to announce the details of their scheme, they acquire property at its normal market value, on a willing seller and a willing buyer basis.  That is the proper and desirable method of proceeding.  It was because they wished to proceed in that way that the <Col N="2142" /> board deliberately endeavoured to withhold details of development schemes until they had acquired the property that they wanted to acquire.  If because of the publication of details here to-day, or of any further publication, the value of such property is unduly enhanced and schemes become impracticable on that account, the board will either have to drop the schemes or resort to compulsory acquisition when the value of the property will be assessed by arbitration.</P>
    <P>One other reason why the board has chosen certain resorts for development instead of others, and why progress in the case of some of these resorts has not been as rapid as the board would like, must be referred to.  Everything depends on the co-operation of the local authority.  Deputy McGilligan referred to the announcement by the Commissioner for County Dublin of his intention to undertake sewerage and water supply schemes in the Portmarnock area where property has been acquired by the board.  Clearly, the development of this area on the lines contemplated by the board would be impracticable unless the local authority co-operated by providing these public facilities&mdash;sewerage, water supply, and roads.  This was a private estate and the house was occupied by a single family.  The family had the estate for their own personal use.  The property was acquired by the board, and if it is to be developed, as the board contemplate, the full co-operation of the local authority is necessary.  The board intend to develop the property so as to enable them to dispose of portions of it to people who are prepared to build hotels, to put up shops, cinemas, cafés, restaurants and so forth.  That will not be practicable unless the public services required are provided by the local authority.</P>
    <P>In a number of the resorts that I have mentioned, the completion of the board's plans is being held up because the local authority, for one reason or another, is unable or unwilling to provide these services at the present time. Clearly, the successful operation of all the board's local resort development schemes depends fully upon the adequate co-operation of the local Authorities in the areas concerned.  I <Col N="2143" /> might also say it depends on the co-operation of the local business community. This did not arise in the case of Portmarnock, but it did at Tramore and other places, where the board promoted the establishment of a local company.  Persons interested in the development of the town and resident locally arrange for the collection of capital to be invested in the type of development to which I have referred, utilising the board's property for that purpose.  Until the board can see the prospect of such local effort being forthcoming on an adequate scale, it will be hesitant about undertaking the large expenditure involved in some cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan referred to the desirability of improving the standard of hotel service by the adequate training of hotel staffs.  That is one of the special functions given to the board. They are already organising classes for hotel chefs and other specialised hotel services.  I think that a great deal more can be done in that direction, and I should hope to see the day when a registered hotel would be a place that has a manager or a manageress who has acquired certain certificates of proficiency and experience in the business, and that the persons employed as hotel cooks would be persons who had undergone specialised training in that work.  I think there is a great deal to be done both by direct subsidisation of technical classes by the board and by the promotion of competitions, such as was suggested here.  By one means and another, I think we should endeavour to make it known to those engaged in this business that good service will attract trade, and to ensure that the all-round standard service will be sufficiently high to secure the reputation of the whole holiday business here.  It is quite obvious that, in one particular holiday resort, or in any particular area&mdash;it is probably true of the country as a whole&mdash;one badly run hotel, one place where the lavatories are not kept clean, where the beds are dirty or where the meals are not properly cooked or properly served, will cause such damage to the reputation of the whole area as to undermine <Col N="2144" /> and destroy the business of everybody else in the same area.  That is why it is reasonable enough to establish such an authority as the board with power to ensure that one badly run business will not be allowed to continue, thereby destroying the opportunity of advancing and improving all other similar businesses in the same locality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan also inquired as to the board's method of recruiting staff. The board's staff is not very large in number and, to some extent, consists of persons with specialised training.  It has engineers and architects as part of its specialised staff.  Its staff was recruited by means of advertisements in the public Press inviting applicants who were interviewed by a committee of the board.  They were placed in order of merit, as the committee judged it to be.  Those placed first on the list were appointed as required. Before leaving this subject, there is just one other point I want to dispose of, and that is the idea that the board is interested only in wealthy foreign visitors.  One of the purposes for which the board was set up was to develop holiday facilities for workers.  It is only in the last ten years or so that the idea of holidays for workers developed at all, and if workers are to be given holidays by law or by agreement with employers, it is obviously desirable that they be given also facilities to enable them to get good holidays at suitable holiday resorts and within their means.  The business of holiday hostels for workers in other countries was developed, sometimes by private enterprise and often as a Government project.  The construction of holiday camps in Great Britain and elsewhere may have had in mind the possibility of war-time mobilisation at a later stage, but, in all cases, so far as it has been possible to ascertain, these camps were very successful, and were operated on a profitable basis despite the fact that good meals and suitable accommodation were provided for workers at a very low cost.  One of the functions of the board is to promote the establishment, or to establish itself, of such holiday hostels at suitable centres, with the provision of suitable holiday accommodation for workers and their <Col N="2145" /> families.  Some of the properties which have already been acquired and to which I have referred will be developed as hostels, and the board is giving very special attention to that aspect of the work.</P>
    <P>I did not refer earlier to one particular activity upon which the board has been engaged during the war years. The Government asked it to carry out a systematic review of the athletic facilities available in every parish&mdash; parishes that had parish halls or playing fields, football fields, athletic grounds or swimming facilities.  The board carried out a very systematic survey of all the facilities of that kind in every parish, and that information is available to the Government.</P>
    <P>It may happen that it will not be the Irish Tourist Board which will be responsible for doing anything in relation to the provision of such facilities. However, the board was asked by the Government to carry out that survey and, on the basis of that survey, the Government may be able to take action, either directly or through local authorities, to make such facilities available to our people, particularly in the rural areas and smaller country towns.  Although the board will not neglect the possibility of the business of providing suitable holiday accommodation for people who can afford to pay for good holiday accommodation, it will have a very special function of ensuring that adequate holiday facilities will be available for everybody within their means.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the question of foreign tourists, about which Deputy McGilligan spoke at great length, although it is not of great importance at the moment.  I stated, in introducing the Bill, that the board is taking no steps, by means of publicity or otherwise, to attract such tourists in this year.  The reason is not that given by Deputy McGilligan.  The main reason is that we are not ready to receive them.  The number of hotel bedrooms in this country is very small, compared with our population&mdash;much smaller in relation to our population than the number of hotel bedrooms in other countries.  We have not got hotel accommodation for such tourists, but large numbers are coming.  We do <Col N="2146" /> not propose to stop them, but we are not going to take any measures to attract them or facilitate them in coming.  Many of them are going to come in any case.  A large number will be Irish people or people of Irish descent, coming home here to establish contacts with relatives and friends, and certainly they would regard it as a real hardship if the Government took any steps to prevent their coming.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are taking no steps to encourage them to come, because we are not ready for them.  If we had had five or six years of the work of the Tourist Board in developing resorts and improving hotel accommodation, then we would be glad to see them, but at the present time a large influx of visitors in such numbers could not be catered for adequately.  It might cause a great deal of dissatisfaction which would do us more harm than good in the future trade.  In the future, when the present scarcities have ceased and sterling is freely convertible into other currencies, then that business will be good business and it will be an export business, and export business is what we require if we are to build up the standard of life of our own people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky referred to hotel charges and I think Deputy McCarthy also mentioned the matter.  The board does not control hotel charges in the sense of fixing reasonable charges for the accommodation provided.  What the board does is this: Each registered hotel each year, as a condition of registration, is required to state what its charges are for various classes of accommodation, and those charges stated by the hotel to be its charges are published by the board in its handbook. The hotel goes off the register and is put out of business if the actual charges are more than those stated, the aim of the board being to ensure that there will not be any tendency on the part of a hotel proprietor to shove up charges on a likely prospect or a foreign visitor, or take advantage of any special rush of business to charge more.  They can fix any charge they like, but they must stick to it.  It is on the basis of that charge that they will be publicised by the Tourist <Col N="2147" /> Board, so that a person desirous of going to Killarney or any other resort can look up the Tourist Board handbook and select the hotel with charges within his means.  One thing the board will endeavour to ensure for him is that the scale of charges quoted in the handbook will be adhered to by the hotel when the visitor arrives seeking accommodation.</P>
    <P>I agree that the development of holiday business here requires an improvement in our travel facilities, though I would not agree that our travel facilities are altogether as bad as Deputy Cafferky represented them.  I think Deputy McCarthy was nearer the truth. It is certainly part of the whole general plan of development that, as circumstances make it possible, travel facilities will be improved in frequency and in price.  As the House is aware, the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann has already announced substantial reductions in transport charges, to operate as from 1st July next.  Even this year, there will be some expansion of omnibus services, because of the acquisition by the company of new omnibuses; and perhaps it is not beyond the bounds of probability that some expansion in rail services may also become practicable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan rightly stated that the House had difficulty in deciding whether the board had been proceeding on right lines, because of the short experience we have had of its operation. Some Deputies misunderstood the position.  Certainly, Deputy Coogan did, judging by his observations.  The board has not been working since 1939, either on registration of hotels, the improvement of accommodation or on development schemes.  For a period of five years after its establishment, the board was withdrawn, as it were, from active work and confined to planning work.  The part of the Tourist Act of 1939 concerning registration of hotels was brought into operation only in 1944, and was operated only in last year, and during that year they carried out inspection of hotel accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Section 15.  The board's staff would not be paid for by Government advances.  The total expenditure of £38,000 which the board is incurring this year&mdash;or, rather, the sum of £20,000, as the other £18,000 is for general publicity work&mdash;includes salaries of its technical staff, engineers, architects and surveyors, who have been there preparing these 18 detailed schemes now ready and upon which the board hopes to begin work in the present year, as well as other schemes which may be approved later.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cogan that it is, perhaps, unfair to ask the Dáil to pass judgement on the operation of the Irish Tourist Board, having regard to the limited knowledge we have of the lines on which they have proceeded.  I myself would have some hesitation in saying whether they are on sound lines or not, as it is really only in the last 12 months that they have been working on anything more than making plans, and in no case has any single project been brought to the point where judgment on it is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of these resorts is only in the initial stages and one man's view as to the success of a particular scheme for any resort is as good as another man's; so one would like to see a complete scheme in operation before giving an opinion.  Similarly, the improvement of accommodation at hotels is really only in its initial stage. The board could not set too high a standard during the emergency.  It would not have been reasonable to expect that hotel proprietors would go ahead and spend large amounts of money on furniture and equipment which only began to be procurable during the past year.  The reason why the Bill is being introduced now, however, is because the schemes already approved, the commitments already entered into, involve eventually a total expenditure larger than that for which <Col N="2149" /> the Dáil provided in 1939 and therefore it was considered necessary that the Dáil should be asked to amend the 1939 Act by raising that limit so that these schemes could, in fact, be embarked upon without committing the Dáil for a matter in regard to which it had not been consulted; and so that other schemes supplemental to these could be undertaken, now that it is possible to do so.  I should hope, however, that at some stage it will be possible to me to report that the board can embark upon still further activities, in which case further legislation will be required at a time when the Dáil will have more information concerning the work of the board and will be in a better position to pass reasonable judgment upon its work.</P>

      <P>The Minister rather minimises one matter which is, I think, of very great importance because it involves the greatest amount of money that has been spent up to the present time, that is, the question of these properties that are going to be handed over to a new company.  He indicates that within a few months a new company will be formed that will take over these properties and that in the development that will come along in time the new company will either turn itself into a public company or will sell the properties to another public company.  That is a very beautiful but very nebulous outline of what is going to happen and I suggest to the Minister that we would want at this particular stage definite information as to the number and the type of properties that are going to be carried over to this new company, the total amount of capital that will be involved in the properties handed over, and the nature of the company that is going to be set up to do this.  The Minister may not be in a position to elaborate that question to-night but I think it is a matter that requires much more detailed elaboration immediately.</P>

      <P>I could mention the properties in detail but I could not give a figure as to the total capital involved because that cannot be readily determined.  The board has acquired these properties.  I have already told the House what the board paid for <Col N="2150" /> these properties and it now has to develop them, but the actual cost of development can only be very provisionally estimated in each case.  The intention is that these properties will be developed as hotels and kept going as hotels.  It is hoped to show that they will be profitable as hotels and at that stage the company will issue its shares to the public when it is able to produce a balance sheet and prospectus which will attract subscriptions to the shares, and transform itself into a publicly owned company in that way.  It is considered better business from the point of view of the board to wait until it has hotels as going concerns to show the public rather than a number of country mansions yet to be developed as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £162,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1947, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including Public Concerts.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting for the year 1946-47 is £198,100, an increase of £112,437 on the Estimate for the previous year.  The main increases are in Sub-heads A, Salaries; B, Cost of Daily Programmes; E, Light and Power, and F, Plant and Equipment (including equipment for a Short Wave Station).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Sub-head A, there is an increase of £3,862.  The higher figure is attributable mainly to higher bonus payments, staff additions and increases in salaries.  Although the normal hours of broadcasting have not been increased the continuous efforts to improve the quality of the programmes within the existing hours by more intensive preparation, employment of <Col N="2152" /> larger casts, etc., make it necessary to expand the station organisation from year to year and to adjust salaries in certain cases to compensate the officers for the more exacting work they are called upon to perform.  This process of expansion must of course be continued as programmes develop in extent and character.</P>
    <P>The increase of £12,185 under Sub-head B is due in the main to provision for slightly increased payments to artists, higher cost of telephone trunk lines for outside broadcasts, provision for improvement of the programmes in Irish, including better facilities for getting material from the Gaeltacht and better arrangements for obtaining News supplies.</P>
    <P>In respect of Sub-head E, Light and Power, there is an increase of £3,300. It is due chiefly to the station being kept open for sponsored programmes after 11 p.m., to an increase in Electricity Supply Board charges which became effective during the past financial year, and to provision for heat, light and power for part of the current year for the proposed shortwave high power station to which I shall refer under the next sub-head.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F&mdash;Plant and Equipment. As Deputies will see from the details of the sub-head, the most substantial part of the increase of £92,915 in this sub-head is due to provision for equipment for a high power shortwave station.  The Government has decided that it is desirable that this country should have such a station available for broadcasting overseas.  In anticipation of Dáil sanction for the expenditure, preliminary arrangements have been made for getting the equipment for the transmitter at Athlone and setting up the organisation to deal with the programmes. Provided no unforeseen hitches occur, the station may be ready to begin operations by the end of April, 1947.  The sum included in the sub-head for equipment is £89,000, which, together with smaller sums in other sub-heads, brings the total Vote provision for the shortwave station this year to £92,000.  Apart from the shortwave station equipment, the extra provision in sub-head F is for mobile recording apparatus to get outside programme material, and for items of equipment <Col N="2153" /> for the existing stations which could not be procured during the war.  No provision is made in the Estimate for programme operation costs for the proposed new station and if, as now anticipated, it will be necessary to get programme staff, etc., in the current financial year to prepare in advance for actual operation, I may have to come to the Dáil for a supplementary provision.</P>
    <P>The variations in the sub-heads of the Estimate other than those to which I have referred are small in amount and are due to casual causes.</P>
    <P>Revenue from wireless licences in the financial year ended 31st March, amounted to approximately, £109,000 (the original estimate being £107,000) and from advertisements etc., to approximately, £15,000, as against an estimate of £3,200, i.e., there was a total revenue of £124,000.  This represents an increase on the revenue for the previous year of almost £13,000. The estimated revenue for the current year is £107,500 from licences and £17,760 from advertisements, i.e., a total revenue of £125,260.  The information available since the Estimate was prepared indicates, however, that the licence revenue will be higher than shown, as the licences are again on the upgrade and the sum to be obtained from advertisements is likely to be substantially more than estimated. The total expenditure, including expenditure by other Departments on services rendered to broadcasting, is estimated at £244,293.  On the figures, as estimated, therefore, there will be a deficit of £119,033.  A great part of the deficit is, as Deputies will appreciate, due to the proposed expenditure on the shortwave station.</P>
    <P>I shall now refer in a general way to the programmes of the past year.  A marked increase has been noticeable in public interest in the broadcasting programmes and the policy of aiming at a high standard has been well justified. This has been particularly noticeable in the sphere of music.  It is safe to say that the public symphony concerts have by now become a part of the life of Dublin and, through the radio, of the country.  The strengthening of the orchestra has been of great <Col N="2154" /> help and has been reflected in a higher level of performance and a wider field of musical works.  On December 9th, 1945, was given the fiftieth public symphony concert in the present series.  During the season 1944-45, the attendance at these concerts averaged over 80 per cent. of the capacity of the Capitol Theatre, and the attendance at the concerts from October to Christmas, 1945, and January to March, this year, sustained that high level.  Generally, the orchestra has made much progress and the members are very much encouraged by the generous support they receive when the orchestra plays in public.</P>
    <P>The policy of encouraging musical organisations in Dublin and throughout the country has been adhered to.  A number of important concerts were relayed from Waterford, Cork, Cóbh, Dungarvan and Kilkenny, and we have had broadcasts of oratorio from Dublin and Cork.  We also had relays of church choirs from many places, including Cork, Limerick, Tuam, Carlow, Arklow and from a number of centres in Dublin.  Musical activity, in general, is on the increase and a great deal of the credit for this condition of affairs is, undoubtedly, due to broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Irish Language Broadcasts.  &mdash;The encouragement of the study and use of Irish is being steadily pursued.  The series of lessons under the title &ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo; is being followed closely by a large body of listeners.  The lessons began on the 2nd March, 1945, and were broadcast on Tuesdays and Fridays of every week up to the middle of June.  The same series was repeated from September, 1945, to January of the present year and the second and more advanced series is now being broadcast regularly twice weekly.  Of the popularity of these lessons, we have abundant evidence of various kinds. Letters from listeners in all parts of Ireland, and others from England, Wales, Scotland and even as far afield as Brittany and southern France have poured in for many months, all of them approving the scheme, and, of course, making all sorts of suggestions for its improvement.  The booklet containing the text of the lessons reached a sale <Col N="2155" /> of nearly 30,000 copies, and a second edition, in which a phonetic reproduction of the Irish text was included, 11,000 copies.  The Gramophone Company (His Master's Voice) recorded the Gaelic text, an invaluable aid to listeners who want to return to the sound again and again.  The outcome of this scheme, which will, of course, continue and develop for several years, will be of extreme interest to language-workers. In addition to these instructional broadcasts, there continues to be a wide variety of Irish language features, including plays, talks, dramatisations, short stories, book reviews and anniversary features.</P>
    <P>Programmes in English.  &mdash;Programmes in English continue to range over an immensely wide field.  There can hardly be any subject of general interest or importance, or of national value, that is not covered in one way or another.  Special events, such as the Davis and Young Ireland Centenary and Military Tattoo were made the subject of broadcasts of different kinds, designed to appeal to a wide public.</P>
    <P>Particular efforts have been made to arrange talks of interest and assistance to farmers, with notable success in one series, which, after a successful run last year, has been revived.  There are many difficulties to be surmounted in this matter, but it is felt that, when plans at present under consideration have been fully worked out, most of them will be overcome and a better service achieved.  During the war, one of the major difficulties was that many of those farmers who possessed wireless sets were dependent on batteries and the scarcity of these made listening impossible.  That position has now somewhat improved.</P>
    <P>One of the surest and most satisfactory indications of an increased interest in the programme generally is to be seen in the space now being given to comment on them in the newspapers. A number of papers now run a weekly radio column and the writers of these columns are in constant touch with the broadcasting service and are supplied with information on the programmes, on broadcasting policy and on future <Col N="2156" /> plans.  It is clear that these columns would not be published if the newspapers concerned did not feel that they would have a big interest for their readers and the way in which they are being conducted tends to keep readers well informed and to induce a balanced judgment of the programmes.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Advisory Commitmittee has met at fairly regular intervals, usually once a month, and has been most helpful to the Director of Broadcasting in the examination of current programmes and the discussion of suggestions for improvements and for new features.  The debt of gratitude which we already owed to the committee has been substantially increased during the past year.</P>
    <P>In the past, I have suggested that Deputies might confine their remarks on this Estimate to matters of general principle or policy.  I repeat that suggestion. Detailed queries or recommendations can be dealt with more readily and satisfactorily by correspondence with the director or by personal discussion with the directorate staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that my notice to raise this question on the adjournment has compelled the Minister to return to the House after only a very short interval.  I intend to be brief on this question.  For the past five or six years, there was carried on a world war which was somewhat on the same lines as the war of 1914-18, but on a more extensive scale.  We all remember that, after the 1914-18 war, there was an immediate collapse in agricultural prices. The recent war terminated last year and there has been a growing fear amongst farmers that one of the future effects of the termination of that struggle would be a collapse in agricultural prices again.  History has an irritating habit of repeating itself, and farmers are inclined to fear that there may be a repetition of the conditions <Col N="2157" /> which prevailed after the last war, and it is therefore with great anxiety that farmers have learned that the prices obtainable by producers for wool during the coming season are likely to be substantially lower than they were last year.  This anxiety has been increased by the fact that the Government has announced that the maximum prices fixed two years ago have been revoked.</P>
      <P>At the time this Maximum Prices Order was made, farmers and sheep raisers generally resented the Order, because they felt it was a deliberate attempt to deprive them of the natural advantage which would accrue to them by reason of the law of supply and demand which would have had the effect, were it not for the Order, of increasing the price of wool.  Thus, we have a position in which, when the producer had the prospect of obtaining a satisfactory price for his produce, an Order was made by the Minister fixing maximum prices for wool, so that the farmer would not get the price which the ordinary law of supply and demand would have provided; but now, when there is a prospect of wool prices falling, there is no move on the part of the Government to fix a minimum price in order to protect the producer.  It may have been necessary and desirable to protect the consumer two years ago, but I think it is equally necessary and desirable to protect the producer to-day.</P>
      <P>This State depends upon the continued activity, energy and enterprise of the producer, and there is no body of producers in the State who have to work harder, who have to face greater difficulties, than those engaged in the sheep raising industry.  That industry is conducted extensively in the West of Ireland by the very small land holders and in Leinster to a very great extent by the farmers in the hilly districts on land which is of very inferior quality. These people have to struggle hard against very adverse circumstances in order to make ends meet, and if there is one section of the producing community who ought to be protected it is those engaged in the sheep raising industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago this Party put down a motion which sought to provide guaranteed prices for the chief products <Col N="2158" /> of agriculture, and, in advocating that motion we named the principal products for which we sought protection. Dairy produce, bacon pigs, wheat, beet and also wool were included.  The Minister for Agriculture adopted a very sympathetic attitude towards that motion and while expressing doubt with regard to the possibility of guaranteeing a price for wool, he did not definitely turn it down.  The Minister has a comfortable and perhaps a safe habit of being a little uncertain about matters which are very contentious, and he did not come down definitely for securing a price for the wool producer or against it.</P>
    <P>In putting down this question to-day, I was seeking from the Minister an assurance that he is standing firmly for security of prices for the agricultural producer, and particularly in connection with a commodity such as wool which is a commodity which can be controlled and regulated.  The Minister for Agriculture and also the Taoiseach announced that agricultural products which are uniform in quality are capable of being protected and guaranteed in regard to price, and I think it will be agreed that wool is a commodity which can be graded and which, in the different grades, is uniform in quality.  Therefore, it is a product for which the protection of an assured price can be given.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell us about the interest of the consumer in this matter, but the price of wool forms a very small part of the price which the consumer pays for woollen products.  For example, tweed sold by weight would probably be in the region of 22/-, 23/- or 24/- per lb., whereas the price of wool has not exceeded on an average 2/6 per lb., and it is likely, even though it is not demanded by sheep owners, that it should exceed 2/6.</P>
    <P>Thus it will be seen that to give a fair price for wool would mean only a very small fraction of the price which the consumer has to pay for the finished product.  I think the Minister himself has on a number of occasions suggested the desirability of giving the farmer an assured price and a secure market for his products as far as possible, and wool is certainly one of the products for which that security can <Col N="2159" /> be given.  The Minister's reply to my question to-day was very unsatisfactory and will cause very grave anxiety and misgiving amongst the humble producers throughout the length and breadth of the country, and I think he should reconsider the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, thought the Minister did not give a satisfactory answer to Deputy Cogan's question because it is only fair that, if he saw fit to fix a maximum price a few years ago, when there was a prospect of wool increasing in price, he should fix a minimum price now, or at least give, so far as possible, an assurance that the price will be reasonable.  Wool is produced on most of the large and small farms in the part of the constituency I come from.  In Kilmaine, Shrule and Hollymount the people go in for wool production on a pretty large scale.  It is regarded there as a very useful sideline.  It may not be the main agricultural output in that area, but it is a very useful thing to fall back upon.  These people, as well as wool producers in other parts of the country, maintained that 2/6 a lb. was not sufficient to encourage wool production, especially when the price of the finished product, as has been pointed out by Deputy Cogan, was not in keeping with what the wool producer was getting. If there cannot be an assurance given that some price will be fixed for wool, it would be very wrong to try to encourage the people to go in for the production of wool on anything like a large scale.  There is no doubt but that once the price of wool starts to come down it definitely can come down in such a way that it may reach the stage it reached ten or 12 years ago.  Therefore I say that there should be a minimum price fixed for wool, especially as the Department fixed a maximum price for it at a time when, if the price of wool had been allowed to go ahead, it would have probably reached twice the amount which the Department fixed.  Therefore I say that the Minister should reconsider the matter. He gave no assurance in reply to the question put to him to-day.  I can assure him that if a minimum price is not fixed he will be taking a good step in the direction of doing away with <Col N="2160" /> wool production and the sheep-raising industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with Deputy Cogan and Deputy Commons with regard to fixing a price for wool.  We all know the importance of sheep-raising in many constituencies in the Twenty-Six Counties. As the previous speaker pointed out, while the Minister took steps to control the price of wool during the emergency, he did not take the same interest in controlling the price of the articles produced from the wool and the people had to pay a high price for these articles, while the producer of the raw material was prevented from getting the market value of the raw material. Wool production is very important.  A short time ago I had the pleasure of going through the Foxford Woollen Mills which Deputy Dillon mentioned to-day and I saw what can be produced from Irish wool.  The manager of the factory pointed out to me articles that can be produced from Irish wool in competition with imported wool.  We know the propaganda there is against the use of Irish wool.  To-day we were talking about what industries we could establish to maintain our people at home.  If we could establish industries in the Gaeltacht like the one at Foxford it would help to give employment to the people there.  There will be no hope of doing that if the Minister will not make some effort to preserve the wool industry in Galway and Mayo, where they specialise in sheep-rearing. If he does not take steps in that direction, I am afraid the result will be that farmers will get out of sheep-rearing, because it would not pay them unless they get some reasonable guarantee as to the price they will get for their wool.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The withdrawal of the Minimum Price Order will not affect the price of wool.  Something else, of course, may affect it and bring down the price other than the withdrawal of the Minimum Price Order.  I want to support the other Deputies, however, so far as saying that previous to the <Col N="2161" /> emergency there was great discontent amongst farmers owing to the way wool prices ranged.  After selling their wool they found that the price was doubled before the end of the season. That was a matter that needed attention even before the emergency, namely, controlling the price right up from the producer to the manufacturer.  Everyone is aware that all the wool produced in this country was not used within the country previous to the emergency.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether that is so at present.  Certainly there was discontent about the way the price ranged from May, June and July during the shearing season, when the farmers generally disposed of their wool, and the end of the season when the price was probably doubled.  As a consequence the buyers had an advantage at the expense of the farmers.  I ask the Minister to keep that in mind if he is giving consideration to this matter in the future.  He should try to keep the price level throughout the season and allow a small margin of profit to the buyer, so that the rich manufacturers will not be reaping a profit of 100 per cent. at the expense of the farmer.</P>

      <P>Let us consider this suggestion that there should be a fixed minimum price for wool as a practical proposition, leaving aside all suggestions of propaganda.  What are the Deputies putting forward as a serious and practical proposition?  They propose that there should be a minimum price fixed for wool.  I presume they realise what that means.  It means that we fix a price to be paid and make it an offence for any person to sell or to buy wool below that price. I wonder have they given that matter full consideration.  Do they think they are conferring a benefit on the wool producers by making that suggestion? We can fix the minimum price for wool on the basis of the world price or we can fix it above the world price. There is obviously no sense in fixing a price equivalent to the world price of wool because the farmers will get that price anyway.  Their wool will not be sold at less than the world price.  Supposing we fix a minimum price above the world price and make <Col N="2162" /> it an offence for the farmer to sell wool below that price, what guarantee have you that he will be able to sell his wool at all?  Imported wool is becoming available now.  The manufacturers will buy the wool available to them at the lowest price.</P>

It is clear from what Deputy Cafferky has said in his attempt to answer my question that you must do more than fix a minimum price for wool&mdash;you must compel people to buy at that price.  There is no good in fixing a minimum price if nobody is going to pay that price and if the farmer has no sale for his wool.  You have got to create a situation in which people must buy wool at that price. Is that not so?</P>

      <P>It is not sufficient to fix a minimum price.  You must compel manufacturers to buy the wool if you fix a price above the world price.  The suggestion is made that we did the farmers an injustice when we fixed a maximum price.  What maximum price <Col N="2163" /> did we fix?  We fixed for 1944 the actual price that was paid in 1943.  That was not merely double the pre-war price but it was 30 per cent. above the world price.  In 1944, they got the maximum price but they did not get it in 1945.  The situation in 1945 had changed and the maximum price was not realised for the whole of the wool crop.</P>

      <P>The maximum price was fixed not to deprive the producers of any benefit but to prevent certain racketeers making a profit on the wool.  The effect of fixing the price was to get for the farmers in 1944 the same price as they got in 1943 and to eliminate the racketeering that had developed in 1943.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the maximum price was not paid in 1945.  There is no point in fixing a maximum price if people are not prepared to pay that maximum price.  The maximum price was fixed in 1944 on the basis of the actual price paid for wool in 1943&mdash;that is double the pre-war price and 30 per cent. above the world price.  As I say, the maximum price was not realised for the whole of the wool crop for 1945. A substantial part of our wool crop is exported because it is a type of wool that is not used here.  We have no machinery to use that wool.  Are you going to fix a minimum price for the wool which you must export?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The Foxford mills use a very substantial quantity of native wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact a large part of our wool crop, what we call black-faced wool, is not used here.  Its main commercial use is the manufacture of carpets.  Some carpets are manufactured in this country but the bulk of the wool crop is exported.  You cannot get for that wool a price above the world prices.  You cannot compel a <Col N="2164" /> buyer in other countries to observe any minimum price which is above the world price.  He will buy our wool, if he thinks he is getting it at a price which gives him equal value as wool which he can get from other countries. Our woollen industry is an important one.  It is one of the industries in which we did a substantial export trade in the past, and it is one of the industries on which we must rely to develop an export trade in the future. To some extent we are allowing the export of specialised types of cloth at present in order to develop that future export trade.  The prospects of developing that export trade are very good but we cannot look for any expansion in that trade unless we are prepared to permit our woollen manufacturers to acquire wool at the same price at which their competitors in other countries can acquire wool.</P>
      <P>I am putting this issue first.  I am not discussing this question on the basis of agricultural policy.  I am discussing it on the basis of general economic policy.  My concern during the war was to ensure that there were maximum supplies of goods available for the people at the lowest price at which they could reasonably be made available.  It is a complete fallacy to argue from the particular case of wool to the general issues of agricultural policy.  There is a Government decision already announced to proceed on the basis of fixed prices for various agricultural products but that policy cannot apply to wool.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan is completely wrong in his history.  Agricultural prices did not fall after the last war.  After the last war agricultural prices rose to a much higher point than they had reached during the war.  After the last war, the various controls that were imposed on prices and supplies were repealed. They were repealed too soon and the inflationary forces which war always releases came into operation. The price of commodities rose in 1919, 1920 and 1921 to a far higher level than they had during the war.  The cost-of-living index reached its highest point in 1921 and the collapse in prices did not take place until 1929.</P>

      <P>There was an alteration of money values.  Shall I put it this way&mdash;there was an alteration in money values in 1925 following the restoration of the gold standard in Britain.  Britain adopted that policy which reacted upon us here.  The value of money appreciated and prices fell but the collapse in agricultural values, in relation to the values of other commodities, was a consequence of the world depression which began in 1929. I think the Governments of the world have learned a lot since.  The mistakes made after the last war are not being made now.  The action that is being taken now may be mistaken also but at least they are not making the same mistakes that were made after the last war.  What the consequences of the present controls or the maintenance of the policy that is being operated by individual States now may be, no one can forecast but I think it is a reasonably fair assumption that because they are not making the same mistakes as were made after the last war the results will be different, and there is no likelihood of a collapse in agricultural prices generally as far ahead as one can see.  I do not think that that applies in the case of wool. There is a large supply of wool in the world and the restricted output of clothing is not due to scarcity of wool. There is, in fact, several years' wool crop stored in all parts of the world, but there is a deficiency in spinning and weaving capacity.  Our problem in disposing of the supplies of wool we have is due to the absence of adequate spinning and combing plant.  It was not possible to use the whole of the native wool crop or indeed some special qualities of wool which were imported.  We had to make an arrangement by which some proportion was exported to Britain to be combed into wool tops which are the raw material of the spinning mills.  We had more weaving capacity than <Col N="2166" /> spinning capacity so that there were a number of bottle-necks which reduced the total output of cloth here.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputies that they should consider this matter more fully than they appear to have done.  I am not by any means satisfied that any benefit would accrue to farmers by fixing a minimum price.  Certainly the fixing of a minimum price alone will not mean that they will be able to sell all the wool they have at that price. If you want to make a minimum price effective, you must create an artificial scarcity of wool so that people will be prepared to pay that price.  I do not think that the circumstances require that we should create an artificial scarcity of woollen garments.  On the contrary, national economic policy requires that we should develop not only our woollen cloth production capacity but, if possible, develop it to the stage where we shall be able to build up an export trade because it is one of the few industrial commodities for which we have a reasonable prospect of getting into the export market on a big scale.</P>

      <P>Is there not a danger of the Irish wool producer being exploited by the exporters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  It is at least certain that the Irish wool producer will get the world price for his wool.  Arrangements are being made internationally to prevent the marketing of wool supplies in such a manner as to depress the price because clearly a rapid fall in world prices would have an effect on production.  The great wool producing countries are themselves taking measures in order to ensure that there will not be any rapid fall in prices which would curtail future production.</P>
