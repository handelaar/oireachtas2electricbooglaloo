      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the inadequate train service between Newmarket and Cork City is causing serious inconvenience to the people of North Cork, and if so, if he will direct Córas Iompair Éireann to make provision for a train from Newmarket to connect with the early train leaving Mallow for Cork and also to provide a train from Banteer to Newmarket to connect with the train which leaves Cork at 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is at present one passenger rail service each way daily between Newmarket and Cork. There is also an omnibus service which allows passengers from Newmarket to have a day in Cork and to return the same evening.  I am informed by Córas Iompair Éireann that an increase in the railway service between these points would involve the use of an additional engine, which is not at present available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the train leaves Newmarket at 11 a.m. and gets into Cork at 1.30, during the dinner hour, and leaves again at 2.30, so that people cannot do any business?  Can the Minister do anything to improve the service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The service cannot be improved at present by the provision of an additional train.  Of course, there is no place where the service is fully <Col N="834" /> satisfactory and cannot be until there is more equipment available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to give a train service from Banteer to Newmarket?  The engine is there for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is a general demand from the people of Ballyhooly and Castletownroche for a bus service to connect these districts with Cork City; and if he will direct Córas Iompair Éireann to take steps to provide a suitable bus service for those populous districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that Córas Iompair Éireann have received requests for a bus service to connect Ballyhooly and Castletownroche with Cork City.  These places are already served by train.  Prior to the emergency there was a bus service between Castletownroche and Cork which the company hope to restore as soon as the vehicle position permits.  They never operated a bus service to Ballyhooly. The question of introducing new services will be considered when normal time-tables have been restored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. P.J. Fogarty Mr. P.J. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there has been no petrol available in Swords for the past ten <Col N="835" /> days; that the absence of petrol supplies has caused considerable inconvenience to farmers in the area who have new potatoes and other vegetables to dispose of in the Dublin markets; and if he will take steps to see that the position is immediately remedied and to ensure that there will not be a recurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there has been no petrol available in Swords during the period referred to and inquiries made by me do not support the Deputy's suggestion.  I find that during the period from the 25th June, 1946, to 9th July, 1946, a total quantity of 1,975 gallons of petrol was delivered to motor spirit retailers in Swords and that during this period orders for supplies received by the oil distributing companies from these retailers were promptly executed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that out of 100 lorries in Rush area, only 30 were able to attend the Dublin markets last week due to the failure of the Department to forward petrol coupons to the lorry owners for the month of July; and if he will state the reasons for the delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that out of 100 lorries in the Rush area only 30 were able to attend the Dublin markets during the period referred to by the Deputy.  In the absence of particulars of the lorry owners concerned and the dates on which evidence of the taxation of their vehicles reached my Department, I am unable to accept the statement that the absence of the lorry owners from the Dublin markets was due to the failure of my Department to forward petrol coupons to them for the month of July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a number of ship owners in Arklow who are classed as groups comprised of individuals and a limited company have been refused the right to vote for the election of shipping members on the Harbour Boards of Dublin and Cork, owing to the non-inclusion of such groups in the appropriate section of the Harbours Act, 1946, and if he will take steps to have the Act amended at an early date to remedy this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the returning officers at Dublin and Cork have taken legal opinion and have been advised that when a vessel is owned jointly by a number of individuals and a limited company, the owners do not come within any of the categories of qualified electors specified in Section 7 of the Harbour Act, 1946.  These categories include (a) a body corporate, (b) an individual and (c) a group of individuals.</P>
      <P>The next elections of these harbour boards will not take place until 1948. In the meanwhile I will have the matter considered in conjunction with any amending harbour legislation which may become desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been directed to the announcement that Irish Shipping, Limited, have entered into contracts with the British shipbuilding firm, Messrs.  John Readhead and Sons, South Shields, for the building of two cargo liners; whether he will state if these contracts were placed as the result of competitive tendering on the part of Messrs.  Readhead and Sons; <Col N="837" /> whether any Irish firms were invited to submit tenders for the building of either of these ships, or for any part of the work; and whether he will make a statement as to the position generally concerning the shipbuilding and the ship-repairing industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Irish Shipping, Limited, have placed the order to which the Deputy refers.  I am satisfied that Irish Shipping, Limited, are most anxious to place orders with Irish shipbuilding firms. They are keeping in constant touch with the Liffey Dockyard Company, but this firm are not yet quite ready to undertake the building of vessels of the type required.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive statement as to the general position of the shipbuilding and ship-repairing industry in this country could not conveniently be made in reply to a Dáil question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer that portion of the question which inquires whether he will state if these contracts were placed as a result of competitive tendering on the part of this particular firm and whether any Irish firms were invited to submit tenders for the building of either of these ships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no Irish firms in a position to build ships of this type at present.  If Irish firms were in a position to accept orders for this type of ships, they would get them from Irish Shipping, Limited.  In present circumstances, it is a question of getting orders accepted anywhere, rather than seeking competitive tenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the placing of the contracts with this firm the result of the submission of competitive tenders or was the firm selected without any competitive tenders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the result of a <Col N="838" /> diligent search over the whole world to get a firm that would accept the contract.</P>

      <P>As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Reports.</P>
      <P>The statement is as follows:&mdash;(i) The total sum paid by way of salaries, fees and allowances to the chairman, the registrar and other members and officials of the Trade Union Tribunal is £282 for the period that the tribunal was in operation; (ii) the other expenses of the tribunal, such as the cost of advertisements, etc., were borne as part of the ordinary expenditure of the Department, and it would not be possible to segregate the figures for the tribunal without an expenditure of time which would not be justified; (iii) the tribunal sat on 25 occasions; (iv) 12 applications were made to the tribunal for sole determinations; (v) the following are particulars of the applications:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no information which would suggest that the water supply to the Swords and Malahide area is unfit for drinking or other domestic purposes.  Recently the local authority, following a complaint received regarding the taste of the water supply to Malahide, which is part of the same system which supplies Swords, had samples of the water analysed both chemically and bacteriologically. These analyses showed that whilst the supply was quite safe for drinking or other domestic purposes, the taste had been affected owing to the use of a temporary chlorinating plant during a period when the permanent plant was under repairs.  The latter plant has now been reinstalled and there should be no further cause of complaint regarding the taste of the water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to these allegations.  In making them, Deputy Costello did not give any names or dates or particulars of the offence.  I infer, however, from previous observations made by the same Deputy on 13th <Col N="845" /> March last (Dáil Reports, Volume 99, No. 19, columns, 2401-2402) that the offence in question was the murder of two police officers in Dublin on the 16th August, 1940.</P>
      <P>I need hardly say that the offence of murder was not created by any Government Order, or that the penalty for that offence has always been death.</P>
      <P>Emergency Powers Order No. 41 of 1940, which was the relevant Order in this case, did not create the offence of murder, or any offence: its effect, as regards this case, was to prescribe the mode of trial and the method of execution. The power to make such an Order was vested in the Government by an Act which was passed by both Houses, without dissent, in June, 1940.</P>
      <P>As regards the alleged non-availability of the Order, I shall quote the words used by the High Court judge who refused to make an absolute order of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the case.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In regard to another objection made as to the contents of Orders 41 and 41A not being available to the accused, or rather to their legal advisers, I need only say that the evidence before me now is that extracts&mdash;the material portions, I presume&mdash;of these Orders were read out by counsel for the State at the trial, and that the Orders were handed in, but both the accused men stated that they did not intend to make any defence.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>There is some delay on telephone calls between Ballybunion and Listowel, and arrangements are being made to provide an additional circuit as soon as the circumstances permit.

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is in a position to make a statement as to the Government's decision in respect of Dr. Ward, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, with special reference to his pension as Parliamentary Secretary, and the arrangements which it is proposed to make regarding the substitution of persons holding public appointments and the association of Parliamentary Secretaries with private business activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At its meeting on Friday last the Government accepted Dr. Ward's resignation from the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health with effect as from Saturday last.</P>
      <P>As regards pension, the Government decided not to propose any change in the existing law.  In the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, no provision is made for the forfeiture of a pension applied for and awarded under that Act, but provision is made for its abatement or reduction by reference to any payments out of public moneys which the recipient of a pension may continue to receive.  There are other enactments dealing with the forfeiture of pensions, but it would not be proper for me to speculate as to the circumstances in which they might or might not be applicable in this case. The Government's intention is to let the law take its course and not to introduce legislation to change the existing law in so far as it may apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to arrangements regarding substitutes for persons holding public appointments, certain provisions are contained in Section 38 of the Local Government Bill which has been passed by the Dáil.  These affect officers under local authorities and <Col N="850" /> enable the appropriate Minister in special circumstances to authorise the holder of an office to perform its duties during a particular period by a deputy nominated by the holder with the approval of the Minister.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health has accepted an amendment in the Seanad to this section providing for a review every six months of any arrangements thus made for the performance of the duties of an office by deputy.  When this amendment comes before the Dáil an opportunity will be provided for a debate within the limits allowable under Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>In the case where the holder of an office is a member of the Dáil the question of the performance of his duties has of course certain peculiar aspects.  This case requires special consideration, particularly where the office holder is a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister.  On the resumption of parliamentary business after the recess I propose to take steps to set up a committee or commission to examine this case.  The body set up could be asked also to consider and report on the question of the association of Deputies, Senators, Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers with private business activities.  It could also be asked to consider the more general question of the privileges of members of the House and of the standards of conduct which they may be expected to observe.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has not reported that Dr. Ward was guilty of any improper conduct in the actual execution of the duties that pertained to his Parliamentary Secretaryship.  But the findings of the tribunal made it inevitable that he should no longer remain a Parliamentary Secretary.  The public interest demands that the highest standard of conduct be maintained by those who occupy positions of trust and responsibility in Governmental administration. The punishment for any failure to maintain this standard is necessarily severe.  It is exceptionally severe in Dr. Ward's case in view of the position he held and the public services he rendered in the past.  As an administrator he proved himself <Col N="851" /> energetic, able and efficient.  During the past 14 years as Parliamentary Secretary he superintended the preparation of a number of important measures and piloted them through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In recent times he devoted himself with customary energy to planning for the extension of the public health and medical services.  I regret the loss of the services which he would have been capable of rendering in the future.  The circumstances which make it impossible that he should render these services any longer are a matter of regret and pain to all of us.</P>

The purpose of this amendment is to expand the reference to the function of the proposed institute in the matter of testing and analysing commodities. The House will remember that some apprehension was expressed that the powers given to the institute in the form in which they were set out in the Bill as introduced might be used to the detriment of public analysts and others who did the work of analysing and testing commodities as a business.  It was never intended that the institute should act in that way, and the purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that its function will be to test and analyse commodities only in the circumstances set out in the amendment.</P>

      <P>The class of person who would take up this position in a labour court would require to be a person of outstanding ability and such a person might very reasonably display, in fact, would require to display, a certain independence of judgment.

He ought to be in just the same position as a judge in a court, and in fact in most cases he will be making decisions which will have far greater effect than very many decisions by judges in the courts.  I feel that he ought to have the status and the security of a judge, so as to be able calmly and justly to consider the questions coming before him in all their ramifications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not without some sympathy with the point of view expressed by the Deputy, but there are practical considerations to be advanced against the amendment.  It is quite true that the person who is to be appointed chairman of the court should be of outstanding ability and integrity, and that he should not be subject to arbitrary removal.  At the same time, it will be appreciated that a great deal will depend on the suitability of the person chosen.  If we give the chairman and the other members of the court the tenure suggested by the Deputy, it will mean that we will make a permanent choice, and have no power to rectify the position if we find by experience that the choice was not the best.  The reason why it is proposed to have the tenure of office for a fixed period of years for the chairman and other members of the court is to permit of the possibility of a change <Col N="862" /> being made, if the person appointed proved to be not as suitable or as satisfactory as we might hope he would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Five years is suggested. The considerations that apply here are somewhat different from those that apply in other courts and, consequently, there is not precisely the same problem arising in selecting an individual to be chairman.  The reason why I presume it is regarded as constitutionally desirable that a High Court or any other court judge should not be removed by the Executive is, because judges will have frequently to adjudicate in cases in which the Government as such is an interested party.  The Government will not be always interested in the decisions of this court.  Its sole concern will be to ensure that the court does function to the satisfaction of the parties using it. It is, therefore, proper to give the Government power to change the chairman of the court, if the position is such, that the individual appointed will in no sense be unsatisfactory, in no sense guilty of conduct that might justify removal, but, nevertheless, proves to be less expeditious or less satisfactory in the management of the business of the court than it was hoped to attain.  My feeling about the amendment, when this court has been set up and is functioning satisfactorily for a period of time, and experience has been gained of the problems that will arise in connection with this operation, is that we might then consider a provision of this kind, but in the initial stages, when we are moving more or less in the dark, and not quite clear as to what problems have to be dealt with, it is wiser to provide the court in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister.  It is more essential now than later that we should get the most suitable person.  I put it to the Minister that if a person whom he considers would be a suitable person, for what I might describe as the keystone position of the whole structure, is <Col N="863" /> approached, if he has anything like the qualifications required to carry out the duties successfully, he is not the type that is going to take it if he could be displaced at the pleasure of the Minister after five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered that the type of person we are going to appoint to this position will put aside his present position of responsibility and take the risk of taking up one for which the fullest guarantee is a period of five years?  At the end of that period, if he was removed, the position of such a man, to say the very least of it, might be very straitened.  He might not be able to resume his ordinary occupation.  What I am afraid of is that, unless the Minister goes as far as he possibly can, to convey to the person whom he wishes to get, that he will be secure, and will not be taking a risk in accepting the position, we are not going to get the best man.  We may get people who are prepared to take the risk, but it is unlikely that the best type of person will be got.  There is a definite risk. The Minister may say that provided the chairman does his duty fairly, impartially and in a conscientious way there is no fear.  That does not follow.  This is going to be a very difficult and ticklish job, and the occupant will not only have to satisfy the Minister but many other people as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He will have to satisfy the people who go to this court.  I do not think the Deputy is paying sufficient attention to the fact that there is a fundamental difference between this court and the High Court and ordinary courts.  They must be used.  There is no other machinery that people can avail of to get judicial determination between themselves and others.  This court does not function in that way.  We could not take the risk of having to appoint for the rest of his life some person who did not prove <Col N="864" /> satisfactory, or whose presence in the court might mean that it would not be used by the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the ordinary courts have to be used, and that this court need not necessarily be used.  It is because we want to see it used to the fullest possible extent&mdash;which I am sure the Minister desires&mdash;that we should do all we can to attract to the position of chairman the best person we can get. The first thing that any person looks for in a position is security.  While a man may be very anxious to take up a particular position, and may be prepared to take a risk, he may not consider it fair to those dependent upon him to take that risk.  I am suggesting to the Minister, that there is a danger that the best type of person will not accept the Minister's invitation to fill the position unless he can be given more than five years' security of tenure.  That is the point I am making.  I make it in order that this machinery, when it becomes the law of the land, will be in the hands of the person best suited to deal with it.  I suggest when a person is offered any position the main attraction is security of tenure.  I am not blind to the Minister's objection, but I believe that the other objection that I mentioned is far greater than the one mentioned by him. Unless we get a really first-class man as chairman of this court, I am afraid it will not be made more easy or more attractive for the parties concerned to take advantage of the machinery that is being set up.</P>

      <P>I have every sympathy with Deputy Dockrell's proposal inasmuch as he wants to ensure that the chairman of the industrial court will be a person altogether above the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Dockrell seeks to endow the chairman of the board with an independence as closely akin as possible to that possessed by a High Court judge in the capacity in which he holds office.  While sympathising with that idea, I see certain inherent difficulties in implementing it, inasmuch as it is quite conceivable that one might be caught on the wrong foot <Col N="865" /> subsequent to the making of the appointment.  It is possible that one might appoint a person as chairman of this court believing that such person was the repository of every virtue; six to 12 months' experience of him as chairman might indicate that he was a most unsuitable man and that one's earlier decision in appointing him was an exceedingly unwise one. It would be a great pity if one were tied to that mistake for four or five years or, worse still, if one accepted Deputy Dockrell's amendment one would find oneself anchored to that chairman for the rest of the court's life.  Those are real difficulties inherent in the situation.  Deputy Dockrell wants a chairman who will hold the position almost in perpetuity, or until such time as senile decay sets in, when he will have to be removed.</P>
      <P>The Minister says the difficulty about doing that is that if one puts in a gentleman who does not run true to form, there will be no means of removing him from office.  Sensible people have to try to find a balance between these two points of view.  I think probably an even balance could be got by endeavouring to find a chairman who will command respect by our obtaining now from the Minister an assurance, in the form of an undertaking to this House, that an effort will be made to get the most suitable person to function as chairman of this industrial court; that, when he is appointed, there will be no nagging either on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (I am not saying this now in any personal way, because it may be some other Minister for Industry and Commerce) or the Department, and that he will not be obliged, in coming to a decision, to inquire either from the Department or in his own mind what view the Minister or the Department has on some particular decision at which he has to arrive at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, therefore, to ask the Minister a few questions in this connection.  I would like to know what kind of person the Minister has in mind for this appointment.  I hope that it is not intended to put into this office any <Col N="866" /> kind of politician, who is engaged in, or has recently been engaged in, the cut and thrust of Party politics or debate in this House, or who, because of his political affiliations, would be more responsible to the Minister than another person possessed of a greater degree of independence.  I trust that political considerations will be completely eschewed in the appointment of the chairman of this industrial court. Again, is it intended to second a civil servant to the chairmanship of this court?  If it is so intended, is it contemplated that such civil servant, so seconded, will cut the painter completely with the Civil Service and function independently as chairman of this industrial court?  Or is it contemplated that, if so appointed, for, say, a period of five years, he will at the end of that time have the right to revert to his former rank in the Civil Service; if that is so, then he must, during his period of office, always have before his mind the fact that he will so revert under the control of the Minister and he must keep before his mind what the Minister may think of him as chairman of this industrial court.  If that is done, I think the Minister will be committing a fatal mistake at the very outset.</P>
    <P>Under this section we are entitled to ask the Minister what exactly he has in mind.  I frankly want to have a person of good standing in the community, a person with a breadth of vision, a person of understanding.  I do not want a person who has spent up to this a considerable amount of his time in starchy exploits which necessarily give an element of somewhat artificial dignity and pseudo-competence, quite hopeless from the point of view of settling such disputes as are likely to come before this court.  I want a common-sense man of ability, possessed of a high degree of honour, integrity and rectitude and one who can be relied upon to view things with a broad vision and bring his ability and knowledge to bear in the settlement of disputes which will come before this court.  If we are successful in finding a person of that type we shall probably do more to ensure the efficient operation of this court than by giving a person a particular type of tenure <Col N="867" /> under this Bill.  I would like, therefore, to get from the Minister an assurance that he has in mind the appointment of a person who fulfils all the qualifications I have indicated.</P>
    <P>As far as the Minister is concerned in this appointment, I hope that he will do all in his power to throw the chairman of this court as far as possible away from any vestige of his control, and that such a chairman will be appointed on the definite understanding that he has no responsibility to the Minister, and that he is neither going to be nagged at nor asked to justify to the Department, the Minister, or anybody else any awards he makes in his capacity as chairman of this industrial court.  I think the more independence the chairman has the better it will be for the efficient operation of the court.</P>
    <P>I trust, therefore, that the Minister will indicate to the House the type of person he has in mind, first of all, and, secondly, that such a person will have all the independence in the exercise of his powers as that possessed by a judge of the High Court; and that he will in no sense be responsible to the Minister or the Department.  If we can get such an assurance, I think we shall have got from the Minister probably more than even the insertion in this Bill of a definite tenure of office, which could very easily be impaired by the appointment of a person who would be little more than a rubber stamp for the Minister, or too anxious to please either the Minister or the Department because there would be before his mind the possibility of a further tenure of office at the end of his particular period.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Norton has said.  I think the difficulty is that if the Minister has power to retire the chairman it is inevitable that under such power he will have a large measure of control over the deliberations of the chairman and that might not be quite desirable.</P>

      <P>In an endeavour to strike the balance indicated by Deputy Norton a moment ago, I would suggest to the Minister that he should <Col N="868" /> leave the selection of the chairman of the court to, say, the Chief Justice and that the Chief Justice should be allowed to delegate these powers to some judge of the High Court.  There is the temptation that the Minister may react to pressure&mdash;by the Government, for instance&mdash;to appoint some political henchman who would not have the confidence of either employers or employees.  They are after all the people who are directly interested in this measure.  Then, too, we know that in all Parliaments there are usually to be found a number of lawyers &ldquo;on the make&rdquo;.  Any such lawyer who might be appointed might endeavour to do his utmost to please the Minister or the Government in arriving at his decisions.  That temptation is always present.  We know that from past history, not alone here in this House but on the other side of the Channel also.  That type of practice leads to corruption in public life. I think the Minister should make some attempt to meet the point put by Deputy Dockrell and supported&mdash;to to some extent, but not wholly&mdash; by Deputy Norton.  After all, the Chief Justice would be above suspicion, and I am quite certain that none of our judges would come under the control of the Minister in any way or would not have complete independence if he were appointed.  I think some person of such calibre and position should be appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that suggestion is a good one.  I cannot imagine any circumstances under which the Chief Justice would be so closely in touch with the problems with which this court would be called upon to deal that he would be empowered necessarily to make a better selection than the person who, for the time being, is Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is quite obvious that Deputy Norton has given us an ideal description of the chairman of this court.  I hope that we shall get a person who will conform to that description in all respects.  I certainly accept his point of view that a person who had been actively engaged in Party politics would be a most undesirable appointment but I would not <Col N="869" /> go to the full extent of debarring from consideration altogether a person who had experience in the Civil Service.  I have not now the appointment of a civil servant in mind but I should not like to say anything that would preclude for all time from consideration the possibility of a person with Civil Service experience being appointed.  I think we have got to get a person who possesses a considerable amount of practical experience of the problems that are likely to come before the courts.  I have no doubt we shall be able to get such a person.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands, it is quite clear that the chairman is in no way responsible to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the decisions of the court. Neither has he to seek his approval for these decisions nor is the Minister given power to interfere.  The Minister will not ordinarily be concerned with the decisions of the court.  I can see circumstances in which he might be concerned with the expedition with which the court disposed of its business, with the adequacy of its staff or with the suitability of its conciliation machinery but not with the actual decisions of the court.  I think the independence of the court is such as to satisfy any fears which Deputy Norton may have on that score.</P>

Our job is to get the court established, to get confidence in the court created and to get the public educated in the functioning of the court.  Once that is done, we can consider procedure but I should not like to tie myself up at the beginning to something which might prove to be an irretrievable mistake which would <Col N="870" /> destroy the value of the court entirely.

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to think over the matter between now and the Report Stage.  He has paid me the compliment of saying that he has a good deal of sympathy with my amendment and my point of view.  I would have a good deal of sympathy with the Minister's point of view, but I feel it is just a question of whether he can provide anything further in the way of security of tenure&mdash;without, to speak bluntly, tying himself to a &ldquo;dud&rdquo;.  Of course, we all know that people who discharged other duties quite brilliantly may fail in duties that look very analogous to those of their former office.  There might be a real risk in making an appointment and, as the Minister says, of being tied to a person for life.  He should, however, remember that the first few years of the court's existence will be the worst.  If this court establishes its reputation in the early years of its existence, unless some extraordinary state of circumstances comes about, it will be easier and simpler for it to function.  It will have adopted a certain procedure and the people associated with it will have gained experience.  But once the Minister has made an appointment, if the first chairman of the court is a failure, <Col N="871" /> the court will be a failure, I am afraid for all time.  Therefore, I should like to suggest to the Minister that he might think over the matter between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (3), line 3, to add the words &ldquo;and the chairman shall be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than five years' standing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel, looking through the provisions of the Bill and considering the work which this court will have to accomplish, that a barrister or a solicitor of five years' standing should be appointed chairman.  I have read the speech delivered by the Minister in moving the Second Stage and also his speech <Col N="872" /> at the conclusion of the debate on that stage, but all through these speeches I have failed to discover any indication as to the qualities or the qualifications that should be possessed by the person appointed chairman.  I quite agree that the chairman, if he is to be a success, should have practical knowledge of the matters that will come before the court.  I am also aware that practical experience plus theoretical knowledge make a very happy combination.  Whilst it may be argued, as I think it was argued by Deputy Larkin on the Second Reading, that what is required is a man of common sense, and of practical ability, we also want somebody who will act as guide, not alone in defining procedure but also to the other members of the court in coming to a proper decision on the matters that will be submitted to them.</P>
    <P>I would also remind those who pin their faith to the chairman having practical knowledge, that even in the ranks of the Labour Party, when they are adopting rules and regulations&mdash; which are merely matters of common sense&mdash;they always take the precaution to submit them, before committing the rules to print, not to a solicitor or barrister with five years' standing but to the best legal mind that can be procured. That being so, I am strongly of the opinion that, if this court is to command the confidence which it should command from its very initiation, the chairman should be a man who would have, in addition to a practical knowledge of the matters that would come under discussion and review, legal training.</P>
    <P>This court may be a simple thing up to a point.  The wording of the section is in very plain language, but the other sections consequential on this section are very important.  For instance, you have a registrar and officials.  Then there is another section dealing with the position where no two members of the court can agree and the chairman himself will, perforce, have to come to a decision on his own responsibility. In a case of that kind, there is a little more needed than practical ability and common sense&mdash;one needs a knowledge <Col N="873" /> of the law as well.  If those who will attend this court and will have occasion to submit matters for determination have not confidence at the very outset, that will go a long way to destroy the work which the court is being set up to perform.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is no argument to say that lawyers do not sometimes bear a good name and the less lawyers we have the better.  They are a necessary evil and we cannot do without the law. The Minister knows that some of the Acts already passed, even after having the best legal opinion, are found wanting when submitted to the Supreme Court.  I feel, as one with very long experience of the matters that would come for determination before this court, so far as the claims of the working classes are concerned, that the chairman should have legal training, plus a practical knowledge, so far as is humanly possible, of the matters that would come for determination and I respectfully submit the amendment for the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coburn really has said nothing to the House which ought to commend this amendment. Personally, I am opposed to it for reasons which I think would be found convincing.  I have no doubt in the world that barristers and solicitors are very estimable citizens and I do not want to animadvert on their qualifications as a vocation or on their merits as individual citizens; but Deputy Coburn says that the only person you can trust to be chairman of an industrial court, out of our 3,000,000 population, must be selected from barristers or solicitors of five years' standing.  I do not know the most vocationally proud barrister or solicitor who would claim for his profession that it was the only profession from which you would get a suitable chairman for this industrial court. Frankly, I do not believe it is.  I do not think the chairmanship of this court will involve any knowledge of law at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main qualifications that would appear to be necessary are that he would be a shrewd gentleman, that he would have ability and understanding, <Col N="874" /> that he would know men and affairs, that he would have the sagacity for bridging over difficulties.  Nothing that Deputy Coburn has said has indicated to me that barristers and solicitors necessarily have any special sagacity for bridging over difficulties which might arise, for instance, out of a dispute in the docks or in a quarry, in a cotton mill or coal mine, in a dispute about the staff employed in a shirt company or an air liner, which are all matters which would come before this court.  Deputy Coburn's amendment would, in effect, say to every citizen: &ldquo;You are a good citizen&mdash;I do not question that&mdash;but when it comes to appointing a chairman of an industrial court, the only people worthy of consideration are barristers and lawyers of five years' standing.</P>
    <P>I do not think a barristers or solicitor with six years' experience is necessarily a suitable person for this court, nor do I think a person with four years' experience is necessarily unsuitable, but Deputy Coburn says, by implication, that the person with six is all right and the person with four is all wrong; he says by implication that, no matter what other vocations there are in the country from which one might pick a chairman, you will go wrong unless you find your chairman from amongest the lawyers.  I do not see why other citizens should not be qualified.  The Bill empowers the Minister to pick a barrister or solicitor, if he is so disposed, not because of his qualifications but because of the fact that he has the necessary qualifications to ensure the proper working of this court.  In not placing any premium on the legal profession in this respect, the Minister has acted wisely.</P>
    <P>That brings us back to the question as to who will make the best chairman. I do not think that is a test which can be judged by a person's vocation.  The most brilliant doctor, from the medical point of view, the most competent judge on the bench or the most competent man at the Bar, may not necessarily be the most suitable chairman.  In a case like this, one must try to find out what one person has most of the qualifications necessary <Col N="875" /> to ensure the smooth operation of this industrial court.  The Minister has put the obligation on himself to find that person and appoint him.  He has a choice at the moment from every citizen in the country who is within certain adult categories.  Deputy Coburn says that the choice is far too wide and that the selection should be made from the narrow vocation of the legal profession.  I do not think it is a wise amendment.  It would be better to let the Minister exercise his choice from all citizens who have the necessary qualifications.  Under Deputy Coburn's amendment, presumably, if he finds a citizen who seems to have all the qualifications necessary to make him an ideal chairman, he would have to pass over him if he were not a solicitor or barrister of five years' standing.  That would be a pity.  The person who is selected should be the one who is found to have the qualifications irrespective of whether he is a solicitor, a barrister, a judge or something else.  It is not important what his vocation is, so long as he has got the qualifications and the right type of brains to make this work a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet the Minister would allow it to pass if the House were unanimous. Deputy Norton states that, by making the chairman a barrister or a lawyer of five years' standing, you are cutting out everything else and ignoring all other vocations.  I do not intend and never intended to base my argument on that assumption.  The court, by reason of the work which it will have to do and the decisions which it must necessarily arrive at, will, to say the least of it, have to deal with very important matters.  These matters will affect not only the parties actively interested in the findings of the tribunal but the general body of the citizens.  Therefore, I think that great care should be taken by the Minister in so far as the constitution of this court is concerned.  We must all admit that all other sections of the Bill will revolve about this one.  The composition of the court is really the pivotal point so far as this Bill is concerned. The Minister himself attaches so much importance to it that he has even brought in an amendment to enlarge the size of the court from three to five.  No matter what Deputies may say, this court is going to be called upon to perform duties of a <i>quasi</i>judicial nature.  It should not be impossible for the Minister to appoint a chairman who, even though he may be a barrister or a solicitor of five years' <Col N="877" /> standing, will have practical knowledge of the matters that will come before the court.</P>
      <P>I would remind Deputies Norton and the members of the Labour Party that when it comes to a question of law&mdash;of examining the rights of different unions and their relations with one another&mdash; the duty of a lawyer is to interpret everything in court in order to be able to win his case.  The lawyer will make his case to the court on the brief that is submitted to him.  That is part of his professional duty. That does not necessarily mean that a lawyer must have, so to speak, served his time in some particular union in order to have practical knowledge of the matters that affect the ordinary day-to-day lives of the workers in the particular area in which he resides. After all, he is a human being himself, and it is part of his job to understand those matters.  Therefore, I think the Minister should see to it that the man who is appointed chairman will be a barrister or solicitor of five years' standing.  I am not wedded to five years or to four years, and Deputy Norton knows that well.  I am wedded to this, that the person appointed should be a man of legal training and should have that practical knowledge of which I speak.  It should not be too difficult to get a man with those qualifications, and that is the type of man who will be required to give a proper decision on the many matters which will be submitted to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say, with all respect to Deputy Norton, that I think he would be one of the first to object to anybody encroaching on the Labour world and taking up a job that was not within his bailiwick?  This is a sort of judicial position, and I think the legal profession would be quite entitled to claim that a member of that profession should be chairman of this court.  I would like to know how Deputy Norton would feel if, say, a solicitor were to take up a job as an artisan or tradesman. I think there would soon be a great deal of trouble.  In view of the very peculiar constitution of this court, and the fact that it will have to take very grave decisions, I think that the Minister would be wise if he <Col N="878" /> himself were to accept responsibility for falling in with the suggestions made by the Incorporated Law Society.  I had no knowledge that the Minister had consulted the society until he informed the House of that to-day.  I understand that the Minister is prepared, if there is general agreement in the House, to fall in with the suggestions put to him by the members of the legal profession in the appointment of the chairman.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's last contribution has been, I think, less convincing than his first.  He appears to be claiming the right that the chairman of the court should be a member of the legal profession.  I think, if that suggestion were adopted, it would not contribute very much in the way of facilitating trade unionists who will be mainly concerned with the operation of this measure.  Before ever this type of emergency legislation was introduced, trade unionists had very wide experience in carrying through negotiations on behalf of their members.  This Bill is really only something that replaces the emergency legislation which we have had.  In my opinion, trade unionists would be very slow to admit that they have not the right to negotiate and to conduct business on behalf of the workers.  It would take a lot to convince them that a legal man could do better than they can do it.  I endorse what the Minister has said. It would be a most unpopular thing to attempt to appoint a legal man as chairman of this court.  It will be necessary, of course, to have legal guidance for the court.  I suggest that it can be given by the registrar.  We do not want to have a legal man in the saddle, we want a lay man.  The experience of trade unionists, so far as this type of tribunal is concerned, is that much more satisfactory results are obtained when those who are called upon to adjudicate are drawn from the rank and file of the world&mdash;from those with an industrial experience&mdash;than from those who approach questions from the legal angle.  What one expects to get from a court of this sort are commonsense settlements.  You do not want legal people for that.  A legal man would not be acceptable to either <Col N="879" /> of the congresses.  We hope and believe that it will be possible to get a suitable lay person as chairman.  He will have the assistance of representatives of employers and workers.  There is no reason why the chairman should be a legal man.  The registrar will be there to keep the court within the law.  I hope that the Minister will not be swayed by the arguments of Deputy Coburn to appoint a legal man as chairman.</P>

      <P>I think that on reconsideration Deputy Coburn ought to withdraw this amendment.  No useful purpose can be served by narrowing down the field of selection.  The attitude of the Minister should be to select the ablest and the best man that he possibly can get within the State. It would be unwise to confine selection to one vocation.  Even suppose that the chairman should be selected from one vocation, I would be inclined to say that the legal profession should not be the first vocation from which to make a selection.  I think that practically any other vocation would possibly provide a better chairman. The Minister might confine himself to farmers, who have experience in negotiating agreements at fairs, or to cattle dealers, who have experience of negotiating agreements, or to businessmen, who frequently negotiate contracts and agreements.  These men would have wider experience in dealing with human affairs than would members of the legal profession. Members of the legal profession are not skilled in bringing about settlements. Their whole training is against that.  Their whole training tends to direct people who are in difficulties or have disputes towards the courts and to prevent their reaching easy agreements.  In these circumstances, a member of the legal profession would not be the best man to preside over a court of this kind.  I should not rule out the Civil Service. You might get a very good chairman from the Civil Service or from the teaching profession or from professors of economics.  The choice should be unlimited and unrestricted.</P>

    <P>This amendment relates back to amendment No. 13, which we discussed on Friday.  The Committee will remember that, in the discussion of amendment No. 13, we touched upon problems that may arise in establishing the proposed labour court because of the present position in the trades union movement in Ireland.  Since the Dáil met on Friday, I have had discussions, in which Deputy Norton was a very useful collaborator, as a result of which I have sent invitations to both of the trades union congresses to participate in a joint conference under my chairmanship to examine the possibility of finding a basis for agreement on the issues in dispute between them. These invitations have been accepted by both of the congresses.  I know that all trade unionists and all who are concerned with the prestige and strength of the Irish trades union movement will hope that the conference will be successful in finding a method of removing the causes of dissension and in making possible the re-establishment of one central authority for Irish trades unionism.  I can promise, for my part, to do my utmost to help in producing that result.  It is my hope also that, as a <Col N="881" /> result of agreement at the proposed conference, or of the emergence of a basis for agreement to be completed later, it will be possible to get agreed nominations of workers' members of the labour court.  I propose, however, to provide for the possibility of two trade union congresses still existing when the court is being first established by introducing an amendment on Report on the following lines.  I may say that this draft has been prepared by myself and is not the production of the Parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that the amendment which I am now proposing provides for the appointment, as workers' members, of persons nominated by an organisation of trade unions.  The amendment I shall produce on Report will provide that, if the Minister is of opinion that, owing to the existence of more than one organisation representative of trade unions, it is not desirable that the workers' members of the court should be appointed in accordance with the provisions of amendment No. 16, he may, by Order, provide for another procedure. I propose to draft an amendment to require the Minister to bring the other procedure into operation by Order, because, under a section of the Bill, any such Order can be debated in the Dáil and may be annulled by the Dáil.  The procedure which would be alternative to that provided for in amendment No. 16 would be intended to be only a temporary device to be used if the present position continues and would provide (1) for an invitation by the Minister to organisations of trade unions or individual trade unions to submit names of members considered suitable for appointment; (2) the appointment of two members by the Minister from the persons whose names are submitted to him; and (3) a provision that those members will hold office for the five-year period prescribed in the Bill, or until the Order referred to is revoked, whichever is the lesser period, so that it will be understood that the appointment of workers' members in accordance with this alternative procedure will be only a temporary measure intended to terminate if a situation arises in which there is <Col N="882" /> one congress of unions such as we desire.  On the termination of this procedure, the workers' representatives would be appointed on the nomination of the congress, as I propose in amendment No. 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House, and trade unionists generally, no matter to what unions they belong, will extend very sincere good wishes to the Minister in the efforts he is now about to make to bring about a settlement of the unfortunate dispute that at present exists between the two trades union congresses.  For my part, I hope his efforts will be crowned with success.  If he succeeds in bringing about unification of the two congresses, he will be entitled not only to the gratitude of the congresses but of every trade unionist in Ireland, who, no matter what the issues at stake may be, or are alleged to be, is, nevertheless, sincerely desirous of getting back to the position in which this element of disunity will be eliminated and the congress permitted to occupy its rightful place as the vocational organisation of the workers within the State.  I think that both sides to this dispute must recognise that they owe a paramount obligation to the trade unionists of the country and no sense of punctilio or artificial dignity ought to be allowed to impede a settlement of this dispute.  If the trade union movement is ever to attain the status to which its membership and economic power entitle it, it can do so only by displaying to the public that sense of wide appreciation of economic and national issues which it is essential every national movement should manifest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade union movement has got to recognise that, although it was born in a condition of affairs in which it was an outlaw organisation, it has long since travelled from the days of being an outlaw organisation.  To-day, in this country and other countries throughout the world, the trade union movement is recognised as an integral part of national economy.  It has been consulted here and elsewhere by Governments anxious to evolve an economic, industrial and social policy in tune with the aspirations of various States.  It is <Col N="883" /> now in a position in which it represents an element of national life at international congresses throughout the world and it is realised more than ever by Governments and by employers that the trade union movement represents a vital force in the national life of every progressive country.</P>
    <P>If the movement is to maintain that status, or to attain it where it has not yet done so, it can only do so, in my view, by recognising its responsibilities, by showing it appreciates these responsibilities, and by claiming for itself an undeniable share in the national management of these matters in which the trade union movement, because of its vocational character, is entitled to claim a part.  I trust, therefore, that considerations of that kind will have a morally coercive effect on the discussions which are now to take place under the Minister's chairmanship and I hope that both sides, in the interests of the movement and in the interests of the men and women who comprise it, will make a genuine effort to effect a settlement of the dispute which, in my view, has gone on too long.</P>
    <P>Personally, I appreciate the sentiments which the Minister has expressed and I think I interpret the ideas which he has in mind correctly.  There is just one point on which I should like some little clarification.  The Minister says he hopes that this conference will lead to the evolution of a united trade union congress and, if that takes place speedily, then that reunified congress can make the nomination for this industrial court from the workers' side; but that if the conference over which the Minister is to preside has not produced that result in sufficient time for a united congress to make the nomination, then it may be necessary for the Minister, by Order, to take power that both congresses shall submit nominations to him, or that trade unions generally may submit nominations to him, and from the nominations so submitted he will make selections for the court.</P>
    <P>The very fact of presiding over a conference representative of both sides is a clear indication that the Minister realises that there is a problem to be <Col N="884" /> solved, that there are two different groups at present pursuing separate paths.  I take it, therefore, that the Minister's desire is to see, if he can, a reunited movement make the two nominations, in which case all difficulties disappear; and the second device, to incorporate in the Bill a provision by which the Minister may make an Order to receive nominations from below, from the two congresses or from trade unions in the country, is one to enable him to make a selection of two persons to represent the workers on the court.</P>
    <P>I take it that it is implied in what the Minister said that the idea is to be able to get a representative of both sides, if it is not possible at this stage to reunite the congresses, in the hope that in that way it will be possible to afford representation to both sides without any formal declaration of that fact in the Bill until such time as the reunification takes place.  In other words, instead of definitely declaring that each shall be entitled to a representative, the Minister's desire is, by taking power to do certain things by Order, to arrange things in such a way that both elements will have representation on the court until they have sense enough to come together again and as a united body make the nomination of both members.  Am I right in that interpretation of what the Minister said?</P>

      <P>If the effort of this conference to have agreement produces a single organisation, then there is no problem.  That organisation will nominate the members and, once they nominate, they will be appointed.  If the effort is not successful, or may prove to be protracted, then I would hope to get some interim agreement covering the appointment of these members, either an agreement as to named persons or as to the procedure for selection.  If there is no such agreement, I would adopt the procedure in the amendment which I will propose.  My aim would not be to appoint representatives of both sides, but to appoint persons who would be acceptable to both sides. The Deputy will understand that there is a slight distinction.  I <Col N="885" /> would not be thinking so much of the representatives as of persons who would be regarded as acceptable and as to whom I should hope to get agreement.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 16 would give undue representation to organisations that have not the right <Col N="889" /> to represent the industrial workers of Ireland.  I am suggesting that as a result of last week's conference of the trade union congress there were ten British representatives appointed to the executive on which you are asked to put representatives of the Irish workers.  There were five representatives left representing the Irish unions.  God knows there has been enough trouble in this country trying to secure independence.  You find the president of that congress stating that the price asked was too high.  Will the price be lower to-morrow?  Let me point out to the Minister that it will not be lower than the price asked a month ago.  You were asked the one question, did the Irish workers want to be controlled by Irishmen and an Irish executive?  We are told by the man who told us that this was a Fascist State that this organisation is controlled by people outside the country. I am sure that Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies present will agree with me that this is the most democratically-elected Parliament in Europe; we have every man and woman over 21 years possessing the right to elect the Government. There is the answer to the talk of Fascism in this country.  The Minister will ask these men to meet in conference and he wants me to agree with his amendment.</P>

      <P>But you are on amendment No. 16.  What organisation will suggest such a ridiculous proposition to the Minister?  The original section gave the right to any unions to select their nominee, and I am sure they would try to select the best men in the organisation.  But under this amendment the organisation will select a certain man who may be rejected by the Minister.  Do you think the organisation will put forward a second name? They will have some sense of responsibility or honour and they will not put forward two names, to find them rejected and passed over by the Minister. <Col N="890" /> There is some sense of honour in connection with even some of the unions.</P>
      <P>I wonder the Minister changed the original Bill.  These unions would select the best and most brainy man and he would be automatically selected by the Minister.  Under this amendment the unions may be asked to forward two or three names.  What man of honour will allow his name to go forward if he is likely to be blackballed and turned down by the Minister? I oppose the amendment because I do not believe any responsible body representing any trade union or trades council would put up such a ridiculous proposition for the Minister's approval. If two or three names were put forward to the Minister they might be rejected, and possibly the organisation would not have any nominees selected by the Minister.  Therefore, the amendment would not have the effect expected.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Deputy Everett overlooks one important feature in the amendment. The Minister is now seeking power in amendment No. 16 merely to nominate an organisation, representative of trade unions, to be the body who will submit the names to the Minister.  We are accepting the amendment in the light of the important statement he has made to the House.  I rise merely to add my expression of appreciation in connection with the very important step the Minister has taken in bringing about a meeting of these congresses within the next day or two.  I am in touch with this whole matter and whether persons are attached to one congress or the other, this announcement will be received with gratification by trade unions in all branches and hopes will be expressed that the Minister's efforts will bring about the unity which everybody desires.  I can go further and say that if it is successful, and we all hope it will be, then the Minister's prestige will be greatly enhanced and, what is more important still, he deserves to have it viewed in that light.  At this particular stage we are concerned only with amendment No. 16, in the light of the <Col N="891" /> discussion that has taken place here for two days, and in the light of the important statement that has been made by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what Deputy Everett has said, concerning paragraph (b) of the amendment, I am not personally attached to that provision and if we insert the amendment in the Bill now I am prepared to consider any amendment to that that may be moved on Report.  I can understand there being a difference of view as to the wisdom of paragraph (b) and, if there is any dissent, I am quite prepared to delete it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, in the light of what happens in practice, paragraph (b) is not of very much importance.  Whether it goes in or is deleted, I do not think it is of any importance to anybody.  Even though I have been tempted by Deputy Everett, I refrain from following the speech he made beyond saying that the figures he quoted were fantastic.  I want to make this appeal to Deputy Everett.  Both congresses have now accepted the invitation of the Minister to meet him with a view to effecting a settlement of this dispute.  That means that the officers of Deputy Everett's organisation have agreed to meet the Minister.  I take it, therefore, Deputy Everett will not question the wisdom of these officers, for whom I have a high regard, notwithstanding whatever disagreements may have taken place.  I think, therefore, it would be wiser for Deputy Everett and for everybody else, on an occasion like this, when a conference is about to be inaugurated by the Minister, to refrain from making comments which may mean that the conference would start under rather unhappy auspices.  So far as I am concerned, therefore, I am willing to let this contentious or potentially contentious section of the Bill go through in the hope that the Minister, having got both congresses to agree to meet under his chairmanship, may be able to carry his efforts to a successful conclusion.  I know Deputy Everett's view in this matter.  I think he knows my point of view.  My main concern, <Col N="892" /> and I hope it is his concern, is to get a reunified trade union movement because, no matter what differences there may be between the Congress of Irish Unions and the Trade Union Congress, if you were to multiply these differences by a thousand, they are small and paltry differences compared with the position which the united movement will have to face if it is ever to attain the ideal of a decent, happy life for the working-class people of this country.  I suggest to Deputy Everett, therefore, that we ought to let this section, or the contentious elements in this section, go at this stage with the right to have a discussion on Report Stage if that is felt desirable, but all the time in the hope that that discussion might be avoided so that we might endeavour to get a reunited congress as a result of the Minister's intervention in this matter.</P>
      <P>I have no desire to rake the ashes of recrimination in this matter.  I have tried to avoid it all the time and I suggest to Deputy Everett that no good purpose can be achieved by, as it were, washing in public the dirty linen of the two congresses at this stage.  We have enough enemies to fight outside without using this Bill to make further enemies for ourselves at this stage.</P>

Surely Deputy Norton must be aware that the difference between the Congress of Irish Unions and the Trade Union Congress is not a small matter. It is a very big fundamental question. Deputy Norton is aware that this crisis was brought about by the activity in this country of the representatives of British unions during the recent war, when we were trying to preserve our neutrality.</P>

Will there be any time limit within which agreement is to be reached between the two trade unions?  Can the Minister give the House any inkling as to that?  Will the Bill be held up indefinitely until the two parties to the dispute will some day or other say: &ldquo;We will agree,&rdquo; and communicate the terms of the agreement to the Minister?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully submit that the terms of the amendment and <Col N="895" /> even of the section itself are brought about by the fact that a dispute has occurred outside this House.  The discussion to-day and most of the discussion on Friday was devoted to what is the position outside as between two rival unions.  Therefore, I submit that we who come here to do our best to take part in framing this Bill should know where we stand in relation to this amendment.  I must admit that, after all the explanations and all the speeches that have been delivered, the position has not been clarified since the discussion was initiated, so far as I am personally concerned&mdash;unless it is that my apprehension is at fault. Not one of us knows what the position will be, even with this amendment, because the whole thing is contingent on some conference which is to take place between the representatives of two unions, not one member of either of which is a member of this House. That is the position we are in.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I wish the Minister the height of luck, but I am not convinced of the efficacy of all this business, or that anything will come of it.  I am prepared to let it go in order that more time will not be wasted, because, as one who has been connected with the trade union movement, I am sick to death of the differences, differences which are of no importance, between rival sections of industrial workers.  I say that here as a worker and I am prepared to say it outside as well.  I wish the Minister luck in his efforts, although I do not agree that, from the constitutional point of view, it should be necessary for the Minister to do this; I hope he will be successful in bringing this dispute to an end so that we can get the position clarified and be enabled to see what all the implications are.</P>

There are a number of other employers' organisations, such as the Federation of Builders, Contractors and Employers of Ireland, and other organisations of the kind, which confine their membership to employers of a particular class. The only organisation, apart from local organisations, which purports to represent employers generally is the Federated Union of Employers.</P>

      <P>It raises a rather important point which was not discussed when the Minister introduced his original proposal.  The court originally was to consist of three members and the Minister very kindly and promptly accepted a suggestion <Col N="899" /> of ours that the membership should be increased to five.  We gave definite and specific reasons why it should be increased to five, one of which was the desirability of allowing consultation between the Labour representative and a colleague, and similarly in the case of employers' representatives.

My suggestion was designed to deal with what might be a very temporary difficulty, namely a rush of business to the court which the court could not dispose of.  I thought the device of splitting the court into two tribunals was better than making elaborate provision for a second tribunal for a very limited period.  The problem may not, in fact, arise, and ordinarily, it is the full court of five which will meet and function.  I should think that once the next year or two has passed, the court will be quite capable of disposing of the business that will arise without any resort to special provisions such as I have in mind.</P>

Therefore, we are going to have this position, that if the chairman was stricken with illness in the middle of the hearing of an important case&mdash;perhaps one of urgency&mdash;they could not wait for his recovery, and a person would be drawn from outside in a temporary capacity, who had no previous experience whatever of the basis on which the court came to a decision.

      <P>In page 6, before Section 12, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever it appears to the Minister that the amount of business before the court is greater than can reasonably be disposed of expeditiously or that a situation is likely to arise in which the court will require assistance to deal with the business which will probably come before it, the Minister may establish one or more than one subsidiary court (in this section referred to as the temporary court) to perform such of the functions of the court as shall be remitted by the court to such temporary court.</P>
      <P>(2)  The temporary court shall consist of a chairman and four temporary members.</P>
      <P>(3)  The chairman shall be appointed by the Minister provided that the person appointed shall have been a deputy chairman appointed under Section 11 of this Act.</P>
      <P>(4)  The temporary members shall be chosen from amongst the deputy members appointed under Section 11 of this Act in the manner following, that is to say, two shall be chosen from amongst the deputies for the employers' members and two from amongst the deputies for the workers' members.</P>
      <P>(5)  The temporary court shall be established for such period not exceeding 12 months as may be appointed by the Minister and may be re-established from time to time.</P>
      <P>(6)  Sittings of the temporary court may be held in any place in the State appointed by the court.</P>
      <P>(7)  Technical assessors and other officers and servants may be appointed to assist the temporary court to such extent as the court may determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acceptance of amendment No. 20 concerns the appointment of a deputy chairman.  I should like to impress upon the Minister, that the point of view of Labour Deputies is that it is <Col N="902" /> obvious, when this Bill becomes law, there is going to be a rush of business, particularly in relation to bonus Orders, and it is felt that the ordinary court, if not augmented, will not be able to deal with that rush of business. It is, therefore, desirable that there should be some means by which applications would be dealt with.  I am not satisfied that a court of five will be sufficient and it is because of that we felt it necessary to ask for the establishment of temporary courts.  I feel that a good deal of the necessity for this amendment is gone in view of the acceptance of the last amendment, but I would like to hear the Minister's view as to how a rush of business would be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is possible that there will be an exceptional volume of business in the first year.  The bulk of that business will fall to be dealt with by the conciliation staff, rather than by the court itself.  At least, a large part of the burden of disposing of that business could be carried out.  If we have the situation in which the number of cases coming to the court is such that it is overburdened then the best way to meet that problem is to provide for a possible division of the court.  There are practical difficulties in having a subsidiary court.  We appoint a chairman and ordinary members for a term of years, and they are obliged to give their whole time to the business of this organisation, which is generally regarded as their work in the light of the community. You cannot get temporary members for a temporary court on that basis.  That is the practical difficulty I see.  If we decide that the volume of business requires two courts at any time, it is easy to get representatives to do that business for that period, and only for that period, while the court is bound up with the volume of rush business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider the best way to meet that point of view, should it arise, is to provide by an amendment on Report for this court of five to be divided, if necessary, in the opinion of the chairman, who must ultimately be judge of the capacity of the court to dispose of <Col N="903" /> the business, into two tribunals, the second one to be presided over by the deputy chairman.  That is not satisfactory, but it may ensure that during the period of a rush of business applications to the court will have the benefit of having their cases heard by the full tribunal.  That seems to me to be a more satisfactory way of dealing with the problem than temporary or subsidiary courts.  At least, it is workable, and if it dodges the practical problems associated with the ordinary court, it may be that the whole court will always be able to dispose of the business coming to it.  A lot will depend on the precedent to be established in the matter of disposal of business, and the time it takes to deal with ordinary applications that come before it.</P>
    <P>A great deal of business can be dealt with in this court working expeditiously, and I hope to be able to get members who will be prepared to give extra attention and time to the work of the court during the initial period. If necessary, the device of splitting the court into two tribunals would not have to be resorted to unless it was clearly impossible to dispose of the business expeditiously by other means.  I say that that device is preferable than establishing subsidiary courts which offer a practical problem.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might deal with this.  The purpose of the amendment is to delete the provision which is intended to ensure that service in the Civil Service in a post for which only barristers or solicitors are eligible will be treated as practice as a barrister or solicitor for the purpose of sub-paragraph (8).  It is not a matter in which I am personally interested, but I understand that the Civil Service organisations regard it as important to the prestige of their professions that service in the Civil Service as a barrister or solicitor should be regarded as service in the practice of their profession.  I understand they would regard it as a reflection upon them in the practice of their profession if this sub-paragraph were not included.</P>

      <P>The Labour people take an important view of this particular amendment on the question of appeal.  If you take the case of an individual, for instance, who may have his agreement registered and eventually be dismissed from his employment, at the present moment under the common, law he would have redress.  Under the Bill, as it stands here, he might be precluded from having any redress.  Certain matters of that kind might arise in the course of the work of this court and it is important that we should have some provision whereby an individual would have the right of appeal in matters of law.</P>

      <P>I found, amongst the trade union representatives whom I interviewed, that the opinion was that the decision of this court should be final on matters dealing with the interpretation of agreements and the application of the provisions of the Bill relating to conditions of employment and so forth.  I was not quite clear from the amendment what exactly was meant by it.  The point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan is a new one to me. I would like, however, to draw his attention to an amendment which I am moving on Section 26.  It is included in the list of additional amendments which were circulated on the second sheet of amendments and which provides that &ldquo;a registered employment agreement shall not prejudice any right as to rates of remuneration or conditions of employment conferred on any worker by any Part of this Act or by any other Act&rdquo;.  It seems to me that may cover the point referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;namely, the right which a worker might have under common law, or some other enactment, and which should not be taken from him under this Act. I will, however, have the points mentioned by the Deputy examined to see if there is anything in them.  It is a legal point really on which I shall have to take legal opinion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and insert the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to sub-section (2) of this section, the quorum for a meeting or sitting of the court shall be five.</P>
      <P>(2)  The chairman may direct that, for the consideration of a particular matter, the court shall consist of the chairman and two ordinary members selected by him, namely, a worker's member and an employer's member, and, if the chairman so directs, no other member shall act as a member of the court in respect of that matter.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any question arises under this Act at a meeting or sitting of the court, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the members of the court are unable to agree upon the determination of the question,</P>
      <P>the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  if the majority of the ordinary members agree upon the determination of the question, the question shall be determined accordingly,</P>
      <P>(ii)  otherwise, the question shall be determined in accordance with the opinion of the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a minor consequential amendment. So far as the first part is concerned, it is consequential upon the alteration made in the size of the court.  It is proposed here that the court ordinarily shall consist of five persons but, at the discretion of the chairman, the court may consist of three members of whom one must be a worker and one must be an employer; in other words, if a workers' representative or an employers' representative is absent, through illness or for some other reason, the court can still function, it being, however, left to the discretion of the chairman to decide whether it will function or not.  Under <Col N="908" /> the Bill as set out, the court would arrive at its decisions in the manner set out there.  If the two ordinary members agree, that shall be a decision of the court; if they do not agree then the chairman's decision is the decision of the court.  We have now to alter that provision in consequence of the change in size.  What is provided for here is that if a majority of the ordinary members agree on a decision, that is the decision of the court.  If they do not agree, then the chairman decides.  It is necessary to have a decision arrived at and the intention is that the chairman will not in fact participate in the decision if the ordinary members, who are in the majority, are agreed upon it.  That is applying the same principle as was enshrined in the original Bill, when the court was to consist of three.  The new court shall consist of five.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the amendment of the Minister is rather unsatisfactory inasmuch as he is providing for a court of three.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is a court of five. Sub-section (1) makes it quite clear that the ordinary court shall consist of five members and that it is only in the special circumstances mentioned in sub-section (2) that the court is reduced to three.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the majority of the ordinary members agree upon the determination of a question that question shall be determined accordingly; otherwise, the question shall be determined in accordance with the opinion of the chairman.  Now, I merely want to find out what that means.  The position in connection with the Agricultural Wages Board, for instance, is somewhat unusual.  The workers' representatives may take a view as to what the wages and conditions ought <Col N="909" /> to be.  The farmers' representatives may take an entirely different view and say: &ldquo;No, in our view certain conditions should operate&rdquo;; and, between them both and without regard to either, the chairman may bring in an award which may not in any way resemble the point of view put forward by the workers' representatives or by the farmers' representatives.  He enters in with an entirely new opinion.  I doubt if it is wise to give the chairman that kind of authority.  I think it should be decided by compelling the chairman to go one way or the other.  As it stands, the chairman may produce a decision entirely opposed to the run of evidence given before the court and quite unsatisfactory to either, or both sides. The court must give a decision.  I think that is a most important point.  It cannot go back to the parties and say: &ldquo;The court cannot decide.&rdquo;  Whatever procedure is adopted there must create the possibility of a decision, good or bad, and unless it is done in this particular way you cannot now be sure of a decision.  You cannot compel the chairman or any other member to give a decision contrary to his own judgment.  He must be free to exercise his judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to get at the position in a different way.  The amendments which are down here, Nos. 29, 30, 31 and 32, have the effect of making a majority decision operate because provision is made by these amendments for effecting an amendment of sub-section (19) in the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it to the Deputy that there need not necessarily be a majority.  After all, this court is constituted, not on the basis of a tribunal, consisting of five persons of equal qualifications and assumed to have a similar point of view.  You have two workers' representatives, two employers' <Col N="910" /> representatives and a person, whom we shall describe for the purposes of convenience, as neutral.  On any question there is the possibility of three points of view&mdash;a definite point of view on the part of the workers' representatives, a definite point of view on the part of the employers' representatives and a definite point of view on the part of the chairman. I do not think it fair to put the chairman in the position that he must necessarily agree with either the workers' representatives or the employers' representatives against his own judgment, or alternatively to have to say to the parties concerned: &ldquo;We cannot agree or come to a decision at all.&rdquo;  This device does at least ensure that a decision can be arrived at and communicated to the parties.  Whether the parties accept it as a fair decision is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is. You have five people constituting the court consisting of two workers' representatives and two employers' representatives and the chairman.  The employers' representatives and the workers' representatives have certain points of view as to what the award of the court should be. There are probably points of dissimilarity and points of disagreement between them but there may be closer approximation in their views than there is in the views of the chairman and either of their views.  What are you doing in this Bill?  You are giving the chairman power to say: &ldquo;Although the workers want that and the employers want the other, I want this,&rdquo; and the chairman's &ldquo;this&rdquo; may be entirely different from what the other representatives want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, that could quite well be.  Suppose there was an application for a 10/- increase in a standard rate.  The employers' representative may say, &ldquo;We do not agree <Col N="911" /> that there should be any increase,&rdquo; while the workers' representative may say, &ldquo;We think there should be an order for an increase of 10/-&rdquo;.  The chairman may then say: &ldquo;I think there should be an increase of 5/-&rdquo;.  If you adopt the method suggested by Deputy Norton, you put the chairman in the position of having to choose between nothing or 10/- He may not conscientiously be willing to support either point of view.  In that case what is to happen?  Is he merely to say, &ldquo;This court cannot agree on the question; we can come to no decision?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the workers say, &ldquo;We want an increase of 10/- per week,&rdquo; and the employers say, &ldquo;We are willing to give 7/6.&rdquo;  The chairman may then say, &ldquo;Look here, I do not agree with either of you; I do not think that industry can afford any more than 2/6 of an increase&rdquo;.  In that case is his decision to stand?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Remember that if a majority of ordinary members of a court agree to anything, the chairman does not have a voice in the decision. In the circumstances the Deputy contemplates, the award of 2/6 would at least be a decision of the board.</P>

      <P>It might well be that the workers' representatives wanted an increase of 10/- and that the employers' representatives were willing to give 7/6.

      <P>I take it that there would be a motion before the court by the workers' representatives for a grant of 10/-.  One of the employers' representatives would then move that the increase be limited to 7/6.  There would be a vote, I take it, as between these two motions and the chairman would be in the position that he has either got to vote for the 10/- or the 7/6.</P>

      <P>This is not the type of case that would come before the High Court or the Supreme Court.  In the type of case that would come before this court, it is not a matter for deciding for or against a particular decision.  Let me make myself clear. If a group of workers record a standard rate order and then come to the court for an increase of wages, they may claim 6/-, 7/- or 8/-.  There are as many possible increases as there are pennies between the amount which they are getting and the amount which they are seeking.  It is not a question of voting for or against a particular decision. There is a variety of solutions.  There may be as many different opinions as there are members of the court, just as on any issue that comes before this House, there may be as many opinions as there are members of the Dáil.  It is not the type of case in which you can get a majority decision.  There may not be a majority in favour of any one particular solution.  That is why you must provide for some finality, some decision by the court which will be announced to the parties.  You must have some arrangement which will prevent the court being put into the ignominious position of coming back to the Department <Col N="913" /> and saying: &ldquo;This court cannot decide anything.&rdquo;</P>

My objection to this business is that although the chairman may be in a minority of four to one yet his decision is operative. You have five members of the court. Four of them disagree with the decision of the chairman, yet the chairman is entitled to force his decision on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand that but I never yet found at a meeting of a committee or at any time here in the Dáil that some person who came in with the most peculiar view in the world, perhaps, should have the right to impose that view on other members of the body because the others could not agree and that the other members would have to line up and back that view.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take this calmly. In talking about the chairman's peculiar views, they may be sound from his own point of view but ultimately he may put over a decision as a decision of the board and four out of the five members may disagree with him.  Is not that what may happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but suppose the four do disagree, one individual wants one thing and another wants another, the chairman may say: &ldquo;You are not going to have No. 1 proposition or No. 2 proposition, but going to have mine, No. 3.&rdquo;  One man then comes in and gives the decision as the effective decision, although it is his own and the four members of the board are opposed to it.</P>

Is it not obvious that, if one side to the dispute wants one thing and the other side wants another, the only decision one can get is for the chairman to agree or disagree with one side or suggest a compromise and, in the event of a compromise, surely that compromise will not suggest a decision adverse to both parties.  I cannot see the chairman coming in, as Deputy Norton suggested, where the workers are asking for 10/- and the employers are prepared to give 7/6, and saying he is going to reduce the wages or is going to make them 12/6. Surely that cannot happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister recall what happened in the Railway Wages Board, which would be the nearest analogy to what we are dealing with?  The Railway Wages Board functioned for about 20 years and never found a decision on the opinion of one member of the court. There might be differences of opinion, but the decision always was a majority decision, made by representatives of the labour side with the chairman, or of the employers' side with the chairman. There is a good deal to be said for Deputy Norton's point, that if it is to be a decision it should not be a decision of the chairman alone.  In most cases, one may take it there will not be agreement amongst the ordinary members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the Agricultural Wages Board, the farmers and the workers may have agreed in the regional areas but on sending their decisions forward they were not observed when it came to the Central Wages Board, so the agreements were of no value at all, because of the <Col N="916" /> operation of the precise powers which the chairman is given here.  Deputy O'Sullivan has quoted the case of the Railway Wages Board.  That was a board dealing with a very big industry and there the whole procedure for arriving at decisions was by majority vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And it was fairly slow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Slowness had nothing to do with the decision.  The Railway Wages Board brought probably more peace to the railway industry than any other type of board brought to any other industry in this country.  The most remarkable thing is that, in the last quarter of a century, there was no strike in the railway industry.  That was due to the operation of the Railway Wages Board.  That is a very fine record and has proved their ability to avert many an upheaval.  Therefore, even if you arrive at a decision slowly and in doing so avoid a dislocation, there is something to be said for the procedure.  The Minister ought to think over this matter again.  My fear is that he is in the realm of adventure on this point and is giving the chairman power to bring in his decision as a decision of the court, though four members may be opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to think over the point, if the Deputy will undertake to think over my amendment and see the possibilities that might arise in the event of the court not being able to arrive at a decision at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the court were to come to a decision, even a majority decision, that by itself would be a reflection on the chairman.  If the chairman is fitted for this position and there is a court of five, in ordinary cases or even in extraordinary cases, if he is not able to get a decision other than a decision of his own which would conflict with the other four, it seems to me that he is not the man to make this machine run.  What concerns me is <Col N="917" /> the necessity for sub-section (2) of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is merely to meet the danger of having to set up a second court, I think the wording ought to be very different from what it is.  Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The chairman may direct that, for the consideration of a particular matter, the court shall consist of the chairman and two ordinary members selected by him, namely, a worker's member and an employer's member, and, if the chairman so directs, no other member shall act as a member of the court in respect of that matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned two types of case where that procedure might be necessary.  We have the case where a workers' or an employers' member might be ill and the court would direct that there should be only one on the opposite side, that is, if there were only one workers' representative there would be only one employers' representative. The other case is where an employer or a worker, by reason of some past association, might not be regarded as fully capable of exercising an impartial judgment on an individual case.</P>
      <P>In that case, because of the possibility of objecting to an individual member of the court on account of that association, it is provided that the chairman can exercise his power under this sub-section.  Originally, it was intended that a deputy member could be availed of in these circumstances, but as we have abolished the deputy members we have to provide some alternative and this is the alternative suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 33 because it is desirable that, if the tribunal thought it necessary, they should be enabled to allow counsel or solicitors to represent <Col N="922" /> an interested party.  If an interested party before appearing in proceedings before the tribunal wish to be represented in this way, I think it is undesirable they should be prevented by the rules.  This amendment would enable an interested party to make their case before the tribunal by counsel or solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another of the proposals which came to me from the Council of the Bar of Ireland Law Society, to which I said that I should not offer opposition if there was agreement for their adoption.  I find, however, that there is no such agreement. On the contrary, the view which is strongly held by the organisations representative of workers is that the ordinary business of the court should not be done either through counsel or solicitors.  The scheme of the Bill provides, generally, for negotiation between all parties concerned in trades or occupations, followed by application to the court, under one section of the Bill or another, which would ordinarily be made on behalf of the workers concerned by their trade unions.  The trade unions are accustomed to present their own cases without the help of barristers or solicitors and, if employers were represented by barristers or solicitors, it is obvious that legal points might be raised which would force the trade unions to employ barristers or solicitors as well.  There are a number of trade unions which, in these circumstances, might be involved in costs so considerable in relation to their resources that they would hesitate to avail of the court at all.  In any event, it is desirable to retain the practice by which trade unions, through their officers, speak on behalf of their members in cases where legal issues do not properly arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules to be made by the court may permit of counsel or solicitors being heard where legal issues are involved and I assume the court will be concerned to act in this matter so as to facilitate the parties coming before it and to induce parties to come before it.  In framing this Bill, I have taken considerable note of the provisions of corresponding legislation in New Zealand.  This Bill is different <Col N="923" /> in many respects from the New Zealand measure but I notice that the New Zealand Act prohibits absolutely barristers and solicitors from appearing in conciliation cases, although they may be allowed to appear in arbitration proceedings, provided rules are made accordingly for the arbitration court.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the merits of the case which can be made in favour of the amendment, I think the fact that there is no likelihood of getting agreement on the amendment is a substantial argument against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I see about this amendment is that we may give this court a complexion which it is not intended it should have.  It appears on superficial examination to be reasonable for Deputy Cosgrave to say: &ldquo;Let the body be represented in court by solicitor or counsel if the body so desires.&rdquo;  I think a practice of that kind, once started, may result in the course of time in every application which is submitted to the court or every defence which is made in the court being made to the accompaniment of a battery of legal people on both sides, with the result that, although you are endeavouring to set up an industrial court, you may very well, by permitting that type of practice to grow, evolve an ordinary legal court.  I think it would be a mistake if this court were to take on a legal complexion.  I do not think that we intended that the court should have that complexion.  The whole intention underlying the Bill is to provide a recognised and formalised procedure by which unions and employers can now discuss before an industrial court matters which they discussed, perhaps, in the Department of Industry and Commerce or at some neutral venue.  Our aim was to set up a court in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the ordinary cases before the court will be types of cases which unions at present deal with by direct negotiations.  For instance, if there is a dispute at the docks to-day, what happens is that the dockers' employers on the one hand and the unions on the other, when <Col N="924" /> they are brought together, go to the Department of Industry and Commerce and there argue the points in dispute.</P>
    <P>Both sides know what is involved in the point at issue: whether employers are prepared to give whatever those on strike want.  Both know the other's point of view and what is at issue. Unless one were familiar with the technical vernacular of a particular employment, one could listen in to these discussions and know very little about what was happening.  Those involved on both sides are familiar with what is at issue and are able to discuss the matter so involved.  It does not seem to me to be necessary, if you have a strike at the docks, to bring in counsel or solicitor to argue the merits of whether a docker should get a week's holidays or a fortnight's holidays.  Nor, if you have a dispute in a coal mine, is it necessary to bring in counsel or solicitor to adjudicate upon whether the check-weigh man in the colliery is doing his work in a particular way and whether he should not do it in another way.  Nor, if you have a dispute in a cotton mill, is it necessary to have counsel or solicitor to argue whether the members of the staff there are to handle ten or 20 looms.  That is the type of case which, in the main, will be heard by this industrial court.  Frankly, I think it is better to leave these issues to the parties who are familiar with the points in dispute.  Let them argue the merits of the case and let the court pass judgment on the issues submitted to it for consideration.  As I said, I think it would be a mistake if you make this a purely legal court and if you import into it the type of procedure which goes hand in hand with the hearing of evidence in a properly constituted legal court.  I think, therefore, that, except there is some point of law involved &mdash; and frankly it is not easy to visualise what points of law could be involved &mdash; the court should ordinarily operate by the employers' representatives on the one hand and the workers' representatives on the other hand submitting their case for adjudication by the industrial court.</P>
    <P>I can understand legal people saying that if a case is going to be heard in a court people should have recourse to <Col N="925" /> legal advice and it is probably the fact that it is described as a court that is inducing legal people to plead for the right of access to it.  If it were described as an arbitration tribunal, possibly the question would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>But, because it is described as an industrial court, very likely legal people think they ought to have access to it, feeling that once the title &ldquo;court&rdquo; is used they ought not to be excluded.  But this is a special court doing in a regular way work done every day of the week without counsel or solicitor in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I do not think its functions will be in any way assisted by the granting of permission to counsel to appear there in any case in which either side desires to bring counsel.  Probably the more satisfactory way would be to admit the principle that, if points of law are involved, there is the right either by the applicants or the body resisting the application to bring in counsel for the purpose of clarification of legal issues, but not on a matter of industrial facts or economic facts such as, in the main, will represent the work of the industrial court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We need not discuss the question of law arising at the moment.  But I think that if a question of law does arise, this tribunal will be in some difficulty in deciding it. I think it was Deputy Larkin pointed out on the Second Stage that you would have a lay tribunal dealing with matters which would be a question of law. Under Section 31, I think it is, any question arising under this part of the Bill shall not be heard in any court of law and shall be determined only by this court.  So far as that goes, it probably does not arise.  But I understand that the Wages Advisory Tribunal which has operated during the emergency has heard cases where employers, and, I think, in certain cases, trade unions were represented by either solicitor or counsel.  So far as that tribunal was concerned, I understand that it worked satisfactorily</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton, of <Col N="926" /> course, that, if a solicitor and counsel are in a matter before the tribunal, it will in the normal way give rise to the rather lengthy procedure which is associated with a court.  On the other hand, this court has power to hear evidence and, if you have a lay court and lay interrogators examining witnesses on oath, you may visualise a situation in which all kinds of extraneous matters will be brought in for which there will be no settled rule of procedure.</P>
    <P>In an ordinary case, the judge and the practitioners before him are bound by the particular rules governing the examination of witnesses, etc., while in this case there will be nobody present who will be in a position to guide the court as to the proper procedure. To say that the registrar will keep the court right on legal matters is, I think, an extension of the registrar's duties.  I know of one lay court, at any rate, which the registrar has not prevented from going off the rails although he has legal knowledge. Of course, if there is general opposition to it, I realise that this amendment may not meet with approval. But I should like to direct attention to the position in which non-legal people will be dealing in the normal way with what would be regarded as matters within the purview of people trained in legal procedure and the determination of such matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the prohibition on representation of persons by counsel or solicitor is not absolute. We give the court power to make rules providing for cases in which persons may appear before the court by counsel or solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a part of the difficulty in deciding this question is that referred to by Deputy Norton, namely, the use of the word &ldquo;court&rdquo;.  The usual conception of justice, so far as a court is concerned, is that of a blindfolded figure holding a scales.  The figure, although it holds the scales, has no part in the weighing down of the scales.  I think the type of court we are discussing is something much more informal.  It is a court <Col N="927" /> that will take an active part, not only in investigating and considering evidence, but even in eliciting evidence and, if necessary, even suggesting to either party particular forms of argument that might help to determine the question at issue.  There will be no partisanship and no bias shown.</P>
      <P>It seems to me the way in which the Bill sets down this matter is the best way, namely, that the court can set down certain cases in which parties may be represented by counsel.  I think, without being unfair in any way to members of the legal profession, in certain cases where the parties are represented by members of the legal profession, there is a tendency to delay the proceedings.  The presentation of the evidence must of necessity be secondhand.  In cases where it is possible to have the employer present at the tribunal and either the workers directly concerned or their trade union officials, who have a direct and personal knowledge of the trade they represent, the proceedings have been quick and the court has been greatly helped in its work.</P>
      <P>As to the question raised, that many employers have not got the experience of trade union officials in presenting cases, that difficulty is being rapidly overcome because a great number of employers have that specialised representation on their own side.  So long as there is provision whereby the court can make arrangements for certain types of cases in which it might be considered necessary to have legal representation, I think that is sufficient to meet the arguments put forward in relation to this amendment.  If we had a form of court in which both parties would be legally represented it might be a safeguard against some of the possibilities referred to by Deputy Cosgrave, but in some cases it might tend to give rise to further friction, which is not separable from courts of law. That is a thing we largely avoid in the informal way in which discussions between trade unions and employers are carried on.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 45, to delete the word &ldquo;twenty-five&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At various stages the Minister emphasised that this will not be an ordinary court and that we should move away from anything suggesting penalties. I suggest that a £25 penalty on a witness not attending the court or for not producing a certain type of document seems to be too drastic.  We feel that at most the figure should be a nominal figure and we suggest £10 instead of £25.  That is based on the principle that we should endeavour to keep away from penal clauses as far as possible.  I do not think there is any case for such a drastic penalty as £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put my case to the Deputy and let him decide the issue.  This is the normal penalty.  It is a maximum penalty and it is imposed at the discretion of the normal court.  It is not the labour court that imposes the penalty.  An offence having been committed, it is the ordinary court that will decide what the penalty is.  Ordinarily I would not be prepared to contest the suggestion for an alteration of this figure, but there is this point to be considered.  If we depart from what appears to be the ordinary practice we appear to suggest that disregard of the summons of this court is a less serious offence than disregard of the summons of some other court or tribunal and it might appear that we are attaching less importance to the dignity of this court than to the dignity of other courts I have in mind such a body as the Prices Commission and other bodies of that kind which had power to summon witnesses.  I would not like to regard disobedience of the summons of this court as a less serious offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of grounds on which a person might commit an offence.  He might refuse to attend the court, he might <Col N="929" /> refuse to take the oath, to produce certain documents or to reply to any question in regard to which the court might legally require an answer.  Suppose workers are summoned as witnesses. It is quite conceivable that questions would be put to them and, because of their ordinary loyalty or the general atmosphere among workers, they might hesitate in answering and, if they failed to answer, the court could impose a penalty of £25.  It is from that point of view that I think the fine might be reduced to the figure of £10 set out in the amendment.  With regard to the failure of witnesses to attend before the court, to refuse to take an oath or to produce a document, we should keep in line with the practice in other courts.  Here we are dealing with something more.  We are dealing with ordinary workmen, not professional men who, in the main, would be called before such bodies as the Prices Commission, and we would be entering into realms where considerations other than legal considerations have a certain effect upon the witnesses.</P>

      <P>If the ordinary courts impose a fine of £10 or £25 on a defendant and, if the circumstances justify an appeal, it is possible to appeal to the Minister for Justice to waive or reduce the fine.

Therefore, it would be desirable to have some liaison between this court and the Statistics Branch in regard to this part of its functions, so that there would be no overlapping and that the information coming to one authority would be available to the other and thus help to increase the value of the reports published.  There will be no difficulty in providing for this court, either on a temporary or permanent basis, whatever trained staff they require to prepare that part of their report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I framed the Bill originally, it provided for absolute agreement between the parties as a condition precedent to registration. When I was discussing the matter with the Irish Trade Union Congress, Deputy Larkin pointed to the possibility of a situation arising in a trade like the building trade where there might be 14 or 15 trade unions of workers or 14 or 15 groups of employers concerned with the negotiations and in the drafting of the agreement.  I was told it was considered desirable to prevent the possibility of one small union of workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Or employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or one small group of employers preventing the registration of the agreement by objecting to its registration.  That was the argument <Col N="937" /> used against having absolute agreement amongst all parties.  It was desired to create a situation in which, assuming all the important parties to the agreement wanted registration, registration could be effected, even though one small group on either side had some objection to it.  It was to meet that difficulty that the Bill was amended.  This particular amendment is merely an improvement on the wording of the section, but the Bill as originally framed was amended to try to meet the point.  I could not devise any better form of words than those employed here: &ldquo;substantial agreement amongst the parties.&rdquo;  It is quite clear that the court will not be concerned to find out the number of individuals comprising each party.  If there are eight or nine trade unions, it would require to have the substantial agreement of eight or nine trade unions.  The mere fact that one union had more members than all the others put together would not enable that one union to procure registration even though the other six or seven object.</P>

      <P>This arose out of the big building strike where the negotiation of a settlement was delayed for a very long time by a small section on each side. Deputy Dockrell will remember it, because he was a party to the negotiations.  The main body of the agreement was settled long before the strike ended.  The difficulty was one of getting the approval of a small section on each side for the agreement. It was to avoid the possibility of a small section on each side preventing the registration of an agreement that registration was made conditional upon substantial agreement amongst the parties, rather than absolute agreement amongst all parties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 45:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (3), page 10, to <Col N="942" /> delete paragraph (b), lines 3 to 9, and substitute therefor:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  that the agreement is expressed to apply to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  all workers of a particular class or grade and their employers, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  all workers and employers in in a particular trade, avocation or industry, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  all workers of a particular class or grade and their employers in a specified area or in more than one specified area, or</P>
    <P>(iv)  all workers and their employers in a particular trade, avocation or industry in a specified area or in more than one specified area, or</P>
    <P>(v)  where the court is satisfied that it is reasonable or expedient, all the workers or all the workers of a particular class or grade and their employer or employers in one or in more than one specified establishment or undertaking.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (b) only a small number of agreements would come within its definition, and the amendment aims at bringing within the definition all sectional agreements which are negotiated between unions and employers. The amendment, therefore, sets out in a more classified way the types of agreement which can be registered and I think they are wider than under the provisions of the Bill as it at present stands.  For instance, it seems to me to be doubtful if you can register an agreement between a single employer and a trade union.  The possibility of doing that is provided for under the amendment now moved.  It does not seem to me possible to do that under the Bill, as it stands, unless we can get from the Minister a clearer interpretation of the section than it is possible for me to make.</P>

      <P>I thought that was what the Deputy was aiming at and on that basis I am advised that the amendment is not necessary.  As Section 26, sub-section (3), sub-paragraph (b) stands at the moment it covers an agreement expressed to apply to all workers of a particular class, and the term class is <Col N="943" /> not defined.

      <P>I have been advised on that.  I take it the Deputy's amendment is to provide for agreements between individual employers, covering employees employed by individual employers or workers covered under particular criteria, or trades, which they normally follow.  I am told the term &ldquo;class&rdquo; is wide enough to cover any definition you like so long as they can be clearly identified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So, if a trade union makes an agreement with a large employer in the city, who carries on a diversified type of trade, such as drapery, hardware, bicycles, repair work, electrical goods, the sale or manufacture of electrical goods and repair work of such, that miscellaneous type of industry can be described under the agreement as workers employed in that particular employment and sub-paragraph (b) will cover that.</P>

      <P>Even where you define them as being employees of a particular firm you will still have to subdivide them.  There you may come into conflict with the agreement.  There have been cases under the Emergency Powers (No. 266) Order of such conflict.  Apart from that definition of class, I would submit to the Minister that the amendment will be helpful to the court and also to the employers and trade unions in arriving at the particular category and the particular basis on which the agreement is made.  The amendment grades the various types of agreement because we proceed on the very wide basis of dealing with a whole class or grade, then work down by reference to a trade or vocation, and finally we arrive at the case of the single employer, and then the areas.</P>
      <P>In the section under the Bill at present we have very wide definitions referring to a particular class and their employers, or to all workers and employers, in a specified trade or industry, or all such workers or employers in a particular area.  I would submit to the Minister that the amendment, apart altogether from proving helpful in clearing up the difficulty in regard to the final class, would be helpful in providing some foundation on which to work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are both anxious to secure that there will be no restriction of any kind upon the registration of agreements.  The paragraph as framed is, I am advised, the widest possible so long as we do not attempt to define the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;class&rdquo; covers any group of workers which can be designated by reference to their employers, their place of employment, the name of <Col N="946" /> their employer, or anything else.  We have tried to break it down, but we are avoiding any attempt to define the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; precisely because that would have a restrictive effect on the powers of the court.  I shall have the section examined so long as my statement on it, as it stands, is not misconstrued.  Any class of workers can be defined by reference to any situation whatsoever and can be registered. I think that is all the Deputies have in mind.  It is certainly what I have in mind.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 46:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), page 10, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; in line 13 to the end of paragraph (d).</P>
      <P>Section 26 (d) provides that the court shall register agreements in the register if it is satisfied, among other things, &ldquo;that the agreement will not have the effect of unduly restricting employment generally or the employment of workers of a particular class and that it will not have the effect of ensuring or protecting the retention in use of inefficient or unduly costly machinery or methods of working&rdquo;. Now, the purpose of this amendment is to relieve the court of the obligation of saying&mdash;and personally I think it has no qualifications to say it&mdash;whether an agreement will restrict the employment of workers of a particular class, or whether it will have the effect of ensuring or protecting the retention in use of inefficient or unduly costly machinery or methods of working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to me to be a pretty heavy burden of responsibility to put on a court of this kind.  For instance, if there was a dispute between bakery employers and bakers this section would place upon the court the obligation of ensuring that any agreement arrived at would not have the effect of retaining the present method of baking as against some other method of baking, or the use of inefficient methods. You might have a dispute between hairdressers and their employees and the agreement there must ensure that provision is not made for the retention <Col N="947" /> of methods of dressing hair which are in fact regarded as obsolete and the consequent retention of inefficient methods of operation in such a case.</P>
    <P>What qualifications has the court for making an inquiry into a matter of this kind?  An agreement is negotiated and registered.  Is the court to go through all such agreements individually and ascertain whether they can be registered having regard to these conditions, that the agreement will not have the effect of unduly restricting employment generally or the employment of workers of a particular class and that it will not have the effect of ensuring or protecting the retention in use of inefficient or unduly costly machinery or methods of working?  Take, for instance, an agreement registered between coal owners and coal miners. What power or what qualification would the court have to adjudicate upon the question of whether the agreement was such as to have the effect of ensuring or protecting the retention in use of inefficient or unduly costly machinery or methods of working? The members of the court probably never saw a coal mine in their lives and probably would have no notion of going down a coal mine. They probably would not be interested in a coal mine.  All they are concerned with is to promote industrial peace. This clause would seem to put on the court the duty of inquiring into the effects of an agreement before it can be registered.  It is putting on the court a responsibility which it has no qualifications to discharge, which it will not have the time to discharge and which should not be placed on a court constituted in this way.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say in defence of this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me be quite clear. All associations of employers and trade union workers can make any agreements they wish and enforce these agreements amongst themselves, even if these agreements have an anti-social effect but, having made an agreement which has an anti-social effect, it is I think unreasonable to expect that that agreement will be accepted for registration and made enforceable under <Col N="948" /> the authority of the law, as a registered agreement will be.  That is the point I am getting at, that we should not put behind an anti-social agreement the authority of this Bill.  Such agreements have been made and will, no doubt, be made again.  While we are not making them illegal and while we are not taking any action to upset them, we are not at the same time proposing to give them the endorsement of public approval which they would appear to have if accepted for registration.  That is why the court should be entitled to say: &ldquo;We will not accept the agreement for registration.&rdquo; That, however, does not end the agreement but we are not endorsing it from the public point of view by accepting it for registration.</P>

      <P>Take the case of the coal mine again or the case of a marble quarry or a phosphate rock quarry &mdash; something far removed from what is the normal scene of the court's activities. An agreement is arrived at between the employers and the workers. The agreement comes up for registration. That agreement provides for the rate of wages to be paid to workers with certain types of machinery.  Is the court expected to inquire whether that is in fact perpetuating the use of machinery which is inefficient or unduly costly?</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  I am not saying that they should carry out an efficiency survey.  I shall give the type of agreement which I have in mind.  It is purely an imaginary matter, I had better say, to prevent misunderstanding. Let us assume that an association of master plumbers made an agreement with a trade union of plumbers that they would grant an increase in wages on condition that the members of the trade union worked only for the master plumbers thus eliminating competition for the master plumbers.  That agreement is anti-social in its effect and should not get registration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the agreement would be refused registration on the ground that it was unduly restricting employment to workers of a particular class but there would be other cases.  I think the best illustration I could give would be the automatic discharge of grain.  That may be in issue at some port other than in Dublin.  It was in issue at one time in Dublin but I do not think it is now.  There were agreements in operation precluding the use for a time of the automatic plant.  That situation in Dublin was resolved by an agreement in the negotiation of which I participated.  Any agreement of the kind that had existed I would have regarded as unduly restrictive and of a kind to which we could not afford to give approval.</P>

      <P>Ordinarily an agreement between workers' unions and employers' unions would not prescribe the type of machine to be used, say, in a cotton mill.  There would be sections in the agreement covering the number of people to be employed in relation to a particular output or the number of machines that an individual operative could handle but there might be provision in it for the use of hand looms instead of automatic looms.  If that were so, it would be undesirable that it should be registered.</P>

      <P>I am objecting to the portion in which an obligation is put on the court, which it cannot discharge, of inquiring before it registers an agreement what effect that agreement has from the standpoint that it will not have the effect of ensuring or protecting the retention in use of inefficient or unduly costly machinery or methods of working.  It seems to me that in every case in which an agreement is presented to the court for registration, the court would have to go through each agreement to see whether or not it would have these effects.  In most of these cases the court will have simply to register the agreement automatically. I should not like to be a <Col N="951" /> member of the court that would have to inquire, for instance, into the effects of agreements between employers and workers in the building trade.  Deputy Dockrell is one of the few Deputies who could interpret an agreement of that kind.  There are all kinds of phrases used.</P>

      <P>We would be a lot better off with a broad generalisation. The Minister is trying, as he says, to get a barrier against anti-social agreements, but the types he has in mind are not the types he is providing against.  In the case of a large transport concern which undertakes to give very much improved conditions to workers, on the basis that they mutually <Col N="952" /> agree to impose higher fares on the public, the company getting increased dividends and the workers getting exceptionally good conditions, there is a case where what the Minister has in mind would have to be considered.  That is the kind of case a court could deal with, as it would have a report on the company's earning capacity and its capacity to pay wages.  In the case of inefficiency or unduly costly machinery or methods, that would never appear in an ordinary agreement and, unless there is a specific agreement, it would not attract the attention of the court. This court will be up against the problem of making an inquiry which it is not competent to carry out.  A much broader statement on the lines the Minister had in mind would be better, dealing in a general way with anti-social effects and leaving out the finer provisions he is trying to bring in.</P>
      <P>In regard to the portion dealing with the restriction on workers in employment in a particular class, we are opening a field where the court would have to be very careful or would get into difficulties in regard to ordinary working practice and would not be effective against an anti-social practice.  In such a case, it may be argued that a ratio of 3 to 1 is restricting employment, but if they start to inquire on those lines, the court will not make very much progress.  That is the kind of prospect opened up to the court by the present phrasing.  If it were stated that &ldquo;an agreement which was manifestly anti-social in character should not be registered&rdquo;, that would give the court power to decide in exceptional cases.  In the broad type of case that might arise, it might just be the type they would not inquire into. On the other hand, there is an opening left, if the court in its wisdom does not embroil itself in discussions in regard to working practice, creating many difficulties and imperilling its use as a labour court.  The Minister might reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>I thought of the type of case to which the Deputy has referred and deliberately decided to omit it, that is, giving the court power to refuse to register an agreement because <Col N="953" /> the effect would be to increase the cost of goods or services to the community. Clearly that could not be done, as any agreement providing for better conditions and improved wages must ultimately increase prices to the public, unless there is a considerable offset in savings on cost in other directions.  I think it is sufficient to give the court power to refuse to register an agreement because it appears to the court, without any detailed examination, to be undesirable to register it on those grounds. That is why I suggest the paragraph might be made to say: &ldquo;the court is satisfied that the agreement is not intended to have the effect&rdquo;.  Then the court would have to have regard only to the expressed intention of the agreement and would have power to refuse to register only if it were expressly intended to limit the type of working, or the method or machinery used in the operation.  That would meet the argument put forward that the court might be expected to undertake a technical investigation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 47:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) to insert before paragraph (f) a new paragraph as follows: &mdash;</P>
      <P>(f) that the agreement specifies, in regard to each trade union of workers which is a party to the agreement, the persons or bodies of persons (in this Part referred to as controlling authorities) who have authority to direct a strike of any members of that trade union who are affected by the agreement, and.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to another amendment to Section 30 and arises out of the discussion we had on the Second Stage.  Section 30 provided that where a registered agreement is broken by a trade union which is party to the agreement, certain penalties could be imposed on the trade union.  I do not want to refer to the particular penalties now, as that is a matter we will have to settle later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out that action might be taken by the president of the union or by members of the union without the consent of the controlling authority of the union which, in fact, made the agreement and that, therefore, it was reasonable to limit the penalties provided for breach of the agreement to breaches which were sanctioned by the controlling authority of the union which made the agreement.  I accepted that contention and undertook to amend the Bill.  It seemed to me that the best way of doing it was to require that, when an agreement was registered, the controlling authority of the union who would have authority to direct a strike should be indicated in the agreement.  The legal difficulty is <Col N="955" /> that a trade union is a trade union but there is not in law any indication of an executive authority in a union.  The law relates to a trade union as a whole. Therefore, it was necessary to have the executive authority of the union clearly indicated in some way.  The best way that I could get it indicated was to have it named in the agreement when registered.  That is the purpose of the section, and relates to the other amendment to be moved later that provides that when an agreement is registered the authority of the union whose action could, if they wanted to do it, break the agreement, will be named in the section, so that if there is to be any penalty imposed for a breach of the agreement it will be on the named authority that it will be imposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment says that the agreement must set out the persons or bodies of persons who have authority to direct a strike of any members of a trade union who are affected by the agreement.  It seems to me to be drawn without knowledge of what really happens.  Nobody in a trade union that I know of directs a strike except the people affected by the strike.  Let us take a craft union in which all the members belong to the one craft.  They have a claim in for some improvement in conditions.  The employer says that he cannot concede the claim.  He may offer something which is very much short of their demands. They may consider his offer and say that they will not accept it: that they want more.  Negotiations go on and ultimately the stage is reached in which there is a deadlock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employer says that he is not prepared to do any more.  The union ballot on the question of a strike. There is a vote taken and notice is served on the employer intimating that a strike will take place unless the demands made are conceded.  There may be a membership of 4,000 or 5,000 in the union.  There is a vote taken, and it is found that the majority are in favour of a strike.  The majority decide on that and the strike is automatic. This amendment seems to me to conceive that it is an official or an <Col N="956" /> executive committee that has the right to decide that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in fact, there can be no strike except by the body of the members voting for it, then clearly it is the body of the members who are the controlling authority.  If the situation is as the Deputy says, there will be no strike unless that body have voted for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister wants this information for another purpose but the information that he is getting does not suit for the other purpose: if that is the information that he wants &mdash; who decides on the question of a strike.  This agreement may, therefore, provide that for the purpose of furnishing this information, it is the members of the union, or the section concerned in the dispute, that decide on the question of a strike.  That gives the Minister certain information, but that information is of no use for the purpose for which it is wanted in the later section, namely, to ascertain on whom the penalties ought to be imposed if there is an irregular breach of the agreement.  This amendment seems to assume that someone is vested with the power to direct a strike. There is no question of that because in most unions the members vote on the question of a strike.  The strike is then automatic.  This amendment seems to conceive a situation in which there is a leader, a fuehrer, in the background and that it is he who gives the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.</P>

It seems to me that you cannot use the phrase &ldquo;executive committee&rdquo; unless you can say that it is the controlling authority which may not be the case and would not be the case in the illustration which the Deputy has given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The members have a ballot on the question.  The executive may think that it is unwise to go on strike.  The members decide the question. There is a vote on the matter, and that makes the strike automatic. <Col N="957" /> This amendment seems to me to make the approach that there is some authority which directs a strike.  That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to convey anything like that.  An agreement is negotiated on behalf of a union. There is somebody that will carry out the negotiations.  The whole body of the members do not participate in the negotiations.  The agreement would be negotiated through some executive committee or group of representatives, and having been negotiated will, presumably, be presented to the members for approval.  The agreement is subsequently presented for registration, and is registered.  Now, that agreement is clearly binding on someone. Those who made the agreement have entered into a contract with the other parties to it, undertaking to observe its terms.  Registration, apart from anything else, is a proof of good faith in that regard.  At a subsequent stage that agreement is broken by the trade union.  The union calls the members out on strike against the provisions of the agreement.  What we have got to decide is, who is responsible for that action?  If we are going to make the Bill effective there must be somebody whom you can hold responsible for breach of the agreement if there has been a breach.  I know there is difficulty there and I would like to get the views of those who are more familiar than I am with the organisation of trade unions on that point.  We must have some means of designating the people of whom it can be said, if there is a breach of the agreement, that they are responsible for the breach, while at the same time protecting that authority within the union from being held responsible for action taken by a group of members against their will or their instructions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that during the building of the sugar factory at Mallow there were members of a local union of bricklayers employed there.  One of the rules of that union was that no agreement could be arrived at unless all the members unanimously assented to it.  It was a very unworkable rule, but apparently it had been a rule for a number of years so that even when <Col N="958" /> there was a suggestion to improve their conditions, unless all the members were unanimous about it there could not be any action taken.  Clearly, in that case you could not say that there was any authority in that small union except the whole body of the members.  In every case there must be some authority which is recognised as the official authority in the union, and for the purpose of this section it must be the authority of whom it could be said that if they had not assented to this strike in breach of the agreement the strike would not have taken place.</P>

      <P>The point at issue goes a little deeper than the impression conveyed by the Minister.  I can understand the desire to insert this particular amendment to bring it into line with Section 30, arising out of the Second Reading debate, but while understanding it I cannot agree with it.  The Minister will find, I think, that this particular section, with Section 30, are likely to give rise to very keen controversy so far as we are concerned.  This Bill is intended to be a sort of peace machinery as between employers and their employees. Throughout the debate the Minister has expressed the view that the success of the Bill will depend on the confidence there is in the members of the court.  I want to suggest to the Minister that he is unwittingly prejudging the whole issue.  He is presuming that those who are going to break these agreements and, consequently, suffer the penalties set out are the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the Minister the background of the trade union movement in connection <Col N="959" /> with this.  I am sure that he will agree, as all members of the House will agree, that the trade union movement has been an extraordinary movement.  It has been built up by the voluntary efforts and sacrifices of the members who are very jealous indeed of the rights which they have achieved down through the years.  An illustration of that may be found in the position that arose after the Taff Vale judgment, when individual members of trade unions became responsible for the actions of the unions.  The position remained in chaos until the Trades Disputes Act of 1906 was passed.  The legal position which the Trades Disputes Act gives to the unions at present will be revoked, to some extent, by this particular section.  Because of that, the average trade unionist or the trade union to which he belongs will say: &ldquo;Why should we be linked up with machinery of this character if we are to be liable to very severe penalties?&rdquo;  To be successful, the Bill must have confidence from the start. It must not be assumed that the workers are out to destroy the Bill and that they must be made subject to heavy penalties.  This is the background from the trade union point of view.  There is a feeling of uneasiness on the part of trade unionists, not because of this particular section, because they were unaware of it, but because of Section 30 which carries these penalties.  I suggest that the measure should commence to operate with goodwill on both sides and with the assumption that it will be worked for the purpose for which it is intended.  It would be better if this amendment were deleted, together with the relevant sub-section in Section 30.</P>

      <P>I want Deputies of the Labour Party to help me in this regard. It is clear that we cannot simply delete the provisions to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred.  We set out a provision for registration of agreement.  If an agreement is negotiated, it can be registered.  Why should it be registered? There is no need to have an elaborate arrangement for registration of agreements unless certain effects follow from their registration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We want more than a moral effect.  Once an agreement is registered, it becomes binding not only on the parties concerned but, in certain circumstances, on other parties.  That is, however, a matter we can discuss on another section.  For the moment, we may confine ourselves to agreements negotiated between parties and binding on them.  The agreement is binding in law.  If an employer gives his employees lower pay or worse conditions than the agreement provides, the trade union can go to the court, get the arrears of pay made good to the workers, get the conditions improved or get any consequential adjustments which justice may appear to require brought into effect.  If the trade union breaks the agreement, there must be some corresponding advantage to the employer for having it registered.  If he does not agree, the agreement cannot be registered.  What is the inducement to the employer to assent to the registration of the agreement? That is the point we have to discuss.  It is clear that the employer will not assent to the registration of the agreement unless there is some advantage to him in it and I think that the advantage you can give the employer is the assurance that the agreement will be kept by the trade union who made it with him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be regarded, in certain circumstances, by employers as a sufficient penalty.  My argument against amendment No. 66 is that, if a union, having made an agreement which it wants to get out of, just breaks the agreement, and the court punishes it by cancelling registration of the agreement, that is not an inducement to employers to register agreements.  I have put this to the trade union congresses and individual unions with which I discussed the matter.  There must be some advantage to the employer or he will not assent to the registration of an agreement. There is no point in registration, from his point of view, unless it secures that, <Col N="961" /> if the union breaks the agreement, he will have some redress.  What is the redress to be?  I was proposing in the original draft of the Bill that the penalties on the union should be the same as the penalties on the employer. The employer can be required to make good any loss to the worker by reason of his failure to comply with the terms of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was proposing that the union should be required to make good any loss to the employer by reason of the union's failure to keep the agreement. That was objected to.  I decided to delete that provision and to propose instead that the union should be ordered by the court to stop a strike which is contrary to the agreement, and if it fails to stop the strike, having been so ordered by the court, that it should be subject to legal penalties. You must have some provision by which, if a trade union calls a strike in breach of an agreement which it has made, the court may say to the union, &ldquo;You have broken the agreement and you must stop this strike&rdquo;.  It seems to me that the very minimum which the Bill must provide is power to order a union to stop a strike which is in breach of an agreement and some penalty on the union if it refuses to comply with the court's direction and defies the court.  There may be need to cover the case of an unofficial strike. The defence of the union to the labour court may be that its members are on strike against the wishes of the executive authority.  They may say that they do not favour the strike, but that they have no means of preventing the men from going on strike.  Some provision must be made to deal with that type of unofficial action, as well as official action by the union, but what we are discussing at the moment is breach of the agreement by official action of the union.  My proposal is that if the agreement is broken by the union, the court should order the union to stop the strike and that it should be subject to penalty if it does not.  There is a difficulty as regards the designation of the body which has authority to direct a strike and which is to be held accountable in these circumstances.  This amendment endeavours to meet that difficulty of <Col N="962" /> designation.  Is there any objection to ordering a union to stop a strike which is in breach of agreement and, if you have not that provision, why should any employer assent to the registration of an agreement?</P>

      <P>The whole force of the Minister's argument on this amendment and its corollary in Section 30 is that there will be no inducement to the employer to register an agreement.  As it appears to us, all the advantages of registration will flow to the employer.  The employer will, at least have this advantage that, having registered the agreement, it will ensure that his competitors will be obliged to pay the same rates of wages as he does.  That is a sore grievance with him at present.  I venture to say that it is the employers who will see all the advantage of registration under this scheme rather than the workers.</P>

      <P>The Minister is anxious to see that some advantage will flow to the employers.  But, with Deputy O'Sullivan, I think it is already one-sided; that it is by no means on the side of the workers, but the reverse. The Minister states that when an agreement is registered the court will give back to the worker anything he has lost; if he has lost his employment through a misinterpretation of the agreement, that is the most he will get. The Minister forgets that at present the worker has the right to go to the ordinary courts.</P>

      <P>On the other hand, you will find specifically set out here the penalties and punishments to be imposed on the trade union.  If a trade union in a genuine way makes an agreement, I say it will have to keep the agreement.  But there is a loophole by which the trade union can be involved willy-nilly.  On the other hand, the corresponding benefits and advantages to the members are not so clearly set out as against the employer. <Col N="964" /> I still contend that this matter of the industrial court when dealing with a misinterpretation or interpretation of an award when it is in favour of the worker is still too vague.  At the most it can get him back his job and whatever wages he has lost Before the enactment of this law a citizen would be entitled to go to the ordinary court and take an action against his employer, perhaps for hundreds of pounds for loss of character.  That can be taken away by this court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly was not intended to take it away.  As a matter of fact, I feared that it would be argued that Section 30, whilst specific in relation to the penalties that could be imposed on an employer, was far less specific as to the penalties that might be imposed on a trade union and that the balance was the other way around. I do not really mind what goes in as long as something goes in which will make the Part effective.  This is a matter which is far more a concern of the trade unions than it is of mine, in so far as they see the advantages in having a provision for the registration of agreements.</P>
      <P>They see that before provision for the registration of agreements can be made effective there must be some advantages not merely to the trade union, but also to the employer.  What advantage are you giving the employer?  Why should not an employer register an agreement?  That is a question which I want answered. What will be put in their place?  If we put nothing in their place, is not it obvious that no agreement will be registered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that part of our difficulty in this particular debate, which has broadened out very much, is a conception that seems to exist in regard to what trade unions are, that they are something over and above and apart from the workers.  Until we get rid of that conception, I think we will not make any headway in trying to get a working basis for Section 30.  In the ordinary way as between an employer and a body of workers, the whole weight <Col N="965" /> of the bargaining power is on the side of the employer and the redress for that is trade union organisation.  It still is the same body of workers and the trade union organisation is not something apart from the workers. There seems to be a tendency running through Section 30, when we come to the question of the final controlling authority, that there is apart from and above the actual workers involved some other body, either an executive committee or a branch committee, or some kind of corporate body known as a trade union.  Deputy Norton has tried to bring that out in dealing with the question of the controlling authority in regard to ordinary strikes.</P>
      <P>If you went through all the rules of all the trade unions in the world I do not think you would find a complete parallel between any two unions.  It varies from place to place.  In some cases a ballot vote of the members of the union can call a strike; in other cases it is the members of the branch or even the members on a job, after having decided amongst themselves. Generally, the action of the executive committee or branch committee is more of a negative character.  As Deputy Norton said, the members on a particular job may come together and decide that they want to go on strike.  The actual giving effect to that or serving of the notice may be referred to a branch committee or an executive committee, and all they do in practice is either to delay or try to negative as far as they can the decision taken down below.  But, in the ultimate resort, it is the decision taken by the members to which effect has to be given.  If they are insistent or pressing enough, it has to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why we are pressing for a different approach to this matter is that, having defined the controlling authority which it is quite clear was running through the Minister's mind in the form of an executive committee, we come to Section 30 and we find this particularly objectionable section in the Minister's amendment whereby certain clauses of the Trade Disputes Act are taken away in so far as benefit is concerned. Whether he has considered the whole of the possibilities arising out of that I <Col N="966" /> do not know.  But it is clear from what transpired before and after this had to be rectified that if you define the controlling body of a union as the executive committee and a strike takes place called by a branch committee or a secretary or members of the branch, there is no guarantee at the moment that if the provisions of these sections of the Trades Disputes Act are denied to that particular body of workers or to the branch committee and so on, that even the executive committee may not be drawn in, once we open this door to conspiracy.</P>
    <P>What I suggest to the Minister to consider is this: that in so far as the employer and the worker are concerned, if we leave these two parties together, all the advantages lie with the employer, as the ordinary body of workers employed, having no organisation, no financial resources, and completely depending on their own powers to fight an employer, are in a weaker position.  As I say, the balance is redressed when they establish a trade union organisation, not only an organisation in the physical sense, but, more important still, the possibility of having financial resources and other powers behind them.  If we accept the position that an agreement is registered and that we are a party to that agreement, we are under an obligation to keep it.  If we break that agreement or, if it is broken, say, by the members on behalf of whom the agreement is registered, and if we can say then that the line is drawn and the ordinary benefits that flow from trade union organisation for that group of workers as against an employer will cease, then we can see our way clearer, and I think we would say that, where there was a breach of an agreement, that would put a stop on the central funds of the union.  Then you leave the balance clear again between the employees and the employer.  The employer has the benefit of having the agreement registered; he is back in the superior position again.</P>

      <P>I know that.  If it were not for my fears about the Minister's later amendment, amendment No. 70, I would find myself in agreement with what the Minister has said.  So far as I understand the Minister, his point is that an agreement is reached between the employers and the employees; that agreement is registered in the court and, if either party commits a breach of the agreement so registered, either party should be penalised in accordance with the method set out here.  The Minister's difficulty about the trade union is to know who should be penalised.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody will say there is anything unjust if, after an agreement has been voluntarily arrived at and registered before the court and there is a deliberate breach of that agreement, you impose penalties on one side or the other.  I do not think anybody would argue against that. That is the Minister's case.  The difficulty which I gather is put forward by those opposing it is that the wrong parties may be penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, one of the most valuable parts of the Bill is that <Col N="968" /> agreements may be registered and, in the vast majority of cases, it is to the advantage of the workers that agreements should be registered.  Certain Deputies are approaching this part of the Bill from the Dublin point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not say that in any offensive way.  They are looking at it from the position where you have highly organised trade unions, where 100 per cent. of the workers are in the trade unions and where a trade union can exercise its influence.  I am more concerned with agreements that may be made with employers, when this Bill becomes law, outside Dublin City, in the rural areas, where it will be definitely to the advantage of the employees that they should be registered. It should be made clear to employers that if any employer or any number of employers commit a breach of that agreement, the penalty is there and it is in the hands of the workers to see that the penalty will be inflicted. Speaking for general bodies of workers, some only partially organised, some completely disorganised, but who can be got together in groups and probably brought within the protection of this measure, I may say I am mainly concerned with that aspect. It is true, as Deputy Larkin says, that the working of trade unions varies, but I think, generally speaking, a strike of any importance does not take place without being sanctioned by the executive committee of the union concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">

      <P>I said, generally speaking, a strike which is precipitated, particularly if it is a strike in breach of an existing agreement by a section of workers in defiance of the national executive of that organisation. I think the position is one that should be dealt with.  It seems to me that usually executives of unions are slow to sanction strikes unless there is a good case for a strike and unless the workers' interests are definitely jeopardised, because strikes &mdash; and I have had some experience of them &mdash; contrary to what many people believe, are not welcomed by those who have trade union responsibilities.  Apart from all the <Col N="969" /> other worries and troubles they bring, there is the very definite fear of heavy inroads being made on their financial position.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how any trade union that is doing its work in the way in which I think it ought to be done and which its national executive or the executive committee is appointed to do&mdash;to safeguard the interests of all members of the union, not to have them jeopardised by a section in flat contradiction of a decision of the national executive&mdash;would lightly sanction such a strike.  It seems to me the union which has not a national executive &mdash; call it by whatever name you like, but national executive conveys what I mean&mdash;is not, in my opinion, an efficient trade union.  A union that has a national executive that is not prepared to put its foot down against a strike which it does not believe in, is not any advantage to the workers but might, in fact, become a very definite danger.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Morrissey, it is because we are trying to deal with the position where a union tries to protect both the union and the members as a whole against what you might call illegal or unofficial action of a small body of workers, that we are so concerned with this section.  The effect of the Minister's amendment would be that no precautions could be taken by the national executive which would, in the ultimate, guarantee immunity of the union against the action of individuals or groups of members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this to the Deputy: I am an employer.  I make an agreement with a union covering the wages and conditions of my employees. A number of my employees go on strike for the purpose of getting higher wages or better conditions.  I complain to the court.  The court summons the executive of the union and the executive says: &ldquo;We are not assisting the strike.&rdquo;  It seems to me that would mean that the court cannot make an order directed against the controlling authority of the union because they are not in fact assisting the strike but, from the point of view of the employer, his position is no better.  In fact, in some degrees, it is worse because his staff are out on strike in breach of an agreement and he cannot talk to the executive of the union about it because they are not supporting the strike; it is not official so far as they are concerned.  What protection can you give him in the circumstances?  I could not give any except this withdrawal of the Trade Disputes Act from that unofficial strike.  I agree that the withdrawal of Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Trade Disputes Act in that case might have wider consequences than I had in mind. I merely had in mind that an unofficial strike taken, not merely in breach of the agreement, but in defiance of the authority of the union, should not be given legal protection.  I think, however, there is something in Deputy Larkin's point that the interpretation of Sections 3 and 4 of the Trade Disputes Act, might still involve the union <Col N="971" /> authority and the union funds and therefore I would be satisfied, if this would overcome the Deputy's objection, to confine the penalty in the case of the unofficial strike to the withdrawal of the application of Section 2 of the Trade Disputes Act, which deals solely with picketing.</P>
      <P>The situation would then be this: that if there is a strike in defiance of an agreement and the employer complains to the court and satisfies the court that there is a strike which is in breach of the agreement, the court may direct the controlling authority of the union, whatever that controlling authority may be, to refrain from assisting the maintenance of the strike. Or &mdash; and this is an amendment that I would be prepared to consider also &mdash; confining the power of the court to that action or the alternative action of making a declaration which would have the result of withdrawing the protection of Section 2 of the Trade Disputes Act from that dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to define the controlling authority of the union.  That is going to be a problem.  I do not think Deputy Larkin was quite fair to me when he was telling me that a union was not something apart from the workers because, as I framed the Bill originally, I was making no such distinction.  I said the union has made the agreement; the union has broken the agreement; therefore the union should be subject to penalties.  It was the practical difficulties that followed from dealing with the union as a whole, as mentioned by Deputy Norton, that led me into this attempt to distinguish the union from the executive authority of the union.  The executive authority, if it is to be the body identified with the strike, must be defined in some way and the sole purpose of the amendment is to enable that controlling authority to be defined as the trade union wants it to be.  If they say the controlling authority is the whole body of members, O.K., let it be the whole body of members.  If they say it is an executive committee or convention of delegates, O.K., let it be a convention of delegates.  It is whatever they declare it to be will appear in <Col N="972" /> the agreement and it is against whatever controlling authority that is defined in the agreement that the order under Section 34 will be directed.  Therefore, to meet the point that it is necessary to have definition of controlling authority because of the objection advanced on Second Reading by Deputy Norton, we must have some provision of this kind.  Having got over that purely technical difficulty, the position would be that where an agreement is broken by a trade union and the court is satisfied that such a breach has occurred, having heard all the parties, it can do one or other of two things, but not both.  It can either direct the controlling authority of the union not to assist the strike, or it can withdraw the protection of Section 2 of the Trade Disputes Act from the strike. It cannot do both.  The first will be the obvious remedy where the strike is official.  The second the only remedy where the strike is unofficial, but clearly there must be some consequences for the union if the controlling authority, having been directed by the court to refrain from assisting the strike, defies the court and proceeds to assist the strike in contravention of the court's direction. That penalty can only be a financial penalty imposed by the ordinary courts. I do not think it can be anything else.</P>

      <P>That is what I mean &mdash; in other words, their head or whatever you like to call it. The Minister has said that if they like to specify the union as a whole, then he is satisfied.  I want to point out that many strikes start as unofficial strikes.  They are then taken over officially and there is a period in which the employer very often is left in the position that he <Col N="973" /> really does not know what the strike is about or whom it is with.  Supposing the Minister withdraws this amendment and leaves it that there is no protection for the employer who has registered an agreement which contains sections which he has scrupulously to observe or he will be pulled up, and the employer finds that the agreement has been broken and that the reply of the union is that it is unofficial.  The minute you withdraw the penalty from a trade union you will immediately be up against another difficulty, which I am surprised the Minister has not mentioned, namely, that the unofficial part of the union who have taken part in a strike or called a strike which possibly the executive objects to or frowns on, when approached, will say to the officials of the union, &ldquo;what are you worrying about?  We have broken the agreement.  Perhaps we will get something out of it and anyway, there is no penalty.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to get this machinery to operate efficiently, we cannot start off by assuming that a union which enters into an agreement voluntarily will desire deliberately to break it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If a union enters into agreement with an employer for a certain period it ought to respect its obligations to honour the agreement, and I think there will be no difficulty so far as trade unions are concerned generally in having these agreements observed for the stipulated period. The only difficulty which I think the Minister envisages is the difficulty which arises from an unofficial strike and I think, frankly, trade unions, and trade union executives in particular, have to face up to the responsibility of dealing with the unofficial strike.  The unofficial strike is a menace&mdash;Deputy Dockrell would say that it is a menace to the employer &mdash; a worse menace and a worse undermining of authority so far as the trade union is concerned.  No general in charge of an army would allow a portion of that army to decide when they <Col N="974" /> would go on the offensive, or would allow any particular section to decide what tactics they would put into operation. Anybody controlling either an industrial army or a military force has to make sure that there is only one authority in control, and a trade union which has an elected authority has more moral force than any army headquarters staff ever had.  If unions have a democratic way of picking an executive, they have to put up with the obligation of obeying the executive, until they get another.</P>
      <P>Nothing has done more harm to the trade union movement than unofficial strikes, ill-conceived, ill-considered and put into operation without the slightest regard for the good name of the union, or for its standing, its status, its prestige and its bargaining power.  Unions have to face up to the responsibility of dealing with the unofficial strike.  It is a phase of trade union activity which does much more harm to a trade union than to anybody else.  In the main, it does not last long &mdash;it is a sporadic thing, usually conceived on the spur of the moment and implemented without very much consideration, but it does this harm, and, particularly in a country like this, that it creates an agitation and propaganda against trade unions which does much more harm to the trade union movement than it does to employers or anybody else.</P>
      <P>My objection to the unofficial strike is that it is a challenge to a disciplined organisation and a challenge which the trade unions will have to deal with. Members will have to know that, just as in Parliamentary elections and just as in every other type of democratic activity, there has to be a majority controlling within the trade union. Any other type of control or method of implementing decisions simply leads to chaos, and if there has been repressive legislation in certain countries in recent years against trade unions, I am not sure that some of the ill-considered actions of irresponsible people who wanted to injure trade unions were not in some measure responsible for the growth of the mentality which gave birth to that repressive legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is here concerned only <Col N="975" /> with one aspect, the unofficial strike. I suggest that that situation can easily be met by the amendment in the names of Deputies Larkin and Keyes, amendment No. 66, which says: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;....</P>
    <P>(b)  if after due consideration the court is satisfied that the complaint is well-founded &mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the court may, by order, direct the said trade union of workers to refrain from assisting out of its funds in the maintenance of the said strike;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the court may cancel the registration of the agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister there gets authority to empower the court to order a union to estop the utilisation of its funds for the purpose of assisting in the maintenance of an unofficial strike.  It cannot, No. 1, finance an unofficial strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Deputy relate amendment No. 71 to that? Deputy Larkin and Deputy Keyes are moving not merely to insert the words set out in amendment No. 66 with regard to sub-section (2) of Section 30, but to relate sub-section (3), which is the section providing for the financial penalty if a union defies the order of the court.  What happens then?  If, under that amendment, the court orders a trade union to refrain from assisting a strike and if the trade union defies the order and continues to assist the strike, what happens? Must there not be some consequence for that defiance of the court's direction?</P>

It provides for certain rates of wages and certain conditions of employment, and the employer proceeds to make his plans for the carrying on of his business, or enters into contracts, on the assumption that these are the wages and conditions which would apply for that two-year period.  If, in the course of that two-year period, the union authorities begin to regret having made that agreement and want to get into a position in which they can demand better wages or better terms&mdash;they are tied to the agreement because they made it &mdash; if the Deputy's amendment is accepted, they can get out of the agreement by the simple process of breaking it and defying the court when the court directs them to refrain from assisting.  The only penalty would be cancellation of the agreement which might be precisely what they wanted to secure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton's whole case, as I see it, is that if a union is prohibited from using its funds for financing a strike, it will accept, that no union would consider for a moment breaking an agreement which they had registered and had voluntarily arrived at and no union would refuse to carry out an order of the court when its funds are estopped. Therefore, it does not matter about the penalties, because then the penalties do not come into play at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me put this possibility.  Supposing an agreement is entered into and is registered, that subsequently there is an unofficial strike, and the union executive is directed by the court, in accordance with the amendment, and they agree to the direction, that executive might be changed at a general meeting.  The volume of opinion at that meeting might be against the agreement, and there might be <Col N="978" /> sufficient change in the executive to make all the difference.</P>

It must be clear that employers will not find it cheaper to pay the penalty than the prescribed wages in certain cases.  If the objection is to the size of the penalty we can come to agreement on that.  I merely provide, in accordance with the Deputy's amendment No. 66, that if there is default there will be an action against the union involving some penalty.</P>

      <P>It might.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A common-sense court will do that.  The intention is to avoid having an agreement so ambiguous as not to be understood.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that where employers and workers have by long usage established agreement in what might be called trade language of their own and if they persist in using phrases which they clearly understand, an agreement ought not to be incapable of registration, merely because by resorting to other language it might be thought not to mean the same thing.</P>

In the amendment which the Minister has moved to sub-section (5) &mdash; that is, amendment No. 52 &mdash; there is provision by which the court shall direct persons as to the manner in which they shall publish the particulars of the agreement which it is proposed to register; and then the court may refuse to register the agreement until that direction has been complied with.</P>

    <P>What is the purpose of publicising the whole thing if it is not intended that somebody will be entitled to comment on the proposal to register the agreement?  If they do comment on the proposal to register the agreement what function has the court in respect of their comments?  Has it, for instance, any power to hear them and, <Col N="983" /> having heard them, has it any power to decline to register the agreement? What precisely underlies the idea of publishing the intention to register?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular point of objection I had in mind was this, that the parties to the agreement might not, in fact, be representative of the employers or workers concerned.  I was not contemplating objections to the provisions of the agreement, if the parties who made the agreement were representative of the workers and employers concerned.  The provisions of the agreement are solely a matter for the parties themselves.  The court may register the agreement without regard to its provisions, except in accordance with the provisions laid down here.  It would have to have objection if the agreement were lodged and if it were such that the trade union that signed the agreement did not, in fact, represent the workers concerned or the employers who signed did not, in fact, represent the employers concerned.  That would be a valid ground under which the court could object to registering the agreement.  The idea I had in mind was the representative character of the agreements.</P>

    <P>I think this matter has been referred to two or three times already.  It might happen that new legislation would become effective which would provide minimum conditions of employment better than those provided in a registered agreement.  It might be that an agreement would be registered which would help to cover a class of workers already covered by a joint labour committee and for whom minimum rates would be in force.  Generally, I think it is desirable to have some safeguarding clause of this kind to ensure that, whatever effect a registered agreement may have on workers, it cannot deprive them of any rights they have under any other law or any other <Col N="985" /> part of this Act.  I think it is desirable there should be such a safeguarding clause in view of such a possibility.</P>

      <Col N="986" /> (1)  If a registered employment agreement provides for the variation of the agreement in accordance with this section, any party to the agreement may apply to the court to vary it in its application to any worker or group of workers to whom it applies.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where an application is made under this section to vary an agreement, the court, having notified all parties appearing to the court to be concerned, shall consider the application, and the following provisions shall have effect &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the court may, as it thinks fit, refuse the application or make an order varying the agreement in such manner as it thinks proper;</P>

    <P>This is a section which I devised following certain discussions with trade unions.  There are trade unions that cater for a diversity of classes of employees in various parts of the country where standard conditions are not necessarily enforceable.  It was considered desirable, in the case of either sections of workers in a particular area, or individual workers perhaps in another area, that a provision should exist for the amendment of a registered agreement if a case for its amendment could be made.  The proposal here is that an application can be made to the court for an alteration of the agreement in respect of some sub-classes or an individual covered by the agreement.

      <P>There are actually three amendments concerned with this point.  While it may appear that the Minister's amendment is a drafting amendment, the way the section reads at the moment is that the registration can be cancelled only on the application of all the parties &mdash; of both sides bound by the agreement. The Minister's amendment improves the section but in amendment No. 58 there is a further improvement which might be considered in relation to amendment No. 57.  That is, that on the application of either all the parties representing the trade union of employers or all the parties representing the trade unions of workers, the agreement may be cancelled.  In other words, the Minister's amendment provides that there must be agreement between all the parties on both sides to the cancellation of the agreement whereas amendment No. 58 contains a provision whereby the court can consider an application for cancellation where there is agreement between all the parties on one side.</P>

      <P>In regard to amendments 59 and 60 I am inclined to think that Deputy Dockrell's amendment is better than my own.  The point that was put to me is that there are agreements of so complicated a nature made by unions with employers that they just continue indefinitely and that circumstances might arise in which the union would prefer not to have the <Col N="990" /> obligation of negotiating a new agreement because of the complicated issues it might involve.  There might, in fact, be general agreement between the unions and employers not to negotiate a new agreement.  I was proposing then that when the agreement ceased to be registered with the lapse of time, it could be renewed and would be renewed automatically if both parties applied.  Deputy Dockrell's suggestion is that the court can continue the registration subject to three months' notice of cancellation by either party.  I think that is a better device.  If that is agreed, I shall withdraw my amendment, and if Deputy Dockrell will withdraw his I shall have that prepared officially by the Parliamentary draftsman for the Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting change.  The Federated Union of Builders, Contractors and Allied Employers of Ireland proposed to me an amendment for this section, which I have not drafted and on which I would like to get some views.  As the section stands, a complaint that an employer is not keeping an agreement must be made by a party to the agreement, by a trade union representing a workers' party to the agreement.  In the Federated Union's view, it is desirable in their trade to give the individual worker the right to make the complaint to the court that he is not being paid the prescribed <Col N="992" /> rates of wages or being given the prescribed conditions.  In many parts of the country, workers will not be organised or organised effectively by trade unions and some of them may not be capable of putting forward a registered agreement, unless they get the benefit as individuals of the right to come to the court.  I think there is something in that point of view and I would be inclined to move an amendment to that effect, unless there were objection to it.  Quite clearly, the approach to the court can only be through a trade union.  It would tend to strengthen the union's organisation, which may be a good thing, but it also may result in workers isolated, not getting the benefit of registered agreements and by not doing so create a situation detrimental to the preservation of the agreement and the interests of the workers concerned.  There are two points of view concerned, but I think the wider point of view, of the workers getting the benefit of the agreement, would make it desirable to give the individual worker the right of access to the court on a complaint on this one point, namely, that he is not getting the benefit of the registered agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On sub-section (3), I want to put forward the two points of view.  There are arguments in favour of not having a high penalty as it might frighten people off registering agreements.  On the other hand, there are arguments in favour of having a high penalty as it might frighten people from breaking agreements. I think the bounds of consideration are in favour of high penalties. I am prepared to provide for a reduction there but I would be rather apprehensive about reducing the penalties so far that the employer might find it cheaper to pay the penalty than <Col N="995" /> pay a proper wage.  One must have the same penalty apply in both cases and on the whole I think it wiser to provide for a reduction and I am prepared to provide an amendment for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 71 not moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the proposed amendment suggested by the Minister the whole set-up of the section seems to make the individual worker a very infinitesimal complainant having regard to the machinery that confronts him.  Quite clearly it pre-supposes that breaches of the agreement should be dealt with by means of complaints from very well organised bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have great strength and great resources.  For instance, an employer who breaks the agreement will be met by a well-organised trade union with resources and finances to make a complaint to the court and will provide evidence to show that his complaint is justified and can get whatever satisfaction is provided for by Section 30.  Similarly, if an employer can show that a trade union has broken an agreement, he has his resources or the resources of his organisation and can go before the court and utilise those resources to demonstrate the truth of what he asserts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking of this small man of no money, no power, no wealth and no resources and very little wages who has been working down in some rural area and who has not been paid the proper rate of wages.  He has no union behind him, he has very little education and probably is not equipped in scholastics to such an extent that he can express himself very adequately to the type of complaint from which he is really suffering.  It is suggested that that man should make a complaint to the court.  So he can, but bear in mind what the machinery of the court is. <Col N="996" /> The court shall consider the complaint and after such consideration, if it is satisfied that it is well founded, the court will do certain things.  How will that affect this small man?  He may be away in a rural area and you will have to bring him up to town to make a complaint.  It has to be in writing and presumably he is to be cross-examined on the complaint and is held in town while the complaint is being examined.  He is finding it hard enough to live on the small wage he is getting, without bringing him up to town where he probably never has been before and the mere mention of his coming up would probably be sufficient to keep him away.  If you get him into town, he arrives there with some doubt as to what he is going to get in the way of expenses and with a pretty fair knowledge that when he goes back he is going to lose his job.</P>
    <P>It is in circumstances like that you bring this small man before the courts and say: &ldquo;Well now, what exactly happened to you and what is your real complaint?&rdquo;  I am afraid the struggle is too unequal for this small man.  If the man is to make his complaint at all, I would prefer that he would make it to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It could arrange to obtain a statement from him through the manager of the local labour exchange.  The facts would then be transmitted to the court which would thereupon make an investigation.  In that way, the position could be sifted by, perhaps, a conciliation officer.  He could ascertain what was in the complaint, and if it was found that there was something in it then the machinery under the Bill would operate.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that you are going to get very few complaints if you have to rely on the small man employed by, say, a building contractor.  I agree with the point of view that some machinery should be provided to deal with the case of a contractor who might, under the threat of dismissal, compel his workers not to disclose the conditions under which they are working.  In that way, that contractor might be able to get behind a registered agreement.  In the early days of the Housing Act of <Col N="997" /> 1932 I came across cases of that kind in my own constituency where employers insisted that workers should not disclose to anybody the wages they were being paid because there was a fair wages clause in the 1932 Housing Act.  The contractors, in fear of being caught and of being deprived of the subsidy, went almost to the extent of administering a secret oath to their employees that they were not to disclose the wages they were receiving.  It was found pretty difficult to penetrate some of that secrecy in regard to low wages.  I appreciate the point of view that the Minister is endeavouring to achieve, but I am afraid the machinery suggested will not work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have proceeded in that way and made the registration of agreement effective by bringing into operation enforcement through the Department of Industry and Commerce, but we decided against that.  The Department would enforce wages fixed by joint labour committees, but I think that a registered agreement should be enforceable by the parties to the agreement through the machinery of this court.  I think it is wiser to keep it that way.  If you once go to the point of bringing in officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to the carrying out of registered agreements, I do not think that we could stop intervention at the particular point the Deputy has in mind.  We might have to inspect trade unions to see whether they were keeping their agreements.  Therefore, it seems to me that you must have official enforcement all the way or unofficial enforcement all the way.</P>

An order is made against him by the court, but rather than give effect to that order he closes down. We had a recent case where a particular firm which was a party to a national agreement withdrew from the national agreement and closed down rather than pay the rates agreed to.  It may be argued, of course, that you cannot compel an employer to carry on business if he does not want to, but there should be some means for dealing with an employer where the court is satisfied that he is merely acting in a spirit of obstinacy.</P>
      <P>In a case like that, the court should have power to apply something more than mere penalties to enforce the terms of an agreement.  Suppose an order is made against an employer, and that instead of obeying it he closes down business for six or 12 months. What happens at the end of the period if he reopens?  Is the order still effective, or can he get away from the effect of it?</P>

      <P>As I understand it, if an employer has failed to pay in the past the prescribed rates of wages and a complaint is made to the court, the court may direct the employer to repay any sums that may be due and to observe the agreement in the future <Col N="999" /> If the employer fails to do that, he can be made liable to a continuing penalty under Section 3 and, of course, that penalty mounts up the longer the period is during which he fails to pay.  Clearly, if he goes out of business he cannot be required to pay the employee while he is out of business, but he can be required to pay the amount due for the past services of the worker.  If he goes back into business, assuming that the registered agreement is in force, he will be bound to observe its terms.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 71a: &mdash;</P>
      <P>In lines 10 and 11 to delete the brackets and words &ldquo;(including proceedings in a court of law)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doubts were expressed on the Second Reading of the Bill concerning the capacity of a lay court or tribunal of <Col N="1000" /> this kind to interpret agreements. While the general trend of the discussion has shown that the House favours a court which will be in absolute control of its own affairs and that will be absolute master so far as agreements are concerned, I think Deputies will agree that, where the question at issue is one of interpretation, it is inadvisable that the court shall be the final body to deal with it.  I think that was clearly demonstrated to-night on amendment No. 43, and that the phrase in that amendment &ldquo;substantial agreement&rdquo; has, in its ordinary connotation, the same meaning for everyone. Most people understand what is meant by &ldquo;substantial agreement&rdquo;.  We examined a concrete case to-night in which, possibly, eight trade unions were concerned in a dispute.  Five of them were in favour of agreement.  The Minister suggested that, in that case, it might be said that there was not &ldquo;substantial agreement&rdquo;, although five constituted a majority of the unions concerned.  I do not think that he would get many supporters for that point of view.  Such a situation could arise.  In the ordinary way, the phrase &ldquo;substantial agreement&rdquo; can be easily understood but, if a court comes to interpret the phrase, it may present difficulty.  It is inadvisable that the section should be left as it is so far as proceedings in a court of law are concerned. It should be amended and any proceedings, other than proceedings with which the court itself would deal, should be left, in the event of an appeal, to the ordinary courts.  It is undesirable that, in the event of litigation of some kind reaching the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court should have to refer it back to this court under Section 31.  You would have a lay court interpreting the phraseology of an agreement which had been referred back to it by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the Deputy's reference to &ldquo;substantial agreement&rdquo; in connection with the registration of agreements.  That may be a problem for the labour court when deciding whether or not to accept an agreement for registration.  When an agreement has been registered, all <Col N="1001" /> questions concerning its interpretation and applicability to particular cases will be decided by the labour court. I think that there would be very substantial objections to the proposal contained in the amendment.  If there is a question to be settled whether a workman comes within a particular agreement, I think that a court of law is an unsuitable tribunal to decide it. It is hoped that this court will, in the course of time, become experienced in the interpretation of agreements and in deciding questions of their applicability, and should prove to be a more suitable tribunal for deciding questions of that kind than a court of law.  Apart from the suitability of a labour court to discharge this function, as contrasted with the ordinary courts, it is desirable that we should avoid the possibility of a labour court giving one interpretation of an agreement and a court of law deciding otherwise.  A worker might sue his employer for arrears of wages in an ordinary court. The question of the amount of wages due might involve the determination of an issue as to whether an agreement referred to him or not.  At the same time, the labour court might be giving a direction to the employer, in regard to the agreement, concerning a particular class of workers.  You might, possibly, have a situation in which the law court would decide differently from the labour court.  Whatever scheme we adopt, it is desirable we should avoid the risk of conflicting decisions of that kind.  It seems to me quite clear that the labour court is a more suitable tribunal to determine these questions than the ordinary court.  In coming to that view, I have in mind legal practice in other countries.  Under the Wages Council Act in Great Britain, which directs an employer to observe the conditions prescribed in any national or local agreement, no worker can sue his employer for failure to comply with the provisions of that Act until he has gone first to the national arbitration tribunal and secured a decision from that body that the agreement is applicable to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in other countries where labour courts are established, it has obviously been decided that the labour court, and the labour court alone, <Col N="1002" /> should have the right to decide whether a particular agreement applies to a particular worker or not.  That is why I ask the Deputy not to press his amendment.  There are serious objections to it.  These objections are based not merely on the suitability of a court of law to discharge these functions but also the desirability of avoiding a possible conflict between the labour court and the ordinary courts.</P>

      <P>A point I should like to make to the Minister in support of this amendment arises on the words of the section.  The Minister will, perhaps, tell me whether I am right in assuming that one of the objects of the draftsmanship of this Bill is to give this court exclusive jurisdiction in the matters with which it is concerned.</P>

      <P>If that is the case, I take it that no proceedings can arise under this Part of the Act &mdash; Part III &mdash; in a court of law &mdash; that, in fact, any proceedings that can legally arise can arise only in this court.  If that be so, the inclusion of the words which this amendment seeks to delete is meaningless.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not have understood the case I mentioned in relation to a workman sueing his employer for arrears of wages in an ordinary court.  One of the matters that might have to be decided would be &ldquo;How much wages are due to the worker?&rdquo;  That might involve a question as to whether a particular registered agreement applied to that worker or not.  If that issue should arise in an ordinary court, it would have to be referred to the labour court for a decision but the action for arrears of wages would be pursued in the ordinary court.</P>

      <P>I disagree.  The section states: &ldquo;Any question arising <Col N="1003" /> in any proceedings ... under this Part ... shall be referred to the court.&rdquo; This section applies to proceedings exclusively under this Part of the Act and no further.  That being so, taken in conjunction with the other provisions of the Bill &mdash; Section 16 particularly &mdash; there can be no proceedings in a court of law.  The inclusion of the words to which I have referred appear to be meaningless and redundant. To that extent, there is a case to be made for the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>This court will, probably, become conversant with the phraseology and terminology of members of trade unions and employers. As such a body is not now available, the courts have to deal with the interpretation of agreements and their applicability.  If there is not a complete stoppage of proceedings by an employer or an employee, as the case may be, it is undesirable that, in the event of proceedings being commenced, they should be referred back to the tribunal.
