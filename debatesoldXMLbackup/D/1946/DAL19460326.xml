      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, having regard to prevalent public opinion, that the rates charged by building societies on loans for house purchase are excessive, he will have a detailed Departmental examination made of the financial working of such societies, to ascertain if the margin between the interest paid on deposits and the interest charged on loans is exorbitant; and if, as a result of such examination, he is satisfied that the interest charged on loans is extortionate, he will consider what legislation may be usefully introduced to deal with the different aspects of the problem.</P>

      <P>I cannot, having regard to all the circumstances under which building societies operate, accept the view that the rates usually charged by them on loans for house purchase are excessive.  The law relating to the right of inspection in the case of building <Col N="416" /> societies is contained in Sections 4 and 5 of the Building Societies Act, 1894, and if the Deputy refers to these sections, he will see that I have no power of inspection except for failure to furnish proper returns and that the initiative as regards inquiries into the affairs of building societies rests with the members of the societies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department was informed in October, 1941, that it had been disclosed from inspection that bridges at Annaghvann, Traghta and Carrigluggaun had become unsafe and that it was necessary to restrict both the weight and speed of traffic passing over these bridges.  It was stated at the time that immediate reconstruction was not feasible owing to shortages of material. Since then some work has been done between Annaghvann and Traghta by way of the construction of a causeway which eliminates Annaghvann Bridge. It is understood that the completion of the causeway can be put in hands at an early date subject to financial arrangements affecting grants.  A proposal from Galway County Council in this matter is awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special technical difficulties arose in connection with the foundations and design of Carrigluggann Bridge and <Col N="418" /> considerable research work had to be carried out in regard to tidal and ground conditions.  It is understood that the investigations in this respect are now nearing completion.  The question of the financing of the work will receive consideration as soon as a proposal is received from the Galway County Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The last Road Fund payments to Dublin County Borough Council were made on the 15th January, 1943.  These payments amounted to £5,000, and represented balances of 1940-41 improvement grants.</P>
      <P>Sums aggregating £4,300, representing the balance of the 1939-40 improvement grant in respect of three improvement works are outstanding and will be paid when the final documents giving details of the completed works are furnished by the County Borough Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that at a recent meeting of the Pig Dealers' Association great concern was expressed at the reduction of the pig population of this country; whether, in view of this, he will take steps to see that the Pigs and Bacon Commission will expedite the distribution of sows to small farmers throughout the country, particularly in the pig-raising districts; if he is aware, in this connection, that the Pigs and Bacon Commission have notified producers that no further applications for sows will be received; and if he is prepared to state when further applications will be accepted by the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that from 1940 to 1944 there was a progressive decline in the number of pigs in this country.  Since the latter year there has been an increase in pig production and the indications are that the position in this respect will continue to improve.  The scheme initiated by the Pigs and Bacon Commission towards the end of 1944 for the improvement of the breed of pigs throughout the country by the distribution of a number of pure-bred sows has had to be suspended for the time being owing to difficulty in procuring animals of suitable type.  The scheme will be resumed as soon as improved supplies of pure-bred sows become available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the reasons for the continuation of the restriction on the payment of sterling for goods delivered from foreign countries to Eire; also, whether the present system results in delays and loss of goods urgently required by the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no restriction on the payment of sterling for goods supplied from Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Rhodesia, India, Ceylon, Egypt, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, Nigeria, Palestine and Iraq.  Payments in sterling <Col N="420" /> from here and from the countries mentioned to other countries have been controlled by the various Governments since September, 1939, owing to the abnormal conditions created by the war.  The restrictions are continued because normal conditions are not yet sufficiently restored to enable them to be removed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, no avoidable delay occurs, so far as my Department is concerned, and the delays inherent in any such system of control can be minimised if importers give timely notice and adequate information to my Department.  So far as I am aware, the control does not result in loss of goods which I am satisfied are urgently required by the community.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 26, Section 38, at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows inserted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) (a) Where, before the passing of this Act, a person was appointed to an office or employment, under a harbour authority, which became vacant or was created on or after the 1st day of January, 1946, and which would, if this Part had come into operation on the 1st day of January, 1946, have been an office or employment to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts, 1926 and 1940, would have applied, then, that person shall, immediately upon the passing of this Act, cease to hold the said office or employment.</P>
      <P>(b) Every question or dispute as to whether any particular office or employment is or is not an office or employment to which paragraph (a) of this sub-section relates shall be decided by the Minister after consultation with the Local Appointments Commissioners and such decision shall be final and conclusive.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain to the House the reason for this extraordinary amendment, which in fact is <i>ex post facto</i> legislation, a provision which has the effect of rendering unlawful an act which, according to law, was lawful before the 1st January, 1946.  The effect of paragraph (a) is that a person properly and lawfully appointed to an office after the 1st January, 1946, according to the law then existing, has his appointment now negatived.  It is rendered nugatory and it would seem as if the appointment which was then lawful, is now unlawful and the person is regarded as not having been appointed at all and ceases to hold the appointment.  I <Col N="425" /> would like to hear from the Minister the necessity for this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The Deputy will remember that this Bill received a Second Reading in the Dáil in December last and subsequently was circulated to harbour authorities for their observations on its provisions and for the purpose of eliciting from them any amendments which they wished to have considered by the Dáil.  Subsequent to the Second Reading of the Bill and its circulation to harbour authorities, some harbour boards proposed to take or did take steps to fill vacancies which arose in their service or which they anticipated would arise later in the year.</P>
      <P>It will be remembered that one of the provisions of the Bill is to apply the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts to the staff of harbour authorities, that is to say, to ensure that vacancies in those staffs will be filled by the Local Appointments Commissioners, except in circumstances where promotion is approved.  Having regard to the obvious intention of the legislation, which had already been approved in principle by the Dáil, I thought it was undesirable that harbour authorities should forestall the coming into operation of the provisions, by creating offices or by taking steps to fill offices which would become vacant later, where it was clearly the purpose of that action to prevent the operation of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts in relation to these vacancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two particular cases which came to my notice.  Subsequently, I learned of a third one.  The two cases which I had in mind, however, were Limerick and Cork.  In the case of Cork Harbour, it is anticipated that the position of harbour master and the position of deputy harbour master will become vacant next May; but the harbour board proposed to appoint now persons permanently to fill those vacancies when they did become vacant.  In the case of Limerick, it will be remembered that we had a provision in the Bill which postponed the appointment of harbour manager for Limerick until the present <Col N="426" /> secretary retired.  It was anticipated that the retirement of the secretary would not be long delayed after the passage of the Bill and, consequently, special provision was made in relation to that office.  However, the secretary of the Limerick Harbour Board retired while the Bill was under discussion and the harbour board met forthwith to appoint a successor.  In each case I think it was undesirable that the legislation should be forestalled.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to make temporary only any appointments made subsequent to the 1st January and to ensure that the filling of these vacancies will proceed under the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act when this Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister stated in the Seanad, when he was discussing the Limerick position, that, in the case of a promotion from among the existing pensionable officers of the harbour authority, subject to the requirements of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts, 1926 and 1940, a promotion could be made with the Minister's consent under Section 5.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a case. That is why this amendment is worded so as to apply this provision only to situations which became vacant or were created since 1st January.  In the case of the Dublin Harbour Board there was a vacancy which arose some time last year and steps to fill it were in progress on 1st January.  That will not be interfered with.  It is only where the vacancy arose since 1st January that the section will apply.</P>

      <P>That is so.  It will be open to the Limerick Harbour Board to seek the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the filling of the vacancy by promotion.  They can fill a vacancy by the promotion of a permanent and pensionable officer. The Minister would have to consider such an application on the facts, and I would not like at the present time to say anything which would appear to pre-judge the case.</P>

      <P>I promised Deputy Cosgrave to consider another amendment. There is a reference here to an Emergency Powers Order which is <Col N="438" /> being made part of this legislation. Deputy Cosgrave suggested that the Order should be printed <i>in extenso</i> in the Bill.  I thought there was something in that contention, and I had the matter examined.  The objection to doing so, apart from the length of the Order itself, is that it has no great importance, apart from the operations of the proposed board, and that it does not really affect the public interest. The main objection, however, of the Parliamentary draftsman arises out of the form of a Bill which he is preparing to provide for the continuance of various Emergency Powers Orders after the Emergency Powers Act lapses. He considers that it would be creating a very difficult situation for him if we were to establish the precedent now of reproducing these Orders in full in legislation.  He has pointed out that the Orders are, in fact, as freely available to the public as the Bill itself, and would, in fact, be available earlier for public distribution than the Bill itself in its final printed form.  He has urged, therefore, that the Bill should be allowed to remain as it is, and does not consider that any difficulty will be caused for those who will have to administer it.  He thought that the change suggested would create a rather embarrassing precedent in view of the amount of legislation of a similar kind which will be required during the course of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have really very little to say on the amendment.  What this sub-section proposes to do has already been the subject of a pretty long debate.  My objection to the sub-section is that it seems to confer very wide powers on the Minister, so wide that it is almost impossible to get an adjective to describe them.  I could have appreciated this if, in some way, the Parliamentary Secretary had been willing to approve of a previous amendment of mine, limiting his powers partially under sub-section (1). I would suggest, however, to the Parliamentary Secretary that sub-section (1) should be quite sufficient, but that the very wide provisions contained in sub-section (2) are very objectionable.  It seems to me to be very objectionable that the Minister, by Order, can direct a health authority to provide and maintain any institution which he orders them to provide and maintain, without any previous consultation or any references to the local authority concerned.  There is no hint in that sub-section to the effect that the Minister will contribute in any way to the cost of providing and maintaining such an institution.  I do not wish to use harsh terms with <Col N="440" /> regard to the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister; there has been a lot of talk about dictatorship, but I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us that in connection with this matter he is not intending to bring about dictatorship in regard to these local health authorities.</P>
      <P>I think it was suggested, in connection with an earlier amendment, that no local authority has ever refused to provide any institution which was considered necessary, and why the Parliamentary Secretary should now consider that he must have the means to force them to do so, I do not know. Of course, I can see the argument being put forward that the fact that a local authority never proved to be intractable in the past is no proof that it would not be intractable in the future, but I suggest, in that regard, that if in every Bill that comes before this House we should have to provide against that sort of thing, there will be more than one spot of trouble.  I think that this sub-section is bound to be objectionable, and we ought to hear some justification from the Parliamentary Secretary as to why such very wide powers should be given as are provided for in the sub-section.  Perhaps I am knocking my head against a brick wall, but it seems to me that no argument can be made for this sub-section at all.  For that reason, I do not think it is possible for me to say anything more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this sub-section, primarily because it interferes with the right which members of a local authority had of striking the rate, where they had complete control of financial matters.  Now, while this section, as it stands, does not directly interfere with the power of a local authority in that respect, I think that the section, and particularly sub-section (2), must be considered in connection with Section 27 of the Local Government Bill, which has already passed the Committee Stage.  Under Section 27 of that Bill, the Minister, if the Bill is enacted in its present form, will have power, where it appears to him that the rate is going to be insufficient, to hold a public inquiry and, after the holding of that public <Col N="441" /> inquiry, to strike a new rate, and, of course, he has also the other power, which he has already under the County Management Act, of abolishing the local authority.  Now, I think that if this is going to be Government policy for the future, we should be clearly told that it is so.</P>
      <P>If rates are going to rise as steeply as the recent rate in Dublin has risen, then it would appear that the Government thinks that central taxation will not be able to meet the burdens imposed on it and that some of these burdens will have to be met by the rates.  If that is to be Government policy for the future, there should be a statement to that effect.  As far as I can see, from reading this Public Health Bill and the Local Government Bill, it would appear that the Government proposes in future to supplement in certain respects the burden which would fall on the Central Fund for the maintenance of such institutions by unloading that burden, or a portion of it, on the rates, without giving the representatives of the ratepayers an opportunity of refusing these new imposts, if they considered it desirable to do so.  I think that that is absolutely undesirable, and that it is departing entirely from the last power which still remains in the hands of the local authorities: the control of their own financial matters.  I think that we should be very slow to give that power to the Minister, and certainly it should not be given in the form in which it is proposed to be given in this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, as far as the sub-section as it stands in the Bill is concerned, I can find myself very largely in support of it in principle because, if we are to have a national standard of public health in the country and make that standard applicable to all parts of the country, then it is essential that a certain minimum standard should be laid down in regard to these institutions, and a system of public health improvement laid down which will operate in all the different areas throughout the country.  Now, while the Parliamentary Secretary seems to be somewhat backward in giving instances of local authorities having refused to provide such institutions in the past, I can envisage such cases arising.  As a matter of fact, I have only to throw my mind back a few years, when there was a question of the provision of mental hospitals in certain areas, in order to realise the difference between certain local authorities and others.  From that point of view, I think that in principle there is a necessity to have some central pivot around which standards of health in this country, as a whole, will revolve and in connection with which certain guides for local authorities shall be provided in the different areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite conceivable that a situation might arise in a county or in a county borough where a majority of the local authorities might, for certain <Col N="443" /> reasons, set themselves against providing certain health institutions, and, even if these health institutions were provided, against the provision of certain standards in them.  I cannot see why the members of county council or of a county borough should be penalised for dealing with purely local circumstances in regard to what should be provided.  When discussing this matter recently, as far as I recollect the Parliamentary Secretary stated that he was prepared to introduce an amendment on the Report Stage to provide for the holding of an inquiry.  If we are going to have a health service it should not be related to the fact that there is a certain personnel in power, nor to the fact that there is dictatorship.  After all, there may be changes in the controlling powers so far as legislation is concerned in future years, but it is quite clear from what we see going on elsewhere that existing legislation cannot be changed very rapidly, but has to be utilised for a certain period.  Those concerned with legislation for health purposes should be concerned to try to get as good a basic principle as possible into the Bill, having regard to all the limitations and difficulties that have to be faced.  We should not try to hammer out on a health measure what should be our rights on a rates question.  We have other remedies at hand.  If it is correct that the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to make provision for the holding of an inquiry before there shall be any Order issued for the provision of an institution by a local authority, I would be prepared to let the section stand until Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a pity Deputy Sheldon should have reverted in his contribution to the debate to dictatorship. I thought we had gone away from that.  I had hoped that that particular approach would not be adopted so early in the week.  Deputy Sheldon approaches this amendment entirely from the point of view of what he calls the extraordinary powers given to the Minister over local authorities.  He described these powers as being so <Col N="444" /> wide that they actually baffled the imagination.  It is scarcely necessary to say that if the occasion does not arise for the operation of the powers, they will not be operated.  Speaker after speaker stated here last week, as did some speakers to-day, that they do not recollect an occasion arising when a local authority had definitely refused to provide an institution that was necessary.  Deputy Larkin has some doubts on that.  The fact of the matter is that, while it may not be necessary to issue an Order directing a local authority to provide a certain institution, there very often have been prolonged negotiations before local authorities could be induced to provide institutions that are, in fact, deemed to be essential.  On the point of the exceptional powers being taken under the section, I cannot understand the attitude of the House on that. Time after time this House has given corresponding powers to the Minister in relation to local authorities' institutions. When the matter was under discussion last week I drew attention to the powers given under Section 31 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939. Deputy Sheldon may not have been here then.  I was under the impression that he was, but I must have been wrong.  Section 31 (1) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every public assistance authority shall provide and maintain within their district such and so many (if any) homes, hospitals and other institutions (in this Act referred to as district institutions) and at such places as the Minister shall from time to time by Order direct and shall not provide nor (save as is otherwise provided by this section) maintain any other home, hospital, or other institution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave took a different angle, that certain changes about to take place in local government will alter the position.  I want to deal with the determination, apparent amongst certain Deputies, to keep harping on dictatorship and Fascist government. I read of that in certain papers that would not be friendly towards this Government.  That does not do any good, and I urge Deputies to get away from it.  Deputy Sheldon must recollect <Col N="445" /> the Mental Treatment Act.  It is a recent Act.  Section 20 (2) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister is of opinion that a mental hospital authority have failed in any respect to perform their duties under sub-section (1) of this section, he may by Order require them to remedy their failure within the time and in the manner (if any) specified in the Order, and it shall be the duty of the authority to comply with the Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 22 (1) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A mental hospital authority may, and shall, if so directed by the Minister, provide and maintain a mental hospital auxiliary to their district mental hospital for the reception of patients....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An auxiliary mental hospital shall be either a separate hospital or, if the Minister so directs, a part of the relevant district mental hospital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 23 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by Order require a mental hospital authority to provide within a specified time specified accommodation for temporary and voluntary patients and it shall be the duty of the authority to comply with the Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lest we should have missed anything in passing over various sections, giving the Minister power of direction, we come to Section 26, which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition to the institutions and accommodation specifically mentioned in this Part of this Act, a mental hospital authority shall provide and maintain such other institutions and accommodation in connection with the discharge of their functions under this Act as the Minister from time to time directs and shall provide such institutions and accommodation at the places specified by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to know what we have done to justify all the talk about dictatorship since 1945.  Even more recently than that, coming to the provisions of public health institutions, I might call the attention of the House <Col N="446" /> to the fact that public health institutions in the strictly legal sense are very limited in number.  In fact, this section that has given rise to all this discussion is comparatively limited in scope. Since passing the Mental Treatment Act we have passed the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act dealing with public health institutions, where the Minister was given absolute power to provide as many regional institutions as he thought fit, of whatever bed capacity he thought fit, with whatever equipment he thought fit, and there was not even restriction put upon him in the selection of a site.  He could go in on any property within the State and compulsorily acquire a site, and there was no redress.  There was no talk about dictatorship when that Bill was before the House and I do not think anybody will suggest that the powers that were vested in the Minister under that Act have been abused.  I do not think anybody will suggest that the powers that were vested in the Minister under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, have been abused. In fact, so far as the provision of public health institutions, which are in the main tuberculosis institutions, is concerned, the Minister has absolute power at the present time.  It expires at the end of the three year period, although Deputies on the opposite side of the House urged me, when the Bill was before the House, to take a longer period than three years, for fear we would not have acquired sufficient sites and provided sufficient institutions, compulsorily, within the period.  Bear in mind that under that Bill the local authorities were assuming an obligation, or an obligation was being imposed upon them, to bear such proportion of the cost of these institutions not exceeding one-third as the Minister might in his wisdom determine.</P>
    <P>As to the type of institution that will probably arise to be provided under this particular Bill, remembering that so far as regional sanatoria are concerned, they are being provided under a different Act, remembering again that so far as voluntary institutions are concerned, they are being provided under the Hospitals Acts; they are not being provided under this <Col N="447" /> Act, remembering that county hospitals, district hospitals, county homes, fever hospitals, public assistance dispensaries, are all provided under the Public Assistance Act, we are brought down then to the limited public health institutions that may come to be provided under this Bill.  They will be of two types.  The first type is sanatoria, if our three regional sanatoria prove to be insufficient to meet our needs.  When the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Bill was before the House many Deputies urged very strongly that the 2,100 beds that it is proposed to provide under that Bill will be entirely inadequate.  I was urged from the opposite side of the House to set out to provide 4,000 beds.  I said we will provide the 2,100 first and it may be necessary in future to provide further sanatorium accommodation&mdash;I hope it will not&mdash;in addition to the 2,100 beds that we are providing.  The other type of institution is the clinic or health centre.  Rightly or wrongly, we are making provision in this Bill for a mother and child service.  I believe, rightly or wrongly, that it is sound health policy to begin with the mother and child and I believe that, if we can build up a healthy child population, we are heading at any rate for a healthy adult population in the future.  Consequently, we have made provision in this Bill to deal with that situation and to launch that scheme on which we have had a share of discussion already. It will be necessary to make provision in clinics, dispensaries or health centres&mdash;call them what you will&mdash;for this mother and child service.  I think it will generally be conceded&mdash;it will be conceded by anybody who has a practical knowledge of the problem&mdash; that in the main our public assistance dispensaries are no credit to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That being conceded, unless we improve our public assistance dispensaries or, at least, that type of institution, our mother and child scheme will be a failure.  Consequently, what we aim at in this particular section is to provide in the main clinics or health centres at which, so long as <Col N="448" /> the medical assistance type of service continues in this country, medical assistance facilities will be provided in addition to the other public health facilities that we are aiming at. Already, in the City of Dublin, as I am sure Deputy Alderman Byrne is aware and as I presume Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Mulcahy are aware, preliminary steps have been taken to provide a number of clinics.  These are public health institutions but the intention is that when we provide these institutions, and when we provide a considerable number of them, we will accommodate in these institutions the poor who are at present being looked after in these public assistance dispensaries that, as I admit, notwithstanding the fact that we are here 14 years, are a positive disgrace to us.  I want to remedy that and if it costs money to remedy it I am prepared to spend money to remedy it.  Now call me a Fascist; call me a spendthrift; call me a man with wild-cat schemes, if you like. I do not mind.  I believe the policy is sound.  I believe these reforms are overdue.  The local authorities will have no great cause to complain because this type of institution will get priority and at least two-thirds of the cost of these institutions will be borne out of Hospitals Trust funds.  I submit to the House that if we had no Hospitals Trust fund to fall back on at all, these institutions would have to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that local authority institutions to the cost of some £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 have been provided within the past ten years and, of that total expenditure, over £3,000,000 came out of Hospitals Trust funds.  I do not know whether or not I can convince the House that I can be right in anything but I assure the House, at any rate, that I have not rushed into this thing in any way as an enthusiastic reformer at all.  I feel that these things ought to be done.  I feel they should have been done long ago.  If I can get the support from the public and from the various Parties in this House I believe that we will live to see them done.  There it is.  You can support me and you can help me with this Bill, if you feel so disposed.  If not, <Col N="449" /> we will fight on, but I will get the Bill anyhow.</P>

      <P>If this amendment served no purpose other than to extract from the Parliamentary Secretary the speech to which we have just listened, it has served a very useful purpose.  Perhaps, if the Parliamentary Secretary had been prepared from the beginning in connection with this measure to take the House into his confidence and let us know what he proposed to do, in the way in which he has just now, we might have had a different type of discussion.  The only bit of advice, if he does not consider it an impertinence, that I would offer to the Parliamentary Secretary at this stage is that if he would concern himself only with this Bill and the amendments and the merits or otherwise of the Bill and the amendments, and forget about Fascism and all the other things and cease to hurl defiance at us on this side, we might have a better discussion.  Whatever irrelevancies, as the Parliamentary Secretary considers them, there may have been, whatever accusations were hurled against him, I think he is not entirely blameless in the matter himself.  We have no desire in this debate to continue along the lines that, unfortunately, it has taken up to the present.  Personally, I welcome, and I think every member on this side of the House welcomes, the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that one of the first steps he proposes to take when this Bill becomes law is to deal with the present disgraceful dispensary system and the institutions under it.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I think, knows that so far as that is concerned no member of this House, and indeed I doubt if any member of a local authority, will be other than helpful to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary tried to use against us the fact that we have already given rather extraordinary powers under the Public Assistance Act, the Mental Hospitals Act and the Tuberculosis Act.  But there is a difference.  We were then giving the Minister power to deal with a specific thing that we knew something about and to which at least limits could be <Col N="450" /> fixed in one's mind.  So far as this Bill is concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary may know a lot more about it, and probably does, than we do.  So far as we are concerned, we have got very little information and we have to keep at the back of our minds that this Bill is only one of a series which is to come.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to draw from the fact that the House has given the powers which he cited here a conclusion different from the one which he is apparently drawing.  If anything, I think the Parliamentary Secretary has proved that this House is not in any way unreasonable in giving even great powers to the Minister to deal with public health matters.  But we cannot divorce this Bill from the Local Government Bill.  When the powers which the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned were given by this House, local authorities had certain powers which they will not have when the Local Government Bill becomes law. The Minister's position in relation to a local authority, so far as the refusal of that authority to carry out an Order or to vary an Order of the Minister is concerned, will be completely different.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that nobody can say that he has abused the powers that he has got under the Public Assistance Act, the Mental Hospitals Act, or the Tuberculosis Act.  I doubt whether he has got an opportunity yet of operating these Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any allegation that the Parliamentary Secretary has been in any way dilatory. But circumstances over which he has no control may not allow him to operate them to the extent which perhaps he would like to.  Coming back to the point that we have got no indication as to the institutions proposed, the Parliamentary Secretary points out that we have a number of existing institutions, as if that were giving us a line on the limit of the operations of sub-section (2).  May I draw Deputies' attention to sub-section (3) of the Bill:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" />&ldquo;A health authority shall, whenever the Minister by Order so directs&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) restore, enlarge or otherwise alter in accordance with the Order any institution maintained by them pursuant to this section,...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apart from the provision of new institutions, the interpretation of &ldquo;institution&rdquo; set out in an earlier section is so wide that it gives unlimited scope to the Department to impose on the local authorities, by Order, immense obligations.  The fact is that the Parliamentary Secretary has the advantage that they have actually been set down on paper and he can see the whole scheme contemplated by the Department, but we cannot.  We have got no indication as to the number, size, or variety of institutions which have to be erected and maintained.  We have still less indication as to the cost of them.</P>
    <P>I am not challenging the Parliamentary Secretary's sincerity when he says that two-thirds of the cost of erection of these institutions will be met out of the Hospitals Trust fund.  But, with the best will in the world, the Parliamentary Secretary cannot guarantee that. It is not set down in any law.  The present Government, or any Government that may succeed them, may have a completely different view as to how the money raised by the Hospitals Sweepstakes should be apportioned or disposed of.  Nobody can forecast; particularly having regard to the present state of the world, what the future of the sweepstakes will be, what amount of money may flow in from them.  That, I think, will depend to a considerable extent on the attitude of other countries in relation to similar sweepstakes run, say, by their own nationals.  A whole lot of things will enter into the matter.  So far as we are legislating at present, we have to keep before our minds that we are setting down here a legal obligation on local authorities the extent of which is not known to us.  So far as I can, I should like to disabuse the Parliamentary Secretary's mind of the idea that this amendment is moved merely for the purpose of making difficulties or <Col N="452" /> trouble or putting obstacles in his way. It is not.  It is moved because we believe that we should not give to any Minister in any Government the complete, absolute and unlimited powers that are sought in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation was very unsatisfactory to me.  Deputy Morrissey has pointed out that the Parliamentary Secretary's intentions have no authority in law whatever unless expressed in the wording of the Bill.  I am not suggesting that the intentions which the Parliamentary Secretary expressed are not genuine.  But the difficulty is that some succeeding Parliamentary Secretary may take an entirely different view of matters and all that he will be bound by is what is in the Act.  Oddly enough, one of Deputy Larkin's reasons for supporting the Parliamentary Secretary is that he envisaged a change of Government and that, however objectionable the powers might be under the present Government. under a possible other Government they might not be objectionable.  My objection is that, with or without a change of Government, it is what is in the Act that counts, not what is in the Parliamentary Secretary's mind when speaking in this House.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could find some way to make this more clear I would be satisfied.  On the other point which he quoted against me, that it was silly to talk about objecting to a dictatorial sub-section when in other legislation we had already given equally wide powers, I should have thought that was an argument in my favour and not in his favour, because the Parliamentary Secretary will remember that I was only saying it in a light way and not attempting to make any bitter suggestion.</P>

      <P>The quotation of half a dozen other instances by the Parliamentary Secretary does not prove anything. <Col N="453" /> Surely the Parliamentary Secretary does not suggest that, because this House has given very wide powers in other Acts, I must agree with every section and sub-section in this measure. However, that is only a debating point. What I am suggesting is that the Parliamentary Secretary's point was a debating point, too.  It was not material to the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with the explanation the Parliamentary Secretary has given.  It removes, to a considerable extent, my objection to the sub-section.  But the intentions of the Parliamentary Secretary are not in the Bill and, therefore, they are not binding.  That is the point of the whole argument.  I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary smiles at that.  But that has been upheld even in the House of Lords the judgments of which the Parliamentary Secretary's Minister is so fond of quoting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary sees that the objection I am making is a fair objection.  The local authority are, according to the section, to provide and maintain any institution which the Minister asks them to provide and maintain.  That is a very wide power and can be read in a very wide manner by any future Minister.  I am not making a personal attack on the Parliamentary Secretary or his intentions when I say that that provision is too wide.  I should object to it in any other measure as strongly as I object to it in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that he cannot understand the attitude of the House to this matter.  The attitude of the House is quite simple.  According to the programme envisaged by the Parliamentary Secretary, an expenditure of £24,000,000 on the public health side is to be entered upon and, on the public assistance side&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot distinguish between the institutions which are to be provided for under the public assistance code and those to be provided for under this measure.  This is a very general type of section.  If the Minister wants to insist on a local authority providing an institution, although it might be classified in his own mind as a public assistance institution, there is nothing to prevent his doing so under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong in that.  There is no authority in this Bill to provide institutions under the public assistance code.  The Bill refers to public health institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that this provision is limited to sanitary and public health centres.  He felt that he was making a strong point when he referred to the sanatoria.  Those are institutions of a national character and the same responsibility is not being imposed on local authorities in connection with them.  What we want to secure is that the rights of the local authority in these matters will be protected.  It is a very wide power which enables the Minister to insist on the provision of any institution he thinks necessary whether the local authority agrees with him or not or whether they think that his proposal is too extravagant or not. If we believe in going to the trouble of electing a local authority and charging them with certain responsibility so far as local administration is concerned, they should have some say in this matter.  The people who elect that authority are the people who elect the Minister and members of this House.  If they are good enough to elect the central authority, they should be capable of electing a local authority sufficiently competent to deal with their affairs.  This section seems to suggest that the local authority are not competent to make a decision of this sort and that they must be directed by the Minister.  If they have another viewpoint, they cannot question the Minister's decision.  That is where we differ with the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am delighted with the programme about which the Parliamentary Secretary has given us some <Col N="455" /> information this evening.  I do not think that it will meet with any opposition from the people or from any Party.  But that is not the point at issue.  The Parliamentary Secretary could hardly give one example to the House of refusal of co-operation or of opposition by a local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the House be asked to subscribe to this form of objectionable legislation in those circumstances? The Parliamentary Secretary is sure of the co-operation of the local authorities.  The local authority would be more inclined to jib under a provision of this sort than they would if they had a voice in the matter.  They are being denied the right to express an opinion on the question as to whether a particular institution should be provided by them or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not jib at the sanatoria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but that is a different matter.  Those might be regarded as national institutions, provided by the Minister.  The same responsibility was not imposed upon the local authority as is being imposed in this case in relation to public health centres.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to secure the co-operation of the local authorities, he is going the wrong way about doing so. The Parliamentary Secretary compared this provision with provisions in the Public Assistance Act and other Acts. But we are withdrawing certain control over finance which the local authority has at present.  The whole position is being completely changed under the Local Government Bill, which has passed through Committee of this House.  Taking all that into account and the programme announced by the Parliamentary Secretary, this House would not be doing its duty if it did not strongly question the right of the Parliamentary Secretary to ask for this extraordinary power.  It is simply dictating to the local authorities the institutions they must provide, without giving them, in law, the right <Col N="456" /> to express an opinion.  Whether co-operation is forthcoming or not, the Parliamentary Secretary is asking power to dictate to the local authorities. There is no use in talking about democracy and democratic institutions if we try to fit that sort of provision into legislation supposed to be democratic. If the Minister wants co-operation, I believe that that co-operation will be fully forthcoming in respect of the programme he has announced but he will not get it by compulsory legislation of this sort. Any man would be opposed to such a provision as this if he were a member of a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was at pains to try to score a debating point, to my mind, at the expense of the Opposition.  In so far as we did give powers in the Public Assistance Act, the Mental Treatment Act and the Sanatoria Act to the Minister, we did so with our eyes open.  We had some indication, at least, from the Ministerial side of the House as to what we were doing and the implications of what we were doing, but in this particular measure we have no indication beyond the very vague one relating to one aspect of the measure, the nursing service, as to what the general measure is going to cost the country as a whole in central taxation and the local authorities through the local funds.  That was one reason why we were hypercritical in the early stages of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason that we had cause to approach this measure on the lines that we have approached it up till now is that there has been a considerable change in the basis of local government law.  When we gave these powers to the Minister under the pre vious Acts which I have named, we had no such provision as is now contained in Section 54 of the Local Government Bill at present going through the House.  In Section 54 of the Local Government Bill you have a provision which constitutes, as an additional ground for removing a local authority apart from the grounds already provided in Section 44 of the Local Government Act, 1941, the refusal of any local authority to comply with any <Col N="457" /> Statutory Order, Rule or enactment.</P>
    <P>It is in that atmosphere of abolition&mdash; the threat that if a local authority does not carry out a particular duty imposed upon it by the Minister then it will have to face abolition&mdash;that you have this measure debated before the House.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out to the Minister for Local Government before, I think Section 44 of the Local Government Act of 1941 was sufficiently wide to enable the Minister to get at any local authority and abolish it, but under the Local Government Bill now before the House an additional ground for abolition is created.  I am linking that up with this measure because the Minister may, by Order, order a local authority to erect a particular institution, if the local authority, exercising their better judgements, refuse to comply with that Order, then they have thereby supplied the Minister with additional grounds for their own abolition.  That is the whole atmosphere behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition, you have the provisions of Section 27 which have been mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave.  If the local authority in any particular year refuse to strike a rate to provide sufficient funds to carry out the various functions of the local authority in that particular year, the Minister may order a second rate to be struck. Here you have the only weapon which the local authority enjoyed up till now taken away from them ruthlessly-the power of the local authority over the purse.  The only real power which they had left to them under the Local Government Acts is &ldquo;swiped&rdquo; from them, and the authority is in the position that it may not discuss the Order; it may merely comply with the Minister's Order.  We get further than this in Section 13 under which the Minister need not consult the local authority.  He simply issues an Order without any consultation, without any local inquiry.  It is in these circumstances and in that peculiar atmosphere the Minister functions.  It is with that aspect of the matter that we are quarrelling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> Up to now the local authority had the power of the purse; now it has not the power of the purse.  That is why we have approached the discussion in the way we have.  Not only has the local authority not the power of the purse but if it refuses to carry out the Minister's orders, a ukase issues from the Custom House and the local authority disappears.  Surely there is ground for reasonable criticism having regard to that background.  If it has been necessary to stress the dictatorial aspect of these measures, it is because of the background which I have tried to paint.  That is the statutory background we have at the moment, the basis upon which the whole fabric of local government is erected.  If anyone by any stretch of imagination could call that local government, or local democracy, I fail to follow his reasoning. Deputy Sheldon was quite right when he said that the Ministerial intentions were no concern of ours any more than the state of the Minister's digestion or the condition of his liver is a concern of ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been terribly out of order for some time.  Whatever the present Ministerial intentions may be, once we write a particular provision into the statute we have no guarantee that a future Minister will carry out the assurances, the undertakings or the Ministerial intentions of to-day.  We are legislating perhaps for generations to come and we have no guarantee what particular twist or use may be made of these measures when they come to be administered by a future Minister.  We give the present Minister credit for the best intentions and I personally welcome the new approach to this debate of which the Parliamentary Secretary has given evidence to-day.  I think it will help considerably to shorten the debate and to shorten the time necessary for the passage of the measure through the House. I think it would help to clear the air a good deal on the amendments to come if we could have from the Parliamentary Secretary some clarification of what he said in respect of Deputy Bennett's amendment.  Deputy Larkin <Col N="459" /> adverted to it earlier and I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that he conceded the principle of a local inquiry in relation to Section 13. If I am wrong, I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary on that. I think it would help considerably if we had some idea of where we stand.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary in referring to the limitations in regard to institutions, weeded out certain institutions and said that they came under the Public Assistance Act and other Acts.

What the Parliamentary Secretary stated was in relation to general criticism, the accommodation and the equipment provided in these institutions and the desirability of replacing them, but the plan would be to develop public health clinics, and, so long as the public assistance medical code remains, to accommodate and provide for the public assistance people in the public health clinics.  How far existing public assistance dispensaries would be capable of reconstruction, so as to render them suitable as public health clinics, I am <Col N="460" /> not in a position to tell the House, but a survey is being made at present of the accommodation in our public assistance dispensaries to see to what extent it would be possible to remodel them, or to what extent it might be necessary to scrap them altogether and to build new clinics, but these, of course, are very small institutions.</P>

      <P>It does.  We have in fact provided some public health clinics already.  We are in the process of providing a number of public health clinics in Dublin City.  We intend to expand that.  We are making provision in these clinics for the public assistance dispensary as well as for the tuberculosis services and various other public health services-dental services, mother and child services, ophthalmic services and so on.  We are in fact trying to lift accommodation for health services out of the poor law system, so far as possible, and to make the necessary provision in the public health institutions rather than in the public assistance institutions, so far as the clinics are concerned.</P>

      <P>We are not dealing with services at present, but with the necessary institutional accommodation to provide these services.  The improvement of the services is a different matter altogether.  But, clearly, you cannot hold a clinic under proper conditions if you have not a waiting room, accommodation to examine your patient, a proper place for storing your medicines, proper sanitary accommodation and so on.  I think everybody agrees&mdash;I hope they do&mdash;that our public assistance dispensaries, in the main, are very primitive concerns.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate that point, but the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="461" /> keeps going back to the clinic as if it were the only thing.  If it is the only thing, why is there such a wide definition of &ldquo;institution&rdquo;?  It is defined as &ldquo;a hospital, sanatorium, maternity home, convalescent home, preventorium, clinic, health centre, first aid station, dispensary or any similar institution&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>For the reason that I have explained so clearly that I am at a loss to know why the Deputy cannot follow it.  Most of these institutions are associated with the problem of tuberculosis.  Practically everybody in the House told me when I talked about providing 2,100 beds in our regional sanatoria that that number would not meet the situation at all, that I would require 4,000, and some people went as high as 6,000 and 7,000.  I have only provision for 2,100 in the regional sanatoria.  It may be necessary in future to provide other institutions, public health institutions, but in this Bill most of the public health institutions that can be provided are public health institutions in relation to tuberculosis.  Remember that we are repealing the special legislation which gives us the statutory powers to deal with tuberculosis in the past.  As part of our codification and co-ordination of the law, we are repealing these Tuberculosis Acts altogether.</P>

      <P>It is quite reasonable that we should carry on our discussion here in the most harmonious way, but what is fundamentally required, if we are to carry on our discussions to useful purpose, is that the facts should be placed in front of us.  The fact in front of us now is that, whatever might have been said in respect of the Bills the Parliamentary Secretary quotes as having been passed with provisions which gave him power to direct local authorities to do certain things over a field somewhat analogous to this during the last few years, not a single Deputy knew until a week or two ago that the total of the sums involved for institutions under this measure was £34,000,000&mdash; £24,000,000 for public health institutions and £10,000,000 for public assistance <Col N="462" /> institutions.  When, either through omission or for some other reason, we reach unexpectedly a point like that, it is nearly time that some of us called a halt, if only for the purpose of discussion and particularly in the light of the tightening grip over the whole machinery of local government which the Government and its Party, through the Minister's office and through certain operations throughout the country of a political kind, are taking on local government as understood in the past.</P>
      <P>I am in present circumstances irrevocably opposed to the whole spirit of Section 13 and I think that with the prospect before local authorities, in view of the way in which rates have been piled on to them for the last ten or 14 years, the amount of money paid in rates having risen by 100 per cent. from £4,500,000 in 1932-1933 to the figure quoted in the White Paper presented with the Budget last year to £8,000,000, with that as the background before any of this money is spent, no matter what proportion of the burden is to be borne by the hospitals funds, it is nearly time for us to review what we are doing here, even if we do all start cooing together.  What we are doing is passing legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to delete that part of the section which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a health authority shall provide and maintain any institution which the Minister by Order directs them to provide and maintain.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That spells, with whatever has gone before it, £34,000,000 as the sum total and we have passed legislation which involves that sum, and involves that sum out of the ratepayers' pockets, assisted by whatever is in the hospitals fund, without knowing what we are doing.  When piling taxation on to the people, we never had any estimate of the amount, and even when dealing with the Bill on Second Reading, the Parliamentary Secretary did not give <Col N="463" /> us an estimate of the amount we were likely to pass on to the ratepayers' backs as a result of the Bill.  It was only by a certain amount of dragging on the Money Resolution that we got the veil lifted a little and got an estimate, which I think is about two-thirds or half of what the real expenditure might be if the scheme were got properly going.</P>
    <P>We have been talking here about the mother and the child and the necessity for seeing that they are properly looked after from a public health point of view.  Then we are piling this authority on the Minister and piling this burden on the local ratepayers, at the behest of a Department which is preventing local authorities from allowing the rural workers under them to get more than 40/- a week to keep the mother and the family in a decent state of life.  When that occurs, we must stop and ask ourselves what we are doing.</P>
    <P>We should be able to discuss these matters realistically, in a businesslike and satisfactory way, without any lack of harmony.  If we are going to soft soap our minds and our tongues here so that we cannot mention a single fact, then we will be continuing to go ahead raising the rates to double what they were a few years ago.  That will be done on people who, the Department of Local Government tells us, should not be allowed to pay more than 40/- a week to a man to raise his family in rural employment, that restriction being made, it is said, because of the general economic condition of the people.  I entirely support the amendment here.  The Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to warn the people a little bit, by allowing a public inquiry to be held.  I would ask him if he is prepared, in relation to amendment No. 50, to accept an amendment by which, if two-thirds of the representatives on a local body resist his direction to set up a particular institution, he would accept that verdict.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it falls to be decided before this section as a <Col N="464" /> whole comes up for consideration. Amendment No. 50 is an amendment to this section.  If the Parliamentary Secretary still insists on power to direct local authorities to set up certain institutions, I propose under amendment No. 50 to move that he will not have that power as against a two-thirds majority of a local body.  I suggest very definitely to the House that we must shoulder our responsibilities, in seeing that we keep our constructive proposals in relation to the taxable capacity of the people on the one hand; or, if we want to shut our eyes a little to that, we should know, when we are making constructive proposals, what the size of the tax burden on the people will be, even if we take it for granted that they are able to bear more than actually they may be able to bear.  We should stop the kind of practice we have been getting into, of passing legislation which would put a burden on the rates, without knowing ourselves what that burden is and without giving any serious warning to the people that we in this Parliament are putting that burden on them as ratepayers.  Before the ratepayers' portion of this £34,000,000 is going to fall on them, their rates have been increased by something like £14,000,000 during the past 14 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by the Parliamentary Secretary's argument to a certain extent, particularly in view of the fact that he is prepared to accept an amendment to hold a local inquiry.  I think that has a double advantage.  First of all, it gives the local representatives an opportunity of hearing the reasons which urge the Minister to direct a certain course of action.  Even more important than that, it gives the ratepayers concerned an opportunity of learning and weighing up for themselves the different aspects of the particular question involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many areas, while the dispensary doctor or the officials or certain persons connected with the dispensary may be fully aware of the lack of proper accommodation and proper facilities there, very often quite a number of the ratepayers themselves are not so aware.  A local inquiry <Col N="465" /> would have the advantage of making the matter known.  I do not want to anticipate a discussion on sub-section (3), but I would like if, before he ordered a local authority to enlarge or after in any way an institution under their control, the Minister would also hold a local inquiry, at any rate wherever the alteration was substantial.  As sub-section (3) stands, the Minister would have power to direct the local authority to extend or enlarge in any way an institution under their control and in that way an institution might be extended considerably, almost amounting to the establishment of a new institution.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could give the House an assurance that the purpose of this section is only to deal with clinics and the enlargement or substitution of better facilities instead of the existing dispensaries, I would consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <P>The House has devoted a considerable amount of time recently to the discussion of public inquiries and the publication of inspectors' reports and has within very recent times reached a decision, after prolonged discussion.  Consequently, I do not propose to engage in a detailed discussion now, going over the same ground.  I have already indicated to Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Sheldon that, in so far as the type of institution contemplated in sub-section (2) is concerned, I am prepared to provide a public inquiry before an Order directing a local authority to provide such institution is issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of the publication of the report of that inquiry is a different issue altogether.  I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by opening up all that question again.  It is a public inquiry; the evidence is taken in public and it is open to any interested party to be present at the inquiry and to hear the evidence.  If, as a result of the sworn inquiry, the Minister comes to a finding that is inconsistent with the evidence, or if, <Col N="467" /> perpetrate what would appear to be an injustice upon anybody, the usual democratic remedy is available to the people.  If he acts improperly he can be arraigned before the House and, ultimately, he and the Party who are responsible for having given him Ministerial powers will come before the most powerful tribunal of all, when they come before the people from time to time.  I think that is about the only remedy that can be provided under a democratic Government.</P>
    <P>The evidence that is actually taken at these sworn inquiries usually gets wide publicity in the local Press. Sometimes it gets substantial publicity in the daily Press.  The Minister, in the recent debate, dealt in great detail with the administrative difficulties that were anticipated and that would, in fact, be inevitable if what is called the report of the inquiry were to be published.  I take it that the Deputy has in mind the confidential report made to the Minister by the person holding the inquiry, though the amendment does not say so.  Am I right in so thinking?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>In sub-section (2), at the end of the sub-section to add the words &ldquo;provided that at a meeting of the health authority duly called to consider the matter, the proposal shall not be opposed by two-thirds or more than two-thirds of the members attending and voting&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this section the Minister is taking power to insist that on his Order the health authority shall provide and maintain any institution which he directs them to provide and maintain. It has been pointed out on quite a number of occasions, even since we entered on the Committee Stage, that the local authorities have been made practically non-existent in so far as their representative character is concerned. We must admit that these institutions are being provided for local people and the local people, on the very same franchise as they elect Deputies to Parliament, elect representatives to their local authorities to carry out local business.</P>
      <P>My amendment is simply intended to secure that where two-thirds of the local representatives are, following an inquiry and report, in conflict with the Minister's direction to them, their voice and their opinion will hold as against the Minister's and that they shall not in such circumstances be obliged to obey the Minister's Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the House not to accept this amendment, if the Deputy should think fit to press it.  The amendment would, if adopted, have the effect of imposing restrictions on the Minister in regard to the provision of public health institutions.  We have already devoted a good deal of this afternoon to a discussion on the type of institution involved, mainly, as I have said, the provision of facilities for the treatment of tuberculosis.  We are now asked to restrict the Minister in relation to that particular type of <Col N="469" /> as a result of an inquiry, he should institution, notwithstanding the fact that in so far as county hospitals, county homes, district hospitals, mental hospitals, fever hospitals and public assistance dispensaries are concerned, you have in all these categories of institutions no such restriction placed upon him.</P>
      <P>I do not know what confused state of administration Deputy Mulcahy is aiming at, but it seems to me that even if the principle were acceptable it would create a condition of confusion in local administration that would lead to nothing short of a bewildering state of affairs.  The local authority would be given these extraordinary powers of obstructing the Minister in his efforts to deal with tuberculosis and with the establishment and implementation of a scheme in relation to the mother and child service, while he would have unlimited scope, without any statutory restriction whatever, in the provision of institutions under the other codes.  I think it ought to be clear to the House that such a proposal does not make sense.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Mulcahy put down this amendment at a time when he did not clearly understand the type of institution envisaged under this Bill. Anyhow, I do not think that any section of the House could reasonably afford support to Deputy Mulcahy in the proposal he has submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Our intention in this amendment is to call a halt to the policy of eliminating the power of the local authority.  The local authority ought to have some control over its own affairs, and some voice in providing a public institution, and the finances to support it.  The Parliamentary Secretary's argument is that a local authority ought not to have the power to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Minister for Local Government; that if he says it must provide an institution, it must do so.  In order to eliminate any unreasonable element that might be there, the amendment proposes that, unless two-thirds of the members present and voting of the local authority are opposed to the Minister's Order, the Order shall hold.  If there is a considerable <Col N="470" /> volume of opinion in the local authority opposed to the Minister's Order, some respect ought to be shown by the Minister to that opinion: that is, if we have any respect at all for a local authority, and for the power and authority which it exercises.  A local authority should be vested with some power.  Are we going to completely strip the power which is properly vested in the people from them?  The aim running through this Bill, and other recent legislation, is to destroy even the small amount of power that remains with local authorities.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to meet the Minister's wishes to a very great extent.  Unless there is a very considerable volume of opinion in the local authority opposed to the Minister's Order it cannot be negatived. I think the Parliamentary Secretary is unreasonable in regard to this amendment.  If we are to continue to legislate according to the policy outlined in this measure, what we ought to do is to remove local authorities altogether and not be preserving them as a sham and an ornament with no power, control or authority over their own affairs.  If the Minister's policy is to be continued, you will not get men with any backbone in them to serve on a local authority.  The amendment is not unreasonable and the Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider it.</P>

      <P>In the Bill the word &ldquo;institution&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;a hospital, sanatorium, maternity home, convalescent home, preventorium, clinic, health centre, first-aid station, dispensary or any similar institution&rdquo;. The Minister is taking power to order a local authority to provide any one of these institutions.  In view of the present heavy burden of taxation on local authorities, and of the increasing grip of the Department of Local Government on them, I have put down this amendment as a real test of what our approach to local government is going to be in the future.  Are the local authorities going to be completely wiped out?  Deputies should remember that members of local authorities who are elected on the same franchise as the members of this House are elected, <Col N="471" /> are elected for the purpose of looking after public assistance, public health, roads and other matters limited enough in their scope, but of importance to the people of a locality and to them alone, practically.  Are they going to be completely ignored, even on a formal occasion, when they are called together to consider a matter that has been the subject of a public inquiry?  A Ministerial Order is issued and they are summoned specially to discuss it.  If two-thirds of the members of the local body, having fully considered their responsibilities as well as local conditions-all these matters having been fully exposed at the local inquiry-decide that they are against the Minister's proposals, either to take up an institution or to burden the people with the cost of it, are they going to be completely ignored?  I submit that we have now reached the point when we must regard this as a definite test as to whether local government is going to continue or not.  It is because of the importance of having that matter tested out that I am proposing the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. The power that is being taken in this section is to dragoon a local authority, and to deny the members of it the right to express their views on matters <Col N="472" /> concerning local affairs.  The Minister is taking power to dictate what class of institution the local authority must provide.  As has already been pointed out, the members of a local authority are elected on the same franchise as the Parliamentary Secretary and the members of this House are elected to sit here.  I think that the House ought to have sufficient confidence in a local authority to direct its own affairs and to come to a decision on whether it requires a particular institution or not. We agree that it is the duty of the Minister to say that certain institutions are necessary for the maintenance of a proper standard of public health but what we are seeking in this amendment is to preserve to the local authority the right to say, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, to the Minister's Order.  The House ought to have sufficient confidence in the capacity of the local authority to make a decision on such a matter-that is if we believe in democracy at all.  Even supposing the Minister was right and the local authority wrong, in such a case an opportunity would soon be afforded of appealing to the highest tribunal of all, namely, to the people, as the Parliamentary Secretary has reminded us. If a local authority acts in the wrong then, when the elections come round, the people will have the opportunity of pushing out the old council and putting in a new group of men.  What we are anxious about is to preserve the little remnant of power that remains with the local authorities at the present time.  We do not want to vest complete and absolute power in the Minister.  I think the amendment is going a long way to help the Parliamentary Secretary out of his difficulty.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 51:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), at the end of the sub-section to add the words &ldquo;provided that such institution is established within the area of jurisdiction of the authority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see, in connection with this amendment, that in seeking to avoid one difficulty, we might go too far and get into another difficulty, since if the amendment, as worded here; were accepted, it might rule out the possibility of a hospital committee being run by two local authorities.  However, leaving that aside&mdash;and I think it should be possible to improve the wording of the amendment so as to get over that difficulty&mdash;I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that in the section, wide as it is in this respect, there is nothing to show where these institutions will be set up.  In view of the explanation of the Parliamentary Secretary, I quite understand now the type of institution that is to be set up, and, possibly, this may not be necessary, but I still suggest that there might be a necessity for it.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that it would be a peculiar position to have, say, Donegal County Council called upon to set up an institution outside their jurisdiction.  There is nothing in the section to prevent that. When quoting the Act of 1925 last week it struck me that Section 13 in this Bill was rather comparable with the position in that Act, but that the words &ldquo;in their district&rdquo; were contained in the former Act.  This section goes much further than what was in the 1925 Act.  I am not satisfied with the wording of this, because it would rule out an institution to be run by two local authorities.  Obviously, such an institution would not be within the area of both.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary accept the <Col N="475" /> principle that an institution would not be ordered to be built except it was inside some area of which the local authorities would approve?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering if the Deputy would accept this, that the Minister would be unlikely to act in an unreasonable way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be a sounder view than the one put up by the Deputy.  There is really nothing to be alarmed about in the provision as it stands, but if the Deputy's amendment were accepted a difficulty might be encountered by a local authority, inasmuch as a suitable site might not be available in the area within the jurisdiction of the local authority.  For example, with such a special provision in the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act, if we had to direct the local authority in Dublin to provide sanatoria, we would have to go outside the city area.  It is inconceivable that such a position would arise in rural areas.  I think the Deputy should be satisfied that the Minister will not ask them to go to Monaghan to provide a clinic say for Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this particular sub-section.  The only limitation put upon the Minister is in the definition section which relates entirely to a health institution.  Under sub-section (2) the Minister is given power to order a health authority to provide any institution and to maintain any institution.  Sub-section (3) goes further I suggest that it would be reasonable to except that a health authority would act reasonably, seeing that it is accepted that the Minister will act in <Col N="476" /> that way.  There is an obligation that the health authority will also act in that way.  The Minister having got power to provide an institution, wants further power whenever he so directs to &ldquo;restore, enlarge or otherwise alter in accordance with the Order any institution maintained by them&rdquo;.  That relates to institutions maintained by them according to previous directions. That is wide enough to cover any institution, but I do not suppose that is meant.  The detailed instructions refer not merely to such institutions, but to &ldquo;provide in accordance with the Order new, improved or additional drainage, ventilation, water supply, lighting, heating, or any other service for any institution so maintained...&rdquo; Apparently, these people are supposed not to have any intelligence, any expert advice, or any responsibility of their own.  Lastly, they are also to &ldquo;provide and maintain in any institution so maintained all such fixtures, fittings, furniture, surgical and medical appliances and other conveniences as may be directed by the Order&rdquo;.  I suggest that it is time to consider whether we deem all health authorities to be unreasonable, or otherwise give them the same sort of leniency that the Minister considers he should be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume I must go over the whole ground that we debated already.  I made the case as fully as it was possible to make it, and we had decided the principle, as far as the provision of institutions was concerned. In the course of the discussion if we want to know more, either about the renovation or alteration of institutions, it is scarcely necessary to go over the ground again.  Corresponding powers are contained in the Public Assistance Act and even in greater detail in the Mental Treatment Act. We need not go over that again.  We had it several times to-day already.  We have had it all out several times to-day already.  It is regrettable, but I suppose it is inevitable, that we cannot all be here at the same time but it does make it difficult for me if I am expected to go over the same ground and put the same arguments before the House again.  The principle has been very fully debated and, if it has to be <Col N="477" /> decided, then it will not have been decided without full discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but in the event of a health authority not having the intelligence or the will to do it, it is for the exceptional case that such powers as these are necessary.  In the ordinary course of events it will not be necessary to exercise this power at all but it has been in the corresponding code, the public assistance code and, should it be necessary to exercise such power in exceptional circumstances, clearly the power cannot be exercised if the Minister has not the power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a completely new line.  I think it is not in accordance with the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary now seems to indicate that these powers will only come into operation when the local authority refuses to carry out what is considered necessary by the Department. I understood that this was to operate absolutely and completely from the Department, that the local authorities were not to have or to be given or to be left with any initiative at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This is not by way of interruption; it is only to keep the Deputy right.  We are dealing now with Section 13.  The proposal is to delete sub-section (3).  Sub-section (1) sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A health authority may, with the consent of the Minister and in accordance with the directions (if any) given by him from time to time, provide and maintain any institution which they consider necessary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then we proceed to say:&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is only in the event of a health authority failing to carry out the necessary restoration or structural alterations.  ventilation, drainage, etc. In the ordinary course of administration these things occur quite regularly. I am sure the Deputy knows that.  In regard to technical matters such as this, drainage, renovation, restoration, and so on, inspectors are sent down from the Department to consult with <Col N="479" /> the local officials and the local authorities and it sometimes happens that there is difference of opinion as to what particular type of reconstruction, what particular type of equipment or what mechanical fixtures, etc., ought to be provided.  It is conceivable that the health authority may refuse to carry out the work in the manner that appears to the Minister, acting on the advice of his technical advisers, to be the proper manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is accepted or commonly understood that the Custom House issues orders to medical officers of health that they are to inject in respect of certain diseases with certain injections.  Many medical officers do not consider that these injections are good: some in fact consider they are bad for the human system, but the central authority insists on that being done.  Is this then a new provision along the same lines? Take for instance the third paragraph &mdash;(c)&mdash;of this section.  Unless the Minister contemplates himself as dealing in the main with a set of completely unreasonable people, why does he require paragraph (c)? There is power to order a health authority to provide an institution.  There is authority to order the health authority to maintain that institution and that order will be given accompanied by certain directions. Except the contemplated event of a health authority being entirely unreasonable, what is the necessity, what reason or substance could be given, for requiring this power for the Minister that he shall direct them as to the fixtures, fittings, furniture, surgical and medical appliances that they are to keep?  If a health authority is asked to keep an institution, if two-thirds of the funds are provided centrally, they can be relied upon to see that the place is properly equipped. Does the wording contained in sub-section (c) mean anything more than that? Is there such room for divergence as between the health authority and the Custom House as to what is suitable provision in the way of medical and surgical appliances? Is there such wide divergence of opinion likely as between the Minister and a health authority with its own medical officers around?  Unless in the event of considering the Minister always reasonable <Col N="481" /> and the health authority always unreasonable, why should we accept that as a likelihood?</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 56, when I moved amendment No. 44, the Parliamentary Secretary cut me short by saying that he accepted the principle regarding the holding of a local inquiry before an Order would be made.  I understood that that undertaking to hold a local inquiry would apply to the restoration or enlargement of an institution as well as to the provision of an institution. Therefore, I did not argue that question.  The reason I put in paragraph (b) was that, having admitted that a local inquiry was necessary before making an Order for the provision of a new institution, it would be illogical to have paragraph (a) in sub-section (3) because the Parliamentary Secretary, if he so willed, could get over the matter by ordering a local authority so to enlarge a small institution that it would, in fact, be a new institution.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give the same undertaking that he gave in relation to a completely new institution in respect of the other paragraph&mdash;paragraph (a).</P>

It includes a whole host of things-sanatoria, preventoria, clinics, health centres, dispensaries, etc.  The institution that will be restored, enlarged or otherwise altered under (a) of sub-section (3) will probably invariably be the smaller type of institution and the work to be carried out would not justify the holding of a public inquiry.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the work to be carried out would be of such a type that it will not entail a very big expenditure.  If it is going to be the small type of institution, there will be no difficulty because the local council will not refuse to carry out the Minister's orders under paragraph (a).  It will only be in the event of some Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I do not suggest that the present Parliamentary Secretary would act in that way&mdash;acting <Col N="486" /> in an extraordinary manner that the council would refuse to carry out work of this kind.  He might ask them to so alter or enlarge a building that it would practically mean building a new institution.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may have in mind only small alterations or enlargements, but the work may conceivably be a very large one.  For instance, the Minister might desire to have a hospital which might have only 20 beds at the moment so enlarged that it would have 60 or 80 beds.  In fact, it might be a more serious matter from the point of view of the local authorities than some of the Orders made under sub-section (2).</P>

      <P>I think in so much as the Minister accepted the principle of an inquiry in regard to the provision of a new institution, he should see if it is possible to apply the same principle to sub-section(3).  It is definitely conceivable in so far as the restoration, enlargement or alteration of an institution, or the provision of drainage, or possibly even ventilation or heating is concerned, that the all-in cost might be greater than that of the provision of a new institution.  As he has accepted the principle which, I think, is based on the size of the contemplated work in regard to the earlier sub-section, I think the principle should also apply in the case of sub-section (3) where it is not a question of the size or the amount of money to be spent. Certainly no one would argue that he should have an inquiry in regard to the provision of surgical appliances, or of fittings, or furniture, but where there is a question of fairly considerable expenditure I think the same principle should apply as in the earlier sub-section.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest another line of approach?  First of all <Col N="487" /> I cannot see the distinction that was made between sub-section (2) and certainly paragraph (a) of sub-section (3). Whatever is the institution referred to in sub-section (2), it is the same institution in principle that is referred to in sub-section (3) (a).  There is no distinction between a major work and a minor work.  Deputy Bennett made the point that the restoration of an institution may, in fact, be the same as providing and maintaining an institution and I do not see why any point could be made as to the definition.  The definition is the same for both.  The Parliamentary Secretary states that he will accept the idea of a local inquiry if the proposed expenditure on the work exceeds a certain amount. Why not put it this way?  Leave out the question of expenditure and, if the health authority objects, have a public inquiry in connection with (3) (a).  You are then putting the responsibility, so to speak, for calling the inquiry on the local authority.  They will not ask unless it is a matter of some substance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be allowed to argue it before asking the House to come to a decision.  It has been accepted, I understand, that there is to be a local inquiry held into the desirability of asking a health authority to provide and maintain an institution.  This is the following up of that&mdash;that if there is a local inquiry, then the country through both Houses of the Oireachtas shall get an opportunity of seeing what is the result of the inquiry in so far as the report of those who have held it is concerned. This was debated on very many occasions in connection with the Local Government Bill and I want to put the issue here now, apart from all the fuss that was engendered around that particular measure.  Here is the simple point.  It is a question of whether or not a local authority is to be directed to provide an institution and maintain it.  The Minister desires to have power to direct the local authority in that way and it is accepted that there shall be a local inquiry into that matter.  I suggest that the only value of a local inquiry is to enable a case to be made for and against the question whether the Minister <Col N="489" /> is right in these demands on the health authority or not.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the logical conclusion of that is that people should know not merely the result of it, in so far as it is a Ministerial decision, but should know the result in so far as how the witnesses have struck the person who held the inquiry, have appeared to him to be reasonable, have appeared to him to be telling the truth and have appeared to him to be putting up solid arguments, are concerned, and his view of those arguments.  This, in other words, asks that public opinion should have something on which to found itself, that, if there is to be a public opinion of a local type formed in connection with this question which the Minister desires to force upon a health authority, the public should know what is the strength of the arguments for the Minister's proposal and the strength of the arguments against it.</P>
      <P>That cannot be brought before people except those who may attend the inquiry, those who have reason to attend and are able to attend.  It cannot be known to any wider body than these, and I suggest that if the Government were at all alive, even to their own benefit, they would seek every opportunity of moulding public opinion.  They must realise by this time that nobody considers that public opinion is, in fact, moulded by the Minister's simply saying: &ldquo;I want such-and-such a thing done&rdquo;.  We are still living in an age in which the appeal is to reason, and the way in which reason operates is by people, when there is a matter in dispute, putting up the best arguments for, and other people putting up the best arguments against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are still living in a period in which this clash of mind upon mind is supposed to be the deciding factor. Only a person who is present at a local inquiry, who, in the phrase often used in court cases, in connection with the original trial, as opposed to the appeal which may be only on some subordinate matter, attends at the investigation, who sees the witnesses and who can make up his own mind from their demeanour as to how sincere they are in the arguments they are putting forward <Col N="490" /> to support their contentions, can come to an understanding as to whether or not they are putting up what they believe to be true, apart altogether from the force with which it is put up.  Only the person who sees the witnesses paraded in front of him can really give the best opinion.  I do not rule out the possibility of the Minister overriding the report put up to him by such a person, but I do think it would require a considerable argument to be put to the public for the overriding decision of the Minister in order to convince public opinion that what had not gained the assent of the local inquirer has nevertheless got the Minister's approval and has persuaded him to give the order.</P>
    <P>If that did happen, if you had a position in which the person holding the local inquiry, being swayed by the general atmosphere of the inquiry, by his view of the witnesses, by the force with which they presented their arguments and the credibility to be attached to their testimony, reported in one way, and if nevertheless the Minister decided to overrule him and to rule to the contrary, I think the Minister gets another opportunity of moulding public opinion his way by recognising that he has a strong case to meet and a difficult situation to meet, but it is not one he should attempt to get over simply by a decision.  It is one which he should attempt to get over by a decision and by argument, by some sort of reason why he does not accept the report of the person who held the inquiry.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the ground which has already been traversed, or to deal with the other matters about which there has been so much excitement. I think that public opinion is, in connection with these matters, being swayed to the view at the moment that Ministers are seeking to quash the reports of inspectors who hold inquiries.  The public view now is that they are acting contrary to the reports they get, and that they have no reason which they can promulgate to the public and stand on for overriding inspectors' reports.  That does not, of course, satisfy the public and certainly does <Col N="491" /> not help to form a sound public opinion on these matters.  What I ask here does not bind the Minister to accept such a report, but it will certainly put him in a difficult position, a position in which, if there is going to be a difficulty, he should face it and try to get over it, by an appeal to reason.  He should say: &ldquo;I have the report here.  There is the nature of it.  It comes from a person who saw the witnesses, but I do not agree with it, and for the following reasons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If he has not got a strong enough case which he can make in that public way, prefacing his remarks by an admission that the local inquiry so far as the inspector is concerned has gone against him, then he should not decide against the inspector.  If he has good reasons, he should be able to stand on them.  That is the way in which, as I understand it, public life is run in this country.  People take decisions which are open to question here in a variety of ways&mdash;by debate, by motion and by Parliamentary Question&mdash;and only when their reasons for their actions appeal to the public can public opinion find itself satisfied and comforted, and I suggest that the Minister should take this opportunity of trying to develop a public opinion instead of trying to override public opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is possible to get the Parliamentary Secretary to approach the principle of this amendment from the angle of different circumstances from those argued recently in this House, but I suggest that it is possible for us to expect that a responsible Minister would make the attempt, because we are dealing here with something fundamentally different from the circumstances surrounding the previous debate on this issue.  At that time, it was largely a question of administration which was involved, and the Parliamentary Secretary went to great lengths to explain the difficulties which he saw as possibly arising, if the reports of his officers were to be published. Here, as Deputy McGilligan says, we are dealing with an entirely different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> The main matter with which the Bill deals is health, and, in the course of the debate, two particular factors have been put to us in respect of which we are asked to support the Parliamentary Secretary in the attitude he is taking on the Bill.  One was the provision of new institutions and the other the enlarging, restoration or alteration of existing institutions.  The point I was personally concerned with was the possibility that, at a particular time and in a particular locality, there might be a local authority controlled by a majority with views which were anything but advanced on health matters. I was prepared to run the risk of giving certain overriding powers to the Minister in order to get over such a deadlock, because I am aware that such atmospheres have existed in local authorities and possibly will exist again.  I feel that when we are embarking on a national health plan, the benefit of that plan should be made available to all sections of the community, regardless of what may be the local political atmosphere in a county or a borough area at a particular time. That is why I think there is something in this amendment to be considered.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, we have a proposal for the erection of a new institution in a particular area and if there is opposition to it by a majority, a very strong majority, in a local authority and an inquiry is held by the Minister, is it not clear that if by that inquiry certain facts are elicited showing the absolute necessity of that new institution, or possibly the restoration or alteration of an existing institution, it is essential that the facts will not only be made available as evidence to the ratepayers and to the citizens generally in the locality, in order that there will be wide public support for any decision the Minister may make, but&mdash;and more important still&mdash;that the value of that evidence will be available?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has answered the previous criticism on this point by saying that the evidence is available in the newspapers.  I have read the evidence in newspapers not merely at local inquiries but in cases in which men were on trial for their lives, and as each day's report came out, I changed my mind as to the guilt or <Col N="493" /> innocence of the individual concerned. I was not present and did not get a full report of the evidence.  I was completely ignorant of the whole atmosphere of the court and of the appearance of the various witnesses in the witness box.  How much more so will be the case where we have merely the evidence in regard to the provision of an institution which, possibly, the newspapers may not consider to be a very important one, but which may be important where the welfare and health of the citizens are concerned? Yet we are depending on those newspapers to give us the evidence, to provide us with the opportunity to arouse public opinion against the Minister and in support of the local authority.  While there may be a case to be argued that the Minister is not free to publish the report of the inspector, surely if the value and the striking effect of the evidence is to mould public opinion, the observations of the trained and experienced professional man should be added to the bare evidence, in order to give full effect to what the inquiry purports to do, that is, to decide whether there should be such an institution or not.</P>
    <P>The only remaining point is whether the Minister may have to take a different view from that given in the report.  In such a case, I submit the Minister would be in a stronger position if, having made a decision, he is able to submit it to the ordinary scrutiny of public opinion, even though it may appear to be contrary to the report received from his own officer.  For instance, if an inspector reports in favour of the provision of an institution and the Minister rules against it, it should be quite easy to set out the reasons why the report was not adopted.  On the other hand, if the report is against the provision of an institution and the Minister is in favour of it, surely he has not merely the support of the evidence but the support of his whole national health policy behind him? My own feeling is that, nine times out of ten, such inquiries will be held where the local authority has refused to provide institutions or improve existing services. In general, it will be a case of the Minister giving effect to his <Col N="494" /> national health policy and trying to enlist public support for his decision.</P>
    <P>It may not be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to give an indication at the moment that he can weight what is being put to-night, but I suggest that, for the purpose of carrying out his progressive policy, the support and assent of the public are necessary.</P>

      <P>Quite possible, for the reason that there is nothing the Parliamentary Secretary can say that he has not said already to-day.  The principle involved in this amendment has already been dealt with.  Not only that, but a considerable amount of the time of the House has been occupied in the past few weeks in discussing the very same principle.  It has been argued from every possible angle and the House has taken decisions on it. I think no Deputy will expect me to keep repeating the case made on any particular principle raised in the course of the debate.  Everybody will not be in the House when the principle is raised on the first occasion&mdash; I have no complaint to make on that score&mdash;but any time a Deputy comes in he cannot expect the case to be made again.</P>

      <P>I am replying to Deputy Morrissey.  The House is well aware that I cannot accept this amendment. I do not want to create the impression that I feel pressed or bound in any way by discussions which have taken place in the House on the corresponding principle and the decisions that have been reached, but I believe very strongly that the principle embodied in this amendment is unsound. Deputies may disagree with me in that, but the fact of the matter is that, when the Minister decides to hold a sworn inquiry and sends down his officer to conduct it, the evidence is taken in public and it is open to anybody <Col N="495" /> interested in the subject matter of the inquiry to be present.  The evidence tendered is published in the local Press and a considerable amount of it is published in the daily Press. In fact, the evidence, which is the important thing, is available to anybody and everybody who is really interested in the matter at issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister is responsible to the House for the findings.  He may or may not get a report from the inspector, who is not under any obligation to furnish the Minister with a report. Generally speaking, the inspector has observations to make of one kind or another, but they are for the confidential guidance of the Minister and not for the public.  If the principle were to be accepted that the confidential views of the inspector would be made public, his functions as confidential adviser would be completely jeopardised.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made here &mdash;and I grant there is a certain amount in it&mdash;that it is of some importance, apart from the cold facts that may appear in a book of words which may constitute the verbatim report of the evidence, to have the opportunity of studying the witness in the box.  A good psychologist probably could give some useful advice as to the reliability of a particular witness.  I rather think, however, that if an inspector says in his report to the Minister: &ldquo;Such and such a witness&mdash;who is reputed to be a highly respectable man of the highest standards of honour&mdash;is, in my opinion, one of the crookedest men who ever took the Bible in his hand to swear the oath; he is utterly unreliable and I think he perjured himself several times; I would advise you not to pay very much attention to his evidence, in reaching your conclusions&rdquo;, that might be of use to the Minister.  The inspector clearly would not tender such confidential advice, however, if he were faced with the certainty that it would be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other more or less similar types of confidential advice that Ministers get from time to time from such officers, and if they were to be made public it would be better to <Col N="496" /> abandon sworn inquiries entirely.  The only result would be so to scare the officer, as to the possible repercussions when the public got to see what he privately reported to his Minister, that no officer would furnish the Minister with his real views.  I may be all wrong in that, but I believe it very sincerely.  I believe there is no better system than the one which obtains at present, where the evidence is available to anyone interested and where the Minister accepts responsibility, as he must before the House and before the country for the conclusions he reaches based on the evidence supplied to him.</P>

      <P>We have got away from the heated atmosphere of the other discussion, but we have got to a depth of futility that I never expected to hear in this House.  I had eight years' experience of getting reports, but I never got a report in my life of the nature about which the Parliamentary Secretary speaks.  I never once got such a report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not odd that in eight years I never saw a report in which an inspector said what the Parliamentary Secretary has attributed to one? I may put a mild word on it if I describe it as imagination running riot. It is actually a perversion of fact.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to be scared over the reaction upon the inspector&mdash;the inspector would refrain from making that sort of comment.  It would be a good idea if he did.  No inspector need go to that point.  In court, judges simply say that they do not believe a word that so-and-so has said.  In the main, the judges are content to say, summing up the evidence, that they thought the truth and sincerity lay on a particular side, or with a particular witness.  They express themselves as being impressed by one side or not impressed by the other.  There are ways and phrases that decent-minded people will avail <Col N="497" /> themselves of in order to get out a viewpoint before the person to whom they are reporting.</P>
      <P>I am definitely amused at the amazing change that has taken place in the Parliamentary Secretary.  He is quite convinced now that the cold evidence, the record of the evidence, is all that is required.  One of the first measures that a former Government brought into this House was a Courts of Justice Act in which they completely changed the system that used to operate with regard to the secondary courts in the country, the Circuit Courts.  When they came into office they founded a system under which a case was tried by a judge who saw the witnesses, and if it went to an appeal, you got the transcript of the notes. We had a committee of inquiry which investigated that, and if their report was not a unanimous report, it was very nearly so.  I am advised that it was a unanimous report.  That report set out that the presentation of the transcript of the notes, the cold letters of the script conveying the evidence, was not sufficient and suggested that there ought to be a retrial.  That report was presented by a group of mixed parties.  They completely reversed the old system of hearing appeals on notes on the basis that it is only the judge who sees the witnesses who can best appreciate their demeanour and make up his mind as to whether they are telling the truth, as to whether they are sincere and as to the force with which they give their evidence.  Seeing the witnesses, they can better appreciate the nature of their evidence.  That was the attitude of the committee that investigated the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary now falls back on the evidence, although his own Government, following a complete investigation by a mixed party group, decided to throw over the old system when it came to court work for the simple reason that they thought that unless the judge who tried the case finally saw the parties appearing before him, the case would not be sufficiently represented to him.  They abandoned the system of having a couple of judges reading through the transcript of the evidence and <Col N="498" /> endeavouring to find out whether they could agree with the trial judge who had the witnesses in court before him and who had an opportunity of appreciating their evidence.  The system of having a transcript of notes was regarded as unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I do not want any retrial in these cases.  These are not matters that call for a judicial inquiry, although it is something approaching that.  We have put this proposal forward in an unimpassioned way.  We rely on public opinion, which must be formed.  At the moment, so far from being formed, it is rather repelled by the Minister simply deciding to close down on the report of the person who holds the inquiry.  He does not say whether he agrees or disagrees with the inspector. He simply says: &ldquo;That is my view, I am simply saying this is my decision and I am not going to tell you what the person with the trained mind who went down and reported to me, after seeing all the witnesses and hearing all the facts, tells me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think that is bad.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should, in this very specialised problem, at least get back to some appreciation of the necessity of forming public opinion. Deputy Larkin makes the suggestion that, in the main, the Minister and his inspectors will be fighting against health authorities reluctant to advance along the lines of the development and care of public health and he will require all the assistance he can get from the local inquiry, the Minister deciding in line with whatever the inspector reported to him.  I suggest he ought.  If the Minister finds it necessary to disagree, he should endeavour to convince the public that he is operating in a reasonable way. He could say: &ldquo;I admit I got the report and I admit it is against the view I am going to take, but I make that decision for the following reasons.&rdquo;  The Ministerial attitude would stand much higher in the public view if he would face that situation and give his reasons for overriding the reasons of the inspector.  If we go on as before, the public will hold the view that the inquiry is a bit of a farce and that the Minister cannot publish the report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> As to any delicacy about the inspector writing about individuals, I do not expect an inspector will write that very often.  I never remember it in my experience.  A man might say: &ldquo;I consider the evidence produced on a particular point was unsatisfactory and I gave no credence to the witnesses who appeared in that behalf.&rdquo; People who go before an inquiry will have to be ready to expect that to be said about them if they behave in a way that warrants the comment being made.  The whole idea the Parliamentary Secretary has propounded here is not satisfactory.  I say he is not really able to face public opinion in this matter and does not want to try to form it.  I think it is bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the section.  It has a much more restricted application in this sense than it had in relation to the other Bill when we were discussing it. I want to put to the Parliamentary Secretary the point that has been put to him more than once by Deputy Larkin, namely, that if this code of public health is to be fully successful you must get behind it the confidence of the people and of the community generally.  Let us suppose that an institution is to be erected in a particular county, the cost of which may be £50, £100, £200 or £300,000, and that two-thirds of it is to be borne on <Col N="500" /> the Central Fund or out of the Hospitals Sweep Fund; the proportion of the cost falling on the local rate-payers for its erection, equipment and maintenance may amount to such a large sum that it will cause a good deal of public uneasiness locally, especially in these days when the rates are climbing so quickly and so steadily.</P>
      <P>I can conceive an inquiry being held under this section in a case of that sort where the evidence tendered, and tendered in good faith, may be against the proposition, although the proposal itself may be a perfectly sound one. The inspector in his report to the Minister would be able to show that, notwithstanding the evidence given at the inquiry, the institution was required, that the proposal put forward by the Department was a perfectly sound one, and that the Minister should go on with it, but that the rate-payers affected, judging the matter solely on the evidence which the Minister so much depends upon, could only come to the conclusion that the inspector, acting on the evidence, as they read it, had reported against the proposition, and that the Minister, in spite of the evidence and of the inspector's recommendation, insisted on going on with it.</P>
      <P>I take it that when an inquiry is held under this section it will be in a calm atmosphere, and that, in the main, the witnesses examined on such matters will be experts.  I imagine that the local authority will contest the matter only if they are satisfied that there is a need to have an inquiry, or if there is a doubt as to the necessity for the institution or whether the one proposed to be erected is suited for the district in question.  I do not think that I could add anything more to what has been so well and clearly said in support of the amendment by Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Larkin.  They made a very well-reasoned case for it, and I think that on the merits the Parliamentary Secretary will find it very hard to refute the arguments put forward in support of it. He can only attempt to make a case against it by talking of inquiries of the type that we spoke about on the Local Government Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 61:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 1, after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert the words:&mdash;&ldquo;after consultation with the health authority concerned and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the fullest possible discussion shall take place as between the Minister and the local authority whose institution is about to be discontinued. Very often, a local authority may have very sound reasons for retaining an existing institution &mdash;reasons which, perhaps, the Minister may not be prepared to accept.  It may be that on occasions the local authority may have a sentimental regard for such an existing institution or for the traditions behind a particular institution and, for that reason, may not see eye to eye with the Minister in a particular case.  For these reasons, I think that where it is proposed to discontinue a health institution there should be, from the start, the fullest, frankest and freest exchange of opinions as between the Minister's Department and the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not stress that it is the essence of local government that there should be such a frank exchange of opinions.  I need not stress the point <Col N="503" /> that it is essential to the preservation of local government democracy, if you like to call it such, that these consultations should take place, and it is with that object in view that I move this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest, Sir, that this amendment is not necessary? Section 14 (1) sets out that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Minister, after having caused a local inquiry to be held in relation to the desirability of so doing, may by Order direct a health authority to discontinue, as from a specified date, a health institution maintained by them or a separate department of such a health institution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the sub-section says: &ldquo;after having caused a local inquiry to be held.&rdquo;  Now, the amendment proposes that a statutory obligation should be placed upon the Minister to consult with the local authority before deciding to hold such a local inquiry.  Clearly the amendment implies that the Minister had no previous discussion with the local authorities. That has never happened under any Administration.  Local inquiries, such as are contemplated under this section, take place after a prolonged exchange of views with the local authorities, and if there was full agreement as between local authorities and the Minister a local inquiry would not be necessary at all.  I do not know exactly what the Deputy has in mind.</P>

They would have an opportunity of discussing that intention at a public meeting and could <Col N="504" /> put their views on the minutes, so that before anything was done the Minister would have the fullest opportunity of knowing their mind.  That is what I look upon as consultation.  It is not consultation as to whether there should be an inquiry, but as to whether an institution should be discontinued.  I do not like the way the holding of an inquiry is dealt with in this section.

      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> No Order shall be made by the Minister under this section unless it is in accordance with the evidence and with the weight of the evidence produced at such public local inquiry.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment we have already discussed, with an addition.  This is to ask that the Minister shall not merely have the obligation put upon him to publish reports but it goes by a side track to the same point.  It says that the Minister is not to be allowed to make an Order under this section unless it is in accordance with the evidence and with the weight of the evidence produced at such public local inquiry.  One of the tests as to the evidence and the weight of evidence would be the inspector's report but that would not be conclusive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello seeks to tie the Minister. Unless the evidence and the weight of the evidence produced at the local inquiry is in favour of the Order he proposes to make then he shall not be able to make it.  It is tying him to the evidence and the weight of the evidence, apart altogether from the inspector's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to an amendment covering the problem of accepting the Land Commission's certificate as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a man not occupying a house.  I suggested on the Committee Stage that the Minister might try to introduce a definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo; with a view to putting him in the position of accepting my amendment in relation to the occupation of a house.  I wonder will the Minister tell us now what he has done to fulfil the promise.  We did not divide on that amendment because the Minister undertook to look into the matter with a view to meeting us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not so much a question of the amendment that was in Deputy Hughes' mind, as I understood it, or as it appears in the Official Reports.  What Deputy Hughes was concerned with was trying to secure from me a definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo; and I promised to look into the matter.  The whole difficulty, as I explained to the Dáil before, is the impossibility of defining &ldquo;residence&rdquo; in legal fashion.  We all know what residence in fact is, but residence in law might mean one of 100 different things.  I had the whole question of a definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo; examined and I find that if I tried to give any description of &ldquo;residence&rdquo; it would <Col N="511" /> lead to endless litigation.  Any definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo; that has been made in wills and so on has always been difficult to uphold in the law courts.  The Dáil, I think, quite understands what exactly it is that we mean by &ldquo;residence&rdquo;.  These people with whom we are concerned are people for whom houses are built at public expense.  They have never lived in the houses.  Worse than that, they make pretence of living there by installing a little furniture, but never go near the place.  A farm given to a man who does not live in the house or on the farm can hardly be utilised according to the proper methods of husbandry which forms part of the condition under which the occupier gets the holding.  I gave a particular instance here during the previous stage in regard to the question of legal residence and residence in fact and, having had the matter thoroughly examined by the legal experts in the Land Commission, I find it would be impossible to define &ldquo;residence&rdquo; in the particular clause of the Bill that would give us an effective instrument for putting the Bill, if it passes, into operation.  I promised to examine the matter.  I have examined the matter and I find it is impossible for me to give any fairer definition than I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is highly unsatisfactory. I believe the Minister appreciates what our difficulty is in the matter.  Our case was that it is an elementary principle in the dispensation of justice that a charge has to be proved and that a defendant has a right to defend himself.  Here we are asked to bring in a provision under which a certificate of the Land Commission is to be accepted as conclusive evidence and denying the man who is supposed to have broken his contract an opportunity of defending himself.  I think it is going to bring the courts into contempt and to lessen the respect which our people have for the administration of the courts.  It is on that principle that we appealed to the Minister to try to meet our point, whatever the legal difficulties were. Possibly I did not appreciate these <Col N="512" /> difficulties as much as the Minister did. But I did feel that there was a very big principle involved and that the Minister should go a long way to try to meet the issue that we raised&mdash;that it was not good enough for any Department of State or any individual to claim the right to go into court and ask the court to accept a certificate as conclusive evidence.  I am very disappointed with the Minister's telling us now that he has not succeeded in getting over the difficulty.  I felt that the Minister would find some way out of the difficulty.  I believed at the time that he was anxious to meet the issue that was raised.  It is very unsatisfactory as it stands.</P>

      <P>The whole insinuation is that I have been trying to get away with something.  That is not correct. Nobody could have dealt with this more fairly than I have.  I have gone as far <Col N="513" /> as any Minister could possibly go by trying to get from the Opposition any form of words suitable to them that might produce the effect that everybody in the House knows needs to be produced.  I promised Deputy Hughes that I would look into this particular clause to see if I could get a definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo;.  Having got my legal experts in the Land Commission to look into the matter, they find they cannot give us any definition that might not militate against the whole purpose of the Bill and cause endless litigation. I think I have been quite fair to every Party in the House with regard to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will appreciate that in this particular case proceedings will be based on a breach of a condition of residence continuously in the premises to the satisfaction of the Land Commission.  Now, these proceedings are concluded <i>ab initio</i> by the production of the Land Commission certificate, which will be worded to the effect that the holder has failed to reside continuously in the premises to the satisfaction of the Land Commission. That is conclusive evidence of failure to observe the condition imposed upon the landholder.  It is a farce to suggest that the landholder in that case has an appeal to the court.  He is cut from the start.  I admit that there are considerable legal difficulties in defining &ldquo;residence&rdquo; but the certificate should be <i>prima facie</i>, and not conclusive, evidence.  The aggrieved person is not able to make his case.  There may be instances in which men will have legitimate cases to make in court but, on production of this certificate, they will be bowled out.  They cannot make their case.  That is an injustice to them if they have a legitimate case to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister but I do not think that the proposal which has been made would lead to endless litigation, because the Land Commission would be able to show that their inspections disclosed that the person was not living in the house allotted to him.  It would not take a great deal of time to determine whether that was or was not the case&mdash; particularly if the Land Commission <Col N="514" /> could produce this certificate as <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  I suggest that the Minister should yield to the House on this matter.  Otherwise, he will be shutting the door to legal redress in particular cases.  I agree, on the other hand, that it is impossible to get a satisfactory definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for saying that.  The point is not that of the clause, which we discussed already, but the framing of a definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo;.  I tried in every way to get a form of words which we could put into the clause.</P>

Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Coogan know that there is a difficulty in defining &ldquo;residence&rdquo; in such a way that it will be upheld in court.  It has never been possible to define &ldquo;residence&rdquo; or &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; in a manner to satisfy the courts, despite the fact that common sense makes clear to everybody what &ldquo;residence&rdquo; is and makes clear the type of <Col N="515" /> residence we require, so that this measure may be operated for the benefit of the country.</P>

      <P>The necessity for discovering an acceptable legal definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo; will never arise if the people who are fortunate enough to get land and houses from this or any other Government will go and live in the houses built for them by the State.  I do not want endless litigation on a simple issue of this kind.  I prefer to take the certificate of an honourable official of the Land Commission as to whether a person is, or is not, living on a holding awarded to him.  I do not think that the issue deserves much further debate.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Minister originally held himself out &mdash;I am speaking now without having been present at the time&mdash;as going to make an attempt to get a solution of the difficulties that attach to this word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; or &ldquo;residing&rdquo;.  The Minister now comes in and says that he has not been able to get that definition. We are on the Fourth Stage of the Bill. Would it not be possible to allow a delay to see if other people could get formulæ which would suit?  That is the reason I asked the Minister what formulæ had been suggested and what deficiencies had been found in them. We could then see whether phrases used ordinarily in legislation have been tried and found wanting.  The Minister has referred to difficulties arising from the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo;&mdash;I think the term is &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;&mdash;in connection with the income-tax law.  There has not been very much difficulty in that connection.  Some of the Acts produced by the Minister's Government have interpreted the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;, notably, the Act dealing with nationality and citizenship.  I do not see why phrases accepted by the draftsman in other pieces of legislation would not give the certainty sought here.  If there is that difficulty, why not have a period of delay so that some other formula may be thought out?</P>

      <P>I have no undue wish for rushed legislation.  The Deputy was <Col N="516" /> not in the House when this Bill was being discussed.  When it was first discussed, I invited members of all Parties to come and confer with me with a view to seeing if we could find a solution of this matter.  The only hope I could have had would arise from Deputy Costello's assistance but he suggested that it was not his business to give us a form of words.  We did discuss the matter at great length and I could not accept the viewpoints put forward by the various members who attended the conference.  We discussed every clause of this Bill at length.  The issue which should be raised here is as to the definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo; and not any other point. I cannot find any form of words which will give me a definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo; which will be upheld in law.</P>

      <P>The Minister was good enough to say that I was a sort of <Col N="517" /> sole hope to produce a satisfactory definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo;.  I think it is only right and fair that we should say that the Minister did on this occasion meet the various Parties with very great fairness with a desire to meet the various points of view put forward on this measure.  We took up the attitude that we were in favour of the principle of the Bill but that there were certain pieces of machinery to give effect to the principle to which we objected.  The Minister did meet us on one or two of these matters.  He has made the certificate of the Land Commission <i>prima facie</i> evidence, not exclusive evidence, so that the person affected by the certificate has an opportunity of making his case in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that it would pass the wit of the draftsman to find a phrase which would solve the Minister's difficulty here.  At least he might try it.  When I said that it was not my business to give him that phrase, I meant of course that I was not either a Parliamentary draftsman or a draftsman by profession, that I use my tongue rather than my pen in the profession.  At the same time, I have occasionally used the pen rather effectively from the point of view of legal draftsmanship. I think that even on the spur of the moment I could give him some sort of definition that would meet the situation.  I think the intention is to cover a person who gets a holding of land and uses it as his home or the place from which he works and operates the land.  There has been a number of definitions of the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; and &ldquo;ordinary resident&rdquo; but there has never been any difficulty in the courts in deciding on the facts as to whether a person is resident or ordinarily resident, within the meaning of that particular phrase, as used in a deed or will.  I imagine that the Minister wants a phrase which will run something like this&mdash;&ldquo;who resides permanently and continuously in the dwellinghouse and uses the dwellinghouse as his sole and exclusive means of residence&rdquo;.  I make the Minister a present of that phrase.  There would be no difficulty in the courts if the certificate of the Minister's Department is taken as <Col N="518" /><i>prima facie</i> evidence: the man can then make his case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin amazed me by the benediction he gave to a certificate of this kind.  He startled me and astonished me.  Of course we have got use to happenings of this kind but this idea of making Departmental certificates methods of ousting people from making their case in courts, because somebody may be put to expense, is certainly new coming from the Labour Benches.  We do think it a fundamental principle that a man should not be condemned without being heard and the place for him to be heard and make his case is in court. The suggestion we make is that the certificate of the Land Commission is <i>prima facie</i> evidence only and that there is a burden on the tenant of proving to the satisfaction of the court that the Land Commission is not right.</P>

I studied particularly the provision in the section which has just been the subject of discussion and I can tell Deputy Costello or anybody else that I was not sent into this House to defend the small number of citizens who are put in the privileged position of getting houses and holdings at the expense of the State and who, after having been so fortunate as to get them, refuse to go to live in them. Unfortunately, a very small number of such cases arise in my own constituency but if one citizen or two or three citizens were fortunate enough to get these houses and holdings and did not go to live in them for reasons best known to themselves, for reasons I could not understand, I say it is the duty of the Minister representing the taxpayers who paid for the building of these houses to see that somebody else occupies these houses and works the land to the advantage of the community. I am making no apology to anybody for refusing to defend the limited number of people who get these holdings and the land attached to them and refuse to occupy them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 72:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 16, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>16.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may by Order transfer a district institution maintained by a public assistance authority under Section 31 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939 (No. 27 of 1939), to a health authority whose functional area includes the whole or a substantial part of the functional area of the public assistance authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  An Order under this section <Col N="522" /> shall contain such provisions as the Minister thinks necessary or expedient for enabling the district institution to which the Order relates to be taken over and maintained by a health authority in accordance with the Order.</P>
    <P>(3)  An Order under this section transferring a district institution from a public assistance authority to a health authority shall, without prejudice to the generality of sub-section (2)  of this section, contain such provisions for either or both of the following things as the Minister thinks necessary or expedient for the purposes mentioned in the said sub-section (2), that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  adjustments of property rights and liabilities,</P>
    <P>(b)  transfers of the holders of offices under the public assistance authority whose duties relate to the management of the institution to similar offices under the health authority.</P>
    <P>(4)  When a district institution is transferred to a health authority by Order under this section, such Order shall have effect in accordance with its terms and the institution shall be deemed to have been provided under Section 13 of this Act by the health authority.</P>
    <P>This proposed new section, as is clear on the face of it, proposes to give the Minister power to transfer a district institution maintained by a public assistance authority under Section 31 of the Public Assistance Act to a health authority.  The most likely area in which this section may be operated is the City of Dublin.  Some short time ago, I had discussions with representatives of the Dublin Corporation on the question of institutional accommodation for a section of the community for which they had a statutory responsibility, and, amongst other things, we discussed the possibility of the Dublin Corporation taking over St.  Kevin's Hospital.  I understand that the Dublin Corporation are inquiring into the possibilities and examining the position, but whether it will ever materialise, I do not know.  The fact <Col N="523" /> is that we have not any statutory authority within which St. Kevin's Acute Hospital could be transferred to the Dublin Corporation, if it were found desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>So far as the position in the provinces is concerned, the public assistance authority and the public health authority are in fact the same.  The county council is the public assistance authority and the public health authority, and it is only in Dublin City, and possibly in Waterford, and, I think, in South Cork, that the public assistance authority is not the same body as the public health authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from this proposed new section that the Minister may, by Order, transfer an institution from the authority under which it now is without the permission of that authority to another authority without their consent.  In other words, the Minister, without any consultation or permission, without any agreement from the authority under which an institution is at the moment, may transfer its property to another authority which may or may not wish to accept that institution or responsibility for it.  The Parliamentary Secretary shakes his head.  Do I take it that it cannot be done without their permission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the purpose. The purpose of the section, the inspiration behind the section, arises entirely out of the position in Dublin City.  It is conceivable that the Dublin Board of Assistance might not agree with, might not take kindly at all to the idea of transferring St. Kevin's Acute Hospital to the Dublin Corporation.  That is possible.  The corporation are the paymasters&mdash;it is the corporation which supplies the money to the Dublin Board of Assistance for the maintenance of the institution.  They have discussed the question of their position in the matter in the light of the fact that they have to supply the money and they are asking themselves the question&mdash;and they are asking me the same question&mdash;why, if <Col N="524" /> they have to put up the money, they should not run the institution themselves? The answer up to the present has been that there is no statutory authority under which the institution could be transferred to them, and it is arising out of that position that this provision has been made.  There would be no question of taking an institution from an unwilling assistance authority and transferring it to an unwilling public health authority.  That will not happen.  It could happen, but there is no means of preventing such a possibility. You have to take power to do wrong in order to be able to do right.</P>

The trouble is that the Parliamentary Secretary is arguing this Bill and its various sections as if we were legislating only for his time, as if he were always going to be the responsible authority.

      <P>This may or may not be confined to Dublin.  I would like to get some of the Dublin Deputies into this, and would like to hear their views on it.  There is nothing in this proposed new section that says it shall apply to Dublin and Dublin alone.  It could apply to Cork or Waterford.

      <P>Therefore, it could not apply.  But it could apply in Cork or Waterford.  The Parliamentary Secretary says such a thing will not happen, but what we have to concern ourselves with is what can happen.  It has been repeated so often in this House that we cannot afford to concern ourselves merely with the intentions of the Minister.  It is not the intention of the Minister that would hold if this matter ever came to a point.  I take it that the Dublin Corporation are <Col N="525" /> anxious to get the running of St. Kevin's into their own hands, in view of the fact that they have to find the money.  I do not question that&mdash;the Minister knows that better than I do&mdash; but supposing that, for some reason or another, the Dublin Corporation did not want to take over the responsibility of running St. Kevin's, the Minister could, under this proposed new section, make them take over responsibility for it, whether they wanted to do so or not.</P>

They have not.  The matter has been discussed and is still under consideration, but if they decided to-morrow to take it over, there is not any statutory power to enable them to do so.  We ran up against this difficulty in relation to Rialto&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave knows something about that&mdash;which is also a public assistance institution.  It appeared desirable, because of the prejudice against it as a public assistance institution, that it should be taken out of the public assistance category and put into the public health category and handed over to the corporation as a public health institution.  Any of the Dublin Deputies will tell Deputy Morrissey, if he discusses it with them, that the results were very happy indeed and that Rialto now is looked upon as a first class institution and has the full confidence of the public, and particularly of the patients who have availed of that institution.  When it <Col N="526" /> came actually to transferring Rialto to the Dublin Corporation, we found that the law only permitted a lease.  That, of course, is entirely unsatisfactory&mdash; that the Dublin Corporation could only lease it from the public assistance authority.  The power we take now will enable us to make that transfer a permanent one and will enable us at any future time, if it should be necessary or desirable, to transfer St. Kevin's; and undoubtedly it will enable us, if we think well of doing it, to do all the various other things Deputy Morrissey thinks we ought not to do.</P>
      <P>The only assurance I can give him on that point is that the intention is to avail of the machinery of this measure for the purpose of doing good. For the sake of argument, suppose the Dublin Corporation were taking over St.  Kevin's to-morrow as a public health institution, is there any Deputy who would object?  Not one, because those Deputies who have given any consideration to the matter would agree right away that, if that institution could be taken out of the public assistance category and if, let us say, the same air of respectability could be brought about it as was brought about Rialto, it would be better for the poor of Dublin; and the Dublin Deputies, particularly those who are members of the corporation, would agree with that.</P>

      <P>Let me make it clear that I have not the slightest objection to giving the Minister whatever powers he requires to enable the Dublin Corporation or any other corporation to do what they want to do. So far as cases like Rialto or St. Kevin's are concerned, I am delighted to hear that they have been taken over by the Dublin Corporation; but there is a very big difference between that and giving the Minister power to force the Dublin Corporation or any other corporation to do something which they do not want to do.  That is the whole point at issue between us.  I can subscribe to everything the Parliamentary Secretary has said, but, unfortunately, what he has been talking about is not what is in this proposed new section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 73:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), line 34, after the <Col N="528" /> word &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment does not exactly convey what I had in mind when I put it down.  At the time I drafted it, my mind was directed to the penal provisions of this Bill.  What I had in mind was the fact that under Section 29, particularly, persons might be detained, isolated, sent to institutions forcibly against their will.</P>
    <P>Under Section 16 it is proposed that where a person receives institutional service from a health authority, he might be made to pay for that.  Numerous persons who may come under the penal sections of this Bill may be old or infirm.  They may prefer to receive nursing treatment and medical attention at home.  They may have the strongest personal objections to institutional treatment of any kind.  They may be persons who have a strong affiliation with the old home and they may virtually refuse to leave it for institutional treatment.  Under these provisions it would be possible for these persons to be incarcerated in an institution against their will.  Not only that, but it would be possible for the authorities in charge of the institution to detain a person there and to charge him for the period during which he was so detained.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that is entirely unreasonable.  It is most unfair to subject a person of that type to these charges.  I appreciate that my amendment, as phrased at the moment, would mean that everybody who voluntarily enters such an institution would have to pay for the institutional service.  I did not intend that at all.  I wanted to draw a distinction between persons compulsorily detained, compulsorily made to subject themselves to treatment in these places, and persons who go in there voluntarily.  But many persons who go voluntarily may be poor and they may not be able to afford the institutional treatment.  It is not my intention that they should be compelled to pay.  I think where people are incarcerated and forcibly subjected to treatment it would be unfair to make them pay for the services.</P>

There must be some meaning in it and I want to know what the Parliamentary Secretary intends it to mean. Then I will see whether it does mean what he intends it to mean.  From Deputy Coogan's amendment I am not sure that there should not be some reference in Section 16 to the subsequent provisions of Section 29 (8).  I would suggest &ldquo;subject as hereinafter provided&rdquo; or &ldquo;as provided by Section 29 (8)&rdquo;.  That would make the matter more clear.

      <P>This amendment is merely to amplify and make more clear the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section.  The phrase used in sub-section (2) is very vague.  It provides that the health authority shall have regard to the financial circumstances of such persons.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 78:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a person receives any institutional services from the health authority such health authority shall be answerable in damages to such person for any negligence in discharge of the duties of such health authority causing injury or damage to such person irrespective of whether or not such person may have been charged for services received by him from such health authority.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to provide that, from the point of view of legal liability towards a patient in one of these institutions, there shall be no difference between a person who pays and a person who does not pay.  The question of liability on the part of a hospital institution for negligence to a patient in the maintenance, care and treatment of that patient is one that has received considerable attention from the courts of this country and from the courts across the water.  The general tendency of the courts in our own country, if we are to have regard to a very recent case in the Supreme Court, is to assimilate the position of non-paying patients with paying patients.  But that is not clear at the moment.  The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that a person who has to go into one of these institutions is entitled to receive proper care, skill and attention, and that if there is any want of that due care, skill and attention the institution is to be liable for negligence at the suit of that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> There is at present the principle that if there is a paying patient in any public institution, that institution is liable for failure to exercise due care in the maintenance and treatment of the patient, but if a patient goes in under regulations which are made for people who are unable to pay, then, in certain circumstances, the liability is not to that patient at all but is merely to the Minister, if there is any such liability. I think it is quite improper that there should be this differentiation between poor patients and patients who are able to pay for their keep and attention. The distinction would appear to come down from the days when people who went into poor law institutions were regarded as paupers with no rights. Arising out of that situation, regulations were made for the admission of pauper patients into institutions.  The decisions of the courts of this country have laid it down perfectly clearly that in what would have been known in the old days as the case of a pauper patient suffering from negligence at the hands of the people in charge of those institutions, that the patient has no remedy in law, whereas if a small payment were made by the patient on going in, then that patient has a remedy in law against the person or the institution in consequence of whose negligence the patient suffered damage or injury.  I want to draw the attention of the House to that legal situation.  The object of the amendment is to get the position clarified, now that there is an opportunity of doing so, and of providing that, both from the point of view of non-paying patients and from the point of view of paying patients, the liability in law for negligence and breach of duty should be the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  It is very desirable that there should be no discrimination as between paying patients and non-paying patients as regards the neglect or hardship which they may suffer through failure on the part of those in charge of an institution to carry out their duties properly.  As the law stands, apparently the non-paying patient who suffers some unfair treatment or an injustice can, and in all probability would, appeal to the <Col N="534" /> authority in charge of the institution, to the Department, or to the Minister, but in law that person cannot recover any damages.  In view of that, I think an amendment of this kind is desirable. It is particularly desirable in view of the far-reaching powers which the Minister is obtaining under this Bill: powers to compel a person to avail of, and to accept, institutional treatment. The amendment, if accepted, would provide a person with some kind of safeguard.  It would go some distance to ensure that proper care will be taken of all patients who may be isolated or detained in a health institution.  The amendment makes special provision for safeguarding the poorer type of patient who at present would, apparently, have no real redress in law.</P>

      <P>I do not question Deputy Costello's exposition of the law, but what I do say is that his exposition of the legal position relates to a public assistance institution rather than to a public health institution.  There is that big difference to be noted.  We cannot remedy under this Bill a defect in the law, to which Deputy Costello has referred, in relation to public assistance institutions.  I do not think that the law requires amendment so far as public health institutions are concerned. I would refer Deputy Costello, and other Deputies who may be interested in this, to Section 274 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  That section is not being repealed under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 81:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, sub-section (1) says that the Minister may, by Order, declare that a disease is infectious, and I object to the Minister declaring a disease to be infectious by an Order which nobody may have heard about: particularly when you look at the number <Col N="536" /> of consequences that may flow from the making of such an Order.  It has been pointed out before that this Bill, as drafted, will arrange the number of Orders and regulations made by the Minister, and that in the case of a regulation, at any rate, there is the possibility of having a review of it by either House of the Oireachtas, since, while the Minister could put the regulation into operation from the time of its drafting, nevertheless there are a certain number of days in which it could be discussed here or by either House of the Oireachtas, and in that case either House of the Oireachtas could decide to have that regulation annulled or passed, as the case might be.</P>
    <P>In the case of an Order, however, there is no provision for its publication or annulment afterwards, and I think that when the Minister is defining what is an infectious disease it is a matter which should come under the review of this House, or both Houses of the Oireachtas, whether it is a matter of an Order or a regulation, because when you look down through the number of regulations here, you find that under Section 19, a person offending against Orders or regulations in the case of an infectious disease, shall be liable to a fine of £50; that under Section 20 such a person shall be liable to a fine of £100; that under Section 21 such a person shall be liable to a fine of £5; that under Section 23 such a person shall be liable to a fine of £50, or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.  In the same way under Sections 25, 26 and 27, parents and certain other persons run the risk of suffering these penalties, and I think that in such cases there should be the possibility of review of the Minister's Orders here.</P>
    <P>There is more than that in question, however.  I think that, on Section 18, the Minister should give the House a review of what he considers to be infectious diseases, and in what way he proposes to differentiate between the two classes of infectious disease suggested in the Bill itself and in the section, because while he proposes to <Col N="537" /> define what are infectious diseases, he proposes to take power to say that while certain infectious diseases will be treated with the full rigour of the law, others may not be treated in that way.  For instance, in the case of some persons suffering from one particular kind of disease, it seems that they can go on a tram or bus without incurring any penalty, and neither will the driver of the bus or tram be liable to a penalty, but under the Bill as it stands it would seem that nobody is to have an opportunity of knowing what particular disease is meant until the Minister makes an Order.  People have been travelling on trams or buses since their inception, even though they are suffering from certain diseases, and if they are not now to be allowed to travel on these vehicles without the possibility of incurring penalties, they should be allowed to know what these diseases are.  I object to these things, and that is why I am moving this amendment.  I am moving the amendment, not alone for that purpose, but also to get a definition from the Minister of what are infectious diseases and what differentiation he will make between the various classes of infectious disease.</P>

      <P>It is not in any way surprising that there should be doubt in the minds of Deputies, who have not been in touch with the growth of this measure, as to the meaning and purpose of Section 18.  Section 18 gives the Minister power to declare by Order what is an infectious disease.  Now, right at the outset, perhaps I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister already has power to declare, by regulation, what is an infectious disease, and he is under no obligation to place such a regulation on the Table of the House.  It is well that we should be quite clear about that, because there has been a good deal of misunderstanding created as to the alleged extraordinary power that the Minister proposes to take under Section 18.  He is not taking any extraordinary power whatever.  He is not taking any power that he does not already enjoy to-day.  Naturally, you will say to me: &ldquo;Well, seeing that <Col N="538" /> that is so, and that you are going to deal with this matter of other infectious diseases and place the regulations on the Table of the House, why do you want to carry out this particular function by Order?&rdquo;  Well, let me say that if the House so desires, I have no objection to have this type of Order placed on the Table of the House.  Perhaps I might explain another point on which Deputies could not be expected to be clear, and that is in regard to declaring what is an infectious disease. I want Deputies to be clear on this point.  The fact that a certain disease may be infectious does not necessarily make that disease notifiable.  In the past, certain diseases have been made notifiable by regulation, as I have already mentioned.  Therefore, we have to draw some distinction between infectious diseases made notifiable by regulations and other infectious diseases that will not be notifiable.</P>
      <P>The next point that I want to make clear is whether we should propose to bring tuberculosis and venereal diseases into the classes of diseases that will be declared by Order to be infectious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that make them notifiable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I want to draw a distinction at the outset. Deputies should understand that there is a strong reason behind this differentiation in the declaration of infectious diseases and the listing by notification of such diseases.  I do not propose to make venereal disease notifiable.  There may be a difference of opinion about that.  I am always open to persuasion. Deputies know that.  It would take a tremendous lot of persuasion to convince me that it would be wise to make venereal disease a notifiable disease.  I believe that if you make venereal disease notifiable, instead of getting people to come forward for treatment you will drive it underground.  What I am pretty certain would happen is that if people suffering from venereal disease felt sure that by consulting a doctor their case would be notified, they would not seek treatment.  I am not infallible, and I may be wrong in that.  That is the main reason why I <Col N="539" /> propose to draw a distinction between infectious diseases in the category that are infectious, as declared by Order, and infectious diseases that are notifiable by regulation.  So long as they are infectious diseases it will be necessary to bring upon them the full blast, if you like, of the provisions for the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases.  We are only dealing now with the question of the declaration, by Order, of diseases which are infectious.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I had better not confuse the House by a discussion of the considerations arising out of sub-section (2) by reference to a certain stage.  That is a different type of problem.  I hope Deputies will appreciate that there is nothing revolutionary in this.  If we had retained the code of law dealing with venereal disease, if we were not repealing that, or if we were leaving it as the statutory code for the future, there would be no need for this.  If we were leaving tuberculosis, with the present limited statutory powers in relation to it, there would be no need for this.  The fact is that we are repealing all that legislation, and we are bringing these diseases into the category of infectious diseases, in order to try to make a better effort to control them.  There are certain stages of tuberculosis that we desire not to make notifiable.  There are no stages of venereal disease that I would like to see notifiable at present.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made that clear, and I think it would be well if he circulated some kind of memorandum on the question of infectious diseases that are notifiable; those that are not notifiable, and those that are going to be notifiable.  As we go through Part IV of the Bill we will want to know whether a lodging-house keeper is going to become subject to penalties for not notifying certain things in respect of an infectious disease that is not now notifiable, as well as one that is notifiable. The Parliamentary Secretary might distinguish between venereal disease on the one hand and certain not very dangerous stages of tuberculosis. <Col N="540" /> Is it the intention that a lodging-house keeper or a tram conductor may be liable for penalties in respect of people who are suffering from venereal disease or from a milder form of tuberculosis?</P>

      <P>I have certain amendments coming on which give power to exclude certain infectious diseases from the operation of certain sections.  As we meet these amendments I propose to indicate what I propose.  That appears to be the best way to deal with them.  Clearly we must have a list of infectious diseases, and clearly we do not require the full scope of the Bill to apply in relation to all infectious diseases.  That seems to be the only way to deal with the matter, to exclude from the operation of the sections certain diseases for the control of which we do not require the special powers given in these sections.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary has already given us a short outline of some of the distinctions to be drawn between the general category of infectious disease and the sub-categories of notifiable and non-notifiable diseases.  He also indicated that in the case of those discases <Col N="542" /> that are notifiable or not notifiable, there may or may not be the abrogation of certain sections in Part IV.

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to safeguard a person <Col N="547" /> who could be penalised by this section. The section provides rather drastic penalties for a person who fails to take proper precautions against the spread of infection.  This amendment seeks to ensure that a person shall not be deemed to know that he is suffering from an infectious disease unless he has been notified by a competent medical authority to that effect.  I think that is a very necessary safeguard, because the section as it stands merely refers to a person who knows that he is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease.  I think it would be rather difficult to prove in court that a person knows or does not know that he is a probable source of infection.  I think it would be better, both from the point of view of making the section effective and also from the point of view of safeguarding the person affected, if the amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment would narrow the terms of the section rather than expand it.  The section reads that a person who knows that he is a probable source of infection shall do certain things.  &ldquo;A person who knows.&rdquo;  If he does not know that he is a probable source of infection, he is under no obligation.  He either knows or he does not know.  It is very definite. It is not that he has reason to believe, or that he suspects; it is not as if somebody has told him that he believes he has an infectious disease.  It is a question of whether he knows that he has an infectious disease.  Deputy Cogan's intention is to strengthen the position of the person who may be endangered by the operation of the section.  In fact he weakens it.  The amendment says: &ldquo;has been notified by a competent medical authority.&rdquo;  Who is to determine the competency?  Is any duly qualified medical officer a competent medical authority, or is any registered medical practitioner?  Or is it to be a person who has some specialised knowledge of infectious diseases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, suppose that, in fact, a person knows he is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease.  He <Col N="548" /> knows it; he has no doubt about the matter at all.  Should he not be under an obligation to take every possible precaution to prevent that infectious disease from spreading to anybody else without having to wait to be notified by what is called a competent medical authority?  The thing is unreasonable and it would be very inadvisable, indeed, to insert such a provision in a public health measure.  If he knows that he is a danger to his neighbours, he ought to take steps to protect his neighbours, regardless of whether a medical authority tells him that he is a probable source of infection or not.</P>

One or other of those amendments should be accepted, because a person would be open to prosecution on the ground that he knew he was a source of infection and he would have very great difficulty in proving that he did not know.  In matters regarding illness, it is very hard for a layman to be definite about anything.  We meet people who believe they have all sorts of diseases which they have not got and we meet others suffering from really serious diseases who do not really believe there is any thing wrong.  On those medical <Col N="549" /> matters, the layman is almost always at sea.  It would be very unfair to insist on this provision without some safeguard.  It would be extremely difficult for a layman to clear himself in court by proving that he did not know he was suffering from an infectious disease.</P>

      <P>I should not be prepared to support this amendment because it seems to me that the test that would have to be applied would be whether the person concerned had been notified, if not by a competent medical authority, then by some medical authority.  We are dealing with a number of diseases in respect of most of which no person requires to be notified by a medical authority that he is suffering from them.  These may not be the most serious diseases but they may be the most inconvenient from the point of view of the effect on their home life and the effect on their ability to carry on their normal work. Suppose a person is suffering from measles.  He does not require expert advice to realise that he is suffering from measles.</P>

If I had measles, I should be quite aware of the fact but, so long as I could say that I had not been notified by a medical authority that I was suffering from measles, I could evade any responsibility for failure to take elementary steps to safeguard other people.  I might not go near a medical authority. In the ordinary way, people who undergo about of measles do not go near a doctor.  Take the case of venereal disease, which the Parliamentary Secretary does not intend to be notifiable.  I take it that that will still be listed as infectious and that there will be responsibility upon people to take ordinary precautions not to infect other people.  If they failed to attend a medical authority, they would have a complete answer to any charge that they had almost deliberately and almost with malice aforethought endangered the health of other people. <Col N="550" /> Their answer would be that they had not been notified by a medical authority that they were suffering from this disease.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should object to that, though it might shorten the discussion, which is apt to be lengthy if we take all three as separate matters, to discuss the amendments generally and have separate divisions.  I put down my amendment referring to &ldquo;registered medical practitioner&rdquo; without knowing that Deputy Beirne had an amendment down referring to &ldquo;competent medical authority&rdquo;.  The difficulty in which I find myself is this: we are establishing an offence. That means an extension of the criminal law.  Somebody will be fined. This is an offence of a criminal type, punishable in that way.  I hold that, before we enlarge the scope of the criminal law, even though the punishment may be only monetary, we should make clear to the court what tests are to be applied.  Clearly, there should be some objective test, something that does not depend on the person himself.  Such an objective test would be supplied either by notification&mdash;which has a formal smack about it&mdash;by a competent medical authority or by registered medical practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin makes the point that, if a person is slovenly enough in his general demeanour towards the public not to be conscious, or not to care, whether he is conscious or not, <Col N="551" /> that he has duties towards the public, he may avoid his responsibilities under this Bill by not going near a medical authority.  But the medical authority may be sent to him.  This amendment does not mean that he must be notified by some medical man whom he calls in himself.  If the Minister sends in some medical officer to tell him that he has had an infectious disease&mdash;the Minister declares for this particular infectious diseases for this purpose&mdash;and that he is a danger to the public until a quarantine period has elapsed, then there is an objective test which a court can apply and feel that it is not doing any harm.  I have the fear that, once this Bill becomes legislation, the courts will be apt to regard as the test, whether a person had been, in fact, suffering from the disease, and not whether, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, the person knew he was suffering from the disease. There are many Acts in which a person's knowledge is supposed to be the pivotal point.  All that means is whether the person should have known and, in such a case, if the court so decides, it imputes to him the knowledge he should have had.  It will then go on to apply those other tests.  I do not think that that should be so.  It ought to be quite sufficient if a person is notified&mdash;whether the notification be a formal one, as Deputy Beirne's amendment seems to suggest, or whether he be told by a general medical practitioner&mdash;that he has had an infectious disease and is not over the period of infection.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the sense of the amendment and of the word &ldquo;probable&rdquo; is that you get the interposition of some medical man before there can be any question of the knowledge of the probability of infecting others. We are dealing with an attempt to interpose the advice of some medical man in a section which contains the words &ldquo;a probable source of infection&rdquo;. If the word &ldquo;probable&rdquo; were omitted, the objection to the section would not be so great because then I understand the whole question would turn on the person's knowledge&mdash;as to how he is to know he is a source of infection.  As the section stands at <Col N="552" /> the moment, it is heavily loaded against the ordinary person.  If we were provided with statistical material in the early stages of the debate, we would be in a much better position to deal with this particular matter.  Is there any statistical information in regard to the behaviour of people affected with infectious diseases?  Is there any information to indicate that people who knew that they were a probable source of infection persisted in infecting others or in pursuing such a course of conduct that they were likely to infect others?  Were any epidemics caused by such conduct and where have they broken out?  How long have they lasted?  In the absence of such information I object to the people of this country having to face the charge that they were indifferent to other people's health and that they were, so to speak, by their conduct, a danger to other people's health.  If we could get some information on that point and if the information were of such a grave character that cognisance would have to be taken of it, we would be more disposed to agree with the Parliamentary Secretary's fears. I do not know of any case where infection has been spread in this criminal way and in the absence of such information, I do not think we could advance on the lines suggested here.  Where an infected person is so criminally negligent, after he has been given notice clearly by somebody that he is a source of infection, as to put himself in a position to infect others that person should be punished but only that person.</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy McGilligan is one to which we should give consideration.  I have opposed amendment No. 86 with regard to requiring notification by a medical officer to prove that a person knows he is suffering from an infectious disease.  The same principle is in Deputy McGilligan's amendment, although the wording is slightly different. He does, however, raise a different point.  That is, the possibility of proving that a person knows he is suffering from an infectious disease by having him notified by a medical practitioner. Whether that is feasible or not, it seems to me to be a point that should be considered.  How exactly it is to be done, I am not quite sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> Deputy McGilligan has already dealt with the point I raised with regard to a certain type of person who would deliberately not approach a medical practitioner, although knowing he was suffering from an infectious disease, in order to safeguard himself against any possibility of being dealt with under this section.  If a person does not approach a medical practitioner, can we get any provision whereby the medical practitioner will, from his side, serve notice upon that person, and, if so, in what way?  I notice in the amendment which the Parliamentary Secretary has introduced, amendment No. 103, he provides for the serving of notice in certain cases by the district medical officer or by a registered medical practitioner.  Would it be possible, in the event of action being taken under the provisions of this section against an individual, that, as a preliminary to that action being taken, the offence could be proved by the serving of notice, informing him that on a certain date he was suffering from an infectious disease in the opinion of the district medical officer or some other registered medical practitioner, and that that, in itself, would then be proof that, as of that date, he was suffering from an infectious disease? If we had that, it might meet the position the Parliamentary Secretary wants to achieve and might also meet some of the objections which we on this side feel with regard to its present vagueness.  In that connection, we have still to deal with the other word, the word &ldquo;probable&rdquo;, which is also causing some disquietude.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the debate very carefully and I must say that I have not got any new inspiration. That is not due to the fact that I have closed either my eyes or my ears.  The section provides that if a person knows he is a source of infection &mdash;either a probable source of infection or a source of infection in fact&mdash;he has to do certain things.  I cannot conceive any machinery under which we could ascertain that every possible or probable source of infection, or every person who had been in contact with a virulent disease, would be brought under the notice of the medical officer, <Col N="557" /> either a private practitioner or the public health officer.  If such a person does not bring himself under the observation of a medical practitioner or of the district or county medical officer, how on earth are we to know that he has contracted that infectious disease or has been in contact with an infectious disease?</P>

      <P>If he does not know, he cannot be punished, but suppose, for the sake of argument, that he visited a house in which there was diphtheria. he went there that there was diphtheria he was there that there was diphtheria in the house.  Nobody but himself might know he had visited that house, but he proceeds gaily next day&mdash;let us say he had been in close contact with the case; diphtheria might not be the best example because it is not necessarily the most highly infectious but I take it as an illustration&mdash;to a football match, to a cinema or establishes close personal contact with his fellow-men. If he knows that he has just been in contact with a person who has a virulent and infectious disease, and if he fails to take precautions, and somebody whom he contacts develops the disease, I think he is guilty of conduct for which he should be punished. Whether the judge would be satisfied, when that case came to court, that in fact he knew he was a probable source of infection is a matter for the judge to decide.  I can only indicate how I would decide, but fortunately for him I will not be the judge.  Let us take the venereal case again.  The person has not consulted a doctor at all, but he knows he is a certain source of infection, and nobody knows it but himself. Is he free to spread that disease without incurring any penalty?  I do not think he ought to be.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary has caused us even more disturbance of mind by the example he gave us of a person visiting a house where there is an infectious disease who, the following day, because he fails to take precautions, infects somebody else, because <Col N="558" /> we are immediately up against the problem: to what extent that person knew that, by visiting that house, he became a probable source of infection.</P>

      <P>We have here a case, which is very common, of the ordinary layman who may come in contact in a thousand ways with an infectious disease and who, by reason of that contact, becomes a probable source of infection and may, in fact, infect other people.  How and in what way are we to lay any basis on which it can be proved that he knew that, by reason of that contact, he has become a probable source of infection?  Are we going to leave it wide open and, if we are, are we to be dependent on whether there is a person on the bench with the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary and myself who will send him up right away, or a more lenient person who will take a more lenient view?  If that is the kind of law we propose to make, it seems to me to be very poor law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the difficulty of serving an official notice on an individual in such a case as that quoted by the Parliamentary Secretary, in which a person goes to a house, and, the following day, by reason of his contact with infection, has spread that disease and only two or three days later do the medical authorities become aware of it, and then serve formal notice on him that he is a source of infection; but when dealing with a section under which, as I think, a very large percentage of ordinary laymen may find themselves in difficulty, I do suggest we have some responsibility to try to get some more exact and close definition of the offence we are going to impose <Col N="559" /> on these people, than merely depending on what knowledge they may have of whether, by visiting houses or having contact with people, they leave themselves open to punishment for failing to take precautions and have committed an offence under this Bill. We may be defining the section now, but in the years to come we will not be the people who will enforce it and, if we leave such a wide gap there for the ordinary layman, we may find that an ordinary person may be quite innocently drawn into serious consequences. After all, if we take the responsibility of making a law and thereby making an offence, we should try to secure as much protection as possible for the innocent person as well as making as much provision as possible to deal with the guilty person. As far as it stands at the moment, merely depending on the person knowing as proving the basis of the offence, there are countless cases where it will be purely a question of opinion on the part of the person administering the law as to whether the individual was guilty of an offence or not, and it will be very difficult for the innocent person to prove to anybody's satisfaction that he did not know.</P>

      <P>Take the case a little further.  A person calls to the house of a patient who had no knowledge that he was suffering then from an infectious disease, but on the following morning the doctor comes in and diagnoses an infectious disease.  That afternoon, the visitor has heard his neighbour is now so diagnosed.  Are we to take it that the visitor should there and then isolate himself from his home, isolate himself from all public assembly and proceed to incarcerate himself in some public institution?

      <P>Yes, it arises on the question of knowledge.  The visitor has that knowledge that the patient is suffering from an infectious disease, he knows he has been in contact with that patient, he knows something about the Public Health Act and probably concludes: &ldquo;I am a probable source of infection, I had better tear up the tickets I had for to-night's theatre and for to-morrow's football match and isolate myself from my family and run into one of those new institutions the Minister has provided&rdquo;.  He has the knowledge that at least his neighbour has been suffering from the infectious disease.  He is doubtful whether or not he is a probable source of infection, but strictly speaking he will be committing an offence if he does not take those steps.  I want to know if the average citizen is to take all those precautions of his own volition and, if he does not, if he is committing an offence.</P>

      <P>Are we to get an example of what is meant by that? The Parliamentary Secretary meant this example to be taken comprehensively. If a person gets into contact with another person, when the second person is suffering from an infectious disease, the Parliamentary Secretary apparently holds that the first person knows that he, on leaving the second person, is a probable source of infection. I take it that is what was meant by the Parliamentary Secretary, but that is not carried out by the phrase. It is not certain that that first person would be deemed by a court to know that he would be a probable source of infection.  I take it that what the Parliamentary Secretary had in mind in his example was that he wants the court to take the thing objectively. Has A been in contact with B when B was suffering?  If so, A must have known that he was a probable source of infection.  I think that is the point the Parliamentary Secretary had in mind.  I suggest we should start off <Col N="561" /> with the things on which we are in agreement.  If a person has got notice from a registered medical practitioner, the notice advising the person that he is a source of infection from infectious disease, that should be good, as far as it goes.

      <P>That is the point Deputy Larkin made.  How are the authorities going to know?  Someone is infected or in danger of being infected. I do not think it would be necessary in every case to wait until there had been infection, until it became notorious that a person was infected by typhoid.  Supposing that person were known and it was also known that a number of people had been crowding around that person, surely the Parliamentary Secretary would not wait until someone had developed typhoid?  Surely he would ask the registered medical practitioner to warn those people that they had met this carrier and had become a source of infection, that they ought to subject themselves to some sort of treatment before meeting ordinary human contact and should take all reasonable precautions?  I could understand the Parliamentary Secretary if he said he could not take any action until someone else were infected.  Then the damage is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought this was precautionary and not merely punitive.  I thought the idea was to prevent people who, being warned, would keep away from others, on penalty of being brought into court. I did not think he was going to wait until a third person was infected. Apparently, that is the Parliamentary Secretary's idea.  However, we have got away from the section.  I come back now to amendment No. 105 in which the phrase is turned away from &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; to &ldquo;having reason to believe.&rdquo; This phrase &ldquo;reason to believe&rdquo; is in Section 21, first of all, and is adopted in the Parliamentary Secretary's new amendment, No. 103.  He uses the word &ldquo;knows&rdquo; in sub-section (3) but in sub-section (5), as it will be, of the new Section 19, he states: &ldquo;the parent shall not send a child to school if the <Col N="563" /> parent has reason to believe....&rdquo; Has he reason to believe something that the court might more easily apply tests in respect of than this great word &ldquo;knows&rdquo;?  I suggest one of the occasions upon which a court would hold a person had reason to believe would be when he had been warned by a competent medical man.  Why not accept that and graft on to it such a phrase as will cover the area, that is, the zone of uncertainty at the moment?</P>
    <P>Supposing the Parliamentary Secretary adopts such a phrase as &ldquo;a person who has been given notice by the registered medical practitioner and otherwise knows he is a probable source of infection&rdquo;.  That gets in one objective test that the courts might apply.  If a man has been given such information, he is deemed to have the knowledge that the section requires. What is the area not covered by the notification given by the medical authority?  The section could be improved if we put it in the form of &ldquo;a person who has been given notice by the registered medical practitioner, and otherwise has reason to believe that he is a source of infection&rdquo;.  That will give us at least one objective test and you would have the phrase &ldquo;reason to believe&rdquo; rather than this general word &ldquo;knows&rdquo;.  I would be afraid the courts might run awry on this word &ldquo;knows&rdquo;.  The Lord himself hardly knows what the mind of man is, and how is a court to determine it?  That rules out one case where the word &ldquo;knows&rdquo; is the pivotal word.  In the other case we have to take a decision on the question, did certain things happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the ramifications of this section are only being disclosed as it is being debated. I have been listening to speakers who appear to be exercising their minds about a man&mdash;whether he knows, or does not know, that he is a probable source of infection.  I want to approach this matter from the angle of a person who does know that he is a probable source of infection and we will see where that is going to lead. He has to take reasonable precautions, <Col N="564" /> according to Section 19.  Are you going to get down to defining reasonable precautions in various categories?  Deputy Larkin mentioned that a man might have measles and somebody visits him.  Is that person, once he knows he has been in contact with an infected person, to go into quarantine for 48 hours or a week?</P>
      <P>There is another ramification.  Supposing a person is a worker and he goes into quarantine, will he be paid sickness benefit, or could he draw unemployment benefit because he is in quarantine?  I think those and other points are going to come out gradually. Can quarantine be defined as stopping in your own house or, if they are children, in the house of their parents?  Where is this going to finish up?  The Parliamentary Secretary has merely broken in on the fringe of the cases by mentioning &ldquo;reasonable precautions&rdquo;.  Ought not we to have &ldquo;reasonable precautions&rdquo; defined in the definition section of this Act? &ldquo;Reasonable precautions&rdquo; under the heading of measles, and &ldquo;reasonable precautions&rdquo; under the heading of smallpox, I take it, would be somewhat different.  What will &ldquo;reasonable precautions&rdquo; be in the case of a child, and what will &ldquo;reasonable precautions&rdquo; be in the case of an adult, and will people be paid sickness benefit and unemployment benefit?</P>
      <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to develop Section 19 before we even decide on these amendments, which are more or less all put down with the purpose of safeguarding persons as to whether they really know, or do not know, or ought to have known.  I suggest this section has the most extraordinary ramifications.</P>

      <P>Before we get more deeply into the consideration of this section, I would like to invite the Parliamentary Secretary to take back the section and see if he can revise it before we reach the Report Stage.  I think that the House, generally, is anxious to help him in getting the best possible section here.  The word which we propose to delete, &ldquo;knows&rdquo;, ought to be deleted and possibly the best solution of the matter would be to <Col N="565" /> delete &ldquo;knows&rdquo; and introduce the words &ldquo;has reasonable grounds to believe&rdquo;.  That would be more suitable, and we would then place upon the person who has reasonable grounds to believe that he is a probable source of infection, the duty of reporting to a medical officer.  That is the simplest precaution any person who suspects he is a probable source of infection can take.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Reasonable precautions&rdquo; is very difficult to define and there will be only confusion in the public mind and in the minds of the people affected. The Parliamentary Secretary has more or less complicated the case by a reference to venereal disease, because he has told us, first of all, that he does not propose to make that disease notifiable and then he proceeds, in regard to this particular section, to define failure to take precautions as a very serious offence.  We cannot have it both ways, and it would be better as far as I, as a layman, can see, if all these infectious diseases were made notifiable and if that was one of the precautions which the person affected was compelled to take.</P>

If you have an affection for a person and you suggest that person is infected, does that person come under the heading that he or she knows?

      <P>I do not think that, even with the provisions in this section, any great advance is going to be made in the way of inducing people who may be a source of infection to others to isolate themselves.  An individual, with the best intentions in the world, may, through ignorance, be the cause of doing great damage to the health of other people.  He does not know that he is a source of infection to others.  If he is a carrier he knows that, because he has been told.  A person may have contact with another person who is suffering from an infectious disease before the disease has <Col N="566" /> been diagnosed.  He may go away and not hear of that for some time.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should put the responsibility on the medical officer who diagnoses a case of inquiring what contacts were made with that person during the previous 48 or 24 hours.  The doctor has to notify the case to the county medical officer of health, but the other responsibility that I speak of should be put on him so that the machinery can be put in motion at once to notify people who may have had contacts with that case and are probably a source of infection to others.  All such persons should then be notified to take the necessary precautions.  I cannot understand why the Parliamentary Secretary has not already taken power to do that.</P>

      <P>In view of the paucity of information that we have been given with regard to the intentions of each section of this Bill and of the number of amendments that have been put down, it seems to me that we are proceeding in a rather unfortunate way.  What occurs to me is that before having a detailed discussion on any of the amendments to Section 19 it would have been very helpful and would probably tend to shorten discussion if the Parliamentary Secretary had told us what were the intentions of the section as drafted. Certain points were raised to-night by Deputy Dockrell and earlier by other Deputies.  It would have been very helpful if the Parliamentary Secretary had given us a full picture of what is intended with regard to the section. We would then have a better understanding of the whole position.  It would also help us to see what responsibility really falls upon individuals who may have come in contact with an infected person.  Suppose that on a Saturday night a person visits a friend and finds out on Sunday morning that his friend has diphtheria, and suppose further that the visitor had a couple of tickets for Jones' Road on that Sunday. According to the Parliamentary Secretary he is not to use the tickets.  Is he then to hand them back to his friend? If we could be told what the person who makes that discovery at 12 o'clock <Col N="567" /> on Sunday&mdash;that he has visited a diphtheria patient on the night before&mdash;is to do, then we might be able to make some headway: whether, for example, such a person would have to be told by a medical practitioner that he was a probable source of infection or otherwise. These are some of the things that Deputy Dockrell and other speakers are anxious to get information on.  As it is, we are discussing the question in a kind of vacuum.</P>

      <P>Must he then take every precaution comprised in the Second Schedule?  Under it he may have to submit himself for inspection for a blood test.  There may also be inoculations and injections, and these can be done forcibly.</P>

      <P>Well, take paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule, which requires &ldquo;adult persons to submit themselves, or the parents of children to submit such children, to a specified treatment in order either (a) to protect or immunise such adult persons or children against a particular infectious disease, or (b) to prevent such adult <Col N="569" /> persons or children from infecting others with a particular infectious disease&rdquo;.  Is not that an injection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further amendment that prohibits the carrying out of treatment without the consent of the patient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then may I take it that it would not be an offence for a person, who knows that he is affected, if he refuses to submit himself to inoculation? I take it that such a person would not be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is no amendment to the Second Schedule such as he suggests.  The Minister's amendment proposes to delete paragraph 3 and substitute the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.  The requiring of adult persons to submit themselves, or the parents of children to submit such children, to specified measures in relation to the protection or immunisation of such adult persons or children against a particular infectious disease.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  The power to compel such immunisation, which paragraph 3 gave to the Minister, has been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="570" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What immunisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about immunisation, and not preventative treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Second Schedule, as amended, paragraph 3 would be removed, but certain other things will be required under the new paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, a person who is suspected of having an infectious disease will be subjected to the court for determination as to whether he has that disease or not, and it would appear that there may be a regulation requiring this adult person to submit himself to immunisation.  What exactly does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is found to be a source of infection, he may be subject to immunisation, but there is no offence committed if he is not aware that he is a source of infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that may be, but what precautions can such a person take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The precautions must be set out and must be laid on the Table of the House.  They will be provided for by regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know.  We will get this thing clear, even if we have to wait a long time for it.  We have certain powers provided under Section 20, and under Schedule 2 we have this provision as to the requiring of adult persons, and so on, to submit themselves to immunisation.  Does that mean that a person who is a probable source of infection may never be required to submit himself to immunisation? At any rate, is there to be any question of compulsion in regard to inoculation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, absolutely; there is no question about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, one precaution is that a person must submit himself to inoculation although he hates the thought of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good&mdash;I got that clear at last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It was clear from the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was so clear from the start that the Parliamentary Secretary himself seemed to be perplexed about the thing.  Now, at times, medical opinion may not be unanimous on a matter of this kind.  You often have conflicting medical opinions in connection with claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act, for instance. The applicant for compensation may be advised by one doctor against taking action, while another doctor might advise him to take action, but the man will not be subject to a penalty in any case, whereas in this case it would appear that if a man is presumed to be guilty of an offence he can be fined, and that can be done time after time. Is it a fact that a man can be bled time after time in the matter of fines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That £50 fine was contained in the regulations of 1929, and I think Deputy Mulcahy could tell the Deputy something about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but 1929 was 17 years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go back over 17 years, but the Parlimentary Secretary has not impressed himself <Col N="572" /> very much on the House in these 17 years.  Various people may be affected by these diseases, and they are going to be subjected to fines and penalties if they do not submit themselves for examination, although they may not be aware that they are suffering from the disease.  I think it was Deputy Dockrell who raised the question that a person may be brought to court, found guilty of an offence and fined, if he does not take &ldquo;every other precaution&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Yes, but &ldquo;every other precaution&rdquo; is mentioned.  There may be several precautions laid down&mdash; a first, a second, a third, a fourth or a fifth precaution&mdash;but if he does not take another precaution, not specified, he may be found guilty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we all know that doctors may disagree, but suppose that in this case he takes every precaution that is laid down, but not the &ldquo;other precaution&rdquo;, which the court might consider he should have taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <P>What is proposed here is that the court must decide, and what I mean is that I cannot understand why we should have this phrase &ldquo;such other reasonable precautions&rdquo;.</P>
