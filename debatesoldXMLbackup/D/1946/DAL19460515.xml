      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will make representations to the British Government, on behalf of Irish citizens who are at present detained in English prisons for alleged political offences, with a view to securing their immediate release, having regard to the fact that the emergency in both countries is now ended.</P>

      <P>I am aware that motor spirit retailers have frequently been short of supplies whilst awaiting delivery of replenishment stocks from the oil distributing companies.  This is due to a variety of causes of which the most important is insufficient transport provided by oil companies for the distribution of supplies.  It is anticipated, however, that additional vehicles will be in use in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to a report of a statement that there might be a further scarcity of drapery goods and higher prices before the drapery trade could return to normal conditions; if this information accurately represents the position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>While it is difficult to forecast the future supply position, which depends to a large extent on factors outside our control, I have no reason to think that the improvement in supplies of textiles which has taken place over the past 12 months will not be maintained.  There are grounds for assuming a substantial improvement in regard to woollen and worsted materials before the end of the present year.  The position regarding rayon piece goods is similar, but there are less favourable prospects in regard to cotton goods although some improvement in the present position may be expected.</P>
      <P>As regards prices, I refer the Deputy to a reply given to a question on the 1st instant.  I said then that while some lowering of manufacturing costs in this country is to be assumed, as increased supplies of materials become available, there can be no substantial change in clothing prices unless and until the cost of imported materials falls.  I do not anticipate, however, that the cost of imported materials will increase.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in the Dáil on a recent occasion, the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1946, provides for the continuance for a further period up to the 1st April, 1947, of the provisions of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, which enable grants to be paid to private persons in rural areas and public utility societies in all areas towards the cost of erecting new houses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether it is a fact that all contracts for supplies valued at £5 or over must be advertised, and, if so, why this practice is not followed by certain local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a fact that local authorities must advertise all contracts for supplies of £5 and over.</P>
      <P>Under the Public Health Act, 1878 (Section 201), tenders must be invited for any contract of £100 or over under that Act.  Under the Commissioners Clauses Act, 1847, which applies in urban districts and towns under town commissioners, tenders must be invited for contracts of £100 or upwards. Under the Housing Act, 1931, tenders must be invited for contracts of £100 and over under that Act.  Under the Agriculture Act, 1931, £100 is the limit for contracts entered into by county committees of agriculture.  A limit of £50 is prescribed in the case of vocational education committees by the Vocational Education (Contracts) Regulations, 1931.</P>
      <P>It will be borne in mind that a considerable part of the supplies required by local authorities is obtained from official contractors through the combined purchasing machinery operated by my Department.  The Minister gives public notice when he will receive applications from persons desirous of being appointed official contractors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The scale of prices payable by the British Ministry of Food during the current season, i.e., year ending 30th June, 1946, for British home-produced cattle ranges from 84/6 per live cwt. for animals of super-special grade killing out at 59 per cent. and over, to 52/- per live cwt. for animals killing out at 50 per cent.  The prices vary according to the season, the period of lowest prices being from the 1st October to the 11th November and the period of highest prices being from the 3rd June to the 30th June.</P>
      <P>According to a recent announcement by the British Departments concerned, the prices for the different grades of British produced cattle will be increased for the 12 months beginning 1st July, 1946, by amounts varying from 4/- per live cwt. in case of animals with a killing-out percentage of 59 to 2/-per live cwt. in case of animals with a killing-out percentage of 52.</P>
      <P>For the current period the prices of imported cattle sold for slaughter after being two months in the United Kingdom were fixed at 5/- per live cwt. less than the prices of British produced animals of corresponding grades and classes.  Inquiries have been instituted in regard to the differential for the period commencing on the 1st July next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For Irish fat cattle imported into Great Britain during the current period for immediate slaughter the prices per <Col N="9" /> lb. dressed carcase weight vary according to quality and time of sale, the extremes being 7d. for B quality cows and cow heifers from 8th October to 18th November, 1945, and 12½d. for A quality steers and heifers from 3rd to 30th June, 1946.

Does he realise that the position is now favourable and that we are selling in a seller's market and that for that reason every effort should be made by him to have that differential removed and to make use of the people who are anxious &mdash; the farmers on the other side who are buying Irish stores &mdash; to have that differential removed?</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Liffey, in common with other rivers, has experienced a poor run of salmon during the past two seasons, with consequent reduction of the earnings of persons engaged in netting for that fish.  As, however, the salmon running during that period would be the progeny of fish which had ascended the river some time before the Liffey water and hydro-electric schemes came into operation, any reduction in their numbers as compared with the runs of previous years must be attributed to causes other than the working of these schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved to report progress on last Thursday I had mentioned to the Minister the comparative calorific values of turf and coal.  I want to refer the Minister to Volume 99, No. 11, col. 1342 of the Debates for February, 1946, where the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave the calorific value of machinewon turf raised at Clonsast as being 6,314 British thermal units per pound, the turf having a moisture content of roughly 30 per cent.  The same Minister gave the calorific value of the coal which had been supplied to the Electricity Supply Board before the war as being between 11,500 and 12,000 British thermal units per pound.  I want to emphasise to the House that the figure for turf, 6,314 British thermal units, was based on machine-won turf with a moisture content of 30 per cent., in other words, on turf raised and dried under the most favourable conditions.  I submit that that figure would be altogether inadequate for air-dried or hand-won turf.  If we take into consideration <Col N="17" /> the added moisture content resulting from hand-won turf being left in merchants' yards under the weather, without shelter or protection of any kind, it is a safe assumption that the moisture content of the turf at present being sold in Dublin would be considerably in excess of 50 per cent.  So that, even accepting the Minister's figures and relating them to the type of turf on sale in the city at the present time, it is a safe assumption that it would take three tons of that turf to equal in calorific value of one ton of the coal described by the Minister.  I am not accepting the Minister's figures for coal because I believe the Minister's figures for coal were based on coal which had been open to weather conditions.  The figures which I obtained from an independent expert, for Irish anthracite coal, vary from 11,550 British thermal units per pound to as high a figure as 17,070 British thermal units per pound.  Here again I think it is safe to infer that the householder in Dublin is being compelled to use three tons of turf in order to have the equivalent of one ton of pre-war household fuel, coal. I mention that fact because the Minister seemed to challenge the assertion I made on the last occasion, that it would take three tons of turf to equal one ton of coal.  I still adhere to that and I should welcome any figures which the Minister has in his possession to disabuse my mind on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on the question of turf and coal, I should like to make a plea to the Minister to give better and bigger encouragement to mineral enterprise and development.  I should like to support the view put forward, particularly by Deputy Roddy, on this matter.  I think that £10,000 is a miserable subsidy if it is to be regarded, in any sense, as an encouragement to coal mining.  I have in mind an area in my own constituency which has not yet been prospected.  The mineral rights of a large part of that area are vested in the tenant-farmers.  The area covers, roughly, Coolraheen, Uskerty, Baurnafea, Castlewarden and Johns-well. It is the southern fringe of the Leinster coalfield.  Expert opinion inclines to the view that there is coal <Col N="18" /> beneath the surface there which is a continuation of the coal contained in the Castlecomer coalfield.  The farmers, and indeed the workers, of that territory are interested to see some enterprise set going there in order that the area may be properly prospected and that, eventually, coal may be raised. Expert opinion is that there is coal to be found there about 300 feet down &mdash; coal of as good quality as the Castlecomer anthracite coal.</P>
    <P>If the tenant-farmers or the business people of that area get together to form a company or co-operative enterprise to develop that coalfield, I should like to see the State give some assistance to such enterprise.  I think that it would be a sound economic proposition, but if the local people were to attempt it, they would need some State subsidy.  It is possible that other interests may step in and take the matter up as a business proposition.  I should prefer to see local people develop the area without the intervention of outsiders, so that it would be a purely local industry.  I ask the Minister to consider the question of increasing the amount which he is setting aside &mdash; £10,000 &mdash; to enable encouragement to be given to people in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Last day I tried to picture the financial, social, and economic background upon which this Budget is based.  Again, I want to emphasise that the Budget is not an encouragement either to agriculture or industry. There is nothing in this Budget to show that the Government have yet decided what is to be their long-term policy in either agriculture or industry. There is nothing to indicate that the Government have yet made up their minds as to how they are to attempt to increase employment in agriculture and industry.  On the contrary, the transitional development fund would suggest that we are to continue subsidising certain developments here which, in my opinion, touch only the fringe of our economic problem.  The big task is to increase the gross volume of agricultural production. Despite all our efforts during the war and despite all the paeans of praise of <Col N="19" /> the Government we have heard owing to the increased effort during the war, the net result is that we are producing a lesser volume of agricultural goods, and have actually less agricultural produce to consume to-day than we produced or had at our disposal pre-war.</P>
    <P>The big task of the Government is to embark on a policy which will bring back our people into production in agriculture and give us increased production in the years to come.  I do not know whether the Government have decided to confine their agricultural activities to producing for the home market or whether, even now, they visualise a production which will not only cater for the home market but restore our agricultural exports to what they were ten or 20 years ago.  This document furnishes no evidence that the Government have given any consideration to the matter.</P>
    <P>As regards industry, while certain reliefs are being given, again, there is no indication of that basic encouragement which is needed to get industry going on the scale, apparently, visualised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We have set out in the Budget, as, apparently, a creditable performance for the war period, an increase in savings of about £148,000,000 under all headings.  I do not regard that as a healthy sign.  I regard it as a symptom of forced saving.  I think it discloses that there was no outlet for investment during the war years and that money was left lying in the commercial banks and post office savings bank and in savings certificates.  At the moment, at least, the public are content to take a low rate of bank interest&mdash;1 per cent.&mdash;rather than risk their money in profitable Irish industry or agriculture.  It was axiomatic in the old days, whatever view may be taken of it now, that an increase of bank deposits at any time might indicate many things.  It might indicate political insecurity, economic insecurity, lack of enterprise and lack of sufficient confidence to put money into home industries. If the people are content to allow the banks to take this money and use it for them, it is a deplorable <Col N="20" /> situation and that is why I put it to the Minister that a definite step must be taken by the Government to give a directive to the people, so that they will be encouraged to place their money, not on deposit in the banks at a low rate of interest, but in stable, secure industries which will give them a far greater reward.  It is not at all a good sign that the money is lying there and the problem for the Government will be to ensure that this money is realised at the earliest possible date for investment at home.</P>
    <P>As far as I can read the figures of the National Income and Expenditure Table, there is an indication that already our investments abroad are resuming their pre-war appearance, that there is a tendency towards increasing our investments abroad and that the same old policy is going to operate again&mdash;that Irish industry and agriculture are being starved for want of capital moneys and that our people are content to leave their moneys to be invested abroad by the banks.  That is a drift or tendency which should be checked by Government policy.  Every other country has been tackling this problem on a national basis and I think we are approaching a period here in our national development when we must tackle this problem on the basis of the best policy for the nation, the State and the people as a whole.  In other words, I strongly advocate some directive by way of propaganda to encourage our people to turn their minds to problems of this kind.  I do not suggest control by way of interference by the State in the freedom of investment. The propaganda I suggest would enable our people to see ahead what is a good security and a good investment. instead of being content to allow their moneys to lie idle, as far as they are concerned, in the banks.</P>
    <P>The only healthy sign I see at the moment in our international situation is that there has been a good increase in our export position and that we are able to import some goods.  The surplus of imports over exports at present is about £5½ millions.  At the same time we find that our sterling assets in 1945 have been added to to the extent of £35½ million.  Whilst the Minister <Col N="21" /> says that the increase in our sterling assets abroad was due to no deliberate policy of the Government and was inevitable in the circumstances of the war period, nevertheless we find, in the year when the war has ended, that £35,000,000 has been added to the sterling balances abroad.  I do not want to go into the question of sterling balances, beyond suggesting to the Minister that it is inadvisable to add to the amount of our sterling assets in present circumstances, when there is no definite view that those assets may not, in certain circumstances, be frozen or lost altogether.  Undoubtedly, we cannot look forward at the moment to any considerable release there for some years and certainly not until the situation created by the American loan has been put right.  There again, the whole problem is tied up with the question of trading in the sterling area as against the dollar area and our Commonwealth position.</P>
    <P>Whilst Deputy Moran may cast sneers at Deputy McGilligan for raising these matters in the House and accuse him of having turned his back, more or less, on the Party's policy in this matter, is it not right and proper, when this situation has arisen, whether through any deliberate policy on the part of the Government or through any external events over which we have no control, that this matter should be fully debated in the House, so that the best interests of the country may be considered and served?  It is only in that spirit that we on this side of the House raise these matters. We are not raising them for political reasons or for the purpose of causing any embarrassment to the Government; but we do definitely want to indicate the necessity for moving cautiously in our external policy.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I put again the picture I tried to put on the last day? Our farmers have carried on by starving their farms for machinery, fertilisers, agricultural equipment and capital of all kinds.  They have been able to carry on by drawing on the family resources rather than by putting in extra labour; they have been working day and night, exhausting their energies to bring us through the <Col N="22" /> war period.  If, as a result of those activities of the farmer and his family, the farmer has shown some little extra prosperity, that extra prosperity is fictitious.  Whatever he has been able to put by he will have to put into his farm in the very near future in the form of fertilisers, machinery, buildings, electric power and all sorts of capital formation and investment.  It seems doubtful, on reading these tables, if the savings which he has been forced to make during the war period will be sufficient to enable him to do the job when materials and supplies become available.</P>
    <P>In the same way, the industrialist who has been able to put a certain amount by, by way of reserve, faced with the problem of new buildings at considerably greater cost than pre-war, new machinery or renovating old machinery at considerably greater cost than pre-war, will find that whatever he has been able to put by will inevitably have to go back in capital formation and investment in the near future.  Therefore, it is not exactly correct to say that the country is prosperous. If anything, the country is poorer by reason of the war and has nothing to its credit at the moment, except these very doubtful external assets, the realisation of which in our favour will depend entirely on events which are external to ourselves.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I respectfully submit that the Minister will have to go very cautiously during the coming year to ensure that expenditure is kept within some reasonable volume and that the demands of Ministers for new developments will be curbed to the utmost. Then, next year he may be able to go further and give greater relief both to agriculture and to industry.  As regards agriculture, we on this side of the House hope that he will be able to take the further step next year of giving total derating as a relief to the agriculturist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to begin by complimenting the Minister on the astuteness of his budgeting.  He has succeeded in administering a very large pill to the unfortunate taxpayer, but has also succeeded in putting such <Col N="23" /> a very nice coating of sugar on it by way of relief that the taxpayer apparently has swallowed the pill and is almost enjoying it.  The only proposal in the Budget with which I propose to deal is the increase in the grant for relief of rates on agricultural land.  That was a very welcome £1,000,000 and a very necessary one, but what is even more welcome to me is the change in the method of allocating the grant.  The method which had been in operation under the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1939 was both cumbersome and very expensive to the rating authorities.</P>
      <P>May I say that I think the Minister has followed me in this matter?  I think I suggested on the Committee Stage of the Local Government Bill a scheme for allocating the agricultural grant very similar to the scheme the Minister has now proposed.  Indeed half of his proposal is identical to mine.  That is with regard to relief on what is called in the 1939 Act the specific valuation&mdash; the total valuation where it does not exceed £20 or the first £20 where the valuation of the land exceeds £20.  I suggested that that should be derated to the extent of three-fifths, as does the Minister, and I went on to suggest that where the valuation exceeds £20, the excess should be derated to the extend of two-fifths.  I am sorry the Minister has not followed my recommendation in that direction.  I do not think his proposal in regard to the excess over £20 is a very sound one. His proposal is to give a relief of one-fifth of the general rate on that part of the valuation above £20 and to give also an employment grant.  I should like to quote what the Minister said in regard to this proposal:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I propose to use £1,000,000 ... towards enabling farmers of over £20 valuation to increase the wages of their workers and to give complementary benefits to farmers of smaller valuations, utilising for these purposes the machinery of the local rating authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the use of the word &ldquo;complementary&rdquo; is rather misleading because, if the Minister does intend the employment grant to be <Col N="24" /> passed on by the employer to his worker, I cannot quite see how the other part of the grant is in any way complementary because the employment grant will not remain in the farmer's pocket.  He will certainly get the grant but, having received it with one hand, he will pay it out with the other.  He did not indicate that he was giving a headline which he hoped the farmers would follow or whether it was intended by the Government to implement this principle by calling a meeting of the Agricultural Wages Board which would give an increase of 2/6 per week per head to workers.  Two and sixpence per week works out at £6 10s. 0d. per head per annum which is the figure the Minister gives.  I suggest that if the Minister's advice is acted on with regard to the employment grant, or if the Government sees it is acted on, then the employment grant is not a rates relief at all.  What will happen in effect is that the farmer will pay part of his rates to the local authority and part of his rates to his employees.  I am not suggesting that the employees do not deserve the highest wages possible but I think that the Minister is going rather far in suggesting he is giving farmers an extra £1,000,000 and then carefully earmarking some of it to be passed on to the employees.  He is making the best of both worlds in that respect.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister further as to what is to happen at the end of two years when he foreshadows this employment grant will disappear. He was rather vague about it except in so far as he made it clear it would come to an end.  I could not quite follow whether it is his intention to maintain the agricultural grant at the new figure and possibly change the fractions which he is giving &mdash; that is, the three-fifths and the one-fifth.  If he does intend to do away with the employment grant and decrease the agricultural grant which he makes from the Exchequer, I suggest that a very difficult situation will arise.  The Minister is perfectly well aware that it is one thing to increase wages but it is a very different thing, when you reach a certain point, to try to decrease them. What will happen in two years when <Col N="25" /> the Minister wipes out the employment grant and reduces the agricultural grant will be that the farmer will suddenly have to pay an increase in rates while continuing to pay his employees the increased rates of wages.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a concrete example just to draw attention to the effect of the abolition of the employment grant.  It is a personal one in a way.  The only way in which I can be sure of my figures is to give the facts as they apply to myself and I think that these conditions will be found to be fairly general.  I employ four men, which means that my employment grant under the Minister's proposal will be £26.  On the face of it, the relief in rates will mean to me in this year a net drop in the rates I have to pay of £20.  If, however, I have to pay £26 as an increase of wages to my four employees, the net effect will be that my rates will be increased by £6.  Yet the Minister stated that no occupier will have to pay more rates this year in respect of agricultural land than he would have had to pay had the new scheme not been brought into operation. The Minister means by that, I take it, that he is assuming that the farmer will stick to the employment grant and not pass it on to his employees, but I suggest that if the farmer takes the Minister's advice and hands the grant on to the employees, he will be worse off than previously. He will have more rates to pay.</P>
    <P>I suggest that before he introduces, as he probably intends to do, an amending Bill to the 1939 Act, he should re-examine this matter.  I further suggest to him that the proposal I made in respect of the excess over £20, namely, to derate two-fifths of the valuation over that amount, would cost the Exchequer less money and would be more satisfactory from the ratepayers' point of view.  I do not intend to dwell at any greater length on this matter now, because I think the amending Bill which the Minister foreshadows in his statement would afford a more suitable occasion for dealing with it.  When the details of the Bill are before the House it will be easier to go into the exact implications of the <Col N="26" /> proposal.  I should just like in closing to congratulate the Minister on a very successful piece of financial dental surgery.  He has succeeded in performing a major extraction by the judicious use of reliefs as an anaesthetic.  As far as I can judge by the reaction of the public, the state of anaesthesia is so blissful that the public is wholly unaware that the extraction is greater than ever it was before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be denied that this measure of relief constitutes a new departure so far as a Fianna Fáil Minister is concerned.  It is the first time in a long number of years that there has been a reduction in the incidence of taxation.  Let us be thankful in that respect but, so far as aggregate taxation is concerned, the net will sweep a further £3,000,000 into the Exchequer in the coming financial year.  So far as economies are concerned, the Minister has made no effort whatever to economise or to pull down in any way the huge burden of taxation resting on this small community. We had Ministers for Finance during the emergency all pleading that emergency conditions were responsible for the very heavy burden that was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor promised on the last occasion that he spoke in this House that, immediately the emergency was over, it would be the responsibility of himself as Minister for Finance and of the Government to ensure that there would be substantial relief in taxation.  The only relief that has accrued has accrued because the yield from taxation, under the various headings, has increased substantially, leaving the Minister with a substantial margin, and, I admit, he is just making use of that margin to give reliefs in various directions.  But, so far as the burden of taxation is concerned, it is increased, and will be increased by £3,000,000.  Customs, which last year yielded £12,933,000, will this year yield £15,400,000.  Remember, that when we talk about customs duties they are an indirect form of taxation on consumer goods, and that they affect every individual in the State for that reason.  One would expect that a Minister <Col N="27" /> concerned with the cost of living and with easing the burdens on the people of this country would make some effort to ease their burdens.  In the case of excise duties, there is an anticipated increase from £9,810,000 to £10,200,000, plus the £740,000 increase in the duties on spirits and wines. There is an anticipated increase as regards estate duties, stamp duties and from income-tax.  Notwithstanding the reduction of 1/- in the £, it is anticipated that the yield from income-tax will be approximately the same as in the last financial year.  In the case of motor duties, with more motors on the road, there is a substantial increase from £926,000 to £1,150,000.</P>
    <P>There is no reduction whatever in the vast scale of State intervention and State control.  There is no attempt, over the whole range of Government activities, at easing the very severe burdens that the people have to carry. The country has now to provide for more than 33,000 civil servants, at a cost of over £8,000,000 a year.  One would expect that in the post-war period some effort would be made to provide a more efficient civil service, and to get away from the system of having files streaming up from the various departments to the bosses to give executive decisions.  One would expect that a responsible Minister for the Finance and the Government would make some effort to spread executive responsibility with a view to reducing, so far as the taxpaying community is concerned, this intolerable burden of administration which is overloaded at the top.  Surely, the Minister and the country ought to realise that, so far as production is concerned, it has been completely stagnant for many years, and that burdens of the type I speak of, which are piled on by the Government, are making it more difficult for production to recover.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about, and gives a good deal of lip service to, private enterprise, but private enterprise is hampered, to a very great extent, by the policy of the Government.  When the Minister does give relief in the incidence of taxation, he makes no effort to ensure that this relief will be <Col N="28" /> ploughed back into industry.  I have been impressed myself by the figure relating to the yield from income-tax &mdash; that, notwithstanding the substantial reduction of 1/- in the £, income remains buoyant.  I believe that is due to the fact that there is a very substantial number of people in this country who are getting away with exorbitant profits, with profits that are not justified in our circumstances.  That is deliberately encouraged by the Government, and by Government policy, to ensure that there will be a substantial rake off so far as the Minister for Finance is concerned.  I think the figures given in the various tables that have been circulated clearly show that it is Government policy to encourage that.  As a matter of fact, the price-fixing arrangement of the Department of Industry and Commerce would lead anybody to believe that it is Government policy, because if one examines the prices that have been fixed for the essentials of life and if one makes some inquiry as to the actual cost of production, one will find that there is a very substantial margin left over and above what the manufacturer is entitled to do.</P>
    <P>I will give one or two instances.  I understand that socks can be produced here at 1/6, and yet the Government fixed price is 2/11, leaving a margin of 1/5, which is divided between the manufacturer and the Government. In that case the Government gets a rake off.  Take marmalade.  The fixed price is 2/6.  I understand, and I am satisfied, that it can be produced at about 1/9.  That is the sort of policy that is being operated in the country, in a country where only 190,000 people out of a total population of 3,000,000 people have an income of over £3 a week.  These figures are taken from the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure.  The Government's only concern is to get the rake-in in taxation, to ensure that it will have enough largesse to distribute again to our people in the way of subsidies and relief: boot subsidies, milk subsidies and that sort of thing.  Surely, nobody can deny that it ought to be the policy of this State to ensure that the incomes of the people are sufficient to enable <Col N="29" /> them to live independent of State subsidies, and not to degrade them into a situation where they will have to go begging to the State for their existence. It may be politically advantageous to pursue a policy of that sort, but it is degrading and demoralising so far as the nation is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reverse engines so far as that policy is concerned and to reduce the burdens of taxation, the burdens that have to be carried by industry and agriculture, and by so doing to encourage both agriculture and industry to pay higher wages and higher salaries to the operatives employed in both. While, as I say, enormous profits are being made, and while the Minister is giving certain reliefs, he has suggested no scheme to ensure that the reliefs that will accrue from this £1,200,000 will be ploughed back into industry.  It should be his concern to see that the people generally would benefit from a scheme of that sort rather than the few individuals who will get the relief and put the profit in their own pockets.  I think that he could have taken a leaf out of the book of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer who is ensuring that a substantial portion of the reliefs that he has given will be ploughed back, and that the industrialists of Great Britain are going to be induced to put more capital into industry with a view to getting greater benefits for the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not very concerned about the poor or the old age pensioners.  It is true that, in the non-turf counties, they are getting relief to the extent of 10/- a ton in the price of turf.  That will be welcomed by them.  So far as sugar is concerned, they are going to get relief to the extent of 1d. in the lb.  It is not very much.  In the case of the average family it will mean about 2½d., so that they will be able to buy a stamp to write to the son who was sent across to work in England.</P>
    <P>There have been references to emigration and to some extraordinary figures which have been given by the Minister.  It has been contended by <Col N="30" /> certain Deputies that the figures cannot be related to figures from other sources, for instance, figures given in reply to Parliamentary questions put to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. As regards the figures the Minister has given dealing with the traffic in and out, we can understand that at times early in the war a good many mothers and children were driven to seek shelter in this country. The Minister did not attempt to deny that the problem in relation to emigration was alarming.  The people who prepared this very useful book on national income and expenditure made reference to it on page 46:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Principally on account of the safety valve of emigration this country has had a relatively favourable unemployment experience during the emergency though, in fact, this favourable position did not approach that in belligerent countries, where unemployment practically vanished. The situation has been mitigated also by recruiting in the Defence Forces.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to add to this an extraordinary aspect of our unemployment problem.  In our primary industry during the emergency the number of male workers employed on the land, according to statistics, fell by 11,000. That seems an extraordinary situation in a most favourable period, the war period, so far as our primary industry is concerned.  It is remarkable to learn that there were 11,000 less people on the land.  That is a definite indication as to stagnation in production.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to our capital resources.  He said that the total liquid resources of the public now stand at £299.6 million, showing an increase of £148.3 million.  It is rather interesting to read the observations of the people who prepared this book on national income and expenditure.  On page 29 the following appears:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the figure of £24,000,000 for 1938 be regarded as &lsquo;normal&rsquo; there has clearly been a considerable falling off in capital formation, as defined, during the emergency period. The average during the years 1942-1944 indicates a deficiency of <Col N="31" /> £15,000,000 per annum at 1938 prices ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the deficiency of capital formation since 1942.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... or more than £20,000,000 per annum at present day prices.  The deficiency over the whole period would seem to be of the order of £100,000,000 at present day prices. No doubt, it would be possible to dispense with some of the capital goods or works as defined for the purpose of the table.  It is important also to bear in mind that this figure is based on the pre-war quantum of capital formation.  Any acceleration of the rate of increase will increase the figure <i>pro tanto.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next paragraph is important:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These figures, accordingly, set in a new perspective the value of the forced savings of this State during the war.  It is doubtful if these savings will suffice to make good the capital deficiency which has piled up during the war years, let alone provide for more intensive capitalisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have nothing to boast about.  We are worse off than before the war. When we talk about the increase in national expenditure, as explained in this book, from £154,000,000 to £252,000,000, it is simply an indication of the inflation that has occurred.  So far as real wealth and real prosperity are concerned, there is no increase and, as to any accumulation of capital that has occurred, the experts who prepared this book give it as their opinion that as regards our arrears in capital formation and capital equipment in machinery for industry and for agriculture, whatever amount we have accumulated will be scarcely sufficient to make them good.  We have to make good worn-out machinery for transport, for ordinary industry and for agriculture. That clearly shows that our financial position is not one that we can boast about.  As a matter of fact, now that we have reached the post-war period, we are facing world competition in external markets and in the coming years we shall have to be on our toes; we shall have to be thoroughly <Col N="32" /> efficient.  It is necessary for Deputies to know what plans are being prepared to ensure that there will be an expansion in production.  It seems extraordinary, notwithstanding the sweat and toil put into agricultural production during the emergency, that our production has remained practically stagnant.  We cannot overlook the fact that there has been a substantial decrease in the fertility of the soil. There is one extraordinary feature of this book on National Income and Expenditure.  Running through every page are references to stagnation in production.  There is little or no resiliency and, during a very favourable period, this agricultural country has had an extraordinarily stagnant production.</P>
    <P>The basic weakness in our economy, I venture to suggest, is that, under this administration, we have been unable in recent years to reach the level of production that was reached in 1929 under the administration of the late Mr. Paddy Hogan.  The whole future of our people, our standard of living, and the prosperity of the country, depend on our capacity to expand production.  We shall have to export either of two things, goods or men.  I am sure every Irishman believes it is better that we should keep our greatest asset, our man-power, at home and export the goods.  I expect some effort to be made by the Government to ensure that the potential that is there for production is retained.  Every effort should be made so as to ensure that production on the land will be intensified.</P>
    <P>A peculiar feature in this country is the low output per man.  There have been discussions about agricultural wages.  As an agriculturist, I am most anxious to see that the people who rely on agriculture for a living should get a fair income, an income adequate to maintain a man and his wife and family on a decent living standard.  Within the last week or so the British Agricultural Wages Board fixed a minimum wage of £4 per week.  The wages in England range from £4 10s. to £5.  Our minimum wage is £2.  That substantial difference in wages between this country and Great Britain is a menace to the security of this country.  Any keen, <Col N="33" /> energetic young fellow who is aware that 100 per cent more in wages can be obtained on the other side will be very anxious to quit.  But for the fact that there is a prohibition against travel, I believe we would be stripped of our man-power.  This Parliament has to face that problem.  We must solve it and we must see that the agricultural worker here has an income approximating to that paid in the country lying alongside us.  It is a difficult problem, but it must be tackled.  I am sure the Minister is keenly interested in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have referred to low output.  I submit that so far as man output in agriculture here is concerned, it is at least 25 per cent. lower than the output on the other side.  While that is so there will be a big differentiation because farmers cannot afford to pay a wage at all approximating to that paid on the other side.  These are matters which require the closest attention, and the most careful planning because, I submit, we have not attempted to organise agriculture according to modern ideas and on modern lines.  The low output per man in this country is not due to laziness or inefficiency on the part of the agricultural worker, but to lack of technical knowledge on the part of the farming community, as well as lack of modern equipment and the necessary capital to ensure that agriculture is fully capitalised.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have spent nearly enough on agricultural education, and I do not think we are giving our people the right kind of education to equip them to become efficient farmers. We have spent little or nothing on research.  The Minister referred to research in industry and is providing a miserable £10,000 for mining operations and so on.  What good is that? What have we provided in the way of research for the primary industry? What have we provided for soil research, for grass research, for plant biology and pathology and for animal research?  We are doing nothing in that respect.  What we are doing is simply adopting the results of experiments carried out in other countries and trying to apply them to our <Col N="34" /> conditions, which may be completely different from those in the countries in which the experiments were carried out.</P>
    <P>We grow Swedish wheat because Sweden and Swedish conditions are somewhat like ours, but we have provided no finance to ensure the production in this country of a wheat suited to the conditions here.  In other countries, the problem with regard to wheat growing is to produce wheat under dry conditions.  They want a wheat which can withstand a drought, but we want a wheat which will do well with a maximum intake of water and little or no sunshine &mdash; a completely different type of wheat.  Is it not obvious to any man who has studied the problem of organising agriculture in an efficient way that we must have scientific assistance?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister what great advantage even the type of advisory service we have is to the average farmer, and is he now prepared, as a farmer, to provide substantial sums of money and to invest in the primary industry sufficient capital to ensure the organisation of agriculture according to modern ideas, or do we simply intend to continue to allow every individual, by a system of trial and error&mdash;and mainly error &mdash; to determine what is best for his conditions?  Surely that is a matter for the State and surely it is the root cause of the fact that we have a stagnant agriculture?  It is not the fault of the individual farmer; it is due to his lack of education, and his lack of technical knowledge, and to our failure to provide the necessary research to ensure that the plants we grow and the animals we rear are the best in our circumstances and the type required so far as the people who purchase these animals from us are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have pressed the Minister since I came into the House for a proper soil service and I am pleased to say that I have made some impression.  Anyone who attended the Show last week and who saw the Department's educational exhibits there, who saw the beginning that has been made in the matter of a soil service, will appreciate that my efforts have met with some success. Exhibited there were soil profiles and <Col N="35" /> much useful information was being given to visitors.  The people in charge of the stand were very busy answering the inquiries of all sorts of farmers. How many farmers are there who, although good husbandmen and exceptionally good tillers, can never, because of the condition of and deficiencies in their soil, hope to get good results?</P>
    <P>We here are spending money lavishly &mdash;slinging it down the drain very often &mdash;and creating a situation in which the majority of our people are dependent on State subsidies of one sort or another, instead of facing up to the situation in a courageous way and saying: &ldquo;We are not going to have any more of these subsidies, except for the minimum of social services necessary&rdquo;. I have listened to Deputies asking for more and more social services.  I do not want social services, but I want conditions in this country which will give every worker an opportunity of earning a decent income.  If it can be done in other countries, we have the intelligence and the capacity to do it here.  I have no doubt about that, so far as scientists are concerned.  We have men here capable of dealing with these matters I refer to who are second to none.  Why are they not used and why is this House not asked to provide the capital necessary to finance the brains and the organisation we could have here but for the fact that we have refused to provide the necessary capital?</P>
    <P>The sooner the House faces up to the problems which are there, to the opportunity which is there for us, to our capacity, to our potential, in the matter of production, to our circumstances and our climatic conditions, the better.  If we did so, we could expand our production by, on a moderate basis, 40 or 50 per cent.  Do we intend to neglect that?  Do we intend to continue to operate a servile State here, in which we have a lot of beggars seeking to feed out of the Taoiseach's hand, from whom, from a political point of view, the maximum number of votes can be got, or does Fianna Fáil intend to say: &ldquo;We are going to make our people independent and to do our best to provide the organisation necessary <Col N="36" /> to ensure that our people get an opportunity of earning decent incomes&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I have noticed changes in some of our Ministers &mdash; in the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for example. For too long he stood for any sort of mushroom growth, and I am glad that he has developed a new outlook and now says that we must have efficiency. It is about time we adopted that policy.  We want industry because the surplus of the people in rural Ireland, if they are to remain at home, can only be absorbed by industry. There is no primary producer in the world to-day who is prepared to produce and to take a gamble on the sale of his produce.  For too long were agriculturists asked to produce and to stack up their goods on the quays in Dublin to be bought by any fellow who liked to buy at any price.</P>
    <P>That day is gone, and it is one of the reasons for which I am pressing the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance to take part in the deliberations and the conferences on production which are taking place. There are the F.A.O. and other conferences dealing with production and trade and this is one of the few countries which has a very substantial surplus.  Our potential is much greater than any other country's, but we are utterly and completely indifferent to the plans and deliberations of other countries in the matter of production, the allocation and distribution of food and ensuring that the primary producer gets a fair margin.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has thought about this question of cut-throat competition and how it can be eliminated, and how we can prevent mankind from abusing nature and destroying fertility, as happened in the middle-western States of America and other countries, realises that it is these abuses which have driven these countries into a policy of self-sufficiency.  We have adopted the policy of self-sufficiency but many experts who have thought about it have condemned it.  The late Pope condemned what he termed exaggerated nationalism.  He said it was obvious that God intended trade and commerce to take place and that nations should exchange their surpluses with each <Col N="37" /> other, and I suggest that, if statesmen all over the world are to ensure a fair margin for the primary producers, it is an international problem.  It can only be done by international collaboration.</P>
    <P>In this country we are depending on our primary industry of agriculture.  It is through the surplus production of agriculture that we can buy raw material for industry.  Industry in this country is depending on agriculture to that extent.  It cannot even exist except agriculture has a surplus. Through that surplus it secures its raw material.  I think it is an extraordinary situation that in these circumstances, in view of our vital interest so far as the price we receive for our surplus is concerned, we have a Government who have failed and almost refused &mdash; they have not made up their minds yet about it &mdash; to attend this trade conference and the food and organisation conference especially.  I feel that it is a matter that requires international action and co-operation.  In the past we sold food below the cost of production in a situation of gluts and slumps that was characteristic of the years between the two wars.  That can only be eliminated and dealt with by international co-operation.  I want to press on the Minister the importance of acting immediately so as to show other countries that we are keenly interested. Anything that I have read in the matter from experts who have dealt with our economic position and our national income stresses that.  If you take this pamphlet on national income and expenditure, it says in Chapter IX:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having regard to the fact that in normal times Irish industry is dependent to a very large extent on imported materials&mdash;approximately 50 per cent. by value of industrial materials are imported&mdash;but of the remaining 50 per cent. manufactured in this country a large part in turn is produced from imported materials...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we cannot get these imported materials, especially in the post-war period when there are exchange difficulties. The surest way to obtain the essential import of raw materials is by goods for goods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> I also want to read this passage from the First Minority Report of the Committee on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy.  The reason I select the First Minority Report is that it was made by two civil servants.  I do not want to reflect on them in any way, but they were in a rather dangerous position. I do not think it was fair to ask a civil servant to act on that commission, because he was not a free agent.  He was afraid to offend the powers that be.</P>
    <P>That First Minority Report of the commission is Fianna Fáil policy, a restrictionist policy catering for the home market and nothing else.  That policy has been elaborated in the minority report, but, strange to say, you find thrown into that minority report this passage:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Lastly, agriculture provides the exports which enable this country to import commodities which cannot be produced at home, and which are required (a) to supplement home-produced human foods, (b) to provide much of the raw materials for both industrial and agricultural production, and (c) to enable our people to maintain a reasonably high standard of living.  Prior to the present war agricultural commodities formed 83 per cent. of our commodity exports, so that the economic life of the community, which depended so much on imports, was carried chiefly on the back of the agricultural industry. The country's economic stability will, in post-emergency years, continue to depend to a large degree on the export of agricultural commodities, the production of which must, therefore, be developed to the limit of the availability of profitable markets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Agriculture a couple of questions to-day.  If the Minister attended the market here occasionally he might make very useful contacts and come up against a number of English farmers and members of the cattle trade who are pressing for the removal of the differential in the price of Irish cattle against British cattle. I submit that now is the opportunity. We are selling in a sellers' market and the time to get a favourable adjustment is when you are selling in <Col N="39" /> sellers' market.  Yet no effort is being made to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>So far as agricultural development and industrial development are concerned, I believe that we cannot hope to develop industry efficiently until we have a prosperous and expanding agriculture.  The moment you have a prosperous expanding agriculture in this country it will demand industrial services.  It will absorb our surplus population.  It will require more transport, more production and more raw materials and it will require industry to manufacture the raw materials and machinery for agricultural production. That is what our aim ought to be. Whatever differences we have politically in this House, in the treatment of agriculture and the policy that we should aim at so far as agricultural development is concerned, we ought to be in agreement on that in the future. There can scarcely be two minds on it. The years of the emergency have proved that more than anything else. While the world's economy and trade are still in the fluid condition, surely now is the opportunity and we should be pressing forward to ensure that we get our fair share of the market that is there.  I think that the Government are particularly slow in dealing with this matter, about which many thinking people are deeply concerned.  I feel that if the opportunities are availed of we can look forward with hope and confidence to the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the provisions of the Budget, I want to congratulate the Minister on his complete change of front in the last few weeks so far as the agricultural grant is concerned.  He was rather critical of the attitude of the people who advocated relief by way of agricultural grant.  I think we will have to go much further.  I believe that we will have completely to derate agricultural land.  The land of this country is our raw material for agriculture and I do not see why any raw material should be taxed.  Dealing with the big problem, and I think the Minister will freely admit it is a big problem, of keeping our people at home, of making home more attractive for our people and taking their eyes away from the <Col N="40" /> higher wage level on the other side, I think you should completely derate agricultural land and insist on the farmers passing on the relief to the agricultural workers.  I certainly would congratulate the Minister if he had the courage to do that.  He had the courage to reverse engines in the last three or four weeks because he steadfastly refused to give a concession on the motion introduced here a few weeks ago.  Now he has added £1,000,000 to the agricultural grant. The present Government, before the war, increased local rates by £1,000,000 and during the emergency the rates have been further increased by another £1,000,000.  Therefore, so far as the ratepayer in this country is concerned, he is not getting very much; and the load has already been piled up upon him.  Judging by recent legislation in this House &mdash; I refer to the Government's new Public Health Bill which is passing through this House at the present time&mdash;I think we may anticipate a substantial increase in our local rates.  I want to say to the Minister that if we are going to deal with this problem of wages and income &mdash; and we have a problem when we compare the position here with the position as it exists on the other side&mdash;one way in which we can deal with it is by means of complete derating of agricultural land and another way, as I have already stated, is by education, research, the provision of capital equipment and modern machinery, and an intensive drive to secure the best results we can from every provision we make in that direction.</P>
    <P>I think we must all agree that every effort should be made to keep our people at home.  The greatest asset that any nation has is its manpower. When we talk about production, whether it is production in the field or in the factory, the first essential in that production is manpower.  We cannot afford to export our manpower.  In our circumstances here, and taking our geographical position into account, we must make every effort to ensure that the situation at home will be sufficiently attractive to keep our people at home.  If we do that there will be no necessity for travel bans, or perproduce <Col N="41" /> mits, or anything like that.  No man should be anxious to go abroad.  At all events only very, very few should be anxious to go abroad.  Our situation here to-day is such that everybody is anxious to go abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's change in policy so far as the charge on capital is concerned.  I think the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government are now entering on a new phase.  They realise &mdash; as other countries have realised during the past emergency&mdash;that for development you must have cheap money.  The old rates of 4 per cent. and 5 per cent. are dead. I am glad that the Minister has faced up to the realities of the situation and made some effort in the way of providing cheap money.</P>
      <P>In regard to the transition development fund, and relating that to the Minister's optimism for the future in connection with the relief that he has provided by way of £1,000,000 for agricultural derating, the Minister says that that is only going to be applicable for two years.  Is the Minister really sincere and honest when he expresses the view that two years will accomplish what he has in mind and overcome all the present day difficulties? Is he honest in suggesting that at the end of that time we will find ourselves in the grand position that no further financial effort will be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that the Minister is completely wrong in that supposition.  I suggest that if he takes the broad view and examines our position in relation to what is occurring elsewhere he will find he will have to go much further than that.  He will not put an end to our difficulties in a period of two years. He will have to go the whole hog and completely remove the burden that <Col N="42" /> exists at the present time on our prime industry in this country.  The problem is not nearly so simple as he would suggest in the provision of this transition development fund.  It is not a mere transition stage.  It is a question of the complete reorganisation and reorientation of our agricultural life. From all the effort, sweat, and toil that was put into that industry during the emergency little has resulted.  Production has remained almost completely static; and the provision of a mere transition development fund is not going to cure the cancer that is eating into our agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consult those experts who are in a position to advise him as to what is necessary to transform the situation in which we find ourselves.  It seems extraordinary that so many months after the publication of the report on agricultural policy in the post-war period nothing has been heard from any responsible Minister of the Government as to what the Government intends to do in the matter. I hope that when the Minister is replying he will give us some information on this because the great bulk of our people are anxious to know what the plans are for the future.  The Minister has expressed such optimism so far as future production in this country is concerned that I would like to hear him, when he is replying, elaborating more fully on the views that he has already expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <P>We on this side of the House are somewhat disappointed that the Minister in introducing his Budget has given us no information on the plans which were promised some time ago in relation to finding some solution for the unemployment problem. Deputy Hughes has quite correctly pointed out the very serious position of agriculture at the present time in Éire.  He has pointed out the low rate of wages paid to the most important man in this country at the present time &mdash; the agricultural worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>And the low output per man, which is the chief difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told to-day by the Minister for Education <Col N="43" /> that the Government policy is to control all wages in the rural areas in relation to those paid by the farmers to their employees.  The Minister did throw out a sop when he provided £1,000,000 for the derating of land under the £20 valuation in order to enable farmers to pay a higher wage. But he overlooked informing the House that the Agricultural Wages Board, whose members are nominated by the Government, prevent any wage being paid except what they fix&mdash;that is, a minimum wage.  The nominees of the Government on the wages board fix a wage of not more than 40/- a week for the most important men in the country at the present time.  I maintain that so long as that policy continues we will have a lower output from agriculture and a lesser number of men looking for employment on the land.  The Minister said that it was propaganda to suggest that a large number of men were working, or looking for work, in other countries.  I do not want to deal with propaganda.  I want to deal with facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agricultural Wages Board does not fix a maximum.  It fixes a minimum; so what the Deputy says is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister from his long experience of industry should know that when a minimum wage is fixed it becomes a maximum wage unless the men in that industry are organised in such a way that they can secure a higher wage.  Organised bodies must realise the position of the man in industry and what he can afford to pay.  In many cases even the minimum wage is not paid.  At the present moment we have 70,000 unemployed. No hope of any kind has been held out to these under this Budget.  We are told that the well-to-do are to receive a concession by way of a reduction in income-tax.  That is of no concern to the man who is unemployed. That is of no concern to the old age pensioner trying to exist on 10/- a week.  It is of no concern to these people that income-tax has been reduced.  The man who pays income-tax will have a little more to spend on <Col N="44" /> his own pleasures.  He can do a little more joy-riding in his motor car because the price of petrol has been reduced.  There is a reduction for the owner of a dance hall; whether that will be extended to the patrons I am not sure from the Budget statement. All these things are of no concern to the old age pensioner who has been promised time after time that some increase will be granted to enable him to buy a little more food and live perhaps in somewhat better conditions than he has been living for the last six or seven years during the emergency.</P>
      <P>There is 1d. per lb. reduction in the price of sugar.  It has been prophesied in the inspired Press that the sugar ration will be reduced.  At the present time there is an allowance of ¾-lb. per person.  If the ration is reduced to ½-lb. the most that the old age pensioner will receive through the concession in the price of sugar will be 2/2 a year.  That is a wonderful concession to the old age pensioner and the agricultural worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are informed that there is to be an expenditure of £13,000,000 on road development.  At the time the Government have sanctioned that expenditure, they maintain the standstill Order which prevents local authorities from granting any concession to the skilled men engaged on road work who will be the medium by which that money will be expended.  We have been told that there will be an increase of 3/- a week for road workers.  In the Constitution, all parties are guaranteed equal treatment.  Yet we find that there is a law which grants engineers, men with two jobs, drawing £1,000 a year from the local body, a bonus of 15/- a week while in the case of the lowest paid workers, in receipt of 39/- a week, the maximum increase is 3/- a week.  Is that fair and just treatment to all sections of the community? Is not it preferential treatment for the wealthy and the person who can afford to make a sacrifice? When we point out this discrepancy between the treatment of the £1,000 a year man and the 39/- a week road worker, we will be told what the road worker's wages were before the emergency but we will not <Col N="45" /> be told the purchasing power of those wages.  No wonder there is discontent.  No wonder there are strikes by labourers on the land as well as on the roads.  It is only the beginning, for men will see in the local places the well-to-do receiving preferential treatment and even their subbosses, engineers, being allowed extra allowances for their motor cars and 15/- a week bonus.  The road workers are out from eight in the morning until six in the evening.  They bring their black bread with them, in many cases without butter and make their drop of tea on the road.  They are making all the sacrifices and they see another section of the community getting all the benefits.  That is the cause of the discontent and that is where I disagree with Government policy.  If there are sacrifices to be made, let them be made equally by all sections of the community. We have poverty in our midst.  I am in entire agreement with the introduction of the Public Health Bill but I wish that poverty was a contagious disease, and that the rich would become affected from it.  If that were so, there would be a Bill introduced immediately for the eradication of that disease.  But, as it is confined to a certain number, it is allowed to remain, the problem is allowed to drift, and it will become a very serious matter for any Government that may be in power if there is not an attempt made to cure it.</P>
    <P>The emergency is over, and the people have been promised social services. Deputy Hughes has pointed out that he is not in favour of them.  He has indicated that certain members of the Labour Party are always advocating social services.  Does he realise that even amongst the small farmers, that he is supposed to represent, there is need of social services, there is need of free hospital treatment?  Any of them who are not in a position to pay for hospital treatment are entitled to the services that we advocate and that we hope will be introduced so that these people may get the rights that the wealthy people enjoy at the present time.  I am surprised that the Minister did not refer to social services or give some encouragement to the <Col N="46" /> persons whom we recommend, the old age pensioners.  Perhaps he is waiting until the appointment of a new Minister, but it is customary in the Budget to announce some policy and we are disappointed that that has not been done.  The Minister did not give us any hope of a solution of the problem of unemployment with which we are confronted and in connection with which he has received an offer from all Parties in the House that they would be prepared to co-operate in trying to find a solution.</P>
    <P>I would wish to see the concession given in the Budget to farmers under £20 valuation extended to the owners of land in urban areas.  The owners of land in urban areas are in a serious position.  They pay urban rate and county rate.  If the concession were extended to them it would enable them to give employment.</P>
    <P>I want to register my disappointment in connection with the Budget, and I would ask the Minister to give some hope, when he is replying to the debate, that the concession he has given to industry by the suspension of the excess corporation profits tax will not mean that the people will have to pay a higher price for their goods or that the industries concerned will make higher profits but that they will put the money into industry and give employment or extend the benefit they have received to the public by reducing the price of the articles they have for sale.  In that way, it would be of some benefit to the people.  This Budget, giving a small concession in the price of sugar, benefiting the rich as much as the poor, is not, in my opinion, a Budget in connection with which we may congratulate the Minister on behalf of the people we represent.  It is not giving them the benefits to which they are entitled.  When the Minister had a surplus at his disposal, his first duty should have been to give the benefit of that surplus to the most deserving section of the people, the poor people whom we represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was expecting a more favourable Budget than has been presented to us.  We must realise, that, for the past four or five years, there has been a great harvest for racketeers, black marketeers and job-hunters.  Does the Minister realise the manner in which the poorer sections of the community have been treated during the past four or five years? What hope has he of giving them <Col N="48" /> improved conditions in the future?  A Deputy has pointed out that very little assistance was given to the poorer sections.  It was also pointed out that administration, as we have seen it for the past four or five years, has not been up to the standard expected.  The Minister knows that the poorer sections of the community have been fleeced right, left and centre by the parties to whom I have referred &mdash; the business people, the big merchants, the industrialists, the capitalists and those who participated in the black market.  It is extraordinary that tea was rationed and that any citizen who was prepared to pay 25/- a lb. Could get tea in unlimited quantities throughout the country.  In many areas it went as high as 35/- a lb.  People prepared to pay 35/- could get cart loads of it. The same applies to sugar &mdash; a commodity which is most essential.  Unlimited supplies of sugar at 2/- a lb. were available in every part of the Midlands.  Petrol was supposed to be used during the emergency only for the most essential purposes.  Yet, citizens who were on a ration of from four to eight gallons were able to travel thousands of miles.  Imagine six gallons of petrol keeping people on the road for four weeks of the month. Petrol could be secured in any part of the country in the black market, and I am of opinion that while we had such a state of affairs, huge profits must have been made.  The sad part of the whole business is that the people who were pledging their support to Government policy, who were anxious to assist the nation outwardly in every way in the emergency and who were first to bow down in adoration before the altar of God, were the people who were fleecing and robbing the poor right, left and centre.  In my opinion, the Government should have attacked that situation in a more serious manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes made reference&mdash;and rightly so &mdash; to the present wage system here.  He was ably supported by my colleague, Deputy Everett.  A hundred and ninety thousand people in this State have over £3 a week in salary. As Deputy Everett pointed out, the <Col N="49" /> Minister for Education stood up in this House and endorsed Government policy in keeping wages strictly in accord with the rate set out for agricultural workers &mdash; £2 per week.  Does the Government really believe that any citizen can exist to-day, feed a wife and family, pay rent, purchase firing and discharge his duties to that family on £2 per week?  That is a disgraceful state of affairs and I am not a bit surprised at the very high volume of emigration from this country.  As Deputy Hughes clearly pointed out, if there were no restrictions on emigration, the Twenty-Six Counties would be like the Sahara desert.  Why should these people stay at home trying to eke out an existence under appalling conditions when they can go abroad and work for a foreign country &mdash; no less than our traditional enemy and, I suppose, the traditional enemy of the Government?  That traditional enemy has kept the life blood flowing in the veins of thousands in this country.</P>
    <P>After so many years of native government, we have our own people denied the food, work, clothing and shelter that Almighty God has provided in abundance for all of us.  Any citizen who would remain at home and work from sunrise to nightfall for £2 a week would be fit for a lunatic asylum, if employment is placed at his disposal across the Irish Sea at £5 to £8 or £10 a week and he did not take it. The tragic part of the whole business is that 185,000 able-bodied workers were forced to emigrate, in the hope of securing a good livelihood and in order to keep the life's blood flowing in their parents and relatives.  More tragic still, they have been sending over thousands of pounds to lubricate the throats of their friends to shout &ldquo;Up Dev&rdquo; and the praises of Fianna Fáil.  We all realise that every worker is entitled to work and that it is the bounden duty of the Government to provide it and see that a decent wage is paid.  Every worker is entitled to a living wage in order to bring up his family in Christian decency &mdash; I think that is a quotation from Pope Leo XIII's <i>Rerum Novarum.</i>  This Government has given not alone a deaf ear to the great Christian teachings of <Col N="50" /> that Pope but also a blind eye to his writings.</P>
    <P>I expected that provision would be made whereby old age pensioners, widows and other sections of the poor would have been treated better.  I am surprised that no attempt was made to increase the rates of old age pensions. When a citizen cannot live on £2 a week, how does the Government, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance claim that any citizen can live on 10/- a week?  It is a disgrace to civilisation that an Irish and Christian Government should, at this stage, ask any citizen to exist on 10/- a week &mdash; supplemented during the emergency by a mean, miserable, many 2/6, which the old age pensioner had to beg from nobody else but the relieving officer or home assistance officer.  He was brought to the very same level as the pauper, begging a miserable 2/6 supplementary allowance.  As was pointed out during the debate on old age pensions, if a pensioner decides in O'Connell Street to take up a brick and let it fly through a shop window, he will be arrested and sentenced to Mountjoy for a period, at a State cost of 27/6 a week for his keep, but if he is a good citizen, minds his own business and stops at home, he will get only 10/-.  Such a system is a &ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish&rdquo; one. If 27/6 can be paid for his maintenance in Mountjoy, surely £1 can be put aside for his maintenance outside Mountjoy? The old age pensioners have the sympathy of all sections of the community and I am surprised that some provision was not made for them, as we have all been taught to treat them with the highest respect and the highest courtesy.</P>
    <P>The widows, who have been deprived of the breadwinner, are being asked to support the orphaned children on a pension which is altogether inadequate to keep them on their bare rations, not to speak about any extra comfort or nourishment.  We have the Government time and again warning the people of the dangers of tuberculosis. We have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health presenting legislation which is going to be very costly, with regard to public health.  I say <Col N="51" /> that any money spent on public health is well spent, but you could spend millions and millions in the war against tuberculosis and it may be just the same as water flowing down the river, with no results for it.  The one cure for tuberculosis, the one means of making this a healthy nation, is the provision of plenty of food and nourishment. How can food and nourishment be secured, either by the old age pensioner at 10/- a week or by the working-class people at £2 a week?  The country can be nothing else but reeking from tuberculosis, as the root cause of tuberculosis is starvation and poverty&mdash;and that ought to be plain language enough for the Minister.  I am in no way ashamed to state in this House&mdash; although I am sorry to say it &mdash; that there are homes throughout the length and breadth of Southern Ireland which contain families in complete starvation and want.  You have men going out to take part in the turf drive, working for county councils, in many cases, for a month before they get a fortnight's pay.  Many of those men, because of their poverty, dissociate from their fellow workers at lunch-time, as they are ashamed to let the others see they have nothing but dry bread.</P>
    <P>We see people paying the highest price for flour at present.  I am sorry if I have called it &ldquo;flour&rdquo;, as it is only pollard, which is being distributed to people at the price of good white flour.  If the bread was reduced in quality, why was the price not reduced?  In my constituency I have known even dogs to refuse to eat what Christians are being asked to eat at present.  If I have put a tone in this debate which would be likely to have an effect on the nerves of the Minister, I regret it, but that is actually the position as I see it.  I look upon this Budget as the old picture appearing now in a new frame.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes, who dealt with agriculture during this debate, is one of the ablest authorities on agriculture in this House, as he can speak with practical knowledge &mdash; which is something more than I can.  However, it is only three weeks since I rose here and placed before the Minister for <Col N="52" /> Agriculture the fact that hundreds of tons of potatoes were lying rotten in the pits of the farmers of Offaly.</P>
    <P>Surely there must be something wrong in the administration of the Department of Agriculture when we see people in the City of Dublin appealing for potatoes and prepared to pay any price for potatoes, while we have a Government giving plenty of lip sympathy to those who are not able to purchase potatoes, while we have them expressing support for the efforts of the Red Cross to provide for starving Europe and yet, despite the supposed generosity of the Government towards the poorer sections of our people in the cities and their sympathy for those who are dying of starvation in Europe, hundreds and hundreds of tons of potatoes are allowed to rot in the pits.  Is not that very poor encouragement to farmers to set their minds to the production of potatoes?  I know of farmers who sowed six, seven and eight acres of potatoes last year and this year they are sowing only half an acre, just sufficient to supply their own domestic requirements.  They are not going to produce potatoes for the market simply because, due to the bad management of the Government, huge quantities of potatoes were allowed to rot last year.  When the world is in such a state, in my opinion it is a sin calling to Heaven for vengeance to allow potatoes to rot in their pits through mismanagement on the part of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in the course of a reply to, I think, Deputy Mulcahy, to-day pointed out that farmers could secure loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation at a rate of 4½ per cent. interest.  In my opinion if we are anxious to increase our agricultural output the first thing we must do is to place our farmers in a position to produce.  I believe the big barrier to production in this country is lack of capital.  Deputy Everett pointed out that the rates have been going up by leaps and bounds and we are reaching a position now when the majority of our farmers find it impossible to pay their rates.  Strange as it may appear, while rates are going <Col N="53" /> up by leaps and bounds there is a widespread demand for a considerable improvement in social services.  I see no relation whatever between the social services we have and the very high amounts collected for rates.  If we are anxious to promote agricultural production, it is the bounden duty of the Government to arrange that farmers shall have sufficient capital at their disposal in order to produce food.  I am sorry to say that there is not one day in the week in which I do not receive requests from farmers in my constituency &mdash; and I am sure other Deputies have a similar experience&mdash; asking advice as to the proper course to take to secure financial accommodation. The farmers have never failed the Government.  The farmers have never let down the country but the Government have definitely let down the farmers in my opinion.  If the farmers were put in a sound financial way of working, there would be no need of legislation to compel them to pay a certain rate of wages to workers because, from my own experience, they are only too ready and anxious to pay the highest rate of wages possible to their workers but it is the old story &mdash; you cannot get blood out of a turnip. You cannot get money out of farmers' pockets unless you put it into them. If they got proper financial assistance they would be able to increase production and pay better wages.</P>
    <P>If I am not greatly mistaken, a system was introduced in England during the emergency whereby farmers were given as much as £5 per acre bonus for every extra acre they put under tillage.  Why was there not some provision of that description made in this country as a sincere effort to help farmers to produce food for man and beast?  The present plight of agriculture is a serious state of affairs for this Government and it is going to be just as serious for the Government that will follow the present Government, because the Government is leaving the country in such a mess that it is going to be impossible for their successors, no matter how anxious they may be, to straighten up what Fianna Fáil has left as crooked as a corkscrew to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> Rural Ireland is being completely deserted.  Farmers' sons are anxious to clear out, to get from between the handles of the plough as quickly as possible, because they have nothing to look forward to but hard work traversing from one end of the field to the other.  In springtime, as I pointed out, they are busy from sunrise to nightfall and even after nightfall you find farmers trying to overtake their work &mdash; looking after cattle, horses and their agricultural machinery.  Anyone who has experience of rural life knows that if farmers were to go to bed a little later they would meet themselves getting up in the morning to face the same hard toil again.</P>
    <P>During the summer time they are first in the campaign to supply fuel requirements.  During such intervals as occur whilst the turf is being saved, they are engaged in weeding their crops and attending to their tillage, and when harvest arrives they are kept continually going cutting and saving their grain crops and removing them into the haggard to be threshed.  The most important event of the year occurs when they receive the reward of their labour, the day when the cheque arrives from the miller for the price of their grain.  Speaking from the height of my ignorance, so far as farming is concerned, I think I can say that I know sufficient to assert that that cheque is scarcely in the front door until it goes out the back door.  The vast majority of farmers are as poor a fortnight after they receive the cheque as they were nine months before when they put the seed in the land.  I think their circumstances call for a vast improvement in that respect and I am convinced that the only solution is to place funds at their disposal which will enable them to carry on this work of great national importance.  I am sure the Government fully realise that the unstable financial position of farmers is mainly responsible for the constant flow of emigration.  We are aware of the anxiety there is among young men in the country to get employment at anything other than farming, to get to a town or city or across to Great Britain, and all because <Col N="55" /> there is no encouragement given to them to remain at home on the land. Unless some encouragement is given, I am afraid that the position is going to become more serious.  If the position in rural Ireland gets any worse than it is, then I am sure the Minister and the Government must realise that the death of the Irish nation is fast approaching.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to local authorities is also getting very serious. Some effort should be made by the Government to enable them to get the money that they require to finance their housing schemes at a cheaper rate than that which prevails at present. I do not know if the Minister's attention has been drawn to this, but certainly the attention of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has been directed to it.  I am sure that if Deputy Alfred Byrne were in the House he would not hesitate to paint a very sorrowful picture for the Minister of the housing conditions in Dublin.  I can tell the Minister that in the country areas also the position is very bad indeed.  When a house, owned by either a local authority or a private person, becomes vacant you have from 12 to 20 applicants for it. The Town Clerk of Portlaoighise told me yesterday that they had 35 applicants for a vacant house owned by the town commissioners.  If local authorities are expected to carry out huge housing schemes they should not be obliged to mortgage their property in order to secure the necessary financial accommodation to enable them to execute the works.  The Minister should give serious attention to this question.  The housing shortage has become so acute that it is even preventing young people from getting married.  If there is one thing that a young married couple resent it is this: that they should be obliged to remain in the home of either the father of the bride or bridegroom.  The Minister surely knows the family consequences that usually follow when that happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had any experience, thanks be to God, but I <Col N="56" /> know from the experience of some of my constituents.  The position is becoming so grave that this question of housing demands special attention from the Government.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has on many an occasion pointed out in the House that, in the interests of public health, and for other reasons, the provision of houses is most essential.  I think that we have now reached the stage when all our slums should be abolished.  I hope that a housing policy will be formulated at once by the Government and put into operation without delay.  I pointed out on the Estimate for the Department of Justice that we had members of the Gárda Síochána applying for a house when it became vacant in the country, even for labourers' cottages which the agricultural labourers are entitled to. I think the Government should not only provide them with houses but also members of the Defence Forces, especially those serving in military posts convenient to the city.  There are soldiers who are paying up to 25/- a week for a flat.  It is my opinion that this question of housing must be tackled strongly and seriously, and that a lot of the wind and the gas that is released from Fianna Fáil platforms will have to be converted into something practical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point that I had intended dealing with when I was referring to the racketeers, the black marketeers and the job hunters, and that is the cost of juvenile clothing.  On two or three occasions in this House I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what steps he was taking to reduce the cost of juvenile clothing.  A suit of clothes for a child, eight or ten years old, costs as much to-day as a suit for an adult did in 1939 or 1940, despite the fact that our manufacturers have repeatedly made application to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for permits to manufacture children's clothing.  Their applications were refused.  I believe that while we have a monopoly in the manufacture of clothing high prices are going to remain. The position would be changed if there was competition.  If one man <Col N="57" /> could produce a suit of clothes for £6 and another man could produce it for £5 10s., the suit is going to be bought from the latter, and he may even sell it at £5.  From competition of that sort the general public would benefit. While, however, we have the Government restricting manufacturers in the production of clothing, the poor in this country are going to be badly bled.  If there is one section of the community that has been in the front line of the black marketeers and profiteers, it is the drapers.  I think that this question should have got more attention from the Government.  Thousands and thousands of pounds, in the way of profits, were turned over by this class at the expense of the starving and naked people in the City of Dublin and throughout the country during the emergency period.  It is even going on at present.  In view of the fact that we have citizens who have plenty of finance, who are well-equipped with machinery and who have a stake in the country who are prepared to manufacture clothing, I think they should be granted a licence to do so.  The price of clothing will not come down until it is brought down by competition.</P>
    <P>Turf occupied a prominent place in the Minister's Budget.  I come from an area that may be described as the home of turf production.  In my constituency we have peat works at Clonsast and at Turraun.  We have some of the best bogs in Ireland in Laoighis, Offaly and Westmeath, parts of which come into my constituency.  I fail to understand why the poor people of Dublin should have been fleeced in the way they were for four successive winters during the emergency period. They certainly had the experience we used to believe was impossible &mdash; of seeing smoke without fire.  There has been smoke without fire in the City of Dublin and in many of our provincial towns.  I have seen poor people purchasing turf &mdash; if I may refer to it as such &mdash; in this city, and if I were at home on the local bog cutting my own requirements I would dump that turf, that these people were paying £3 odd for, into the boghole in order to level off my turf banks.  It is a disgraceful state of affairs.  I am sure the Government <Col N="58" /> did not take the necessary precautions to see that the people who purchase that turf are getting fair value for their money.  Huge profits must have been made by somebody in this turf racket &mdash; and it was and is a racket.  I believe it has developed to such an extent that there should have been an inquiry into where the huge profits have gone.  The producer did not get much of the profits.  The men producing the turf in many areas &mdash; and I know this happened in my own constituency&mdash;have been producing it at a loss.  Somebody must have been making a good thing out of it.  I think the turf racket should have been the subject of more thorough investigation by the Government.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Budget is not at all one that will be welcomed by the poorer sections of the people, simply because there is no relief for them.  The poorer sections are not interested in income-tax or what comes out of it, nor are they interested in a reduction of 6d., 8d. or 9d. a gallon in the price of petrol.  Some of them have not an ass cart, not to speak of a V.8 or any type of motor car.  Those things do not concern the poor at all.  What would concern them is an increase in the old age pension, in widows' pensions, or some practical assistance for the agricultural community.  I hope that next year, if the Minister is the Minister for Finance, he will be able to present a Budget that will receive a more hearty Céad Míle Fáilte from the poorer sections than this Budget has received.</P>
    <P>I am sure that if Deputy McGilligan were here he would have a word to say about high finance.  I believe the present Minister for Finance has made a thorough study of economics, as far as his intelligence would allow him, be it limited or unlimited, but I am sure that Deputy McGilligan would be able to enlighten the Minister, in a manner in which my education does not permit me to enlighten him, on the question of a complete change in our monetary policy.  I have pointed out on more than one occasion that until such time as you have the finances of this State taken completely out of the hands of <Col N="59" /> private individuals, who are issuing money in order to make huge profits and big interest for themselves at the expense of the Government and the people, and until you have a Government and a Minister prepared to tackle the banks, you will have increases in rates and taxation and you will be whipping the dead horse further.  If this Government does not alter things, some future Government will have to do so.  Sooner or later the bull will have to be taken by the horns.</P>
    <P>I remember a speech made by the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach in Athlone some years ago in which the exact words used were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If I am unable to solve the unemployment problem within the present system, I am prepared to go outside the system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Neither the Government nor the Taoiseach has yet gone outside that system, which is a system that stands for debt, poverty and the destruction of mankind.  Until such time as we go outside that system, there will be no relief for the suffering masses of the people.</P>
    <P>We are told that we must have something behind our currency.  I wonder is the Minister foolish enough to believe that, during the war years, England had gold behind every £ in circulation? I am sure the Minister and the Government will easily recall that, prior to the outbreak of war, in England &mdash; I believe Deputy Norton ably pointed this out in the House on one occasion &mdash; there was unemployment and there was poverty to the highest degree.  It was pointed out in the public Press, on public platforms, and even in this House, that in all the big towns and cities of England the unemployed were marching, carrying banners.  There was complete unrest and uneasiness.  There were strikes something like what we are going to have in this country from now on. Already we have the teachers' strike, the farm workers' strike and the county council workers' strike.  These are only the commencement of strikes here.  It is the duty of the workers to fight for what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> The Government have the example of all those strikes in England.  The poor in that country were kept on the march from soup kitchen to soup kitchen, from 1d. dinner shops to 1d. dinner shops, begging.  Looting and grabbing reached their highest peak.  Shop windows where food was displayed were broken and the food was taken from them in order to satisfy the hunger of the citizens.  We read in the newspapers that the poor lay outside the railings of Hyde Park and on their breasts were labels with the words: &ldquo;We are starving and dying from hunger and exposure.&rdquo;  We read in the Press that a black coffin was carried into Chamberlain's office in 10 Downing Street by the workers as a protest against the horrid treatment they were enduring.  Three months afterwards the war broke out and every available man was put into productive employment.  They took every Irishman they could get.  Not alone did every Englishman get work, but every Irishman who was available was employed.  Every available woman who could work was put into employment. Munition factories were built and worked to full capacity and England was the very centre of industry.</P>
    <P>Money was no object.  I quoted here some two months ago where, in Hull, there was an ex-soldier of the 1914-18 war who had both legs blown off.  He was one of many cripples who were put into employment and he received from £8 to £10 per week.  His duty was to look after those who could work.  When England could at that stage give her cripples £8 and £10 per week, surely it is a disgrace that we can offer our able-bodied men nothing more than £2 per week.  I want to point out to the Minister that, for war, for the destruction of mankind and the destruction of God's gifts to man, millions of pounds were provided &mdash; £15,000,000 to £20,000,000 per day &mdash; but not a penny piece could be provided to satisfy the hungry thousands who died over there, prior to the war, from starvation and destitution, from consumption, from want and from disease brought about through lack of nourishment. Had this country been involved in the war &mdash; thank God it was not, and <Col N="61" /> I hope we shall never have to go through the experiences which England and European countries had to go through &mdash; millions upon millions would have been provided for destruction; but, now that the war is over and gone, why are these millions of pounds not provided for the building up of the various nations?  England could get millions for war from the same banking system under which our people are trying to survive in starvation and want.  What is to prevent these millions being provided to put our men working in full-time employment at decent living wages to enable them to bring up their families in Christian decency?  That is the system to which Deputy Lemass referred in Athlone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I submit that the Government has failed completely to remedy the national ills and that their policy is a policy of unemployment, poverty, emigration, low wages, strikes, starvation, forced sales, seizures and evictions, with the cost of living going up by leaps and bounds and wages going up with the speed of a snail.  I submit that they have completely failed to carry out their programme and have failed to end the national ills within the present system.  I suggest, therefore, that they have recourse to the other method of going outside the present system, because I believe that, while we remain within the system of the bankers and capitalists, we will still carry on under the system of debt.  The private individuals who are running the banks to-day, as the Minister knows, are not running them for love of Fianna Fáil.  They are capitalists who are out to advance their own interests and to help and assist everything British and imperialist.  The tools and pawns through whom they are working are the <Col N="62" /> Minister and his Government, and I think the Minister should use his influence with the Government to get outside that system, to have our own monetary system and to issue currency on the basis of our production.</P>
      <P>Every man who is forced to emigrate is a loss to the country, because, when we export men, we export the real wealth of the country inasmuch as, without the men, real wealth cannot be produced from the land.  It does not require a man to be a professor or highly educated to know that.  I got only a national school education, and I am thankful to God that I did not go any further when I see the results brought about by the educated men on the opposite side.  Until such time as a serious attempt is made to embark on the Douglas system, the New Zealand system or some system other than the present imperialist British system which is out to cater, as it catered, for the Rothschilds, for the original McKennas, the Sir John Keanes or the other bankers who are making a good thing of it and growing fatter and richer while the citizens grow thinner and poorer; until such time as the financial system in this country is tackled &mdash; and if it is not tackled by this Government, I am convinced that, as Governments throughout Europe which ruled with a strong and iron hand fell within 24 hours, so the powerful dictatorial Government of Fianna Fáil can fall within 24 hours &mdash; we will have a continuation of the unsatisfactory conditions to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government have not the courage and the pluck to bring about the revolutionary changes necessary, there are men in the country, and even on this side of the House, who are prepared to bring them about.  The changes must be revolutionary, if poverty, destitution and want are to be ended, if food, work, clothing and shelter are to be placed at the disposal of every Irish man and woman and if we are to have a position in which we will not be exporting our manhood like so many cattle, sheep and pigs to be used as gun fodder by any European power, be it Germany, Russia or England, but in which they will be kept <Col N="63" /> at home to serve their own country at a decent living wage under a system of proper social and economic schemes which will enable these people to remain at home and to get what they are entitled to, food, work and good pay for that work&mdash;food, work, clothing and shelter for all and poverty for none.</P>
    <P>If this Government propose to continue on the path trodden by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, if they are prepared to continue to march along the road to higher taxation, higher rates and greater and increased burdens on the taxpayers, I am convinced that the day is not far off when we will come up against a situation which it will be impossible to rectify, because the country and the local authorities are flying headlong into bankruptcy.  I only hope that the Minister and his Government will be prepared to see that, in the future, a decent standard of living is provided &mdash; a standard of which we need not be ashamed, as we are of the present standard, but one of which we can be proud &mdash; in order that we may keep our people at home to produce the real wealth which comes from the soil of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to speak after hearing the encyclopaedic Deputy Flanagan.  I expected a very sensational Budget from the Minister, but I find that his Budget has fallen very flat.  I cannot understand the change that comes over men when they get into high society.  There was a time when the Minister for Finance was a revolutionary.  He was a plain man's man and the people expected great things from him.  He spoke to the countryman and to the poor man. But when he puts on his white collar and shirt and mixes in high society, he changes overnight.  I should like to know what happens to our men.  So far as I can see, they all change one after the other.  They forget that there are people down the country with a poor standard of living.  Big money and big business change their whole outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that this is a good Budget.  It is a mean Budget so far as <Col N="64" /> the country people are concerned.  It is a bad Budget; it is a Budget which tends to help the big man and to press on the poor.  I think it is unfair of the Government to do that with the present price of commodities and the present standard of wages.  It is a deceitful Budget, because to the ordinary man in the country it looks all right.  When he sees the headlines he says: &ldquo;It is not too bad.&rdquo;  But it must be understood that it is the biggest Budget ever introduced in this country. It is almost £3,000,000 bigger than any other Budget we have had.  The ordinary man cannot read that into it, but that is the fact.  The Government cloaked that.  It is a disgrace, after the demobilisation of most of the Army and taking £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 off the cost, to find a Budget £3,000,000 bigger than previous Budgets.  Although we were told that when they were not needed the emergency services would be wiped out and the money would be left in the people's pockets, they expect more and more money to keep them in a lavish way of living.  It is a Budget of despair.  We are slavishly following the old school.  We cannot bring in our own Budget until we see what Great Britain and Northern Ireland will do.  Is it not time that we should be able to stand on our own feet and bring in our own Budget in our own way to suit the needs of our own people?  But we must follow big business all over the world.  That is absolutely wrong.  We will have to budget in a different way altogether. We are lavishing money in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>At present we have in this little nation a vast city where all the wealth, might and pomp of the country are gathered.  Outside that we have little villages and small towns which are decaying and the people are flying from them to Great Britain and to Dublin and elsewhere.  It is time for some Government or Minister to see that that running sore is healed.  It is time for some strong Government to deal with the problem of the City of Dublin. We know that it cannot go on as it is going.  Soon it will be a case of the whole County Dublin being absorbed <Col N="65" /> by the city, while the majority of these people are living in idleness and comfort. Yet the people who are doing the work are only getting £2 or 50/- a week.  Slave wages are being paid.  As I say, it is time for some Government to deal with this problem of the City of Dublin.  I believe that we should wipe out half of the City of Dublin &mdash; I do not mean by an atomic bomb or anything like that.  But we will have to get the people out of the City of Dublin.  We will have to put them to work down the country to earn their living.  Either that, or we will have to export all the idlers who came in here during the last 50 years, who do not belong to us, and whose ideas are foreign so far as we are concerned. To-day we have in Dublin a mass of money kings, State officials and secret societies of all kinds.  They are bad for this country.  They are all out for getting rich while the nation decays.  The nation is represented by the plain man and woman down the country who are earning their living by the sweat of their brow.</P>
    <P>I think some Government will also have to tackle this question of State officialdom.  I do not say that these State officials are not efficient workers and are not entitled to what they get, but the nation cannot afford all the officials we have.  It would be a good thing if the Government put up £5,000,000 or even £8,000,000 to buy of half of these officials and get them out. This nation could be run by half the officials we have at present.  Everyone that goes in as a temporary official becomes a permanent official in a year or two and is pensionable, while the people in the country who have to pay the salaries and pensions are in a state of misery and want and their children have to go to London or Birmingham or some place like that to live in the slums there.  As Deputy Flanagan said, it is time that some revolutionary change took place.  We have now had 25 years of native government and still the emigration from the land continues.  At one time we had emigration to America.  That has stopped and the emigration is now to Great Britain, our supposed traditional enemy.  If it had not been for Great Britain this country would have <Col N="66" /> been burst.  All that is due to the fact that we do not know how to deal with our finances and to give labour its premier place in the life of the country. The labouring man should be blessed instead of cursed, as he is to-day.</P>
    <P>The whole trend at the present time is to forget that agriculture was the mainstay of our country in the past and must be its mainstay in the future. Yet it is being neglected.  The Minister gives a small sop to agriculture.  The one thing that agriculture wants is immediate relief.  We should derate all agricultural land and give the tillers of the soil who feed our people a chance to get on their feet.  Not alone that, but it is time that we put some State capital into agriculture.  There is hardly a farmer in this country who could not do with £300, £400, £500 or £600 and make good use of it.  If a farmer goes to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan he cannot get it unless he can get half a dozen people to go security for him.  Surely his farm should be enough security for a loan. That is the way to help agriculture. What is wrong is that our land is starved at present and production and output have gone down and down because the land is deteriorating rapidly owing to the fact that our farmers had to feed the people without being able to put anything back into the land.  Our agricultural workers are living on a low, mean wage.  They cannot give the output required because they have not the bone and the sinew and the muscle required.  All these things should be provided for, but they are not provided for in this Budget.</P>
    <P>What the farmer wants is stability. He wants to be able to see at least ten years ahead.  He wants increased markets and stability in market conditions. The Government are not making the slightest effort to provide him with a stable market.  They have not made the slightest effort to approach the British Government, which could give us a market and always did, although I know she always suited herself.  We supplied her with food for the last five or six years.  The Irish farmer should be given his just rights.  He should have stability and <Col N="67" /> a fair price for the articles he produces. It is time that some agreement should be come to.  We have had no agreement for the last ten or 11 years.  The farmer was left to provide for himself. It is time that the farmer should get something in the nature of stability in his market.  If the present Government will not face up to that problem they should make way for another Government. It is time that political playacting stopped.  It has been carried on very successfully.  The tomfoolery which went on blinded our people. Whenever we have a crisis at the present moment, no matter whether it be in economics, or agriculture, or anything else, you find the Taoiseach getting up and beating the old tom-tom and speaking about the Irish language while, at the same time, the Irish nation decays.  I want this kind of thing to stop.  There is a place and a time for everything; and there is a place and a time for the Irish language. It is no use talking about the revival of the Irish language while, at the same time, our agriculture and our industries are dying and our people are decaying. Let the Taoiseach speak about the language in its proper place.  The time has come when he must give all his attention to those things that fundamentally concern the nation &mdash; that is, whether we are going to be able to keep agriculture on its feet and whether this nation is going to survive. Let him give up beating his tom-tom every week-end over the radio and from the public platforms calling for a revival of the Irish language.  We recognise the gesture for what it is &mdash; a gesture to cloak his own inefficiency and the inefficiency of his Government in their efforts to hold power in their own hands.  It is time that the realities of the country were faced up to; it is time for the Government to realise that people cannot live on the Irish language alone.  They live on the results of their own toil and sweat.  It is a case of whether we stand for the idle rich or the plain Irish.  I definitely stand for the plain Irish and I ask the Government to do the same.  It is time that the Government took itself in hand and looked, not to the City of <Col N="68" /> Dublin but to the rest of the country to find out how our people are living.</P>
    <P>This Budget is a mean Budget as far as the poorest and least capable of our people are concerned, namely, the old age pensioners and the widows and orphans.  There is no relief given to these people.  I think it is a disgrace and a shame to ask an unfortunate old man of 70, hovering on the brink of his grave, to live on 10/- a week.  Surely the nation could afford to give him a bounty of even 5/- a week for the few years that he has to live.  The Government is too taken up with the industrialists and the white collar people and so on to bother about those people in the country some of whom have not so much as a shirt to put on their backs. Some people have done well out of this Budget.  It is my belief that the day will come when there will be fireworks over it.  We are always thankful for small mercies and so we are thankful for the small reliefs the Minister has given us in this Budget.  Income-tax is down by 1/- in the £.  We have cheaper turf and cheaper petrol.  These things are all right in their own way, but taken all in all they are of small import in the lives of the bulk of our people.  Petrol could have been left as it was.  The idle rich and those who are fortunate enough to afford a motor car will benefit by this relief.  The majority of our people cannot afford a motor car.  I think income-tax could have been left at the figure at which it was.  The relief offered may benefit industry.  I am glad to see the tax on whiskey and wines has been increased.  I think the Minister did not go half far enough there.  I would tax to the very limit all types of amusements and all gambling dens.  We have thousands of them throughout the country.  I would tax them out of existence.  There are too many in this country living on the sweat of others.  I would make those people toe the line or else get out.</P>
    <P>I think that everybody will agree with me that none of us can feel happy about the trend in Irish society over the last ten to 15 years.  We certainly could not feel happy when we see our young girls, who were famed for their decency, modesty, and Christian outlook on life, swarming into our bars <Col N="69" /> with fags in their mouths and slacks on their legs.  It is time we made some effort to get back to that standard of Irish modesty and decency which was such a bulwark for Christianity in this country.  Are we going to put the reins of control into the hands of these people?  This manner of living is a recent growth; it is due to those who have gone away to London, and elsewhere, coming home with big money in their pockets to mock and smile at the plain Irish people and the plain country girls: what is there for them at home; why do they not come away and see life?  We know what it brings them.  It may bring them a spurious grandeur for a time, but in the last analysis is can bring them nothing but misery and unhappiness.  We see our young girls drinking, gambling and dancing around our country in an artificial swank.  This nation is going the way that France, Russia and Italy have gone.  It is time that someone spoke plainly about these things.  I am not a kill-joy but I loathe these upstarts who sneer at the plain Irish people because they live in an honest and upright way.</P>
    <P>I say that the Budget is a bad Budget.  It is a mean Budget and a Budget typical of Fianna Fáil.  It deceives nobody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies appear to take the view that this is a good Budget.  From the point of view of some sections of the community it may be so described.  Those who are fortunate enough to be in receipt of taxable incomes find themselves relieved to the extent of 1/- in the £.  The motoring public will benefit by the fact that petrol has been reduced to the extent of 6d. per gallon.  It may be reasonably anticipated that the greatest beneficiaries under this head will be, on the one hand, Córas Iompair Éireann and, on the other, Fuel Importers, Limited.  Córas Iompair Éireann, as the Minister is aware, consumes a considerable amount of petrol and, therefore, the reduction in petrol price will prove advantageous to that particular company.  The same applies to Fuel Importers, Limited.  If we exclude the one solitary item of 1d. per lb. on sugar the vast majority of our <Col N="70" /> citizens derive no direct benefit whatsoever from this Budget.  With the end of hostilities abroad, and in the natural expectation of the end of emergency conditions here, one would expect a very substantial reduction in taxation. Yet we find that such is not the case. The Minister has expressed the hope that the reduction in petrol and income-tax will result in lower charges on the public.  That may be so, but it will be dependent upon and rest with the Minister to see that these reductions and benefits will accrue.  Now, some time ago the chairman of Córas Iompair Eireann announced that certain reductions would be effected in the charges of the company as from the 1st July next.  It would, perhaps, be unfair to conclude that that gentleman was in possession of information concerning the Government's intentions in this regard.  But the public would like to know if they may now anticipate a further reduction from Coras Iompair Eireann relative to the reduction in the price of petrol. Obviously if he could forecast six months ago a reduction in certain charges &mdash; assuming that he was then unaware that petrol was going to be reduced &mdash; naturally enough one would now anticipate that we would have a still further reduction.  As I said a few minutes ago it will be up to the Minister to see that these reductions are brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget has been described by some Deputies as being one which will reduce unemployment, emigration, drudgery, etcetera, etcetera.  I cannot see how that is going to happen.  With the exception of the two items I have mentioned there is nothing in this Budget but an attitude.  The poorer sections of the community, the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans, the blind, have been entirely neglected. The benefit that the old-age pensioner will derive from this Budget, which we are told is going to solve all our problems, is three-farthings per three-quarter pound of sugar.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of that and he may be able to explain why the richest classes of the community have been taken into consideration, the people with motor cars, the people in the happy position of paying <Col N="71" /> income-tax on large salaries, while the poorer sections of the people have been neglected.  They have been neglected for a considerable time, in particular since the outbreak of war.  The Minister is aware that the cost of living has increased considerably.  He is also aware of his refusal time and time again to grant an increase in the old age pension, or widows' or orphans' pensions, to help these people to meet the cost of living.  I admit that the old age pensioner gets some relief through the county council, 1/6 in some counties and 2/6 in other counties according to the decision of the local authority, but that is not sufficient to meet the needs of the recipients and it is not in keeping with the standard that should be recognised by a Christian State.  These people are to a certain extent helpless and dependent upon the State.</P>
    <P>Taxation is on the increase.  I would not object to increased taxation if the country were benefiting from increased taxation.  It may be argued by the Government and Fianna Fáil Deputies that the people are benefiting and that this country is better off than it has ever been.  There is a kind of superficial wealth in existence here at present.  It is only a temporary affair resulting from the influx of visitors and larger circulation of emigrants' wages. All these factors have helped to create artificial wealth and artificial prosperity. We do not know for how long it will remain.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the country has improved very little in the past ten or 11 years.  If a country is improving and if a genuine claim can be advanced for increased taxation, one would expect the population to be increasing, one would expect increased production, less emigration, better housing conditions and all the things that point to prosperity.  It does not follow that the country is prosperous because more people attend dances, that receipts from entertainment tax have gone up, that more people frequent cafés and hotels.  These things are no indication that the country is better off than it has been for a considerable time.  Emigration is greater to-day than it has been for a considerable <Col N="72" /> time.  It is not correct to say that that is due to propaganda on the part of Opposition Deputies and Opposition Parties.  As long as I remember, there has been emigration from this country, and I am sure there are older Deputies than I am who have always understood that the greatest industry in this country was emigration and that our surplus unemployed men and women found employment either in the United States of America or some other Continent or in Great Britain.  We are told by those who know that we have a lower marriage rate and a lower birth rate.  All these things point to the failure of Government and the failure of Government policy.  I did say that I would not object to taxation if there existed good reason for it and if we were benefiting by it.  Millions are spent on social services, which in some instances can be described as an insult to those who receive them, such as dole, unemployment assistance, vouchers for food, for free fuel.  Young men and women, married men and married women, have to descend to that standard and have to line up at the labour exchanges in the cities and towns and at the local barracks in small towns and rural areas for that type of assistance.  That is the cause of increasing taxation and the State is not benefiting from it in so far as there is no development.  There is nothing in respect of which one could say: &ldquo;We have spent so many millions and here is the result.&rdquo;  The millions that are spent in that form of subsistence allowance and health schemes are not appreciated.</P>
    <P>It is dealing with the problem in a piecemeal manner and there is no thanks to any Government or any Party that initiates such a scheme.  The people have a certain sense of pride and when a Government brings people down to that standard, where they lose all pride and self-respect, and become a burden on the ratepayer and the taxpayer, they are no longer worthy citizens because they lose confidence in themselves and in the country to which they belong.  Certainly, they lost confidence in the Government ruling the country.  When we talk about increases in wages, we are told that we are constantly <Col N="73" /> comparing the wages received in Great Britain with the wages payable here and that it would be well for us to recognise that we are not in a position to pay the same wage as is paid to the worker in Britain.  We are told that we should try to set a headline by bringing home to the workers that, living in the environment in which they like to live, having the security and the happiness of home life and being able to visit their friends and parents, are an offset to the increased wage which the worker in the same position would receive in Great Britain &mdash; a difference of, perhaps, £1 or 30/- per week.  There may be something to be said for that contention but, if we are to adopt that attitude, we shall have to commence with the highest paid servants of the State and work down.  We cannot ask workers to accept that principle until we ourselves have set the example.  The example must be set by the Government of the day.  I am convinced that considerable economies could be effected in expenditure. If the Government carefully examined every detail of administration, they could save from £3,000,000 to £4,000,000.  I have heard the Taoiseach, time and again, speak of the necessity of paying large salaries to men holding very important positions, such as High Court judges and eminent doctors and professors, in order to get good service. In order that these men may discharge their duties honestly and above board, we are told that we must pay them salaries in keeping with the dignity of their professions or positions. There may be something in that but, if there is, how are we to expect the young man behind the counter of a lounge bar or a business house in O'Connell Street or down the country to discharge his duties honestly and above board on a very small wage?</P>
    <P>How are we to expect him to be honest to his employer if we cannot expect the man who sits in the High Court to discharge his duties honestly and according to the dictates of his conscience unless he receives a large, salary and if we cannot expect a civil servant who may have an important executive post to discharge his duties honestly unless he receives a salary far in excess of what this country can <Col N="74" /> afford?  I do not believe that for a moment.  I believe that, if a man is inclined to be dishonest, he will be dishonest irrespective of the wage or salary he is paid.  If he is inclined to be honest, he will be honest no matter how small his salary.  It depends on his upbringing.  A man who is brought up to be honest will be honest even if he has to work for nothing and, if his upbringing be different, he will be dishonest no matter how much you pay him.</P>
    <P>We, of the Clann na Talmhan Party, have made an effort, as young Deputies, new to debate, to set a decent headline, to forget political controversy and to try to get the Government to realise their responsibilities. We have spoken about the necessity of increasing the old age pension, of improving the provision relating to widows and orphans and other sections who are unable to live in comfort owing to the smallness of their income or other circumstances. When we have done this, we have been asked by the Minister for Finance if, when Budget day comes along, we will be prepared to increase taxation to meet the necessary money to effect these reforms.  I admit, frankly, that if we demand increases in old age pensions and other social services, it means an increase in taxation.  While acknowledging that, we have made it quite clear that, if we had responsibility for administration, we would, by careful administration, by reduction of salaries, by reduction of staffs in certain Departments and avoidance of overlapping, waste and redundancy, be able to make considerable economies in order to provide for the old age pensioners and other sections who would benefit by our better social services. Take, for instance, the amount of money wasted in the upkeep and maintenance of this House.  Take the way business is carried on here.  Little is known by the ordinary man or woman of that.  If they did know it, nothing would convince me but that we would have a revolt.  Men are brought a distance of almost 200 miles for two days' work, lasting from 3 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>A considerable sum is spent in travelling expenses in that way.  Look at the <Col N="75" /> amount of paper wasted.  It may be said that I am talking foolishly, that these things would mean the saving of only a few shillings or a few pounds or a few thousand pounds and what is that out of £57,000,000?  But if every sum of £5,000 and every sum of £100 and even every shilling could be saved and set aside, and if the economies we have in mind were effected, the amount involved would run into millions.  These millions could be used for the betterment of that section of the community which demands the attention of the Government now or in the near future. In fact, the attention of the Government should have been given to that long ago, if the Government had their interest at heart.</P>
    <P>In regard to investigation officers, what sum of money is spent on them, in making inquiries in connection with the means test?  I am sure a simpler method could be adopted.  If this is a Budget to solve unemployment, what particular plans does the Government intend to introduce this year?  There is very little money voted here for drainage or forestry.  There is something like £40,000 for forestry, but there is something over £40,000 for airports. I acknowledge the importance of airports, but the number employed there could not be compared with the number who could be employed on large-scale afforestation.  Thousands would be needed for afforestation, while it is only a matter of hundreds on the construction and preparation of airports. Drainage is very essential to agricultural production and legislation went through this House some two years ago, supported by all Parties, including the Government Party &mdash; in fact, that legislation was sponsored by the Party which I represent, due to the propaganda inside and outside this House &mdash; yet we find that no move has been made by the Government to implement that legislation.  The same applies to rural electrification and to the sanatoria which come under the Sanatoria Act.  If these things were put into operation, it would help to solve unemployment and keep our young men and women at home.  We see no promise of that in the Budget and no provision or allowance for these things.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> Another thing &mdash; which may not be exactly relevant &mdash; is the loans to farmers. I note that it is the well-off farmer who can get a loan.  A short time ago, I knew a young man who made application for a small loan of £30 and was refused because he had only one cow, one this and one that. Must you have 20 cows, machinery, money in the bank and a good reference from some outstanding citizen in the area, in order to get a loan?  It looks like that, from my experience of it.  Then, the interest you have to pay is far in excess of what anybody can afford.  One must take into consideration the interest you would get if you put money into the bank.  These are the things the Government must recognise and tackle; and if they do not do it some other Party or Government will have to do it.  The Government must recognise that the people are gradually beginning to lose confidence in them.  They bring up big schemes of planning and development, but they are very slow in putting them into operation.  While they are constantly talking about emigration, unemployment and other evils, no remedy for them is being introduced. The Government tries to tell us that the emigration which has taken place is due to the war and that there was a slight improvement prior to the war. I deny that, from my own experience. There was no improvement before the war, no improvement within my memory.  I am not accusing the Government which is at present on those benches, as the Party which sat there before them was just as responsible, having laid the foundation. The strange thing about it is that they were followed by a Party which intended to alter that foundation.  However, if the foundation is bad, you must pick it out and remove it in order to set in another.  The present Government built on that bad, boggy foundation and as a result it will be necessary to remove that before a new foundation can be set.</P>
    <P>The country cannot be prosperous if you have thousands of unemployed, thousands dependent on State assistance on a small scale, merely sufficient to keep body and soul together.  The country can be prosperous only if the <Col N="77" /> citizens are put to work in increasing production.  I want to inform the Parliamentary Secretary, who is representing the Minister at the moment, that this Party believes in the development of agriculture, in increasing agricultural production, in better wages for the agricultural worker, on condition that, in return, the farmer receives a better market for his produce.</P>
    <P>We also believe in implementing a large-scale scheme of afforestation and drainage, which would engage a large number of unemployed in the towns and cities and in rural Ireland.  The farm improvements scheme is a good one, inasmuch as it encourages the farmer to brighten up his home life, to improve his land by drainage, fencing and so on, but we will have to be more progressive and start out on a scheme of land reclamation on a large scale, adding to the present acreage millions of acres of arable land so that we can resettle thousands of young men on that reclaimed land and have it turned into fertile land for the purpose of production.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, we need increased housing and that problem cannot be tackled in a piecemeal fashion.  Thousands of houses are required, as the accommodation is deplorable not only in the City of Dublin, of which I have very little experience, but in the towns and villages where one cannot get a house for love or money at present.  Rural houses should be planned on a more modern scale altogether. They are 100 years behind the times, being built according to a deplorable plan, and they are no credit to any Government which claims to be modern and progressive, and to have the interest of the rural worker at heart.  No one can be anything but disappointed with the type of house built in the last ten or 15 years, as far as planning and design are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>These are just things I want to point out to the Minister.  I recognise the value of the grant <Col N="78" /> towards aiding the farmer in relation to his rates, but I want Government Deputies, and particularly the Minister, to understand that that will be offset when the cost of the administration of the Public Health Bill has to be met. If the farmers are to benefit from that grant, they can well thank the sponsors of it.  It was only after much criticism and hard work that we convinced the Minister of the necessity for such a grant, notwithstanding that, time and time again, he and his colleagues told the country that the Opposition has no constructive criticism to offer, that they are destructive and that he has to depend on a man like Deputy Corry, as an authority on agriculture and land division, to guide the Minister for Agriculture and the whole of the Cabinet along lines most suitable for the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not take much notice of what comes from the lips of Deputies of that type.  I hope that in future when Ministers are speaking, inside or outside the House, they will recognise that the criticism that comes from these benches is criticism which we have been asked to put up by those who sent us here, namely, the farmers and the business people and that they will not have to eat their words at a later date when, after we have convinced them of its necessity, they will have to implement a scheme on lines which we advocated, as the Minister for Finance has had to do in this Budget.  I ask, would it not be more appropriate for the Minister to take into consideration the man who smokes an ounce of tobacco, the man who drinks a pint of beer, the man who likes tea?  These are the commodities in respect of which the people expected a remission of taxation as a result of the ending of the war and the emergency.  These are the things which people expected would be affected by a reduction in taxation.  But no; it is the man who has an excessive salary, the man whom the Minister for Finance thought it necessary to force to pay an income-tax of 7/6 in the £, whom the Minister relieves under this Budget.  He will relieve that &ldquo;guy&rdquo; irrespective of how the Budget hits the man who has to pay double the price for his ounce of tobacco.  I remember <Col N="79" /> when, even in my time, it was only 7d. an ounce, and now it is 1/3.</P>
    <P>You forget about the individual who may not have sufficient to purchase a pint of beer after he has finished a hard day's work in the bog, the quarry or the factory, although, mark you, the majority of the community are made up of individuals of that type.  These were the men who time and time again shouted &ldquo;Up Fianna Fáil&rdquo; and put you on those benches.  Drunk with your own power, you have forgotten about them.  Now you are prepared to take into consideration only the minority, the well-to-do, the man who can afford to go to the Metropole or to some other big ballroom in Dublin with a lady on his arm, or those who can throw a party at a cost of £500 or £600 and invite anything up to 1,000 guests. These are the people the Minister thought were over-taxed but the poor old people, the slaves on the land working for £2 a week or on the bog for 37/6&mdash;the privileged section of the community, as they were described by the Minister for Local Government &mdash; the bog worker, and the road worker must continue to pay war prices for their cigarettes, their tobacco, their pint of beer, their ounce of tea and everything they require for the maintenance of themselves and the offspring they are responsible for rearing.</P>
    <P>Yet we find Deputies from my own constituency having the impertinence to stand up and say that this is a Budget for a working-class people. Nonsense, ridiculous!  This is a Budget for the rich and for the exploitation of the poor.  However, there are only a few more years to go until the people get an opportunity of knowing right from wrong.  I think they have learned a lesson already.  It has been a costly lesson and it took a long time to educate them but better late than never. They will be more awake to the fact next time that the Government which they elect is responsible for the administration of the country and they will see that their requirements are first met and not those of a well-to-do minority who do not know how happy they are at the present moment in comparison with that large section of the <Col N="80" /> community who are in a desperate state because of unemployment, small wages and other conditions which I could continue to enumerate for a considerable time.  We shall take the opportunity on the Estimates to deal in detail with certain Departments and to point out where reductions can be made, how they can be made and why they should be made, not only in staffs but in salaries and other expenses which have brought about an increase in nearly every single Estimate without any reasonable explanation being offered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, Sir, but I am wondering is that why they are ashamed to come into the House.  I am, I suppose, the poorest Deputy in the House.  I have no means, I have no land and from that point of view I am better qualified to speak on the Budget than any Deputy here &mdash; as a man who had to work for wages up to 1943.  I notice that Deputy Moran, a Fianna Fáil Deputy for Mayo, in his speech last week said: &ldquo;I hope that every Budget the Minister will have to introduce will be as popularly received throughout the country as this.&rdquo; He is a man who is a lawyer, a well-to-do man who is going to benefit as a result of this Budget, but I should like to know how much it has meant for the poor people.  Is there any reduction in the price of flour, which is 4/- a stone to-day, or in the price of bran or pollard?  There is no reduction in the price of bacon, which is still 3/- per lb., or no reduction in the price of butter, and we know that butter is almost unobtainable.  Eggs are out of the question so far as working people are concerned.  We find, on <Col N="81" /> the other hand, that the tax on petrol is reduced, income-tax is reduced and that the dance tax is abolished.  By the abolition of the dance tax there is a remission of £65,000 in taxes.  Why could that £65,000 not be used to supplement the allowances to widows, who are trying to live on a non-contributory pension of 5/- per week?</P>
      <P>When the Minister entered the House on Wednesday last all of us were interested to know what was in his Budget bag.  The income-tax payers and the men with the motor cars had the news from Radio Éireann that night that the income-tax and the tax on petrol had been reduced, but the poor people with no wireless set had to wait until they saw the newpapers in the morning, and then they found &mdash; the old age pensioners, men on the dole and men tied down under the standstill Order with £2 per week &mdash; that they had got nothing.  The tax on whiskey and wines went up, but the tax on petrol was reduced.  The man who could afford to run a motor car around the country would not mind paying a little more for his whiskey and wine when he found that 6d. was being taken off the price of petrol and a 1/- off his income-tax.  The Budget represented a good bargain for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards turf, the poor people throughout the country have gone through hell on earth during the last four or five years in trying to use it. The price is now reduced by 10/- a ton. That does not mean very much to poor people who buy turf by the bag or by the stone, but it means a saving of £3 a year to the man who, on his ration, buys 6 tons of it.  The poor people will only benefit to the extent of ¾d. Per stone.  Deputy Moran is making a great mistake if he thinks that this Budget is very popular with the people, especially the poor.  National health benefit remains at 15/- a week, the figure at which it was fixed when Mr. Lloyd George introduced that measure. If a man is out of work sick a lady, or some high official, comes down in a big car to visit him.  The official puts up in a hotel.  If the sick person happens to be out of his house getting a mouthful of air when the official calls, the <Col N="82" /> insurance benefit is cut off, and his case goes before a court of referees which sits in some hotel with another high official down from the Department. These are all the great things that the people on the opposite benches speak about.</P>
    <P>Those people are in a privileged position. They are either drawing some other salary or engaged at some other business during the day &mdash; it may be in the Four Courts.  They then come in here and tell the people that this is a great Budget.  There was no one, I think, more disappointed with the Budget than the old age pensioners and the widows when they discovered that they were getting no relief under it, after all the promises that had been made.  At the last by-election in my constituency I saw henchmen of Fianna Fáil and Ministers going from house to house saying to the people: &ldquo;Vote for our candidate and we will increase your pensions; we will give you every concession&rdquo;. They told the old I.R.A. men the same thing &mdash;&ldquo;Vote for Fianna Fáil this time and we will see that your claim will be fixed&rdquo;.  Their claims are still unsettled.</P>
    <P>During the last five or six years we had some great military displays.  We had the Tattoo, we had the Navy and the Army.  Where do we find the men who served the State in the Army to-day? They are unemployed and will be on the march very soon when the few shillings they got at the time of their demobilisation are spent.  We had promises about post-war planning, but there is no sign of any work being started.  One meets those men on the way to the exchanges.  They ask: &ldquo;Are the Government starting work again, or are they going to allow us to go away?&rdquo; I see from the newspapers that the Irishmen in Great Britain are going to be sent home.  Is the Taoiseach, who has got a majority behind him, going to remain silent because he has that majority?  Is he not going to make any move in regard to housing, drainage, rural electrification, or is he going to wait until there is another war to solve the unemployment problem, as he has done in the past?</P>
    <P>We have heard nothing from the Government Party on this Budget.  I <Col N="83" /> do not know what the new Minister for Finance is going to say in answer to all that has been said from this side on it.  If something is not done for the unemployed before the winter sets in, I am afraid they will become desperate.  They are not going to stand on the streets in queues for a miserable dole.  That day is gone.  The majority of them served in the Army for the past six years, and during that time their wives and families had separation allowances.  Are they to go back again to their former miserable existence?  If the Government do not get a move on, it may be that something may occur which I would not like to see happening in this country. You could have a revolution.  That has happened in other countries.  You could have the unemployed marching on the county councils and on Leinster House as they did in the past.

      <P>One thing that marks this Budget more than anything else is the fact that, while it purports to give relief to the taxpayer, it is actually making provision to take more money out of the taxpayers' pockets during the current year than was taken last year.  When Deputies talk about this being a good Budget, giving relief to the taxpayers in general, they ought to remember that the Minister has estimated for, and will take, more money from the taxpayers in the current year than was taken last year.  Attention ought to be directed to this fact, that the Government are thinking in millions all the time.  They think in large sums and they appear to have lost completely &mdash; indeed, if they ever had it &mdash; any desire even to attempt to exercise economy in the running of the services of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is estimating for a sum in excess of £1,000,000 per week.  I suggest that this financial statement does not fully cover the demands that will be made on the people.  We know that already many financial burdens that should make their appearance in <Col N="84" /> this financial statement have been shifted on to the rates.  We know that in the coming year, or two years, that particular line of policy will be accentuated.  Can this country, with its production falling, its population falling, its emigration growing and with apparently no possible hope of absorbing its unemployed into useful employment, afford to pay a bill in excess of £1,000,000 a week?</P>
    <P>Let me remind Deputies that the bill now before us is roughly £20,000,000 more than in pre-war days.  Have we additional production to justify that? Will the Minister tell us what have we got for that additional £20,000,000? Have we more people in employment to-day than we had when the bill was £20,000,000 less?  Is the standard of living of the general run of our people, particularly the wage earners and the salary earners, to-day higher than it was in pre-war days?  Not only have we increased the annual bill by £20,000,000, but we have substantially increased the dead-weight national debt.  We have a bill here running between £53,000,000 and £55,000,000. We have a threat of £24,000,000 for hospitals and public assistance institutions and £21,000,000 for roads.  The Government are thinking not only in millions, but in tens of millions.</P>
    <P>We have a Public Health Bill, the cost of which is unknown even to the man who is fathering it, or the Government who are responsible for it. Even the Minister for Finance does not know the extent of the burden which it will place on national taxation. Nobody in this country has even a hazy idea of the burdens which it will place on the rates.  We know of one service under that Bill which the Parliamentary Secretary, when pressed, said would cost between £500,000 and £600,000, which one of his colleagues said would cost £750,000, and which the ordinary member of the House thinks will cost at least £1,000,000.  We know that 50 per cent. of that sum, whether it is £600,000 or £1,000,000, will be placed on the rates.  I believe this country is heading for financial trouble.  Our national housekeeping is costing us nearly double what it was. Our production is no greater &mdash; it is <Col N="85" /> less, as a matter of fact.  We have not any greater number of people in gainful employment.  Our population is falling.  The only thing that is increasing is money.  Money is being poured out in the most wasteful and extravagant way, in a way that is giving us the least return.</P>
    <P>What message of hope do we get from the Minister?  He is the Minister for Finance in a Government that have been 15 years in office.  They have had an unbroken period of 15 years. They came in here and took over a machine that was running.  What is the Minister's message of hope?  He referred to unemployment and emigration in the course of his Budget statement. At the moment I will not enter into the figures which he put before the House.  Those figures have already been dealt with by other speakers.  I will satisfy myself by saying that I do not accept the figures.  After 15 years of a Fianna Fáil Government, here is what the Minister said, regarding unemployment and emigration:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a problem which must be overcome if we are to build a nation completely free, worthy of the endurance of this generation and of the sacrifices of our fathers.  The task is a difficult one, but it is within our capabilities if we try hard enough and are determined to succeed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Fifteen long, weary years, and that is what we are told at the end of that period.  I wonder what thoughts, if any, were going through the Minister's mind when he was setting down that paragraph in his Budget speech?  I wonder did he remember that he became a Minister because he told the people 15 years ago that he had a plan to give employment to every able-bodied person, and that he would do it?  I wonder, when he was asking for more money than his predecessor asked for last year, did he remember that he is sitting where he is as Minister because he told the people that, after careful consideration, and without in any way injuring any of the State services, he could reduce income-tax by at least £2,000,000 per year?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Ministers have short <Col N="86" /> memories and rather hard necks.  We had a demonstration or an illustration of that at Question Time to-day.  We propose to spend £24,000,000 in the provision of hospitals and public assistance institutions.  Is it the Government's intention to make permanent in this country a system of pauperism and to look upon us as a nation which is always going to be disease-ridden?  There is a Public Health Bill going through which will cost an immense amount of money, and, side by side with that, and at the time when it is going through the House, we have the Minister for Local Government and Public Health stating emphatically, in reply to a question no later than last week, that he has no intention of making any provision to increase National Health Insurance benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to this matter and I want to refer to it again. I want to put a case to the Minister and I should like to hear him try to deal with it, or get his colleague to deal with it.  Let me give what is a fairly common case &mdash; a working man with dependents, who has been employed permanently for a period of five, ten, 15 or 20 years and has been doing his best to support his family.  He has been earning £2, £2 10s. 0d. or £3 per week and he is stricken down with illness and is unable to continue working.  He makes a claim for national health insurance benefit to enable him not only to get sufficient nourishment to regain his health but to maintain his dependents. He is to drop from £3 or £2 per week to 15/- per week.  Are we serious when we talk about our concern for the health of the people of this country and, at the same time, make, for the man stricken down with illness, the same provision as was made 30 years ago, when 15/- had the purchasing power of at least three times that amount to-day?</P>
    <P>The truest thing said about this Budget was that it was a clever Budget.  It is, and even the Deputy from Limerick agrees with that.</P>

      <P>Let us not exchange opinions across the House, because I do not want to be tempted. It is easy to tempt me sometimes, but not on this occasion.  I come back again to the main point: where do we propose to stop?  Do we propose to finish at £55,000,000 per year, or are we to go on at the same rate as that of the last four or five years and have an additional £5,000,000 next year?  Does the Minister think he has marked the end of the war sufficiently by giving what purports, as I say, to be relief to the taxpayer, when in fact he intends to take more money out of his pocket, by giving the equivalent of 3d. per week to the average family using sugar?  I do not know what would be <Col N="88" /> the weekly saving in the average household of the 10/- reduction in the price of turf, but I know that the Minister is thereby giving relief to the people out of their own pockets, because he saves £180,000 by leaving more pollard in the flour and he gives relief in the matter of turf to the extent of £250,000.  It would probably be easier and better if he gave the £180,000 as direct relief on flour.  Like other Deputies, I should like to know why turf delivered here in Dublin is still to cost the consumer £2 10s. per ton.  I should like the Miniister to indicate to us what is the total cost of turf per ton here in Dublin, that is, the cost, plus the various subsidies.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I want to refer and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  I do not think there was any reference in the Minister's speech to the State liability in respect of vouchers to farmers for wheat.  That liability must be fairly substantial now.  The last figures I got from the Minister's predecessor in reply to a question showed that the liability at the time was in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000.  I should like to know what it is now, and I should like to know if the Minister can give us any idea as to when these vouchers will be redeemed by the Government, or, rather, when the farmer will be in a position to cash in on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that we have piled up taxation and rates to an extent that is having a paralysing effect on the cost of living and the vast increase in taxation and rates is perhaps the biggest contributing factor to the great increase in the cost of living.  It seems to me that this Government do not intend to make any serious effort to reduce taxation, either national or local.  It is a certainty that both national and local taxation next year will be far in advance of what they are this year.  The Minister is banking on customs.  He hopes that, as a result of the war ending, more dutiable goods will be available, that the people will be able to buy more, and the more they buy the more they will contribute to his taxation chest.  That is the Minister's hope.  If we are to judge by to-day's Order Paper, the Budget does <Col N="89" /> not give us a full picture.  Already we have the Supplementary Estimates starting on to-day's Order Paper.  I suggest to the Minister that it is nearly time we were told where the Government are going, it is nearly time that it would be demonstrated to us that we are getting some real value for this huge amount of money.  I warn the Minister that we will not be satisfied with the old hackneyed answer of more social services and the cost of social services.  Fianna Fáil usually are inclined to boast of social services.  So far as some of the services which they call social services are concerned, they ought to be ashamed of them, because they are necessary only to the extent to which the Government have failed to provide or secure employment for those willing to work.  When the Minister, 15 years after taking office and 12 months after the end of the war, in his Budget statement, says that we have a hard core of 60,000 unemployed on an average in this small State with its falling population, and that, if those able-bodied people who went to Great Britain to secure employment, came back to-morrow, we would have a hard core of 130,000 unemployed, rather than congratulating himself on the state of the country to-day, the Minister has every reason to be ashamed, and so have the Government, because in the essentials we are considerably worse off to-day than we were in pre-war days.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister or anyone else talking about £140,000,000 in the banks.  The Minister knows that real values here have gone down.  The Minister knows something about agriculture and about farming.  The Minister knows that a lot of that money is in the banks to-day, and looked upon as savings and so on, because the farmers were unable to buy the implements or machinery which they were very badly in need of during the last four or five years.  If, to-morrow, adequate machinery, implements, fertilisers and all the other things farmers are so badly in need of were available, a considerable amount of that paper money that is in the banks would disappear out of them overnight. We may have money in the banks, but our capital assets or real assets, in the shape of the fertility of <Col N="90" /> our land, in the shape of machinery, implements, cars and so on, are very considerably less do-day than they were six years ago.  Nobody knows that better than the Minister.  I am sure the Minister has as good a general knowledge of conditions in this country as the next person.  But, do not let us be fooled, because the Minister purported to give certain slight reliefs, into thinking that we have a good Budget or that there is any retrenchment so far as the Government are concerned.  Let me finish by repeating, because it cannot be repeated too often, that the bill to run this country for the next 12 months will be bigger than it was for the last 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the usual speeches which we hear every time a Budget is introduced in this House by a Finance Minister.  I think Deputies have spoken on every aspect of the Budget's proposals and, therefore, I only intend to mention one or two matters in connection with the Budget in regard to which I feel some slight disappointment.  That disappointment is shared by many income-tax payers and many who are not income-tax payers.  We have 1/- taken off income-tax and a relatively few people will benefit.  But we have another class of taxpayer or ratepayer in this country who, apparently, is nobody's child.</P>
      <P>I refer to the middle-class person who has to keep up a certain appearance on anything between £400 and £500 per year, let him be a civil servant, a municipal officer, or somebody who has retired on an annuity or pension. His income remains static and no account appears to be taken of him except at election times, when, of course, everybody promises that type of citizen that his case will get some consideration after the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another citizen who suffers in that respect &mdash; and I can mention my own case, with which, of course, I am more familiar than the case of anyone else; what happens to me happens to dozens and dozens of people in this country &mdash; is the man who has been paying a relatively small sum in income-tax and <Col N="91" /> who loses his wife and has to employ a housekeeper.  That person does not get a penny relief in his income-tax in respect of his housekeeper unless she is looking after children for whom he is entitled to get some relief in income-tax. That widower must have sons or daughters in respect of whom he is entitled to claim some relief in income-tax, otherwise he has to pay the full tax paid by a bachelor or spinster.  It will be conceded that the widower has to keep a decent house and keep up a decent appearance and that he should be the subject of more solicitude than the ordinary bachelor.  No attempt has been made to deal with a case of that kind.  I know of dozens of cases of that kind.  I can speak with some authority because of the fact that I am a victim of the system myself.</P>
    <P>We have had very severe criticisms about what will happen as a result of the 6d. per gallon taken off petrol. Alarming statements were made, one of them being to the effect that as much as 25/- per gallon was paid for petrol in the black market.  I think a statement of that kind would not be made without some foundation in fact. I am aware that a very large number of petrol coupons have been stolen in the post.  I am aware also that some prosecutions have taken place.  I know of a case where a milk vendor got no petrol coupons for about three months. Although these coupons were posted to his address, he never received them. Of course, he went through the usual procedure of writing to the Department, pointing out that he had not got his coupons and he had to send in a deposition to the effect that if these coupons turned up he would return the ones he got in exchange.</P>
    <P>There is some kind of organisation of thieves in this country which, apparently, watches the letter boxes and must know the dates on which these coupons are sent out.  These coupons are stolen in the post.  I am not suggesting that anybody in the post office steals them.  But they are stolen and somebody is doing it.  I am aware that it is difficult to get after these criminals, but I fear there is laxity somewhere. I do not believe it is in the <Col N="92" /> case of either post office officials or in the case of police officers but it must be somewhere else.  I think the Minister should cause an inquiry to be made to find out where that somewhere else is.  Now I do not wish to develop this question of turf very much but I have a feeling that when you took off this 10/- you were at the same time going to get that back by way of a subsidy and, if it is by way of a subsidy, then that subsidy must come out the tax-payer's pocket.  It is not the Minister for Finance who pays that subsidy.  It is not the Government who pays it.  It is the citizens of this country.  It reminds me of the old story of the dog being fed on a bit of his own tail.  We are asked to pay a subsidy of 10/- in order to enable the retailers of turf in the City of Dublin and elsewhere to sell it to the consumer at £2 14s. 0d. a ton.  I would ask some of the farmer Deputies here to explain to this House what sweat and toil and labour is put into the production of a ton of turf. I am sure there would be a very big difference between the price at the bog and the price to the consumer in Cork or Dublin.  The unfortunate producer gets very little.  Somebody in between is skimming all the cream.  A statement was made here in this House that some of the hauliers have practically become millionaires, relatively speaking.  It was said here by a responsible Deputy that if you got any kind of rickety old lorry and got into this business of hauling turf in a few months your fortune was made.  I believe myself that that is an exaggeration. Now there is 6d. a gallon coming off the petrol.  That will be advantageous to these hauliers who have already made so much money in this business.  Undoubtedly it is a fact that many of them made huge fortunes hauling turf.  Undoubtedly they will make bigger fortunes now because they will use more petrol in distributing more turf and they will put more money in their own pockets.</P>
    <P>No attempt has been made in this Budget to help the unfortunate person for whom we all profess so much lip sympathy &mdash; the unfortunate unemployed man and the unfortunate working-man. I do not altogether share some of those views myself because I <Col N="93" /> have a feeling that many unemployed are better off than some of our working men.  I do not say all.  I am speaking now of the hard-working, honest, thrifty, prudent, working men in the country, many of whom are existing on anything from £2 to £3 a week.  How they are able to exist on that, living in close proximity to cities and large towns &mdash; three or five miles outside the city areas of Dublin and Cork &mdash; I do not know.  There was no attempt made in this Budget to relieve the working man or other low salaried people.  We are not told in what way the price of a suit of clothes has been reduced.  I speak of the working man.  I shall drop this term now because some people regard the working man as one who does not wear a collar.  Let us take the white-collar fraternity, which have been mentioned so often &mdash; the men on £300 to £400 a year &mdash; who because of their status have to keep up appearances. Let us see what happens in their case. A man in that particular sphere of life cannot get a suit of clothes under £10 to £12.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>And lingerie, if you like.  Let us take the case of the children.  We all know the pride an Irish mother takes in preparing her child for First Holy Communion or Confirmation.  I may be described as heretical if I say that I think a lot of it is tommy-rot.  That is my own personal view.  A little child would be just as welcome to Almighty God if he were clad in rags.  It is just another sample of our native Irish pride and Molly McSwiney wants to be as good as Mary McCarthy.  Now let us examine what happens.  Seven years ago that child could have been appropriately dressed and presented for the Sacraments for a matter of 16/-.  To-day it takes anything up to £6 6s. to £8 8s.  That is what I have been told by people who ought to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the working-class woman whose <Col N="94" /> husband has an income of £4 a week all the year round in permanent employment.  She wants to prepare, we will say, two children, one for First Holy Communion and the other for Confirmation.  What happens?  She has to run into debt.  She gets the money from a moneylender to provide her children's outfits and she spends the next four or five years paying off that debt at the rate of a few shillings a week.  It was proved conclusively on the Moneylenders' Commission that sat some years ago &mdash; on which my colleague Deputy Morrissey served for some time &mdash; that very high rates of interest were charged to the people and that clothes were supplied to those people on a weekly payment system.  I would ask the Minister what it means to the working-class man and his wife who starve themselves in order to equip their children suitably for this purpose. I can quite understand that pride just as I can quite understand and sympathise with the pride of the man who does not want to go into the workhouse, call it any name you like &mdash; county home or house of recovery.  He does not want to end his days there.  Sometimes he is censured for that attitude.  It is pride, but, as I say, I can sympathise with him.  I can find little in this Budget in which the Minister can take any pride.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the widows and orphans.  I now want to mention another body of our people who carry heavy domestic responsibilities and for whom no provision has been made.  I refer to the single men &mdash; good citizens &mdash; who also shoulder responsibilities for the maintenance and care of others as well as themselves.</P>
    <P>Now, I would ask the Minister to take careful note about what has been said in regard to the profiteers in petrol.  To be told that 25/- per gallon is being offered in this country for petrol is certainly a menacing situation. One Deputy said here to-day that certain persons have an allowance of eight gallons per month.  Some of them are using that much in a week. Where are they getting it?  They are getting it in the black market.  I do not know that any successful efforts <Col N="95" /> have been made to bring about the abolition of the black market or to punish the offenders.  I am, of course, aware that it has been done in the case of gold and other activities that have taken place recently.  The sooner the Minister gets after these racketeers in petrol the better it will be for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Reliefs have been granted in relation to dances and ceilidhes and so on.  That is quite all right.  I do not find any fault with that except that I have a rooted objection to the whole tendency at the present moment in that direction.  I have often gone to dances myself and possibly I have gone in for far more branches of sport than any other member in this House.  I would not like that anything which I am now going to say should be misconstrued and that I would be told that I am a kill-joy.  But I do not feel that it is quite right to take this tax off.  If the amount that will be saved were diverted into another channel &mdash; it is roughly in the region of £65,000 it might mark some step forward in the social life of this country.  But I consider that there is at the moment a very dangerous development taking place inasmuch as we have too many dance halls and too many cinemas.  In the City of Cork some years ago there was a huge fire which burned out a building extending over a quarter of an acre of ground.  To my amazement, and the amazement of a lot of the citizens of Cork, we discovered that that site was to be used for a new cinema.  I should not like to curb decent and fair competition, but an estoppel should be put to the creation of dance halls, jazz halls, pitch and toss clubs and all such things.  That is a bad development.  If we go down the back lanes to the 3d., 4d. and 6d. entrances to cinemas in some of the smaller towns we find long queues, especially on Sundays, composed of persons who in many cases can ill-afford to part with the sum demanded in order to see those American and other films.  I am not a pious person but I do feel that something should be done in regard to this matter and that instead of taking the tax off such places it should be put on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> The less cocktail bars and glass-houses of that character there are in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere the better it would be for all of us but, as long as it brings grist to the mill of our Minister for Finance, apparently, he does not care.  I would ask the Minister to show any justification for putting an extra tax on the glass of malt. It is the ordinary consumer who pays. I am certain the Minister would not be averse to buying a couple of &ldquo;balls of malt&rdquo; on an evening, and that he would inquire as to why he did not get another 4d. change.  The Minister may tell me that he wants to export whiskey for dollars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget has been dealt with extensively by Deputies on every side of the House.  Any relief it contains will be welcomed by every section of the community.  There are certain reliefs given in the Budget which should have been diverted to a certain section of the community.  I shall deal first with the reduction of the tax on petrol and fuel oil.  That relief will benefit to a considerable extent the community at large, transport companies, hackney men, haulage contractors, agricultural merchants.  The reduction in the price of petrol to the private consumer or to the individual who uses his car for pleasure should not have been allowed at this particular period.  Instead, there should have been an increase to the old age pensioner and to other unfortunate but deserving sections of the community. Deputy Anthony has mentioned that petrol is being purchased at prices up to 25/- a gallon.  I do not disagree, and I think car users would be quite satisfied to pay any price for petrol provided they had an opportunity of having their pleasure and enjoyment.  It was unfair that relief should be created for such a section of the community, who can well afford to have their pleasure, while there is no consideration for old age pensioners and widows and orphans. The means test is still in operation and these pensioners are given no opportunity of bettering their position. The cost of living has increased and the value of the 10/- to the individual concerned is much less than it <Col N="97" /> was five or six years ago.  If the relief that is being given on petrol to private users had been diverted to that purpose, it would have been a much better day's work.</P>
      <P>In regard to the relief given to transport carriers, Córas Iompair Éireann and other haulage contractors, I hope it will be distributed so that the community as a whole will benefit.  Bus fares, train fares and freight charges on agricultural produce are much too high and I hope that this reduction in the tax on petrol will automatically benefit the community.  In regard to the haulage of sugar beet, it is a well-known fact that the freight charges imposed by Córas Iompair Éireann on the producer are responsible for reducing the amount of sugar produced in the country.  I hope that the reduction in the cost of petrol and fuel oil will mean a reduction in freight charges on that particular commodity.</P>
      <P>In connection with the reduction of 1d. a pound in the price of sugar, in my opinion that will not bring any immediate relief to the community, having regard to the fact that it will mean to the average household about 3d. per week.  If that 1d. per pound were put into production, by way of an increase in the price of the raw material, that is, beet, it would bring about relief and create a better atmosphere throughout the country in general.  It would represent about 10/- a ton increase for sugar beet and would have the effect of increasing the acreage considerably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am basing it on 10/- a ton.  That would encourage the producer to cultivate a greater acreage of beet, which would have the effect of creating more employment in the sugar factory and for the haulage contractor and in the production of agricultural machinery and having that employment over a longer period.  The value of that 1d., spread over a very large field of activity, would be felt in the country in general and would benefit the Exchequer.  If it were spent in that practical way, it would create more <Col N="98" /> relief, increase the ration of sugar, and the community as a whole would appreciate it more than the reduction of 1d. per pound in the price of sugar.</P>
      <P>That reduction might be all right as a cross-road argument but the matter has to be regarded from the practical viewpoint &mdash; the viewpoint of increased production.  Increased production is what we want.  What will be the increased production by reason of that 1d. per lb.? We all know that the by-products of sugar beet can be used for the production of live stock, milk, butter and so on.  Agricultural production has gone down.  Taking the creamery returns of a week ago, the production of milk has gone down to the extent of 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 gallons per year.  If production goes down this year at the same rate as it went down last year, the people will be without any butter in a year's time. They will hardly have enough milk for their tea.  The Government would be wise to look ahead and encourage production, even if taxation has to remain as it is.  If taxation should remain as it is you would have, with that increased production, the money in circulation and the community as a whole would benefit.  That 1d. per lb. may seem a small thing to us but we should take into consideration the relief it would bring to the people.  It would mean millions in production throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the question of the relief of rates.  Every ratepayer will welcome any relief in rates.  But, putting the Public Health Bill side by side with the relief given in the Budget, what will the cost be to the ratepayer?  The Public Health Bill will place a burden on the ratepayers greater in amount than the relief being given in the Budget.  It would be much better if the Government were to operate the public health measure nationally and leave the rates as they are. Virtually every piece of legislation which is going through is throwing a burden on the ratepayers year after year.  It would take millions by way of grants to place the ratepayer in a position to carry on.  We are never told, even by the Minister for Local <Col N="99" /> Government, what the maximum amount is which the ordinary ratepayer will be able to bear.  I think that we are heading for a collision and that, in a short time, the ordinary rural ratepayer will not be in a position to meet the demands that will be made upon him.</P>
    <P>As regards housing, a little provision is being made, but what is the position in rural Ireland?  Very little housing is available to keep the workers in the rural areas.  That is the general complaint of farmers who want to budget for better production in the future. They cannot get labour.  A week ago, at the show, farmers from all over the country were looking for some type of machinery which would enable them to cope with the problem, because they cannot get labour.  I do not blame the worker.  The ordinary agricultural worker is recognised as the mainstay of the country and he is working in the main industry of the country.  Still, his wages are abnormally low.  He should be placed in a position equal to that of the wage-earner in a rural industry.  No housing is to be obtained in the rural areas.  At a recent meeting of our county council, we found that we could not get timber even to repair the cottages.  If that be the position, there would seem to be no hope of getting timber in the near future for new cottages.  The questions of housing and decent wages are those which affect the rural worker most and the same applies to the farmer.  The farmer cannot budget for production unless he can get suitable and satisfied labour.</P>
    <P>We have the Public Health Bill passing through this House.  Many county councils are crying out for greater hospitalisation.  What is the need for it all?  You have the Public Health Bill and the hospitals dealing with people affected with disease.  Why not provide decent houses and a decent wage for people in the country, so that they may build themselves and their families up?  Reference was made by Deputy Morrissey to the rural worker in receipt of £2 or £3 a week.  If he becomes ill, he and his wife and dependents must live on 15/- per week. <Col N="100" /> Some provision should be made by the Minister for Finance whereby the insurance benefit payable to a man who falls ill and is unable to earn would be equal to the wages he had been previously receiving, so that he would be able to maintain his family to the same standard.  He cannot hope to build up his health and the health of his children on a sum of 15/- a week.  I hope that the Minister will see that such cases are provided for and that better provision will be made for housing in the rural areas.  I hope also that farmers will be placed in a position to pay rural workers a decent rate of wages, so that they will be able to provide properly for their families. That would bring much-needed relief to the rural community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This being my first Budget and, incidentally, my first Budget speech, I feel somewhat nervous in tackling the subject.  Perhaps it will be refreshing for the Minister to learn how people who are not deeply immersed in politics look at the annual Budget.  A Government Deputy made the remark that the Budget was one on which the Government could go to the country.  I entirely agree with him, but have not the same idea that he had.  It is a Budget on which the Government could go to the country because, in a very astute way, the Minister for Finance has contrived to give a little relief to each section of the community. I think that he had a motive in that.  After all, it is his first Budget and the first post-war Budget. It was necessary to give relief to all sections of the community in order to show that the Government were making some move to cut down taxation. With Deputy O'Sullivan, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the way he presented the Budget.  Although I was not conversant with these Budget speeches or with the terms of the Budget, I can safely say that I grasped the terms of the Budget and of the speech in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one question I should like to ask.  It is a question I have been asking since I came to the use of poli <Col N="101" /> tical reason.  There is an increase of 1¾d. on a glass of whiskey.  Save in a few branches of commerce, we do not use farthings in this country.  If I go into a publichouse or a hotel and ask for a glass of whiskey&mdash;which is very improbable&mdash;I am quite certain that I shall not be asked to pay 2/1¾ for it, but that I shall be asked to pay 2/2. I should not like to suggest to the Minister for Finance how he should adjust taxation as regards whiskey or any other spirits, but I think the present method is unfair because the public always suffer by it.  On other occasions we have had fractions of this type in taxation of commodities like cigarettes.  The unfortunate public again had to suffer while, if I am not mistaken, the shopkeepers or at least the manufacturers, reaped the benefit of the odd farthing.  Along with their own profit on the increase in taxation, as they will have in this case&mdash;I can be corrected by the Minister if I am wrong&mdash;they will have the additional farthing on the glass of whiskey.  Possibly I mention this in my ignorance of the matter, but if the Minister says that it cannot happen in the present instance, a big section of the community would be satisfied.  My experience in regard to taxation of this kind is unlike that of Deputy Anthony.  I knock about with chaps who are mainly in the habit of going to football matches and dances, and my opinion is that people who can afford to drink whiskey nowadays can also afford to pay another 2d. without any great hardship.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any tribute should be paid to anybody for bringing about a reduction of 10/- per ton in the price of turf, because as many Deputies have pointed out&mdash;I do not want to labour it further&mdash;the price of turf during the emergency, and incidentally the quality of the turf, were an absolute scandal.  The tax on petrol is being reduced by 6d. per gallon and that reduction to people like myself who have the good fortune to own a car is very welcome.  I notice that in the Minister's speech he said that it would be only reasonable to expect that people who ply vehicles for hire should in consequence of this reduction give some concession to the public using these <Col N="102" /> cars.  It is all very fine for the Minister to say that it would be reasonable to expect such concessions but I hope that, if it can be done, a direction will be given to Córas Iompair Éireann to cut their bus fares and their train fares accordingly.  This is definitely a concession to Córas Iompair Éireann, as regards buses anyhow, and if it is reasonable to expect that charges will be reduced, it would be still more reasonable to expect that the Government, or whatever Department is concerned, would take up the question at once with Córas Iompair Éireann and insist if necessary that bus charges will be reduced in consequence.</P>
    <P>Another concession which should appeal to younger folk in the country is the abolition of the dance tax in its entirety.  I am for and against the abolition of this tax and I think my argument is very reasonable.  There are in this country, more so than in any other country in Europe, a number of societies, religious, semi-religious, and charitable, who run dances frequently for no purpose except to raise funds for the benefit of the community and for such things as Catholic action, boy scouts, etc.  Dances are also frequently promoted by sports clubs and football clubs.  I am in thorough agreement with the abolition of the tax so far as these people are concerned because if the Minister and his officials knew what it cost to run a dance at the present day they would certainly realise that a whole lot of money cannot be made for these societies if a tax is levied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to pay for the hire of the hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to pay for the hire of the hall, the cost of the band and other expenses.  I am, however, very much surprised to see that the Minister will allow commercial dances to be run free of tax as from the 1st August.  I am of the same opinion as Deputy Anthony in that regard.  I cannot say that I am not a dance fan because I do attend a number of dances but I think it is ridiculous to see a certain type of people&mdash;I shall use no stronger language than that&mdash; coming along to our Irish seaside <Col N="103" /> towns to run dance halls and inducing the unfortunate youth of this country to sweat out their blood dancing, for the sole purpose of profit and that such people should not be subject to any tax.  I am not suggesting that all types of dances should be taxed but in so far as certain people come along to our Irish seaside resorts to conduct dances for their own private gain, I think it is quite a scandal that money which could be derived in the form of taxation from these sources, should be remitted by the State.  The fact that the tax is abolished does not necessarily mean that these people are going to reduce the prices of admission.  The public will still pay the old prices.  This tax would probably bring in about £40,000 which seems a small amount when you take the size of the Budget into account but, with other forms of taxation, it would go a long way towards helping people on whose behalf various pleas were made to-day. I do not know if it is too late to reconsider the matter but if a whole year has to pass during which these people can get off scot free from this tax, I think it is a ridiculous state of affairs and one which should be remedied without delay.</P>
      <P>I am in thorough agreement with the concessions made to farmers in the Budget.  The Minister again stated that he made this concession to farmers to help them to increase the wages of their workers.  In this respect also I think that the Minister should not content himself merely with wishing that the wages of agricultural workers would be increased.  I am sure that it is in his power to suggest subtly to the Agricultural Wages Board that the present wage of £2 per week should be increased by giving a direction to the Department of Local Government and Public Health to increase the wages paid to road workers, because the strong argument we have had in this House for the last two or three months was that the wages of the road worker had always to bear some relation to those of the agricultural labourer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To implement, as it were, the wish which he has expressed in the Budget, <Col N="104" /> he might endeavour to induce the Department of Local Government to increase the wages of road workers and also use his influence to see that the farmers, in consequence of the concession given to them in the Budget, will also raise the rate of wages paid to agricultural labourers.  So much for the concessions in the Budget.</P>
    <P>I do not want to indulge in too much criticism because I can well understand that, as Deputy Flanagan has pointed out, under the present monetary system any Government would be handicapped but efforts should be made in certain directions to improve the conditions under which some of our people are living to-day.  I just stepped into the House as Deputy Anthony raised the question of National Health Insurance. It is not a new experience for Deputy Anthony to have to raise that question and I am sure that if the present policy continues, provided I have the good fortune to come back here in 15 years' time, I shall find some Deputy referring to the same question.  It is not because we are in opposition that we try to give examples of hardship under the present National Health Insurance system.  The Minister I am sure is a humane man and I am sure every Deputy behind him is interested in every one of his constituents.  When Deputy Anthony gives an example of a man who has been in receipt of £3 10s. per week while working and who, when he gets ill, has to exist on 15/- per week, every single person in the country can realise that there is something wrong.  That is the reason why, as some Deputy has pointed out, we have so much tuberculosis in the country.  If a man has it he is not going to say so just for the sake of going into a sanatorium and trying to rear his family on 15/- a week.  Tuberculosis is a disease which does not strike you down.  You have it and you know it, but you can still do some work.  That is what is happening at the present day.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, or any member of the Government, were to go into a foundry where men have to work under rather difficult conditions, they would see there men with pale, drawn, <Col N="105" /> haggard faces, men who were, obviously, suffering from tuberculosis. These men will just not admit that to their families because they know that if they do, they will have to go on National Health Insurance.  In that event, the weekly income will be 21/- a week, or something like that, instead of £3 10s. or £4 a week.  I have not made a study of economics and cannot suggest how that situation can be remedied. I think, however, that the Government should at least try to do something to narrow the difference between the 21/- and the £3 or £4 a week.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Irish Labour Party moved a motion in Private Members' time proposing an increase for old age pensioners.  On this side of the House a number of Deputies got up and made a perfect case for the motion.  On the Government side, the few members who spoke did not speak against the motion.  The Minister himself tried to make a case against it, but he knew in his heart and soul that the old age pensioners were deserving of an increase.  In order to save his face and the Government's face he tried to make that case.  I think it was on the Central Fund Bill that some members of the Fianna Fáil Party made speeches in the course of which they very gently made an appeal to the Minister to increase the old age pensions, thereby demonstrating that just because they were members of the Government Party they could not get up and support a motion which had been moved by a Party on this side of the House.  At the same time, they demonstrated that they had sympathy with the old age pensioners, and that if they were in the Minister's position they would do something for them.  In their Budget speeches, we also had some members of the Fianna Fáil Party again appealing for the old age pensioners.  I think that the latter comprise the only section of the community which did not get an increase during the emergency.  The plight of the old age pensioners is indeed a very sad one.  Every single man and woman renders service to the State, and when they reach the age of 65 or 70 years and are unable to work any longer are obliged to try to live on the 10/- a <Col N="106" /> week, unless they are people of independent means or unless their families are in a position to support them. Any doctor will admit&mdash;I am sure the Minister himself would admit it in private conversation&mdash;that it is impossible for anyone to survive on 10/- a week.  We do not want to give them £4 a week, £3 a week or £2 a week, but something like 25/- or 30/- a week.  I do not think that would be an unreasonable sum for the State to give.</P>
    <P>A number of changes are being made in this Budget.  The expenditure during the coming year will be over £50,000,000.  The Minister, by the manipulation of figures, is granting some concessions, concessions to people who pay income-tax, to those who have cars and indirectly, of course, to Córas Iompair Eireann and to other sections. He has found money for all these concessions but could not find any additional sums for national health, for the old age pensioners or for widows and orphans&mdash;the very people for whom provision should be made in our social services.  I do not agree with certain types of our social services, because I think that, generally speaking, they are a kind of charity and degrade the ordinary individual, but as regards health insurance, old age pensioners and widows and orphans you have there three sections of the community which should and must be catered for by the State.  There is a duty on the State to provide for them and the sooner the payments in respect of these three social services are increased the better and happier the general community will be.</P>
    <P>One could cover a good deal of ground on the Budget, but speaking in general terms, one can say that we can make this country wealthy.  Ireland is renowned for its agriculture because the soil is rich, but we have never exploited the richness of the land.  In point of fact, there are some parts of the country that we do not use at all. My suggestion to the Minister and to the Government is that if they were to utilise the man-power of the country in reclaiming and cleaning the waste and scrub lands that we have, they would be creating even greater wealth than we have.  That land, when reclaimed and cleaned, would be capable of producing <Col N="107" /> more agricultural produce, and, incidentally, giving a lot more employment.</P>
    <P>There is one local matter that I would like to refer to.  Wexford town is an old-established town, and is more or less famous for its manufacture of agricultural implements.  Looking at Wexford to-day it is more or less the same Wexford that I remember 15 or 20 years ago.  Wexford has not progressed. It is not the fault of the town of Wexford that Wexford has not progressed.  Twenty years ago Wexford was progressing, but suddenly that progress stopped because the harbour became defective and was not capable of allowing shipping to enter the town.  This is too large a question for the people of Wexford or the town of Wexford.  It would cost at least £200,000 to improve Wexford harbour.</P>
    <P>The expenditure of that sum would not be wasted, because in consequence of it people who would be industrially-minded, and who had money, would set up factories there.  They would recognise that Wexford town was a place that was accessible by rail and sea, so that the setting up of factories there would enrich the town and its inhabitants.  Now, Wexford is an old town.  People call it a quaint-looking town, but it is going to be quainter and shabbier unless something is done in connection with it in the near future.  Wexford is a sea-coast town, and I mention it as an example of what the Government might do in order to help to promote the nation's progress. This may appear a small thing but it is a big thing so far as Wexford is concerned.  It is the small things that really do matter.  I do not know whose fault it was, but the question of improving Wexford harbour was shelved some seven or ten years ago.  Wexford was famous for its shipping and for the sailors who came out of it, but at the present time we have about three ships a week coming into the port. Those people who were engaged in shipping, or as dock labourers, have to turn to some other trade in order to earn a livelihood.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will enlighten me on some of the important matters I <Col N="108" /> have raised.  As a new Deputy, I would like to congratulate him on the manner in which he presented his Budget. Various sections of the community have spoken to me about the Budget and they told me that it was the first Budget the concessions and ramifications of which they could understand. If he cannot do it this year, I appeal to him to take particular notice next year of the three social services which I mentioned.  I trust that in the present year he will be able to devote a little more attention to housing.  I am afraid I overlooked housing in the course of my remarks.  I think the Minister deserve to be congratulated because of the concessions he proposes to give to local bodies in the matter of housing.</P>
    <P>I am sure he is familiar with the bad housing conditions that exist.  I was absolutely shocked when I first realised how bad the housing conditions are.  I visited practically every house in the towns and villages of County Wexford during the by-election and it was a revelation to me when I saw the conditions that exist.  I thought I was intimate with the people and knew how they lived, but it was not until I went into the houses that I fully realised the conditions in which they are living. It would not be an overstatement to say that whenever a house is declared vacant by the Wexford County Council or Corporation, there are 35 or 40 people applying for it.  In some cases in County Wexford there are three or four families living in a house.  In a lot of cases in Wexford town there are housing conditions of such a nature that even an animal would not be put into the building.  These remarks may seem exaggerated, but I am not making speeches for propaganda purposes. I know that propaganda in this House is not taken very seriously.</P>
    <P>I know there is an urgent need for more houses.  The Minister for Local Government was asked certain questions about housing in Wexford town and the picture he painted with reference to the future of housing was not very rosy.  We are led to believe there is a shortage of cement, timber and other building materials.  I think it is only fair that there should be some <Col N="109" /> system of stocktaking throughout the country in order to see what material is available for the purpose of housing the people.  Building materials may be got for places such as cinemas and dance halls and there does not seem to be the slightest trouble in getting these places erected.  I suggest that dance halls, cinemas, clubs and even shops should not be built until the ordinary people are housed in a decent manner.</P>
    <P>This Government had a good housing programme before the war, but there is no indication that they will continue along these lines.  The Minister has done a good deal in his Budget, but I urge him to make it easier still for local bodies to erect houses.  Until we have decent houses we will not have a healthy nation and, when we have a healthy nation, there will be no need for the introduction of such legislation as the Public Health Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is the first Minister of this Government who has made any attempt to give a bit of relief to the agricultural community.  He has very good intentions.  I have been wondering how the word &ldquo;Budget&rdquo; arose.  It is good in parts, as the shy man said when he was asked by the landlady what he thought of the egg.  I would like this Budget to be better in many parts.  Recently our Party proposed that all land should be derated, because it is definitely raw material.  It is the only raw material connected with any industry in this country that is taxed.  I hope the Government will go the whole way and bring in complete derating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to have a fairly good knowledge of agricultural matters.  One thing is daily becoming clearer, and that is that food, clothing and boots are highly important items. In very few countries will money purchase much at the moment.  There are negotiations proceeding for a big loan &mdash;I suppose it will be all paper stuff &mdash;between England and America.  The man in the street can come to only one conclusion, and that is that gold will not clothe you, you cannot make boots out of it and you cannot eat it.  I wonder will the time come when gold <Col N="110" /> will cease to be of any use.  What the world will do then, I cannot say. Definitely, food and clothing are most important items.  The farmers are the food producers.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned here pretty often, and I know it as a farmer, that at the present time you cannot get a man to work on the land.  That is a terrible state of affairs.  If you could introduce something to lessen the drudgery on the farm you would be doing a great thing for the agricultural community.  A slight little touch in the derating line would be a great help. The young fellows working on the farms, the farmers' sons, will not remain on the land.  They ask themselves why should they stay when only one of them can succeed to the farm. They ask you what can be made out of farming.  You hear frequently that the banks are bursting with the farmers' money.  I do not know where it is.  Farmers' sons are not remaining, and they are good judges.  You must make farming more interesting; you must help to pay the man on the land and help to reduce the drudgery of farm life.  As has been remarked more than once, we work from dawn to dark.</P>
    <P>One most important matter was mentioned by the Minister when he used the two words &ldquo;water schemes&rdquo;.  The House has passed an Arterial Drainage Bill and a Bill for rural electrification. These are both very laudable, but the men sitting on these benches will form a peculiar idea of these two matters, in view of the fact that water schemes have been left out.  They are as indissolubly bound as the Siamese twins, and going ahead with rural electrification and arterial drainage without water schemes is like cutting off a leg to cure a corn.  If you give a rural dweller the choice between electricity and a water supply, he will take the water supply and will stick to the dip candle and paraffin.  I do not say that as one who is against electrification.  I lived in the city for over 20 years and I have been farming for 25 years in my native Tipperary. There is not a phase of the domestic or farming use of electricity of which I have not got a fairly good idea, and <Col N="111" /> I suggest that these three matters: electrification, drainage and water supplies, should be collectively and collaterally examined, because it would be a serious mistake to go ahead with arterial drainage and electrification without the other.</P>
    <P>In the booklet on electrification, a beautiful brochure, I notice towards the end the statement that: &ldquo;When your farm is electrified, you can get water from the nearest well.&rdquo;  How far is the nearest well?  It may be half a mile away and 40 families may be getting water for domestic purposes from it.  As a farmer with the dual experience of city and country life, I have often wondered at the mentality which passed those two Bills without provision for proper water schemes.  I have spoken of this matter many times and I suggest that it is one to which particular attention should be paid.  It may shock the House to learn that in no rural school in my native county is there a drop of pure water.  I will give an example of what is happening.  About 400 yards from my house is a national school attended by 70 pupils.  They come to my yard for water which comes from a stream emanating in the Galtees.  The water in that stream was examined by Sir Charles Cameron and would not stand up to analytical tests as pure water.  It is typical of all the streams coming down from the mountains in Tipperary.  I am envied as I have this water supply, which I do my best to purify by filtering it through two or three beds of sand and charcoal.  The water a few yards above, however, would not stand up to the test, and I doubt if the water further down would stand up to it.</P>
    <P>I was recently called in by a farmer who lives about two miles from me. He showed me a creamery churn which had been well cleaned out.  He had got the water from a pump, and, in the bottom of that churn, there were insects of different colours.  Is it not frightful to think of people drinking tea made with such water?  It is no wonder we need tuberculosis hospitals. A rather strange fact is that I mentioned this matter about two years ago <Col N="112" /> in this House and it was taken up by Lord Beaverbrook in his syndicate of papers.  England has now accepted it and a sum of £21 millions has been estimated for England and Wales.  An estimate has also been made for Scotland which very closely resembles this country.  The Twenty-Six Counties would be about the same area.  The rivers may be swifter running in Scotland, but we compare very closely with them in mountains and general contour. A sum of £8 millions has been estimated for Scotland.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be very interested in this because he could probably borrow the money at 5 per cent., or at a much lower rate, such as 4 per cent. or 3½ per cent.  £400,000 would pay the interest on that amount, which would put an adequate supply of pure water into every rural home.  There are 400,000 farmers and the same number of rural dwellings, so that the interest alone could be paid for on the basis of 10/- per house.  Owing to engineering and other difficulties, however, it might run higher, even up to £4 or £5. According to Professor Murphy who carried out an examination of 60 farms in Cork, a farmer and his son would be getting about £80 a year.  The agricultural labourer receiving £104 per year&mdash;and it is nothing to write home to mother about&mdash;may have to go a quarter mile or half mile with a horse and cart and barrel to get water.  On the basis of losing a quarter of a day, it represents £26 a year, and on the basis of a half-day, £52 a year.  I take it on the basis of a half-day lost. Capitalise the cost of keeping a horse and cart and a man.  The man's time represents £52 a year on the basis of his absence and the absence of the horse from the farm.  I was very glad the Minister mentioned this matter because it gave me a chance of developing this point.</P>

      <P>You, sir, are the master.  We will agree to differ, but I definitely related my speech to the water schemes the Minister mentioned for which there is such a great need here at the moment.  Then the Minister has taken 1d. per lb. off sugar. For an average family of five, getting 3¾ lbs. of sugar per week, that would mean a saving of 3¾d; we will call it 4d. for short.  What will they get for that 4d.?  The fact is that there is very little sugar to be got.  A member of the family may be able to get a little bit through the black market, but he is sworn to secrecy.  It has been freely mentioned that people will pay 2/- or 3/- a lb. for sugar.  Even then, you are lucky to get it.  We are dealing with the matter on a hypothetical basis.  I should like to know what is the acreage under beet this year and I intend to put down a question about that.  I think the area under beet is very much less than last year, because there is not a sufficient price paid for the beet.  I suggest that, instead of taking 1d. per lb. off sugar, the 16 per cent. should be added to the price of beet.  All we get for beet in Tipperary, when the carriage is taken off the £4 and the sugar content is taken into account, is from £3 2s. 0d. to £3 6s. 0d., and we have fairly good land in Tipperary. I suggest that a better way to tackle it would be to put the one-sixth on to the £3 6s. 0d. the farmer is getting.  The farmer would then get £3 17s. 0d.  In fact, I suggest that 32 per cent. should be added, which would bring the price to £4 8s. 0d. We would then get sugar to use with all these wild fruits, such as crab apples and blackberries, so as to supplement the meagre butter ration.  It has been mentioned that dry bread is eaten in the homes of poor people. Where are they to get jam?  Instead of taking 1d. per lb. off sugar, I suggest that the 16 per cent. should be added on to the price the farmer is getting for beet.  Money will get you anything, even sugar and tea in the black market.  If you pay the price to the farmer he will produce the beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drudgery of beet growing is unknown <Col N="114" /> except to those who are engaged in it.  You can see these people up to their knees in mud.  It is a slave's life.  There is nothing to equal the drudgery of beet growing.  It is torture to see these people working at it.  It is the last job on this earth.  We are asked: &ldquo;Why do not the farmers grow beet; why do they not give us more butter?&rdquo;  You will have to pay more for the stuff.  You tackled the thing at the wrong end by taking the 1d. per lb. off sugar.  You should have put it on at the other end and give us 16 per cent. more for the beet.  Then you would get sugar.  Even with the 16 per cent. extra, it will take you all your time to get it.</P>

      <P>With the other speakers, I wish to congratulate the Minister on the content and presentation of the Budget. Undoubtedly, he has brought a fresh and competent mind to bear on the financial problems of our national economy.  The reliefs contained in the Budget are generally welcomed and the provision for expansion, particularly in the case of housing and in the activities of our local authorities, is widely acclaimed.  There is no doubt that the short-term loans and high rates of interest have been millstones round the necks of the local authorities for many years and have restricted their activities and reduced their confidence in the work in progress.  The Minister has, for the first time I think, got away from that.  Some Deputies criticised him for doing it and stated that more will now be paid for the loans over a longer term of years on the basis that the Minister has indicated. Of course that is true.  But then these people who benefit by the loans will also be getting service for a longer number of years.  Surely they will have to pay a little extra for the extra years of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand Deputy Heskin's approach to the reduction in the petrol tax.  He seems to think that the people who use motors for pleasure should be charged a different price for petrol from the people who use lorries and cars for commercial purposes and, at the same time, he criticised the <Col N="115" /> black market activities.  I do not know how the thing could be administered so as to charge different prices for petrol to different sections of the community. If that were done, I fancy it would give a new lease of life to the black marketeers instead of remedying the position to which Deputy Heskin has referred.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made also to the relief given to rates.  Undoubtedly that is generally welcomed.  At the same time, the Minister is criticised for not having more money to apply to these different purposes.  Agriculture is our primary industry.</P>
    <P>Whilst I do not agree with the members who have said that the soil is the only raw material which is taxed, soil is, of course, after all portion of the raw material because the crops that grow take something from the soil.  But for the main part what they take from the soil is what is put into it and, if the productivity of the soil is not what it has been, that is due in great measure to the emergency conditions which did not permit of the importation of fertilisers formerly used by the farmers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Select Committee consisting of seven members, to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, be appointed to investigate the facts in the case of a certain member of the Dáil who, as appears from Press reports of evidence given in court recently, received financial accommodation from a company, in furtherance of whose business interests he made representations in his capacity as a member of the Dáil to the Department of Finance; to report on this matter and to consider and report if the member's conduct, as found by them, is inconsistent with the standards of conduct which should be expected from members; <Col N="116" /> That the Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records;  That the quorum be four.</P>
    <P>I put that motion on the Order Paper of this House, Sir, on the 25th May, 1945, very nearly 12 months ago; and the House is entitled to some explanation of how and why it has not come before the House for consideration before to-day.  When the matters, to which I shall refer to-night, first came to my attention I waited on the Ceann Comhairle and I directed his attention to them.  I asked him to communicate with the Leader of the House, the Taoiseach, and to inquire if it was the Taoiseach's intention to take steps in the Dáil to constitute a Committee of this House to inquire into these matters and to recommend any steps which the House might consider it desirable should be taken in the light of them.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle took that matter under consideration and, at his request, I waited upon him at a later date.  If my recollection serves me well, he did not deem it expedient then to discuss whether he had mentioned the matter to the Leader of the House or not, as other aspects of the problem had presented themselves to his mind, amongst them being, I think, the question as to whether this matter might properly be brought before Dáil Eireann at all.  I made certain submissions in the light of which the Ceann Comhairle eventually gave his approval to the motion which appears on the Paper now, but subject to the proviso that it could not be brought before this House for discussion until the litigation, in the course of which the evidence referred to was given, had been finally disposed of.  The litigation continued, in a court of first instance and, on appeal, over a period of several months and it was only brought to a final conclusion within the last month; whereupon, on my application, the Ceann Comhairle indicated his readiness to permit this business to be considered and the Government, at my urgent instance, took the unusual course of providing Private Deputies' time in or about the Budget discussion. But I have reason to complain, <Col N="117" /> sir, about one particular detail.  I asked the Tánaiste in this House some days ago whether an opportunity would be given to discuss this motion and I was informed on that day by the Tánaiste that the bulk of public business was so great that Private Deputies' time could not be given in that week at all and that, therefore, the motion could not be discussed.  That was on Wednesday.  Nevertheless on that Wednesday night the House adjourned because it had no business of any kind to transact, and Deputies went home. I was then notified yesterday by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that this motion would be set down for consideration at half-past seven on Thursday evening.  I received that notification while I was in Ballaghaderreen. Fortunately I came to town to-day only to discover that, without any amendment of that message to me of any kind, the Government had announced their intention of taking the motion to-night at 9.  Had I accepted the formal notice which they gave me and refrained from coming from the country until to-morrow morning the Government, no doubt, would have had the satisfaction of saying that Deputy Dillon, having pressed for time on this motion and been granted it, was not in his place to put it before the House.</P>

      <P>There is no use trying gags.  You are not going to put me off. Is there anyone else who wants to make a little interruption?  Get them all off your chests and I will go on. My submission is that representative democracy in this country cannot be sustained unless those elected to represent the people maintain their own integrity.  My submission is that to allow one's conduct or actions in public life to be affected by a bribe or an advantage offered by someone seeking help or assistance in the sphere of one's duties as a Deputy is corrupt and a betrayal of a Deputy's integrity. If anyone amongst us, no matter what benches he may sit upon, is guilty of such conduct, then this Dáil should reprobate that conduct and dissociate itself from it.  I must trespass for some time upon the patience of the House in order to read to them the sworn testimony of a defendant in this court and of a Deputy of this House in this court.  I propose to read that sworn testimony without embroidery and without comment.  I read the evidence as reported in the newspapers:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One of the defendants under examination in further reply said that in 1943 a situation arose in which the company was refused further Swiss francs.  There was a considerable amount of correspondence between witness and the Department of Finance on the matter.</P>
      <P>Mr. Murnaghan (one of the Counsel for the State): You said that all these letters were shown to Mr. Briscoe?  &mdash;Yes.</P>
      <P>Did you say that Mr. Briscoe acted in every case and wrote all letters? &mdash;I meant to say that Mr. Briscoe also wrote letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is he the same person who appears from time to time on the books of <Col N="120" /> the Gilbert Watch Company?  &mdash;He is.</P>
    <P>I want to know in what respect. Take page 140 of the cash book.  Do you see an entry there under date July 28, 1943?  &mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>Was it in 1943 first of all that Mr. Briscoe became interested on your behalf to make representations to the Department?  &mdash;I can't say the exact date.</P>
    <P>What is the entry?  &mdash;It is a bill of exchange for £50 for Mr. Briscoe.</P>
    <P>Does it represent an accommodation bill for £50 to Mr. Briscoe?&mdash; Yes.</P>
    <P>For how long?  &mdash;Probably for two or three months.</P>
    <P>Take page 144, under October 4, 1943.  What is that?  &mdash;A bill for £50.</P>
    <P>For whom?  &mdash;Mr. Briscoe.</P>
    <P>What is that?  &mdash;The same thing again.&mdash;For how long?  &mdash;I can only guess for two or three months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Lavery intervened to ask that Mr. Murnaghan be asked to indicate the relevancy of these questions and said there must be some limit to that inquiry.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murnaghan said that these entries appeared on the books of this company, which were in evidence, and he wanted to know what they were about.  Evidently they were not transactions in watches.</P>
    <P>The court allowed the questions.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Murnaghan: I want to know from you how long that accommodation was for?</P>
    <P>The defendant answered: It may have been for one, two or three months.  I have no means of knowing from this book.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murnaghan: Turn to page 146. There is an entry there under date November 1, 1943, for Briscoe.  Is that another bill for £50?  &mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>Page 150, January 10, 1944.  Briscoe. Bill £50.  Is that similar?  &mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>And January 19, on the same page, a bill for £50?  &mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>February 3, Briscoe, a bill for £50? &mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> Page 154, March 31, Briscoe, a bill for £50?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>Page 155, April 14, Briscoe, a bill for £50?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>Page 156, May 5, Briscoe, a bill for £50?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>July 11, Briscoe, a bill for £50?&mdash; Yes.</P>
    <P>If you examine the books you will find that is the last?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>Your business was a wholesale watch business?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>Has anybody else been accommodated to the extent to which Mr. Briscoe was accommodated, as shown in your books?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>Who else?&mdash;Mr. Eppel.</P>
    <P>Why was Mr. Briscoe accommodated in 1943 and 1944, in particular, to the extent shown in your books?&mdash;Because the man was short and he was running into debt.</P>
    <P>Was there any particular reason why he was accommodated in this period, while he was assisting you and your firm in making representations to the Department of Finance?&mdash;None whatever: I believe I helped him on many occasions years ago.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Briscoe came to give evidence himself:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In reply to Mr. Campbell, S.C. (for Samuels), Mr. Briscoe said a period was reached during the war when there were restrictions not alone on Swiss currency but on other currencies as well.  Subsequent to June, 1942, a number of people approached him with complaints that they had been wrongfully refused facilities to secure Swiss currency to bring in watches.  Three other firms apart from the Gilbert Watch Company made these representations to him.  He had known Samuels all his life, and had no doubt about his respectability and about his approach in the matter being quite open and above board. He knew Shribman for about 20 years, and he was quite satisfied from his own knowledge that both men were responsible, respectable and decent citizens.  He entered into negotiations and correspondence <Col N="122" /> with the Department of Finance on behalf of the company.</P>
    <P>Mr. Briscoe, continuing his evidence, said he made representations on behalf of the Gilbert Watch Company to the Department of Finance to have an allocation of Swiss francs made to them to import watches from Switzerland.  The company were given an allocation through Messrs. Samuels Brothers, Limited, of £3,000 in July, 1943, and had purchased £1,500 worth of watches. When the allocation was made the accused had given an undertaking not to export any of the watches. The allocation of the balance of francs was held up by the Department until a full investigation was made by them into the trading of the company.  He was surprised by this notification and the suggestion of anything irregular.  Samuels had informed him that he could account for all the company's sales of watches, and would give any further undertaking or guarantee asked for by the Department.</P>
    <P>Mr. Campbell read a letter from Mr. Briscoe to the Department which contained a reference to Moylan, a State witness, and which he asked Mr. Briscoe to explain.</P>
    <P>Mr. Briscoe said he had never seen Moylan until these proceedings started, and in connection with which an official of the Department had mentioned Moylan's name. Witness told Mr. Good, Moylan's solicitor, about representations he had made on behalf of Samuels and Shribman, and said he had learned that Moylan had made a statement involving the Gilbert Watch Company. Mr. Good said he did not know that but had no objection if witness asked Moylan about it.  Mr. Good would, if necessary, verify that conversation.</P>
    <P>Witness met Moylan at Leinster House, and he denied making a statement to a Revenue official containing allegations of illegal smuggling by the principals of the Gilbert Watch Company, and said the only charge he had made against them was of issuing invoices to him for <Col N="123" /> prices lower than he had paid for watches supplied to him.  He added that that was to save income-tax by hiding profits.  Witness had told him of the representations he had been making and said that he would withdraw them if he could be satisfied that he had been misled.  He also advised Moylan to tell his solicitor about the statement he had made, as not only would Samuels and Shribman be hurt by the allegation, but he (Moylan) would be involved.</P>
    <P>Mr. Briscoe, referring to a letter dated 11th April, 1944, said Moylan appeared to hold a series of grievances against Shribman and to have reached a stage where he would leave no stone unturned, and hoped to see Shribman destroyed.  The conversations between Moylan and himself covered a number of other matters. Moylan denied making any statement dealing with alleged irregularity in the disposal of goods, and later said he would even go to jail willingly, if he could bring Shribman with him.  He had no grievance whatever against Samuels. His animosity against Shribman was based on the latter's taking advantage of him to extract high prices for goods.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What were you told about the Romeda Co.?&mdash;I was told that they had been refused francs, and, notwithstanding that, they had proceeded to attempt to make payments for watches by depositing bonds in England with an agent of the consignor in order to secure the release of watches here, and to evade the Department's restrictions.</P>
      <P>That would be Mr. Handelmann?&mdash; Yes.</P>
      <P>Did you convey to him that you were not proceeding with the representations?&mdash;I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about Benson's?&mdash;Benson came to me three or four times and explained that he had a quota jointly with Ticher, Ltd., and also one on <Col N="125" /> his own, and that he had come to the conclusion that in making the original application he had not done justice to himself.  I told him that, in view of the 50 per cent. increase on the figures, the matter was not worth bothering about.</P>
    <P>And what about Lawrence?&mdash;I mentioned it to the Department and they pointed out that he had not previously been an importer.</P>
    <P>Is Samuels associated with a firm in Grafton Street?&mdash;I believe that he had a sister who has a firm in Grafton Street.  I don't remember the name of the firm, but I know the shop.</P>
    <P>What sort of firm is it?&mdash;It sells jewellery.</P>
    <P>What is the Universal Watch Company?&mdash;As far as my information goes, it is a firm registered specifically for the purpose of importing watches from Switzerland.</P>
    <P>Registered by whom?&mdash;I don't know.</P>
    <P>Who was interested in the firm?&mdash; The name was first mentioned to me by the Department in connection with Mr. Mack.</P>
    <P>Who is the Reliable Watch Company?&mdash;It is a firm owned, I understand, by Mrs. Shribman.</P>
    <P>Until the proceedings in this court, did you know that?&mdash;No.  I knew that Shribman or Samuels or both were close to this firm.</P>
    <P>Could you describe these people as Shribman and Samuels, the Gilbert Watch Company, or the Reliable Watch Company?&mdash;No.  For the purpose of clearing these watches, all could be eliminated except one, because the Department had decided to give a quota only to the one.</P>
    <P>Were the Reliable Watch Company, the Gilbert Watch Company, the Universal Watch Company, and Samuels Brothers, in fact, Shribman and Samuels?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>Did you know, as a fact, that watches passing through the Gilbert Watch Company or Shribman and Samuels had been smuggled out of Eire?&mdash;No.</P>
    <P>You knew that watches in large <Col N="126" /> quantities were being sold to Moylan?&mdash;At that time, I knew nothing of the transactions or of the existence of Moylan.</P>
    <P>Did you trouble to inquire as to where the watches were going from Shribman and Samuels?&mdash;Of course, I did.  I told them that the Department wondered why they had ordered such a large quantity of watches, and that the quantity ordered would be far in excess of the normal requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>Did you tell Shribman and Samuels that you and the Department were worried about these watches being illegally exported?&mdash; Being illegally exported never arose. Shribman and Samuels assured me that they wanted the watches for domestic consumption here.</P>
    <P>Mr. Briscoe, further replying, said that he had made a cursory examination of the books of the Gilbert Watch Company, which he had later handed to the Department.  He was satisfied from that examination that the firm had ample customers here to sell their watches.</P>
    <P>Did you learn from Samuels that the majority of the watches had been sold to Moylan?&mdash;He told me that all the watches had been disposed of here.  The first time Moylan came to my knowledge was when he was mentioned to me by Mr. Murray.</P>
    <P>Had Shribman or Samuels never told you about Moylan?&mdash;No.</P>
    <P>Did you not think it peculiar that Moylan was dealing with such a large number of watches?&mdash;No.  I thought he was buying and selling.</P>
    <P>Witness further said he did not know that Samuels had been mixed up in smuggling activities, but he knew of a case in which he had been fined for a firm with which he was connected.</P>
    <P>Asked if he had received letters on the letter-heading &lsquo;Samuels Bros., 97 Middle Abbey Street,&rsquo; he said that he might have done.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murnaghan: Wasn't it the merest cod to write you a letter <Col N="127" /> under the heading and address of a firm that did not exist?</P>
    <P>Mr. Lavery interjected to say that Samuels Bros. was a limited company and had a legal existence.</P>
    <P>Mr. Briscoe then said that the Department had agreed to the application for francs being made in the name of Samuels Bros., but the Revenue Commissioners took the cheque for the duty from the Gilbert Watch Company.  The whole thing, therefore, appeared to be a cod.  All through the correspondence Samuels Bros. and the Gilbert Watch Company became intermixed for the purpose of getting the watches.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murnaghan then referred to the letter written by witness to the Department in February, 1944, and asked: &lsquo;Who was the person from whom the untrue information was alleged to have been extracted?&rsquo;</P>
    <P>Witness: I should have said &lsquo;to attempt to extract&rsquo;, because Mr. Ticher was one of the persons who told me.</P>
    <P>Asked whether he had received any financial assistance from Shribman and Samuels, witness said that it was not unusual to find himself short of money and to discount bills, but he would not borrow from a person who would expect him to do anything wrong.</P>
    <P>Asked if he had, in fact, received financial accommodation from the Gilbert Watch Company during the period he was making representations to the Department on their behalf, Mr. Briscoe said that he was a man with a very large income and engaged himself in developing various little businesses.  At that particular time he was associated with R.B. Metal Products for the manufacture of collar studs, and had casually mentioned to the Gilbert Watch Company that he was going to his cousin to borrow some money. They offered to discount bills for him to the extent of £150.  These bills were duly met by him and the interest which accrued was reimbursed to Mr. Samuels.</P>
    <P>Witness, questioned about his relations <Col N="128" /> with the Department, said: &lsquo;If the Department had satisfied me that these people (Shribman and Samuels) were not entitled to francs or could not get them, that would have ended my interest, but I have not been satisfied up to this moment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some evidence was then tendered relating exclusively to a man called Moylan which, I believe, I can, with perfect propriety, omit.  I continue:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Briscoe said his sole purpose in seeing Moylan was to find out if he had involved the Gilbert Watch Company in the statement he had made, and he (witness) had accepted Moylan's statement that he had not involved it.  He did not think that Shribman and Samuels were capable of smuggling.</P>
    <P>President: In your letter of November 22, 1943, you wrote: &lsquo;I have myself reason to believe that watches were, in fact, smuggled from Éire.&rsquo;  What did you mean?&mdash;Mr. Murray had explained to me that large quantities of watches were coming into the country far in excess of the normal requirement and that they were being smuggled into England, and that it would be very dangerous for us if such a thing happened, because our supplies of francs might be cut off.  I agreed, and told him at that time lots of people were coming from the North of Ireland and that all the shops were doing a great trade with them. I did hear that there was some traffic in the illegal getting out of watches, for the purpose of smuggling them to England.</P>
    <P>You had no definite evidence about it?&mdash;No.</P>
    <P>Did you know about the disagreement in the Gilbert Watch Company between Mr. Schaper and Messrs. Shribman and Samuels?&mdash;Only from the time I took up the application.</P>
    <P>Did you know the extent of the dealings between Shribman and Samuels and Mack?&mdash;I understood that large quantities of watches had been ordered.</P>
    <P>Did you know the amount?&mdash;I never knew the amount until later on.  I believe there were more <Col N="129" /> ordered and that some were sent back.  I know there were substantial quantities ordered.</P>
    <P>Did you ever know that of this £21,000 worth of watches that has been referred to, about £8,500 of watches had not been entered on the books of the Gilbert Watch Company?&mdash;No.</P>
    <P>You were never told that £8,500 worth of watches were not entered on the books?&mdash;Afterwards all the facts came out, and I subsequently did hear it.</P>
    <P>When did you find out that the £8,500 worth of watches were not entered on the books?&mdash;About March, 1943.</P>
    <P>Who told you?&mdash;Shribman and Samuels.</P>
    <P>Did you inform the Department of Finance that these watches were not entered?&mdash;I discussed every aspect of the matter with the Department, and I am sure they are aware of it.</P>
    <P>I am asking you a definite question and I want a definite answer.  Did you inform the Department of the fact that this £8,500 worth of watches was not entered on the company's books?&mdash;I did not inform them of it, but they were aware of it.</P>
    <P>Now, I desire to place these matters before the House with complete detachment and with no desire to generate heat, acrimony or recrimination. I believe that the evidence which I have read to the House does give legitimate grounds for the <i>prima facie</i> suspicion that a transaction took place which is not in accordance with the standards of conduct which must be required of any Deputy of Dáil Éireann.  I believe it is the duty of this Dáil itself to make careful inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding this case and, having done so, without fear or favour, to report to this House what they have discovered to be the true nature of these transactions, declaring Deputy Briscoe to be faultless in the whole transaction, if that be their finding, or else pointing out where he erred and in how far that error was due to imprudence, or, if need be, to malice, and having settled his responsibility, to place on record <Col N="130" /> the judgment of this House on that conduct, objectively, if needs be by addressing such admonishment to the Deputy or not as the House deems prudent.</P>
    <P>I am bound in conclusion to refer briefly to one aspect of this matter without which I feel I would do myself a great injustice.  It could be, and may perhaps have been, suggested, that my bringing this matter before Dáil Eireann is in some measure due to an anti-Semitic inclination in myself and that it was on account of Deputy Briscoe's race and faith that I wished to direct the attention of the Dáil to this transaction.  I want to say quite deliberately that that is not true, that I regard anti-Semitism as utterly diabolical, that I believe the curse of God must descend on any person who takes part directly or indirectly in the persecution of any man or woman in this world on account of faith or race.  Let those who accept that avowal, accept it and those who reject it, reject it. My friends and those who know me will, I believe, accept it.  Those who wish to reject it are welcome to do so. As far as I am concerned, I do not give a thraneen for their opinion or their esteem.  I place the facts before the House, Sir, and I am convinced the honour of this Oireachtas demands that they should be scrupulously and dispassionately investigated and a judgment by this sovereign body of the State pronounced upon them.</P>
    <P>I declare these things should be done in a judicial spirit and with no desire either to vindicate my actions or those of Deputy Briscoe.  If I have erred in bringing the matter before the House, all I can say is that I have erred after giving the matter the best consideration I could and that, had I to do it all over again, I would do exactly what I am doing now.  If Deputy Briscoe has erred, let that be declared.  If he has erred through imprudence, there will be nobody in this House to cast a stone at him.  We have all been imprudent in our own good time.  If he has erred, and has given way to temptation, or has done something that has not been consistent with the position of a Deputy of this House, let that fact be fearlessly recorded and the <Col N="131" /> verdict of this House declared on such conduct.  On our readiness to face this most distasteful duty depend, not only the honour of all of us, but I believe the safe survival of representative and democratic institutions in this country.</P>

      <P>Apparently nobody else is going to speak.  Before I deal with the matter of the motion, I think I should refer to Deputy Dillon's opening remarks.  His suggestion was that he was treated very badly in this matter, that the motion had been for a very long time on the Order Paper and that he was not given an opportunity of dealing with it.  He made it quite clear, however, that it was not the Government's fault that that was so. He made it clear, notwithstanding his initial suggestion, that this was not dealt with earlier because until a comparatively recent time the case in which the matter arose was still <i>sub judice.</i>  Is there anybody here who thinks that a motion like this dealing with a case of that kind should have been introduced here while the matter was still <i>sub judice</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is Deputy Dillon's complaint then?  He suggests that he was badly treated to-day.  He has for some time been urging that this motion should be taken.  This is the day for Private Members' time, and it was found that it could be taken to-day and would conveniently fit in with public business. It was announced this morning that it would be taken.  It was also made clear, when it was announced, that if Deputy Dillon was not available here it would not be taken, so that any suggestion that it was going to be taken in Deputy Dillon's absence has no foundation whatever.  It could not be suggested that it was taken at short notice because he himself was the person who was pressing to have this case taken.  Therefore, we may take it that he had ready and prepared anything <Col N="132" /> that he wanted to say on the matter.  So much then for his introduction, and the suggestions contained in it.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the motion itself, the facts of this case were, in fact, investigated before a court.  The facts are admitted.  It was admitted in court that Deputy Briscoe did make representations on behalf of this firm. It was admitted that he made these representations persistently to the Department of Finance, that the Department of Finance considered these representations and refused to make an allocation to the firm called Gilbert Watch Company because they had not the trade, apparently, at the time which would have entitled them, in accordance with the rules which the Department had adopted, to get an allocation.  But the firm of Samuels, the personnel of which had been incorporated in the other company, was entitled and the Department of Finance gave an allocation of £3,000 in Swiss francs, about £1,500 of which was made available for the importation of watches.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe made representations in the case of that firm as he had done in the case of other firms.  Every Deputy in this House practically, at one time or another, has made representations to the Departments during the period of control.  They have made representations to the Departments with regard to facilitating some people that they knew, some people whose business was being affected by the restrictions, some people whom they regarded as being entitled to get allocations of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have always regretted that members of the House should go personally to make representations to individual civil servants and I have often wondered whether there was any possibility of establishing a system by which these representations would be made in some other way: whether it would be possible to establish, in connection with each Department, a sort of inquiry office where these matters would be put through, so that individual civil servants, dealing with these matters, would not be taken from their work and would not be directly <Col N="133" /> approached by Deputies.  It is a practice that has been in operation here for a considerable period&mdash;this approach to Departments by Deputies.  I certainly, for one, would welcome very much a Select Committee here that would indicate how that could be avoided.  I have spoken to civil servants about it.  It undoubtedly interferes considerably with their work.  On the other hand, they say that by their direct contact they are able to convince Deputies who approach them that the position is not exactly as the Deputies represent it: that there is another side to the question other than that which they have been made aware of.  If the House is willing to set up a Select Committee to examine into that matter, I certainly would be very glad of it.  Deputy Briscoe, in making representations to the Department of Finance in regard to these allocations, was not doing anything that other members of this House would not have done in different forms in regard to their constituents or other people who had brought to their notice particular grievances which they thought they had.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is nothing that we can find fault with in the case of Deputy Briscoe as far as that is concerned except that he was following a practice which is universal as far as I know with the members of this House. The fact that these representations were carefully examined and that they did not influence the Department of Finance is clear from the whole action of the case.  It cannot be suggested that Deputy Briscoe, when he was brought into this case, was treated in any way other than the way any outside member of the public would be treated, and that was quite proper of course.</P>
    <P>Now, what is the thing exactly in Deputy Briscoe's case to which objection is taken?  I take it that the whole gravamen of his conduct, as represented by the Deputy who has raised this question, is that it happened that whilst he was doing this he had also got accommodation from the particular individuals on whose behalf he was making these representations.  It was brought out in court, however, that these bills were bills for one or two <Col N="134" /> months, and that they were paid with the interest due on them.  It came out in court that Deputy Briscoe knew this Mr. Samuels, that he was a friend of his, that he had known him from boyhood and that he had known his father before him, that there had been transactions between them, lending and borrowing, and that Deputy Briscoe had been in the habit, in a case like this when he was short for a particular transaction, of borrowing money on bills, and that there was nothing whatever unusual, on that particular occasion, in his getting this particular type of accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen and examined this carefully, and I say that is the position.  The House can say, if it wants to, that Deputy Briscoe was imprudent to have taken that accommodation at that particular time.  It can find judgment on that if it wishes, but it cannot find on it&mdash;the facts are admitted&mdash;that he was guilty of any corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the first thing we must have in cases of this sort is something that will be recognised as a standard, something that will be a warning to every Deputy that he is transgressing if he does not observe it.  We ought not simply, on a particular case like this, bring this matter up, instituting an <i>ad hoc</i> inquiry in order to find out what our standards should be.  It has been reported to me, for instance, that certain things have happened.  People who are traders and who are members of the House have made representations on behalf of their own particular firms.  It has been pointed out to me that professional men who have been acting in cases outside have raised these matters afterwards in the House.  We might think <Col N="135" /> there was something in these cases equally dangerous and, if the House desires, I certainly will be glad to put down a motion that a Select Committee be set up to deal with this whole question of privileges, to deal with this whole question of standards.  But I certainly think it is not right that, in a case of this sort, we should be asked to set up a committee specifically to deal with one Deputy on matters which have been investigated in court under oath.</P>
    <P>We are anxious about standards in this House, but there is one thing which is also essential in this question of standards and that is that the privileges of the House ought not to be abused by members in their attitude towards other members.  We ought to take care that people coming into this House can feel that they can carry out their public duty here without having other members taking advantage of the situation which this House gives them, the freedom which is given, to try to make imputations against the characters of other people.  It is all very well for Deputies to say: &ldquo;I am imputing nothing, I am only stating so and so,&rdquo; but the very fact that they state these things in this manner does imply an imputation and a lot of the mud will stick.  If we want people to come here as public representatives, it is the duty of the House to see that they are safeguarded in these necessary matters.</P>
    <P>I feel I would be setting a very bad precedent indeed if, when a matter was already investigated in court, I was to give way and have a Select Committee set up.  The facts stated by the Deputy are admitted.  The question is whether Deputy Briscoe was unwise, because no other charge can be made.  Surely it was not for the sake of the 12/6 interest, whatever might be due in a month or two on the money, which was paid back; even the interest was paid.  It was not on that basis that the charge of corruption could be made.  This money was paid back.  The cheques are available, the bills are available; they were available in court.  What then? On what basis then should we&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those are the facts, and the facts being as I know them, I say all the House can find judgment upon is that Deputy Briscoe, by doing that at the time, was leaving himself open to imputation and leaving it open to be suggested that he was doing an improper thing and, therefore, he was unwise.  But that is the only judgment that can be got and, if you want to set up standards here which Deputies are to maintain, then let us have a Select Committee to indicate what are the things that must not be done, what is not in accordance with the standards; whether it is proper that professional men, for instance, coming in here, who have dealt outside with cases, should raise these matters in the Dáil.  Let us have that examined in the abstract.  Let us have the question examined as to whether business men who are in this House should make representations on behalf of their own firms whilst they are members of the House.  Let a number of these things, in general, be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go further.  More than once since we have come into office the question has been raised with regard to an Act here dealing with the privileges of the House.  I doubt very much if we have the power, for example, without legislation, to compel witnesses.  If you set up a committee and want to have witnesses before the committee, I doubt if you have that power, without legislation. Therefore, there seems to me to be need <Col N="137" /> of a Privileges Act.  Let a Select Committee be set up to examine how far that is desirable, or what should be the extent of it.  I have seen a draft Bill already.  If you want to raise this matter and make sure of these things, let us do that, but let us do it apart from imputation, an imputation with regard to a particular individual, when the facts have already been brought out in public court.</P>
    <P>I am not accepting this motion, but I am prepared to put down a motion that a Select Committee of the House be appointed to examine this whole question of standards, in so far as it is possible to indicate these standards, to investigate matters such as I have indicated&mdash;if it is proper for a person having financial transactions, borrowing from certain people, to make any representations in their case.  In fact, a still wider question, as I have indicated at another stage, is this, to what extent it would be possible by other means to get whatever advantages there are for the public and Deputies in this method of making approaches to individual Civil Service heads or particular officers in the Departments?  I think that these are matters which it would be in the public interest to examine and I am prepared to do that, but I am not prepared to accept this motion in regard to a matter which already has been the subject of a judicial examination.</P>

      <P>I was reading&mdash;and I said I was&mdash;a report that appeared in the newspapers.  I made that perfectly clear and I asked the Chair not to impose on me the duty of abstaining from reading any part of that report, because I wanted to be perfectly honest.  My suggestion was that a Committee of the House should send for the full note, examine it and, on the full note, record the truth, and if it were a vindication of Deputy Briscoe, record that vindication and thus correct the impression of what appeared in the newspapers.  I want the public mind to be clear on this.  I am not concluding the debate, but I want it cleared up.</P>

      <P>Are we, then, to understand that a Deputy comes in here and puts down a motion of this nature, insinuating charges against another Deputy, on the basis of a mere newspaper report when he could have had accurate knowledge?  The Deputy knows as well as I know that, even if he could not obtain the official transcript of the notes after determination of the case, he had only to ask the Minister for Justice in a Question here to produce the notes, and they would have been produced.  If the Deputy were sincere in his protestations in the opening of his speech to this motion, would we not have expected that he would at least have taken care to <Col N="139" /> get evidence, to acquaint himself with the facts through the open official channel I have indicated, or to inquire of the Department, because the Deputy knows as well as anybody else that if, in such circumstances, he had inquired from the Department, he would have been furnished with the complete evidence?</P>
      <P>I may seem a little heated in this regard, but, as one of the latest additions to this House, I am appalled to find that a procedure of this nature should be adopted to make charges against any Deputy.  If there is anything calculated to bring the reputation of this House into disrepute, it is that kind of carry-on.  As I say, I have perhaps been a little heated, but I do not want to let that in any way take from the astounding fact that, on the basis of a newspaper report&mdash; with no diligence and no energy shown by the Deputy, who knows his privileges and knows that nobody can come at him, that he is covered by the privileges of this House&mdash;a Deputy casually and carelessly puts down this motion with the most high-sounding and beautifully pious aspirations at the end of his speech.  I will not abuse the privileges that I have by referring to hypocrisy, but I must say it is an appalling state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, something more on this motion, and there is something that I should like to say as a newcomer to the House, and I think many other Deputies will say it.  It is that, in the present situation, for us Deputies <i>vis-á-vis</i> our constituents, <i>vis-á-vis</i> our duties as Deputies, there are certain difficulties.  The making of representations on behalf of our constituents has grown to be part of our duty as Deputies, and we all make these representations.  In fact, I am afraid that to a certain extent there has been competition in that matter. We can all agree on that.  It is very difficult to say where one is to draw the line between representations which are tinged, shall I say, by a personal interest and representations which are not.  For instance, people come to see me in the Dáil as they come to see other Deputies.  A number of Army <Col N="140" /> people have come to me to see if anything can be done about resettlement.</P>
    <P>Every other Deputy has the same experience and I am glad to be able to say that every Deputy has tried to do his best for these people.  Suppose a man comes here whom I do not know personally.  There is no trouble about the making of representations in his case, about giving him a reference or trying to help him out; but suppose somebody whom I know very well comes up here.  Am I misusing my position as a Deputy in helping such a friend?  Put in that way one can see how difficult it is to draw the line and I suggest that there is there a problem which might easily be examined.  I think we should all welcome it.</P>
    <P>There is the further difficulty in this situation, in which so much of our time, as every Deputy knows, is taken up with matters of that nature, that it is extremely difficult for a Deputy to give all the attention he should give to legislation passing through the House.  We are primarily here to pass the laws and to give proper attention to the legislation passing through the House.  Every Deputy realises the difficulty of paying proper attention to these matters and I suggest that that aspect should be taken into consideration if these matters are to be considered. But that perhaps is a side matter.</P>
    <P>To return to the motion in perhaps a little cooler mood than that in which I started, let us look at this from the point of view of a charge, because it is a charge.  Let us by analogy consider it from the point of view of procedure on indictment.  What is the first thing? The first thing is the information stage when the prosecution is expected to make a case.  Otherwise, informations are refused and nothing further happens. What is the case?  Listening to the Deputy who made the case, I have not been able to find what the charge is.  Evidence was read from a newspaper report, I gather.  It is insinuated that it implies turpitude, but no definite or specific charge has been made.  Is that a <i>prima facie</i> case of anything?  There is no need to go over it again&mdash;it has been dealt with <Col N="141" /> already.  Where is the charge?  Confining myself strictly to the narrow part of this motion, I do not see that a <i>prima facie</i> case about anything has been made, and, consequently, this motion is unsustainable.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach clears his mind with regard to any difficulties there may be in Deputies having to approach Departments about persons or matters and puts a proposal by way of motion before the House, we shall be very glad to consider it.  When the Taoiseach also clears his mind as to whether he has any animadversions to make on the way in which business people in this House or persons with professional callings in this House seek to serve their interests in this House, and as to whether he sees any reason for designating any of these practices or actions as objectionable and puts a motion before the House asking for assistance in the consideration of these matters and the passing of judgments upon them, we shall be very glad to assist the Taoiseach to discuss such a motion.  But we are not discussing either one or the other of these things here.</P>
      <P>I do not understand Deputy de Valera feeling that he has to be heated in this matter and I do not understand that any charge has been made.  When I listened to Deputy Dillon I felt that this was really a matter in respect of which, arising out of the Press reports and even following any examination which the Taoiseach might have made of it, the Government might have moved to set up a Committee of the House to investigate the facts, and see whether what was suggested to the public or to some of the public was correct or not, or whether, as was apparently necessary, wrong impressions should be disposed of by a full examination of all the facts and a report by an impartial Committee of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I feel that the Government themselves might have moved in the matter or, failing that, that I, as Leader of the Opposition, might have moved in the matter, because it seems to me that the statements which have been made from the Government Benches have rather <Col N="142" /> added to any suspicion that might be in the public mind, perhaps unwarrantedly. The Taoiseach's statement, coupled with the reports that Deputy Dillon read, which I understood him to say were reports taken from the Press and were the only reports available to people throughout the country regarding certain transactions of a Deputy, suggests that there are two matters that might very well be fully inquired into: (1) whether in fact there was any special treatment given to any firm as a result of Deputy Briscoe's representations; and (2) whether in fact any accommodation of a financial kind that was given to Deputy Briscoe was repaid in the way in which the Taoiseach says, namely, in full and with interest. If the facts are as the Taoiseach so emphatically states, that the Deputy got no accommodation for a particular firm as a result of his representations on the one hand, and that he, in fact, did not benefit financially by reason of his operations in this matter, I think it is due not only to Deputy Briscoe, but to this House, that the public would have it completely established for them what the facts were and that that should be done by such an impartial body as this House could set up.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach says he has completely investigated this matter and has found that there is no cause for saying anything except that Deputy Briscoe was unwise, I feel that that is one reason why he should do what this motion asks him to do, to give the House an opportunity of informing itself of the facts and, through its inquiry, informing the public, because the fact is that it is quite possible that this House has not sufficiently established its own traditions.  We have got through a rather difficult period since this Parliament was set up.  If we are to have not only the reputation of the members of the House individually, but the reputation of members of the House as a class, perfectly clean and clear before the public mind, we ought to be ready to take any steps that might be necessary to clear away doubts in an individual case or to prevent individual cases of one kind or another putting it into the power of anyone to suggest that Deputies were making use of their public <Col N="143" /> positions for their own private advantage. I suggest to the Taoiseach that he should reconsider this matter; that it is quite wrong to feel that charges are being made in this House and that the information the public have and the information that we all have here is simply the information to be got from the Press.  From the information that we can get from the Press, coupled with the statement of the Taoiseach to-night, I suggest that a very strong case has been made for setting up the Committee asked for by Deputy Dillon and having the facts fully stated to a representative committee of this House and, through that committee, to the people.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach has investigated the matter, I cannot see why he should not welcome the suggestion in the motion.  If the facts are as the Taoiseach has stated, then what is there to be afraid of or ashamed about? I think that in fairness to Deputy Briscoe, whom I knew for many years before I came into this House, the Taoiseach would be wise to accept the motion in order to clear the Deputy from any allegation that has been made.  The Taoiseach has made reference to the manner in which Deputies make representations to the different Departments.  All Deputies are approached from time to time to make representations to various Departments. The Taoiseach has indicated to this House that he is inclined to agree with the idea of an inquiry into the manner in which Deputies make representations to Departments.  I am one Deputy in this House who would strenuously resent and strongly oppose any action which might be taken by the Government to restrict the rights of Deputies as far as representations to Departments are concerned.  The Taoiseach has not suggested that this should be done, but he has stated that he would welcome an inquiry into the ways and means in which such representations should be made.  If any <Col N="145" /> steps are going to be taken in that direction I suggest that there should be no interference whatsoever with the present rights which Deputies in this House have in approaching civil servants in their Departments.  We all know&mdash;at least I know&mdash;that there is no civil servant in any Department to-day who shows any political spite or any bias towards any Deputies because of Party affiliations or for any other reason.</P>
      <P>Deputies from this side of the House may not agree with me in that, but I know that what I am stating here is true.  The civil servants in all our Departments here are above politics. If the present system were to be changed and if it were incumbent upon Deputies to make representations through the Ministers over the various Departments I am one Deputy in this House who would not approve of such an arrangement.  I am one Deputy in this House who has never made any representations through a Minister of the Fianna Fáil party.  I know that when I make representations to a secretary of a Department that secretary has no political prejudices and that his Department, in its administration, is above party politics and one Deputy is treated in the same way as any other Deputy.  I have known of cases where Deputies have been received by civil servants and those civil servants were completely ignorant as to which Party the Deputy belonged.  I think that is the right and proper spirit in which to run our Civil Service.  I say that no steps should be taken to restrict the right of any Deputy to discuss any matter concerning his constituents with any officer of a Department.  I am convinced from my own experience that no accusations can be levelled against civil servants in their treatment of Deputies because of party affiliations or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, sir, assuming any Deputy in this House happens to be a solicitor and one of his constituents comes into his office and requests him to make representations, we will say, to the Land Registry.  That Deputy, in his capacity as a solicitor, has to purchase the Land Registry maps.  In his capacity as a solicitor he probably has to <Col N="146" /> make out a file in which the correspondence relating to that constituent's case will be kept.  Now could Deputy Dillon raise a motion in this House if that solicitor, who happens to be a Deputy of this House, charges his constituent for his services as a solicitor?</P>
    <P>I would like to know does Deputy Dillon, or any other Deputy in this House, think that it savours of corrupt practices for such a solicitor to claim his expenses and his fees for his services as a solicitor, while at the same time he is in a position to make representations to Departments on a similar matter in his capacity as a Deputy? Now I regard this as a very serious matter because, assuming I was a solicitor and I accepted fees from my constituents in return for services rendered to them in my capacity as a solicitor, I feel that no Fianna Fáil Deputy would hesitate in putting down a motion on the same lines as Deputy Dillon has tabled in this House to-day in Deputy Briscoe's case.  Thank God, I am not a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Now, I think that Deputy Dillon, in his closing remarks on this matter, should make very clear to the House what exactly his views are in relation to professional representations made by Deputies.  I believe that where a Deputy fills a dual capacity both are separate and distinct.  His occupation as a solicitor and his temporary position as Deputy are not fundamentally co-related.  His position as a Deputy is temporary and it should not enter into account in relation to remuneration for services rendered as a solicitor. The same argument is equally applicable to doctors who are also members of this House.  If a constituent calls in the medical aid of a doctor, who is also a member of this House, and that doctor in due course furnishes a bill to his constituent for such services, surely it is not suggested that this House would in those circumstances have before it such a motion as that tabled here to-night bringing a similar charge against the Deputy as the charge that has been made against Deputy Briscoe?  I believe that any medical man, who is also a member of this House, is entitled to his fees for medical services rendered to his constituents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> I think it would be grossly unfair if a motion on similar lines were to be put down here against a doctor in this House and for that doctor to be charged with taking fees from his constituents in return for his services.  I am not raising this matter now for the purposes of publicity, but merely for the purpose of getting some concrete information from Deputy Dillon.  I agree with Deputy Dillon when he asks for an inquiry into this matter because I honestly and sincerely believe that if such an inquiry is not held now the only person who will suffer by that is Deputy Briscoe.  In all fairness to Deputy Briscoe I think that such an inquiry should be held and the facts should be made known to the general public.  The facts of the case were published in the Press.  The facts of the case will be republished in the papers to-morrow morning with the result that people who have long forgotten all about this matter will have their minds and their memories refreshed.  Therefore, in all fairness to the Deputy, I think the Government would be well advised to accept the motion put down here and would be well advised in making known to the public all the facts.  If the facts then are as the Taoiseach has pointed out, so much the better for Deputy Briscoe and so much the better for Deputy Dillon. Deputy Dillon's curiosity will be satisfied once more.  As far as this House is concerned it is my belief that every member in the House would welcome an inquiry on the lines suggested.</P>

      <P>I just want to make a few remarks about the Taoiseach's statement concerning the privileges exercised by members of this <Col N="148" /> House.  I do not intend to deal with the motion relating to Deputy Briscoe. But the Taoiseach has stated that he would welcome a committee to inquire into the manner in which representations are made to Ministers and others. Now I never in my life have made any representations to civil servants or to the head of any Department.  I have always gone direct to the Minister. The Taoiseach, or his Ministers, cannot deny that when such representations are made they are referred to the Departments concerned and one gets back the stock reply.  I would welcome any committee which would make recommendations in this connection so that Deputies would have some assurance that when they make representations for their constituents they will receive the proper attention.  If the Taoiseach will give us a guarantee here that any representations made either to himself, or to his Ministers, will be specially investigated and not merely diverted through the ordinary channels, with all the delay involved&mdash;</P>
