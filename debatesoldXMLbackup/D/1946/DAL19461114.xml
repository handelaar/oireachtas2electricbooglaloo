      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the reasons why new hotels and new golf clubs are in a position to obtain quotas of tea, sugar, butter, cigarettes and spirits, whereas the proprietors of cafés and small restaurants, who cater for the poorer class of people, are refused such quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On account of the limited supplies of tea, sugar and butter available, it was found necessary, as part of the rationing schemes for these goods, to restrict allowances for catering purposes to those catering establishments, including hotels, golf clubs, cafés and restaurants, which were in existence when rationing was brought into operation in 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> A concession was made, however, during the past year under which allowances of tea, sugar and butter were granted to newly-opened hotels. I regret that the continued shortage of supplies would not permit of the extension of this concession to newly-opened cafés, or other non-residential catering establishments.  I have made no concession of this kind to new golf clubs.</P>
    <P>The distribution of cigarettes and spirits is not controlled in detail and I cannot say what supplies of these commodities are made available to newly-established concerns of the type mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Exceptions have been made during the past 12 months. Exceptions are made for golf clubs into which a person can go and have any meal he likes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>If I mention a golf club, will the Minister explain how they get their tea and sugar?  This club was established during the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, they do not get them under the rationing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that a small restaurant or café in Malahide, catering for poor people, cannot get tea or sugar, while the tourist hotel in Portmarnock can get all the tea and sugar it requires?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider some very exceptional cases in view of the fact that, according to disclosures by his inspectors in the Department of Supplies, there have been serious reductions in some of the allocations.  For quite a number of years people were drawing a larger <Col N="865" /> quota than that to which they were entitled and could not the Minister make an allocation in exceptional cases from the amount thus saved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that you could deal with the business of making allowances to new cafés or restaurants on the basis of exceptional cases.  The only reason why allowances cannot be given to those institutions is that their number would run into thousands and the supplies are not there to meet such a demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state where the supplies of cigarettes and whiskey previously allocated to the various Army canteens, are now disposed of; and if the various traders <Col N="866" /> throughout the country have been given an increased quota of cigarettes and whiskey as a result of demobilisation, with consequent decreased demand for these commodities in Army canteens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not exercise any detailed control over the distribution of cigarettes to traders.  The manufacturers and wholesalers are regulating supplies to their customers on a quota basis but these quotas are not subject to official arrangement.</P>
      <P>Demands for cigarettes in Army canteens have been reduced as a result of demobilisation but the surplus thus available would not be sufficient to increase traders' quotas generally throughout the country.  I understand, however, that the manufacturers are making supplies available out of this surplus to ex-members of the Defence Forces who served full-time in the Army during the emergency and who have set up in business since they were demobilised.</P>
      <P>The rate of release of unmanufactured tobacco from bond to manufacturers was increased by the Minister for Finance on two occasions towards the end of last year and is now greater than pre-war.</P>
      <P>As regards whiskey, I understand that the sale of spirits is not, and has never been, permitted in Army canteens.</P>
      <P>The whiskey sold in officers' and N.C.O.'s messes is obtained through normal trade channels.  The distribution of whiskey is not officially controlled and I have no information as to the quantities supplied to these messes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that many country shops in the Dunmanway, Timoleague and other districts are still without any allocation of kerosene for domestic purposes for the months of August, September and October; that these shopkeepers and their customers are greatly inconvenienced and upset by the unfair manner in which they have been treated; and if he will take immediate steps to ensure that supplies are delivered without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy. Whilst some outstanding October allocations are in course of delivery, I understand that supplies for August and September have been delivered in full.  I am having the matter discussed with the oil distributing companies, with a view to eliminating delay in distribution so far as this can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received several complaints since I put down that question.  The position is bad over the greater part of West Cork; a great many people have not got their supplies of kerosene for September or October.  In remote districts people have to do a great deal of work with artificial light, and I do not suppose the Minister intends that a man should milk a cow in the dark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the British Ministry of Health has granted a special allowance of petrol to midwives to enable them to run small cars or auto-cycles with a view to having attendance on patients expedited, especially in rural areas; and whether he will be prepared to sanction the provision of a similar scheme in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the beginning of petrol rationing registered practising midwives, whether engaged in rural practice or otherwise, have been given a special monthly allowance of petrol for private cars or auto-cycles registered in their name and used by them <Col N="868" /> in the course of their professional duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to state that an error appears to have been made in the office in addressing this question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  What I wished to point out was that the British Ministry of Health made a certain cash allowance, not a petrol allowance, towards the purchase of cars for midwives. Could I now get a reply from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health as to whether a similar scheme will be adopted here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy. Having regard to the particularly difficult turf supply position this year, unavoidable interruptions in deliveries to outlying areas may occur, but on the whole I am satisfied that the arrangements to meet the fuel requirements of Graiguenamanagh are adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that up to last week there was no turf whatever in Graiguenamanagh?  The position was temporarily relieved by the arrival of 8 lorries last week but there is considerable anxiety as to whether a regular supply will be maintained during the winter months. There is no alternative fuel available&mdash; no timber and, of course, no coal.  In these circumstances would the Minister take steps to ensure a regular supply of turf for this area in future?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that insurance companies have <Col N="869" /> imposed severe conditions on lorry owners engaged in turf haulage, and that, since the general return of motor vehicles to the road, they have been charging increased premiums, and imposing excess premiums and very onerous conditions; and if, in view of the hardships arising from these matters, he will have the whole position examined by his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inform the Minister that there has been an increase of 20 per cent. in the premiums of such lorries.  Therefore, I think the Minister's reply is not satisfactory. Not alone has there been an increase in premiums but the insurance companies are imposing other excessive charges on the owners of these vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that various types of motor lorries and commercial vehicles are being imported into the State in a practically completed state; if he is further aware that at least two firms in this country are importing such vehicles completely broken down and fully assembling them here, thus providing considerable employment; and if he will, accordingly, forthwith prevent the importation of such vehicles except in a completely broken down state and compel all importers to assemble completely such vehicles here, so that further employment might be open to our citizens.</P>

I do not consider it desirable to prohibit the importation of complete commercial <Col N="870" /> vehicles.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state, with reference to Shannon Airport: (a) the amount of landing charge paid by each plane using the airfield; (b) the actual cost to the State of each landing, taking capital outlay, maintenance, etc., into account; (c) the aggregate amount, to date, of capital outlay and the annual cost of servicing same; (d) the all-in cost of maintenance for the last 12 months; (e) particulars of the staff and of the cost of the same; (f) the net income earned; (g) the amounts, if any, of any further capital expenditure contemplated in the near future; and (h) the names of the companies at present using the airport and the duration of their contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital expenditure on the Shannon Airport amounted to £1,099,629 on the 31st March, 1946. Works in progress since the 31st March, 1946, represent an estimated capital expenditure of £458,000.  Consideration is being given to the further development required to bring the airport up to the standard which the Government thinks desirable.  In so far as some of this expenditure is met from borrowing and is not a charge against revenue, I would refer the Deputy to Table I of the tables appended to the Financial Statement laid before the Dáil each year by the Minister for Finance in connection with the Budget.  Borrowing for airports forms part of the general Exchequer borrowings the service charges of which may be found in the annual finance accounts.  Particulars of the staff employed, expenditure on maintenance and details of receipts are set out in Vote 56 of the Estimates for the Public Services.</P>
      <P>The companies at present operating scheduled air services to the airport are:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Aer Lingus Teoranta;</P>
    <P>Air France;</P>
    <P>American Overseas Airways, Inc.;</P>
    <P>British Overseas Airways Corporation;</P>
    <P>Pan American Airways, Inc.;</P>
    <P>Transcontinental and Western Air, Inc.</P>
    <P>None of these companies is under contract to use the airport.</P>
    <P>It is not feasible to state the amount of the landing charge paid by each plane using the airport as the charge is based on a scale and depends on a number of factors such as the weight of the aircraft, the number of passengers, the weight of air mail and the weight of other cargo carried.  For aircraft of the type at present used on transatlantic operations the airport dues work out at about £20 per landing.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations apply to the question of the calculation of the actual cost to the State of each landing.</P>

The commissioner approved 204 plans relating to 3,151 houses.  During the same period <Col N="873" /> 64 plans in respect of 69 premises, other than houses, were submitted.  Of these, plans in respect of 60 premises were approved and nine rejected for similar reasons.  From these figures it will be seen that less than one-fifth of the plans for houses were rejected and that these involved about one-eighth of the number of houses.  There is no justification for the statement that every obstacle is placed in the way of persons anxious to build houses.  The question of the approval or rejection of plans submitted under the Town Planning Acts is a matter, in the first instance, for the commissioner.  Aggrieved parties may appeal to the Minister.  If the Deputy requires particulars in respect of periods earlier than the present year I can arrange to have them compiled by the county council and sent to him.</P>

Up to date only 271 applications for purchase have been submitted to the local authority.  Before cottages are vested they must be put in good repair and sanitary condition.

      <P>The only widows, as such, who are entitled to food vouchers are widows who are in receipt of pension under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, the vouchers being in the nature of an increase in the rate of pension under those Acts.  A widow's non-contributory pension under the Acts may be granted to a widow in receipt of a British widow's pension, provided her means are within the statutory limit and she is otherwise qualified, and such widow, in virtue of her Irish widow's pension, would be entitled to food vouchers if she resided in the area to which the food voucher system applies.</P>
      <P>It is not intended to extend the classes to which food vouchers are issued.  Persons outside those classes, if in necessitous circumstances, are eligible for the grant of home assistance and if in receipt of such assistance are eligible for the grant of additional assistance in kind, the cost of which is recouped to the local authority from the provision of £170,000 made in the current year in sub-head J (4) of the Vote for Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>I am aware that, in recent months, flooding took place in the Dunmore area.  My information, however, is that in only one case was there serious loss of tillage crops.  The question of generally excepting the farmers in this area from full compliance with the tillage Order cannot, of course, be entertained, but the individual case in which actual loss of tillage crops occurred will be further considered <Col N="885" /> with a view to determining whether the present tillage quota can reasonably be complied with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to parts (a) and (b) of the question, Mr. Ó Cuiv's initial and subsequent appointments on the academic staff of the School of Celtic Studies were made by the council of the institute in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Act of 1940 establishing the institute.  The Act provides that every appointment to a position (other than the position of senior professor) on the academic staff of a constituent school be made by the council on the request (with the approval of the Minister for Education) of the governing board of the particular school.</P>
      <P>These appointments are not made by competition after advertisement, because it is not a question of making a selection of an individual for a specific post from amongst a considerable number of qualified persons. Rather is it a question of securing for the school as many as possible of the limited number of persons showing promise of scholarship and encouraging them to devote their careers to Celtic studies.</P>
      <P>The procedure in selecting persons for any position on the academic staff (other than that of a senior professor) is that applications received are considered by the governing board of the school.  This board consists of scholars of repute in Celtic studies or persons who have a special interest in those studies.  They know of the students who are working in the field of Celtic studies and are in a position to judge of their merits and their suitability for work in the school.  Persons selected are tested over a period of probation and only when they are regarded as in every way satisfactory are they confirmed in their appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to part (b) of the question, Mr. Ó Cuiv was originally appointed in <Col N="890" /> February, 1942, as a temporary part-time assistant in the school at a salary of £180 a year.  In June, 1942, he was appointed a full-time assistant on probation for one year at a salary of £400 and this appointment was subsequently renewed for a further year.  In June, 1944, he was appointed to his present post as assistant professor on the scale of £500, proceeding by annual increments of £25 to £600 a year.  The salary figures given are inclusive.</P>

      <P>It was never intended to leave the institution permanently in its present quarters in Cork Prison. The decision to return to Clonmel, now that it has been vacated by the military, until something better is available elsewhere, is based primarily on the fact that the accommodation at Clonmel is better than the accommodation at Cork: there is about an acre of ground for outdoor exercise and recreation and large rooms for workshops, classes, refectories, and indoor recreation.</P>
      <P>An additional reason for leaving Cork is that the prison there is needed for short-term local prisoners.</P>
      <P>The proposed lease to University College, Cork of a portion of the Cork Prison ground does not affect the matter; the return to Clonmel would be proceeded with even if that lease were not in contemplation.</P>
      <P>The cells at Clonmel are somewhat smaller than those at Cork, but they will be used merely as sleeping cubicles.  The boys will leave them at 7 a.m. and will not go back to them until they go to bed at 10 p.m.  I have seen these cells and I am satisfied that with certain improvements, which are being made, they are suitable for the purpose in view.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that the cells in Clonmel Gaol are stone cells, the floors and walls of which are stone, designed for the incarceration of short-term prisoners in the early part of the last century?  Is it not true that the Minister has stated, in this House and elsewhere, that in his considered judgment the accommodation at Clonmel was grossly inadequate and that he was resolved to remove the boys out of it, even to Cork Gaol, rather than leave them where they were?</P>

      <P>That is not so.  As far as I recollect the walls are stone, but I am almost certain that the floors are wooden.  In fact, I am certain of that. I had the idea that the place was very bad.  I do not recollect ever having stated so publicly, but I got the idea very largely from hearing Deputy Dillon condemning the place.  I decided to have a look at it for myself, and I am perfectly satisfied that, pending the erection of a more suitable building which I hope will be undertaken as soon as possible, Clonmel is better suited for the purpose than Cork prison, apart from the fact that we want Cork prison for short-term local prisoners.  I am perfectly satisfied with that and I invite Deputy Dillon to have a look at it when we have it ready and not to assume that I am trying to take a retrograde step. I ask him to go there when we have it ready.  I also ask any other Deputy who takes an interest in this matter to have a look at the premises when we have them ready, and then say whether I am right or not.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply is it not true that he has received from divers sources the strongest representations against the scandalous inadequacy of the accommodation in Clonmel as a Borstal institute? Is it not further true that, in fact, the authorities of Cork College applied to the Taoiseach to assist them to prevail upon the Minister for Justice to withdraw from the Cork prison premises part of the ground which had been used for exercise and outdoor recreation for the Borstal inmates, and that as a result of that pressure brought to bear on the Minister for <Col N="896" /> Justice by the Taoiseach a lease was granted of a deduction of a grant of land from the premises of Cork prison which makes it impossible to retain the Borstal inmates there any longer and forces them to go to Clonmel?</P>

      <P>I have received representations for a more frequent delivery of correspondence in the district of Barratitoppy, Scotstown, County Monaghan.  The matter is under consideration in conjunction with general proposals for increasing the frequency of postal delivery, where justifiable, in rural areas.  I am unable at present to say what, if any, increase in frequency of delivery it may be found possible to afford at Barratitoppy, but as the postal service in that area is already operated at a loss of 70 per cent. on the revenue it may be taken that it will not be practicable to afford a delivery on every day of the week. There are approximately 4,400 rural posts.  About 500 of these have less than a daily delivery.  The great majority of the posts with less than a daily delivery have a thrice-weekly delivery&mdash;less than 30 posts have a frequency of two days a week or less. We are about to spend an extra £20,000 on increasing the frequencies of deliveries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the shortage of rabbit wire which, in most parts of the country, is essential for the protection of young plantations. My Department is able to obtain only a small fraction of its requirements. Like other materials in short supply <Col N="904" /> wire is more expensive than when supplies were plentiful, but I have no responsibility in regard to its price nor have I any information beyond that furnished by the Deputy about its cost in Northern Ireland.  I am aware, however, that the shortage is universal and is not confined to this country.</P>
      <P>It was partly on account of the higher cost of fencing materials that, in 1944, the grant payable in respect of tree planting was increased from £4 to £10 an acre.  But the value of timber also rose considerably and does not appear likely to fall again to its pre-war level.  I am not prepared to consider any further increase in the grant.  Any person who has undertaken to plant trees in fulfilment of the conditions in a felling licence and who finds it impossible to procure fencing materials at a reasonable price will be granted an extension of the period allowed for replanting by applying to the Forestry Division and stating the facts.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I had then pointed out to the House three matters in respect of which I submitted the House had been misled by the Minister, three matters which, I submitted, in themselves constituted good ground for rejecting Section 4.  I do not propose to recapitulate one word of what I said last night, but I want to add two other considerations to the case I have made already and upon which I stand.  I direct the attention of this House to sub-section (1) (c) (iii) of this section. It empowers the company set up under the Act of 1938&mdash;the House will remember that that Act repealed the Act of 1934&mdash;to include in its objects &ldquo;the manufacture and sale of any substance, all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell us now what product or products he has in mind in that sub-section. I have adverted to the impropriety of producing a rectified spirit, to which he referred in the Second Reading speech, on the ground that an independent firm was already equipped to do so.  He challenged the contention that the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia, to which he himself referred, should necessarily be more expensive if produced by the company under the sub-section than if it were bought on the world market.  I <Col N="908" /> feel in the despairing position that I am unable to bring home to the House the critical decision which is about to be taken by it.  I know what is intended by this Bill.  It is really a design to get, ultimately, sanction to produce this indispensable raw material of the agricultural industry through the mediumship of this company.  The Minister has said, most disingenuously, to the House that the presence of deposits of gypsum in this country renders this country a pre-eminently suitable place for the manufacture of this commodity, thereby suggesting that we may anticipate its being produced at a price which would compete with the price from any factory in the world.  But the fact is that the indispensable raw materials of the sulphate of ammonia industry are hydrogen and nitrogen, the fact is that, in industrial countries, these indispensable raw materials are the waste products of other industries and can be purchased by the sulphate of ammonia manufacturers from those other industries at waste price.  If they were not taken over by the sulphate of ammonia factories, they would have to be thrown away; and as a result of their ability to buy on those terms, the cost of production of sulphate of ammonia is comparatively low.  If, however, you have to set out on an independent industrial chemical process to manufacture nitrogen and hydrogen, for this purpose of ultimately using it in the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia, it is an extremely expensive operation.  Nitrogen and hydrogen so procured are very expensive.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know&mdash;his experts must have told him&mdash;that the only methods available to us for the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia in this country are incomparably more expensive than those readily available to manufacturers in industrial centres where they use the by-products of other industries.  He has not told us that.  If he had told the House that, many people who do not realise now the danger in which we stand at present would realise it.  If this section remains in its present form, it will be used to levy, on all arable land in Ireland on which sulphate of ammonia of <Col N="909" /> nitrogen in any form is used, a tax of 2/6 to 5/- per acre, in perpetuity.  That is so monstrous a proposition that I have a horrible Cassandra feeling that I cannot persuade those who listen to me to believe it&mdash;and the horrible part of it is that, if this Minister gets away with it&mdash;in face of what the Minister for Agriculture declared here, when he condemned them both&mdash;once we are saddled with it, it will be almost impossible to free ourselves from it.</P>
    <P>The last reason I want to adduce for rejecting this section relates to what appears to me to be a very serious point&mdash;and I cannot help feeling that it is somewhat disheartening to find about 15 members of Dáil Éireann in the House when the whole future of agriculture is in jeopardy and when we are asked widely to extend the way in which a company of this character will function and the powers this company has.  Remember that when the Minister was justifying this wide extension provided for in Section 4, one of the strongest arguments he adduced was this.  &ldquo;It is not intended,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;to spend one penny piece out of the Exchequer on these wider purposes, without first coming back to Dáil Éireann, stating the purpose and seeking the money.&rdquo;  Now, on that representation, many men might shrug their shoulders and say: &ldquo;Well, we do not want to be on the records as being opposed to Irish industry and the Minister says there must be another discussion about this matter before any additional expenditure can be put on the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any persons who accept that are sadly misled.  If they turn to the Principal Act, they will find that this company has power under Part V to obtain from every petrol distributor in the State a precise return of the petrol sold by him.  They can then serve an order on the petrol companies requiring them to buy any quantity of industrial alcohol that the company, with the approval of the Minister, cares to compel them to take.  They can then compel the oil company to incorporate that quantity of industrial alcohol in the petrol to be sold to the consumer.  Under the protection of this Act, the petrol company can <Col N="910" /> increase the price of petrol by a sum to be approved by the Minister but calculated at a rate to compensate the company for having incorporated industrial alcohol in the petrol sold. The Minister has told the House that that levy amounted to ½d. per gallon on all the petrol sold in the State. That levy did not go to the Exchequer. It was collected by the Industrial Alcohol Company and that is revenue which they may employ without any reference to this House good, bad or indifferent, for any or all the purposes of Section 4.  So far, they have levied only ½d. a gallon on all the petrol used in the State.  There is no reason why, under the powers conferred in the 1938 Act, they should not levy 2d. or 3d. a gallon by a device identical with that which I described to the House. Article 17, paragraph (2) of the Constitution provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann shall not pass any vote or resolution, and no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to Dáil Éireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is the money levied from the public in the price of petrol public money or is it not?</P>

Further, these companies are under statutory obligation to await delivery of the spirit, in respect of which they are required to pay within seven days <Col N="912" /> of the date of the making of the order, until it is convenient to the company to make delivery, with the guarantee that ultimately all the expenses of so providing will be passed on to the taxpayers and that all the revenue may be used for the purpose of establishing in this country an uneconomic industry for the manufacture of an essential artificial manure, the cost of which will be charged to the agricultural industry in perpetuity, and as a result of which every acre of Irish land competing in the British market against an acre of Danish land, an acre of Belgian land, an acre of Dutch land or an acre of New Zealand land, will for evermore carry a tax of 2/6 to 5/-.</P>

      <P>The House can stand anything.  I think most Deputies who read the Bill will be aware of the fact that its passage will not permit the Industrial Alcohol Company to manufacture anything except industrial alcohol.  The powers of the company to engage in the manufacture of other chemicals are being enlarged but, before it can engage in such manufacture, the procedure contemplated in Section 7 of the Bill must be followed. Deputies need have no fears, therefore, that the company will commit the House or the country to any new developments which are not fully examined in advance.  Deputy Dillon would have known that if he had read the Bill but, of course, any suggestion of new industrial development in this country is regarded by Deputy Dillon as a personal affront and makes him hysterical.  I do not think we need pay any more attention to what he was saying on this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes spoke also on the section but I think most of his remarks related to the general principle of the Bill and harked back to the discussions we had on Second Reading.  I do not want to repeat what I said on Second Reading but I think <Col N="913" /> it desirable to clarify for Deputies the purpose behind the Bill.  The Government considers that it is necessary to have a commercial organisation to investigate the possibilities of establishing in this country certain chemical industries.  The need for these chemical industries was demonstrated during the war, but the practicability of them has yet to be established.  It is true that in the stress of the war years, faced with shortages which could not be made good by imports, devices were adopted to ensure the production of essential materials on some basis which were not unsuccessful. I gave as an illustration the fact that there had been established, by the Department of Defence in collaboration with the Emergency Scientific Bureau, a factory for the production of explosives which, incidentally, made possible the continuation of the supply of matches because materials required for the manufacture of match heads were also produced in the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the shifts we were put to to maintain supplies of essential materials during the war, the experience gained in that period, the possibility which that experience seemed to suggest of establishing important electro-chemical industries here, that led the Government to conclude that it was desirable to set up a commercial organisation to investigate the possibilities fully, an organisation which in certain circumstances could be authorised to carry out manufacture on a commercial scale.  Having come to the decision that an organisation was necessary, the Government then had regard to the question of what form the organisation should take and, at that stage, it decided that it was desirable to transform the powers of the Industrial Alcohol Company and to give that company these functions rather than set up a new organisation. Whatever views may be held concerning the economics of the industrial alcohol scheme, I think there is no ground for question as to the capacity of the organisation which has run the scheme.  The technical staff of the company are a body of very competent people.  We could not get in this country a more competent organisation to carry out the particular types of investigation that we have in mind.  It was <Col N="914" /> decided, therefore, to give additional powers to the Industrial Alcohol Company so that it could carry out the functions we had in mind rather than set up a new organisation for that purpose. The sole purpose of this Bill is to effect that change.</P>
    <P>Let it be quite clear that no decision has been made yet as to the chemical products in the manufacture of which the company may engage.  Various possibilities are in mind and are being investigated Departmentally at the present time.  Whether these possibilities, when examined in the manner in which it is contemplated that this company will examine them, will lead to the establishment of manufacture here it is too soon to say.  It may be that the investigations will prove to be abortive or lead to conclusions that economic manufacture is impracticable. It may be that we shall get as a result an important industrial development.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, by way of illustration of the type of development we had in mind, the possibility of producing here sulphate of ammonia.  We investigated before the war the possibility of establishing a factory to manufacture sulphate of ammonia.  There was an inter-departmental committee which went fully into that matter and had discussions with commercial organisations in other countries.  It was a slow process. As I explained when introducing the Bill, the instrument of an inter-departmental committee was ineffective.  It is true that there was a difference between the point of view of the Department of Agriculture and that of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the reconcilement of these different viewpoints contributed to the delay. As a result of the delay, the nature of the instrument we used, the desire on everybody's part to investigate every process of producing sulphate of ammonia before deciding on any particular process, we found ourselves in the position that no progress had been made before the outbreak of the war.  It seems foolish to talk now about the cost of sulphate of ammonia here in connection with the cost of sulphate of ammonia elsewhere, because we just have not got any. Apart from small imports made available by the British authorities for a <Col N="915" /> certain purpose, there was no supply of sulphate of ammonia at all available here except for some small supplies smuggled over the Border and sold at exorbitant prices in the black market.  There is no Deputy who does not realise that it was unfortunate for the country that we did not succeed in getting established here that important industry before the war.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the measures taken by the Government to protect the superphosphate industry. If these measures had not been taken we would have no superphosphate industry either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.  It existed long before you came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It existed up to 1932 but in 1933 and 1934 the manufacturers here were being subjected to an unfair type of competition from Belgium.  The competition took the form of selling superphosphates well below the cost of production and the industry here would have disappeared if the Government had not taken action to meet the situation.  Deputy Dillon, of course, would have regarded that as a triumph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The imports of Belgian superphosphates were negligible before the tariff went on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point I am trying to make clear to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The manufacturers here were able to meet the competition from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no competition from Belgium at all until a change in Belgian law required the Belgian steel manufacturers to stop discharging sulphuric acid into the atmosphere.  That law compelled the recovery of the sulphuric acid from the fumes of the steel works, and its utilisation for some purpose.  It was utilised to manufacture superphosphate which was sold below normal economic cost.  The increase in a very short period in the imports of Belgian superphosphate into this country threatened the existence of our superphosphate industry and led the Government to impose a tariff.  The <Col N="916" /> tariff was applied only to superphosphate imported from the Continent of Europe.  It did not apply, as everybody knows, to superphosphate imported from Great Britain.</P>
      <P>In case the Deputy thinks I was misleading him, let me tell him something he does not know yet.  At a later stage, a quota restriction was put on the importation of superphosphate from anywhere, but in fact licences were so issued under those quota restrictions that they could be used, and were used, only for the importation of superphosphate from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I was making when I used that argument here was that if we can produce here sulphate of ammonia as cheaply as it can be produced in Great Britain, we should be satisfied.  We produced superphosphate as cheaply as it was produced in Great Britain, but we did not and could not produce it as cheaply as it was produced in Belgium.  I do not know if Deputy Hughes will contend, as I know Deputy Dillon would, that the efficiency of Irish industry must be judged in relation to the lowest price at which products can be purchased in any part of the world, no matter what the social conditions in that part of the world and no matter what special circumstances may affect prices.  That is not our view.  It seems to us that sulphate of ammonia is an industry for which this country is particularly suited.  It is almost the one chemical industry which we can carry on here without importing any thing.  Every raw material required for the production of sulphate of ammonia is available here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that there are factors which will make it impossible to produce it as economically as it can be produced elsewhere&mdash;the size of our market, the cost of electricity and certain other factors; but, on the other hand, we have very valuable deposits of gypsum.  Gypsum is an essential raw material for this industry.  Our gypsum deposits are by a long way the most valuable mineral resources of this country.  At present, we are <Col N="917" /> exporting gypsum to many countries&mdash; Finland, Sweden, Holland, and Denmark, as well as Great Britain. We do not want to utilise these valuable deposits merely to export raw rock anywhere.  We want to use them as the basis for the industries they can support and one of the industries we have in mind is the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia.</P>
    <P>We are not committing ourselves to establishing that industry.  We are not pledging this organisation to establish the industry.  We are proposing to ask the organisation to investigate fully the economics of that industry and the particular problems that will arise if it is to be established.  There are many different processes, some of them patented processes, for the production of sulphate of ammonia.  Which is the most suited to our circumstances, and which will work most economically in our circumstances?  These are the questions which we will expect this company to answer, but, before they can manufacture it, not merely must public notice be given under the provisions of Section 7, but, because of the capital required for such a development, there must be further legislation because the capital resources of this company would not be adquate for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Let me be quite clear as to the difference between the new functions and powers which the company is getting under this Bill and the functions and powers it has under the original Act.  So far as the production of industrial alcohol is concerned, whether denatured spirit or undenatured spirit, the company is fully empowered to engage in it under the powers conferred by the 1938 Act. Deputy Dillon said I was misleading the Dáil when I intimated that there are provisions in the Bill designed to ensure that the company would not engage in the manufacture of any chemical product in competition with private firms.  I want to distinguish between the new forms of manufacture which the company may engage in because of the new powers given it under this Bill and the forms of manufacture in which it can engage now.</P>
    <P>It can now produce industrial alcohol and has produced industrial <Col N="918" /> alcohol, both denatured and undenatured, and the plant which is now being installed at Cooley to produce a very fine neutral spirit is being installed and will be operated by the company under the powers already possessed by it as conferred by the Act of 1938.  There is a company in Cork producing a limited quantity of similar spirit.  It is doing so under the authority of a licence given to it under the Act of 1938.  The company needs no new powers to produce any form of industrial alcohol.  I mentioned in the course of the Second Reading debate that some doubt&mdash;how strong the doubt is, I cannot say&mdash;exists as to the liberty of the company under the 1938 Act to sell spirit except to petrol distributors. It has in fact been selling spirit to hospitals, laboratories and industrial users during the war, but there was some element of doubt as to whether it was entitled to do so.  We are removing that doubt under the Bill and making it clear that it can sell industrial alcohol to anybody. But, of course, the bulk of its production of industrial alcohol will continue, in future as in the past, to be sold to petrol distributors.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for new legislation to empower the company to engage in the manufacture of industrial alcohol in any form.  If it goes beyond the production of industrial alcohol into the manufacture of other chemicals, it will require a licence under Section 7.  Before that licence can be given, there must be public notice of the intention to give the licence through the Press and an opportunity must be given to private interests which may be affected to make whatever objection they have to make. The intention is that the licence will not be given to the company unless it is clear, as a result of that public investigation of the situation, that private interests are not likely to engage in the production of the chemicals in question on an adequate scale.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the Bill contains no provision for altering the financial position of the company.  The Minister for Finance is empowered under the Act of 1938 to invest in the shares of the company up to a limit of <Col N="919" /> £500,000.  If any new form of manufacture which the company may undertake should require the provision of capital in excess of that figure, fresh legislation will be necessary and the Dáil will have an opportunity of fully considering the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any limitation on the price the company can charge the petrol distributors for industrial alcohol?</P>

The sole purpose of Section 4, therefore, is to extend the powers of the company to enable it, if otherwise authorised, to investigate the possibility of the manufacture of chemical substances, or to engage in their manufacture, but it is quite clear that the provisions of Section 4 alone would not permit of the company engaging in the manufacture of chemical substances, unless and until the procedure laid down in Part III of the Bill has been satisfied.</P>

      <P>When the Minister was winding up the debate on the Second Stage.  The Minister now says that there is nothing in this section or in the Bill which extends the power of this company to manufacture highly rectified spirit.  But the Minister said, as reported in column 542 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;They (the Alcohol Company) produced a spirit which served its purpose during the war but it was not good enough.  They are satisfied, however, <Col N="920" /> that they can produce a very fine neutral spirit which will be readily accepted by hospitals, laboratories and industrial users and they are installing a plant for that purpose.  It is necessary to amend the legislation so as to permit the company without any qualms whatever to sell spirit to persons other than petrol distributors.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister said there was nothing in the Bill which extended the powers of the company to sell spirits.  In the same breath he said that he wanted to assure the House that there was no question of this company competing with any other company which was under private ownership in the production of any product which that other company was prudently producing. To-day he announces blandly that he knows well there is a company in Cork producing this highly rectified spirit, and Cooley is going to do the same thing.  Which story is true?  Is he going to use the power to compete with private firms or is he not?  He says he will not.  But in the next breath he says that at this moment the company is installing machinery at Cooley to compete with a Cork firm which is producing an identical article.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What do you mean?  Are they not both producing the same highly rectified spirit?  Is there any Deputy who believes that if there are two firms producing the same article for a very limited market there will be no competition between them?  Does that statement make sense at all?  To me it seems a complete contradiction, and I refuse to accept it.  Words have lost their meaning if we are to say in the same breath that Cooley and Cork are producing an identical product for a limited market and there will be no <Col N="921" /> competition between Cooley and Cork. If Deputies fall for that kind of trash, there is simply nothing we can do about it.  Deputy Ó Briain smiles.</P>
      <P>Will Deputy Ó Briain, who is a man accustomed to teaching, say if there is anything wrong in my logic?  Will Deputy Ó Briain explain to me how you can say that Cooley and Cork are both going to produce exactly the same product, that the market for that product is strictly limited, and that there will be no competition between Cooley and Cork?  I say that is self-contradictory and, if Deputy Ó Briain disagrees with me or thinks I am an obscurantist in taking that view, I will be grateful if he will explain where I have gone wrong.</P>

      <P>By going to the Cork firm and saying to them: &ldquo;You shall not be allowed to supply.&rdquo;  I wonder if the Deputy will agree that, if he makes a capital investment in an alcohol factory in Cork, his object will be to sell the maximum quantity?  The Minister has guaranteed that he will not use this company to compete with any private enterprise.  I quite agree that it is possible for the Minister to say to the Cork firm: &ldquo;There is a market for 100,000 gallons.  You may only produce 40,000, and Cooley 60,000. At that 40,000 you must stop.&rdquo;  Surely to say that does not represent competition is, to say the least of it, to be disingenuous.  It may not constitute competition, but it constitutes prohibition. Surely the greater contains the lesser.  It is worse to prohibit than to embarrass with competition.  I will leave it to the House.  To me, it is an utter negation of the undertaking given by the Minister.</P>

    <P>Last night the Minister said that it was the impact of war alone which prevented us from having a sulphate of ammonia industry here.  I read here in his presence the statement of his own colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, formulated as a confession in the House, that he had vetoed the establishment of a sulphate of ammonia <Col N="922" /> factory in this country because such a factory could only be introduced on the basis that this ammonia would cost us 10 per cent. more than if we got it from abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture also says: &ldquo;I would not allow that additional burden to be placed on agriculture.&rdquo; To-day we are told a devious story about inter-departmental committees and various views and so forth. Did the Minister for Agriculture use these words in Dáil Éireann or did he not?  If he did, was he speaking what was true or what was false?  If he spoke truly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke falsely.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke truly, as reported in column 540 of the Official Reports, the Minister for Agriculture spoke falsely and I am entitled to know who was speaking the truth.  I believe that the Minister for Agriculture was.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that the opposition to this proposal to set up a sulphate of ammonia factory is due to a constitutional objection on my part to Irish industry.  The Minister seems to forget that before he or his belongings were ever heard of in this country I and my belongings had invested everything they had in this country.  There was industry functioning in this country before the name of Lemass was ever heard of.  It was industry that had not to pay bribes to political rackets in this country in order to get licences to rob our people.  Let us have a truce to that type of talk.  If anyone in this country dares to attack the tariff racketeers, he in unnational and opposed to Irish industry or to the employment of our people.  It is those of us who want to be proud of Irish industry, who want to see our people employed, and who employed our people by providing the means by their own labour to create employment for them, who resent and detest the fungus industries which have grown up in this country as a racket to rob the people and fatten the racketeers.  There is no Deputy who does not know that I am speaking the truth in that regard.</P>
    <P>I object to the establishment of an industry here which will result in the farmer who has to sell his goods in the <Col N="923" /> British market, because he has nowhere else to sell them, being burdened with a tax which his competitors in that market have not to bear.  That is my sole objection.  I reject the attempt by the Minister to mislead our people in that regard.</P>
    <P>This House has to make up its mind on this question; are you going to ask the farmers of this country to produce agricultural products which they must sell in the open market in Great Britain and, at the same time, require them to pay a tax on their raw materials that the competitors they have to meet are not called upon to pay?  Because, if you do intend to do that, it means that you intend to make our farmers paupers, while the farmers of other countries who are supplying the British market enjoy a moderate standard of comfort.  If you want to feed a beast in this country, it will take the produce of half an acre to feed him.  If you tax that half-acre through the manure the farmer must use upon it, the amount of that tax will come out of the profit which he is able to earn in competitions with those he meets on the British market who have no tax to bear and you will, as certainly as we are in this House, ultimately create a situation that where the Dutch, the Danish or the Belgian farmer is prepared to take 10/- profit on his beast, our farmer, who has worked just as hard, just as efficiently, just as resourcefully, will be obliged to sell his beast for no profit at all in order to meet the Belgian, the Dutch and the Danish price, because the profits enjoyed by the foreign farmer, who has free access to raw materials wherever he can buy them cheapest, will be consumed, at the expense of the Irish farmer, by the tariff racketeers of this country who do not give a damn about the people they exploit so long as they can line their pockets and live in stylish houses out of the unjust profits, extracted behind a tariff or quota restriction, in their factories where those things without which the farmers cannot carry on their business are being made.</P>
    <P>How shall we pursue the Minister in the maze of misrepresentation which <Col N="924" /> he brings forward in regard to highly technical matters?  Fortunately, I can follow him every step of the way for I have handled these things as he has never handled them.  I have sold them and bought them and I have seen them used.  The pity is that there are few Deputies who have the same experience.  Some have used them; some have bought them; some have sold them, but there are very, very few who have bought, sold and used them and who can, therefore, follow through the intricate maze of the technicalities of this trade.  The Minister says to Deputy Hughes, one of the men in this House who has used them, that there was no restriction on the import of super and then he proceeds to wriggle out of that when he realises that if he does not wriggle out of it his ear will be nailed to the post of that misrepresentation. There was first a prohibitive tariff on Belgian super and then there was a quota restriction on all super.  Why?  I will tell you.  I know.  I saw it.  I saw the whole dirty rotten transaction and I reported it to this House.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir, Section 4, which gives them power to do a variety of things.  The Minister confuted Deputy Hughes ten minutes ago.  I want to show that Deputy Hughes was right and that the Minister was wrong. Surely I can do that, or is the Minister to be allowed to tell a story to the House which is demonstrably false and then shelter behind the protection that it is irrelevant?  It is on the record. The fact is that, long before the tax was put on super, the Irish manure ring had brought their price down to meet the competition from that source. Produce the balance sheets of those companies.  Was there a single year in which they could not pay a dividend? But, when they had been forced to bring their price down and, as a result thereof, the Belgian imports into this country of super virtually ceased, they went to that Minister and got him to put up a tariff of 25 per cent. against their potential competitor whom they had been able, out of their own resources, to drive out of the country and, having got the tariff, on the morrow's morrow, they put 2/6 a cwt. on to super.  Is there any Deputy will deny that?  I saw it done and I reported it to this House.  It is the same ring ultimately in whose favour a report will be made by the experts of this alcohol company and at that stage we will be told that, by the mercy of God, we have a public-spirited body of manufacturers in this country into whose hands we can confidently commit the task and you will see the same manure ring manufacturing sulphate of ammonia in this country to squeeze another drop of blood out of the farmers we are supposed to represent.</P>

      <P>I challenged the Minister on renewing the debate to-day to tell us what that meant and he has gone back again and again to his plan for sulphate of ammonia.  I am trying to warn this House that what appears on the face of that section is not its inward meaning.  I am trying to warn the House that a cursory reading of that section might persuade one to believe that it was merely a harmless section designed to widen the field of legitimate research but that I know it is a section designed to enable the manure ring of this country to squeeze another drop of blood out of the agricultural community.  I do feel in the position of Cassandra and I can see that many of those listening to me read it and reread it and say: &ldquo;Where can you get that meaning out of it?&rdquo; I want to tell the story as clearly as I know it myself.  That is what I am trying to do. I take a man like Deputy Ó Briain.  He just does not believe it.  He cannot imagine that it can be true.  All that I can do is to warn him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not return to the question as to whether industrial alcohol would be, or ever had been, a potential substitute for petrol.  He sought to make the House believe that on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I challenged him to prove it, and he ran away from it.  Perhaps Deputy Ó Briain would be astonished to hear that one of the lofty purposes to which the factories are at present being turned is the manufacture of industrial alcohol out of sugar beet.  Does that surprise him? It is too much trouble to bring sugar beet from Monaghan and North Louth <Col N="927" /> to the Thurles factory, so it is brought to Carrickmacross alcohol factory and there turned into industrial alcohol to be sold at 7/6 a gallon to the people of this country who cannot get a spoon of sugar to put in their tea.  I heard the beet-sugar factories of this country described on one occasion as prolific elephants, but under the existing dispensation they are not only prolific but mad as well.  They have apparently decided to reject their own raw material and function on the presumption that our people have more need of industrial alcohol at 7/6 a gallon than they have of sugar at 5d. per lb.</P>
    <P>The Minister skated lightly over the elaborate duties that this company would have to discharge in investigating the methods of the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia in this country. Are Deputies of this House such children as to accept tripe of that kind, or do they not know that all the existing systems of nitrogen fixation have been made the subject of abundant literature which is there for all who run to read?  There is no necessity to turn to Carrickmacross nor yet to Ballycroy in order to examine the work that was done 20 years ago by the German Dye Trust&mdash;by Brunner Mond, which is now Imperial Chemicals, and by Duponts. When the Minister tells you that elaborate research on these matters is going to be investigated in Cooley and at Carrickmacross that is not the truth as I was brought up to understand the word.  When I was a child I was told it was wrong to tell a lie, but to prevaricate was contemptible because that man had not the courage to tell the truth nor the guts to tell a lie.</P>
    <P>There is no research necessary for the methods available to us in this country for the manufacture of nitrogenous manure.  It is a nitrogen fixation process, of which there are two or three, every detail of which has been worked out and operated under commercial conditions.  If you want to live in the kind of way which was commended to humanity by the late Marshal Goering you can then consider the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia but you must employ specially made hydrogen and nitrogen as constituents. <Col N="928" /> But if you do not want to surrender yourself to that particular form of economic schizophrenia which infects and poisons the people of this country, then buy a commodity of that kind where it can be made and where the raw materials cost virtually nothing at all.  What is wrong with us here is this, that the people of the Fianna Fáil Party of this House have been degraded into economic schizophrenia which persuades them that any contact with the outside world is impure&mdash;you may have to do it for a time in this imperfect world in which we live&mdash;but that the ideal to aspire to is a Gaelic Robinson Crusoe.</P>
    <P>That queer mental twist is precipitating our people into a series of economic disasters which some successive Government will have to repair.  I do not envy that Government their task.  It is going to be an appalling one.  Most people on this side of the House, in one degree or another, are not prepared to accept the proposition that contact with your fellow-man outside the four shores of Ireland is a crime.</P>

      <P>To-day he justifies the proposition put forward on the section that it will contribute to our economic self-sufficiency.  You can see the few Fianna Fáil heads that are here wagging like mandarins and saying: &ldquo;After all we are on safe ground; the chief says that, so it must be right; anything that he wants to do, if it is <Col N="929" /> economic self-sufficiency is o-kayed by us, whether we understand it or not,&rdquo; but if he will use any other argument for it, then their native wit will enlighten them.  They see what it truly is&mdash;a tax on their neighbours and a burden which their own people will have to bear.  Against that average decent men, countrymen most of them, would react violently.  At economics, self-sufficiency, every head starts nodding, because a negation would mean excommunication by the chief.  Till we get rid of that mentality, we shall have a series of follies of this character thrust upon us, but so long as I am here, so long as I can get a quota of people to send me here, I will fight them every inch of the way.

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some rough idea of the process by which sulphate of ammonia is manufactured.  I am aware, too, that it is not necessary to collect nitrogen as a by-product from some other industry and I am aware that synthetic sulphate of ammonia is now produced.  I am satisfied from what the Minister stated that, in the matter of raw materials, we have the anthracite&mdash;perhaps the Minister can say we have the turf&mdash;and we have the electricity.  Given a very high temperature we can combine the nitrogen with the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the rather crude ideas I have about it, I am not at all satisfied, taking into account our requirements, the amount we used pre-war and the amount we could use, that it is possible to produce sulphate of ammonia economically here in competition with Imperial Chemicals at Billingham. The Minister suggested that it can be produced at a price equal to the <Col N="930" /> import price.  He added that he was giving some information about superphosphate of which I was not aware. He indicated the 20 per cent. on Belgian products and that afterwards there was a quota fixed.  I want to give the Minister some information now.  We have been the lowest users of superphosphate in the world because of the high price we had to pay.</P>
    <P>In recent years, when one would expect, with the increased knowledge of the agricultural community so far as the advantage of using phosphate is concerned, that more of it was used, the Minister can see from the returns that the amount utilised by our primary industry has not increased from year to year.  I do not think Britain was ever interested in an export trade in superphosphate, so there is little use in the Minister suggesting that we did not get imports from Britain, because Britain is interested only in the manufacture of super for her own requirements.</P>
    <P>The House cannot overlook the warning given by the Minister for Agriculture and his departmental experts and also by our agricultural economists.  They have warned the country as to the necessity of providing these essential materials for agricultural production at a competitive price.  There is no use in going into details, because they are elementary. The Minister must appreciate that the margin for the primary producer the world over has been very narrow at all times.</P>
    <P>As a result, there are suggestions made about the formation of a federation of primary producers, F.A.O. and organisations of that sort, to try to make an international effort to secure a more reasonable margin for the primary producer.  If it is essential for our economy that we have an exportable surplus and we have to sell it in competition with farmers who have raw materials at a lower price, that is the real danger and that is what I am concerned with.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking pains to represent this Party as against the establishment of Irish industry.  We are against the establishment of any industry that will throw undue burdens <Col N="931" /> back on other industries, and particularly the primary industry.  In the circumstances in which we live here, we must have a very substantial exportable surplus if we are properly to develop, because we could not possibly consume what the land is capable of producing.  We cannot afford to throw back burdens on the primary industry simply because it appears desirable to have an industry of this sort.  The desirability is not enough.  The economic aspects and the repercussions on other industries, particularly on the primary industry, must be carefully examined. I submit that empowering this company to carry out any research work with a view to the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia is not the right procedure and the Minister is not providing the necessary safeguards that the House would desire.  An independent tribunal ought to be set up to examine the matter if the Minister is convinced that it is possible to manufacture sulphate of ammonia at an economic level.</P>
    <P>The Minister stressed the war situation, but surely we are not going to plan for an internal war situation.  Are we to plan for a war situation all the time or for a fairly long period of peace and a short period of war?  Have we to carry as a safeguard undue burdens that the primary industry cannot carry?  That is the position in a nutshell. I do not think the Minister is quite fair.  He is merely playing politics when he tries to represent this Party as opposed to industrial development. We are opposed to schemes that throw back heavy burdens, particularly on agriculture, that will inevitably depress the agricultural outlook.  If the Minister examines the position over the last 15 years he will be surprised to find our agricultural output has fallen.  The volume reached a higher level prior to that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a matter of this kind, when a Deputy comes up against experts, <Col N="932" /> it is difficult for him, not being an expert, to express an opinion.  What the ordinary layman&mdash;if I may use that phrase to describe a Deputy who is not an expert&mdash;would seek is the guiding principle which governs a section of this kind and the operations of a company such as this.  I do not subscribe to the idea of self-sufficiency, neither am I opposed to the development of Irish industry here.  I believe that in every way the genius and energy of our people should be directed towards developing here every conceivable industry, having regard to our resources.  I also hold, as a guiding principle, that private enterprise should, in the main, be permitted to operate our industries manufacturing in every sphere and, to a great extent, research also.  However, there are occasions on which the community as a whole, through the State, must come in to assist private enterprise.  This is particularly true in a small nation like ours, where there are no big industrial concerns to carry out far-reaching research. On that account, there seems to be a case for the establishment of a State company to carry out certain activities in regard to manufacture and research.</P>
      <P>We must also ensure that the consumer is protected and, in the case of the manufacture of the substance provided for in this section, artificial fertilisers like sulphate of ammonia, the consumer is also a very important producer and so it is particularly necessary to protect him adequately.  The only fear that arises in my mind is that the protection provided in this Bill may not be adequate.  We know that various safeguards have been suggested by the Minister, in this Bill and in the Principal Act, but we know how similar safeguards broke down in the past.  For example, in connection with the manufacture of bacon, we saw how the safeguards provided for the community were disregarded and overturned.  We must be very much on our guard to ensure that the net result of the passing of this section will not be to increase the cost of sulphate of ammonia to the Irish farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept the view that we should refrain completely from manufacturing sulphate of ammonia <Col N="933" /> unless we can manufacture it more cheaply than in any other part of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone suggested that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not answering any point made by Deputy Hughes but am merely expressing my own thoughts and ideas.  If we admit that there might be a case for manufacturing it here, perhaps at a somewhat higher price than that at which it could be imported, we may be accused immediately of seeking to impose an additional burden on the farmer.  Of course, that does not follow at all.  The manufacture of certain commodities such as this may impose some additional burden on the farmer and on the community, but perhaps their non-manufacture would impose an even greater burden on the community in general.  There will always be a population here to maintain and the burden of maintaining it might be greater than the cost of putting the people to produce in industry.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it behoves us to be extremely careful and to view this section in its widest perspective, having regard to the whole economic set-up.  For example, it is true that during the years before the war, home-manufactured sugar cost something more than imported sugar would have cost, but if we take the whole period during which we have been manufacturing sugar here, we find that there is a net gain to the community through manufacturing.  The answer to that may be that, here again, we are planning all the time for a war situation.  However, we cannot eliminate from our calculations the fact that, in spite of the benevolent attitude of the Great Powers towards each other and their mutual guarantees, there may be another war at some time in the future.  Even leaving that question out of consideration altogether, there is an urgent and pressing need for our people to engage in industrial research and development&mdash;and particularly in the development of industries which are of a complex nature, which require a good deal of expert knowledge and deep research and which are very technical in their processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> The industries which are going to succeed here in the future are not the simple, old-fashioned industries like mining and the heavy industries like iron and steel, but rather the more complex and technical ones.  Therefore, I would be slow to turn down the proposition which is submitted to us in this section; I would be slow to prevent this company from undertaking the manufacture of commercial substances&mdash;perhaps at the outset mainly for experiment, but with a view to their becoming permanent industries. The House should realise that we have no individual manufacturers with the resources and advantages possessed by some of the huge manufacturing companies in other countries.  It should be borne in mind, also, that some of our biggest and oldest established industries arose in their infancy from an Irish Parliament over 120 or 140 years ago giving them some encouragement and definite assistance in their initial stages.  These points must be remembered in considering the proposition contained in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that a section of this kind should be critically examined because it contains unusual provisions.  In course of time, it may impose a burden on the State which may not be justified on rigid economical grounds.  I have no fault to find with sub-section 2, which provides for experiments for the purpose of ascertaining if chemical processes can be safely undertaken here.  This discussion has centred on the establishment of a sulphate of ammonia industry. If it is the intention of the committee associated with the company that such an industry should be established, it is only right that another committee should be set up for the purpose of examining the economics of that industry.</P>

    <P>The Minister indicated that, if the establishment of such an industry were recommended, it would be necessary for him to approach the Dáil with legislation to enable him to get the industry going.  If the Minister has occasion to approach the Dáil with legislation of that character, he should <Col N="935" /> be able to give the House an exhaustive statement of the economics of such an industry.  I do not think that projects for the establishment of new industries should be rigidly examined from the economic standpoint.  If that were done we should make no progress whatsoever.  But an industry of this character, about which one of the Minister's colleagues entertained some doubts, should, certainly, be closely examined before its establishment is recommended to the Dáil.  I suggest that, on Report, the Minister should include a sub-section providing for the establishment of another committee or sub-committee.  I suppose it would have to be another committee, because we could not expect persons who are experts in chemical subjects to be experts in economics.  This committee should examine the economics of whatever industries the other committee recommends.  If the Minister would do that, it would give the House confidence because they would have an opportunity of examining the legislation in the light of the information supplied by the committee.  We heard a great deal about emergency conditions and the war situation but I assume that this legislation is designed for peace-time conditions.  We are entitled to be assured that, when a big undertaking of that kind is embarked upon, the consumers of the product of that industry will not have to bear a burden which is out of proportion to their resources.  It is our duty to see that the primary industry is protected in every possible way and that its overhead charges are reduced to the lowest possible level, so that producers will be able to compete successfully with their rivals in the British market.</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of an industry here, I assume that a tariff will be imposed on similar substances from other countries and that the farmers who will be the consumers here will be forced to buy the home product. They should be able to buy it at a price similar to that charged by the outside bodies.  It is our duty to see that legislation of this character does not operate unfairly in respect of the people whom it is intended to benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> It was mentioned in the debate that the Minister for Agriculture said on one occasion that, if a sulphate of ammonia factory were established here, the purchase of its products would impose an additional charge of 10 per cent. on the consumers.  Has the Minister for Agriculture been consulted about this section?  Has he changed his views in the intervening years or does he still hold the view that a sulphate of ammonia factory here would be an uneconomic proposition?  It would be interesting to have the views of the Minister on that subject, because I assume he has gone into the matter exhaustively with his own experts and that they have definite views on the subject.  The Minister can rest assured that we are just as anxious to see industries established here as he or any member of his Party is but we want to make sure that, when established, industries of this character will not impose a burden on the primary producers.  We have to recognise that the products of the primary industry are sold on a foreign market and that every burden placed on the producers puts them at a disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> their competitors.  For that reason, I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should set up a committee to examine the economics of whatever industries those who engage in these experiments recommend and, particularly, the industry we are discussing at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The main portion of your speech dealt with artificial manure, or superphosphate, that might come in from Belgium.  For the first time, a new idea struck Deputy Hughes.  He said that a large group of manufacturers of artificial manures in England would not be interested in an export market.  That is news to people in this country&mdash;or in any other country.  I am sure that group of manufacturers of artificial manures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say artificial manures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Superphosphates.  I am sure they would be just as interested in an export market as any of their colleagues in the industry in England. As the Minister pointed out, the superphosphate manufacturers of England can send their stuff into this country free of tariff and restriction.  They have not been doing so.  Our manufacturers are competing with them and producing artificial manure or superphosphate at as low a price as the English manufacturers can produce it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes admits that for once in his life but he is afraid of this section which says nothing about sulphate of ammonia.  The Minister is asking for powers to enable the existing company to make certain investigations of a technical character in the matter of electro-chemical industries and kindred products.  Incidentally, he mentioned that the possibility of manufacturing sulphate of ammonia in this country would be explored by this company. We then have all this furore from Deputy Hughes, not backed by very many members of his Party.  He speaks alone as far as I can see in this matter; he is not supported by some of his Party anyhow.  They do not see eye to eye with him in this matter.  He quoted some statement of the Minister for Agriculture to the effect that, were it not for him, sulphate of ammonia would have been manufactured here.  I wonder is the Minister for Agriculture still of the same opinion.  Let us assume that sulphate of ammonia did cost 10 per cent. more here than in other countries. If we had had it for the last six years it might have paid the country 10 per cent. over the next 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> We have no sulphate of ammonia for the last six or seven years.  Has Deputy Hughes estimated the loss to the country as a result of that?  He talked about a tariff of 2/6 or 3/- on every acre of arable land in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of your colleagues will recollect it as well as I do.  I am just wondering what Deputy Hughes has in mind in his objection to the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia in this country.  Would it not be better <Col N="939" /> to have it in view as a long-term policy for the country even if it did cost 1/- or 2/- per cwt. more?  If we had a sufficient supply for the last six years we would not be short of so many agricultural products as we are to-day.  The Deputy will admit that.  The very same argument was used on the benches opposite against every proposal to start other industries here in years past; we have heard it time after time.  We have a very definite recollection of it in regard to the manufacture of cement, but we do not hear a word about cement to-day.  We do not hear it said that cement costs the primary producer or the builder more than it would if we were importing cement.</P>
      <P>I am just wondering when we are going to get away from having the same arguments trotted out on every occasion there is any proposal to improve the lot of the people of this country, because that is what it means.  The very same arguments were used in the Parliament of this country many years ago to bring about the Act of Union.  It was urged that it was far better to be in union with another country which could produce things much more cheaply than we could hope to produce them.  Deputy Hughes used the very same argument.  I am surprised, and very often pained, to hear any Party suggest that we cannot produce anything in this country, that some concern in foreign lands can produce it more cheaply than we can and that unless we can buy these cheap products of other countries on all occasions, agriculture cannot exist here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, as one having at least the same interest as Deputy Hughes in the future of agriculture, that the ordinary farmers do not accept these theories at all.  They have never accepted them and they have shown very definitely that they are interested in having industries created in this country.  They have shown it by the fact that on several occasions by their votes they have put the Deputy and his Party in a minority and put the Party on this side of the House in a position to build up these industries. Farmers who are interested in having their costs of production as low as <Col N="940" /> possible on all occasions do not accept Deputy Hughes' theories.  We have of course the old Tory few, a certain small element in the country, who are always opposed to this country producing anything except flocks and herds.  Deputy Hughes, whether he realises it or not, is advocating the very same view on every occasion he gets up here in this House.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that any group or any responsible member in this House should put forward views of that kind. I do not mind Deputy Dillon, because nobody heeds what he says.  He has not the views of any sane person and never advocates the view of any sane person, but I am surprised that any member of a responsible Party representing a certain view in the country, and including in its membership many who are strongly in favour of building up industries in this country, should share the views of Deputy Hughes. Everybody is anxious to have the taxation of the primary industry of the country kept as low as possible but it must be remembered that the primary industry enjoys a large measure of protection in the home market.  It is protected against the agricultural produce of any other country in the world and Deputy Hughes is aware of that.  Side by side with his objection to establishing a factory to produce sulphate of ammonia, if he were consistent in his views he should advocate that in normal times the import of all agricultural products should be freed from restrictions of any kind.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will continue his investigations into the possibilities of producing this very necessary commodity in this country.  It is absolutely essential for agriculture and agriculturists are long sorry that it has not been available for the last six or seven years.  If it had been available, output would have been increased by at least 20 per cent.  There is no immediate sign of its becoming available from outside sources and I hope that as a result of the investigations which he intends to initiate, the Minister will succeed in having it produced in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The great trouble I see in this House is that proposals are <Col N="941" /> not considered from the aspect of whether they are right or wrong.  The position appears to be that, if one side puts up a proposition, the other must find fault with it.  It was sad to hear all the ridicule possible being thrown on Irish industries by a Deputy here, when we should realise that our first duty as Irishmen is to do the best we can, and, even though they are wrong, to say they are right and help them out. That is the way the Japs get on and they are right in doing it for Japan, and our duty as Irishmen should be to try to help everything Irish in the best way we can.  Instead, we find that it is the job of Fine Gael in this House to oppose everything Fianna Fáil puts forward and the job of Fianna Fáil to oppose everything Fine Gael puts forward, regardless of whether it is right or wrong.  As has been said by Deputy Allen, if we go back a little on history, we will find it is that type of activity that lost us an Irish Parliament in times gone by.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the section. We are told here that it may cost a little more.  Deputy Hughes told us about what could be got from Belgium, as did Deputy Dillon, and how cheaply it could be got there, but what could be got from Belgium during the past five or six years?  There was nothing to be <Col N="942" /> got.  I am not who would like to see any action taken which would impose a burden on the section of the community I represent, but that section is one which does not mind bearing its share of the burden.  I believe that, even with the extra 10 per cent., sulphate of ammonia would have been very cheap if we had had it for the past six years, when we consider that sulphate of ammonia was brought across the Border and sold to the farmers in Deputy Hughes' constituency at £70 a ton.</P>
      <P>We must realise that the setting up of industries will help this country and will help the home market.  Listening to some Deputies, one would imagine that everything we have must go to a foreign market.  Thank God, we have a home market here for a fair share of our produce and our job is to make that home market still stronger.  I should like the Government to realise that, while I am in this House, they will get every help from me that I can possibly give to build up these industries for the production of commodities essential to our people.  That will be the home market for our producers and the greatest value of all will be that it will save our children from being exported as they were exported in years gone by.  I suggest that the Minister should go forward with this Bill and see what can be done, to do it in the best way possible and I believe he will have the goodwill of the people in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Allen deliberately misrepresented me or not.  Perhaps he was asleep yesterday evening, and, in fairness to him, it would be better for me to come to that conclusion, because I never mentioned anything about a 2/6 tax on land.  He was probably listening to Deputy Dillon and knew that somebody was speaking about a tax on land and came to the conclusion that it was I was speaking.  I never mentioned any tax on land, and, as a matter of fact, I am not opposed to the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia, as I made clear on Second Reading, if it can be done economically.  I am not at all satisfied that the method by which the Minister suggests these in- <Col N="943" /> vestigations should be carried out is the proper way to do it.  If it can be done economically, I welcome it, but I do not think we should charge this company with the duty of determining whether it is possible or not, without having some independent committee or tribunal set up to examine the whole matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that we are not empowering the company to do anything except to carry out investigations, but that is not my interpretation of the measure, and I cannot accept it.  Under sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph (c) of Section 4 (1), the objects of the company shall include the manufacture and sale of any substance, or of any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process, so that, with the licence of the Minister, they can start to manufacture right away without having to come back to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe that the Minister said an opportunity would be given to any person who believed that the granting of this licence would create State subsidised competition to make representations to the Minister but I cannot find in the section any suggestion that there is an appeal to an authority other than the Minister or that there is any expressed guarantee that a chemical licence of this character will not be issued which would in fact operate to complete with an existing industry, thus giving an aggrieved citizen access to the courts for the purpose of deterring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of access to the courts.  The power of <Col N="947" /> decision is given to the Minister.  The Minister's decision can, of course, be challenged in the Dáil.  It is a matter for the Executive and Parliament, not for the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the purpose of this Bill is to create industrial enterprise of a character that cannot be carried on, for one reason or another, by private enterprise.  The House is assured the powers of this Bill will not be used to compete with private enterprise.  If that is our intention, ought not we to say so and then, if there is a difference arising between the Minister and the citizen as to whether a project which the Minister intends to approve is in fact destructive competition, it is open to the citizen to go to an impartial tribunal and ask it to determine does the Minister's proposed licence in effect traverse the guarantee that was given to individuals by Oireachtas Eireann when this legislation was being enacted. Otherwise we have the situation in which the aggrieved person is constrained by this House to go to the man whom he believes he has a grievance against and ask that man to determine whether his grievance is valid or not.  Presumably, if the Minister believed the making of such an Order would create a legitimate grievance, he would not make the Order.  It is the individual who still believes he has a grievance, after the Order is made, for whom I wish to provide a tribunal before which he can go. Take the case of the Cork Yeast Company. At present that company is producing, as far as I am aware, a highly rectified spirit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That illustration will not serve here because different principles apply in that case.  The firm in Cork that got a licence under the Industrial Alcohol Act to produce the spirit applied for it and got it and produced the spirit knowing that this company was also empowered to do the same thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of the character&mdash;of the character&mdash;albeit not identical with the Minister's version of the facts.  Let us assume that the Cork Yeast Company was in the production of a highly rectified spirit and that this Act was enforced and that highly rectified spirit was one of the commodities in respect of which a chemical licence had to issue under this Act, and the Minister published in <i>Iris Oifigiuil</i> a declaration that he was about to license the new company, Ceimici Teoranta, to manufacture absolute alcohol, and the Cork Yeast Company said: &ldquo;That is to give Ceimici Teoranta a right to manufacture a product which we are already manufacturing satisfactorily,&rdquo; and the Minister replied: &ldquo;That does not come within the general guarantee given by me in Oireachtas Éireann or implied in the terms of this Act,&rdquo; and the Cork Yeast Company said: &ldquo;We think it does.  We believe Oireachtas Éireann meant that we should be given a guarantee of immunity against competition of this kind,&rdquo; are we to have the situation in which the final judge as between the Minister and the Cork Yeast Company is the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of possible doubt about that subject.  If the Deputy will read sub-section (2) of Section 6 he will see that doubt is clearly removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must re-state the case because the Minister is trying to avoid the issue.  Suppose the Minister gives a licence to a subsidiary of Ceimici Teoranta to manufacture sulphuric acid and a citizen of Galway instantly enters a caveat and says, &ldquo;I am manufacturing sulphuric acid and you should not give a licence to a subsidiary <Col N="949" /> of Ceimici Teoranta to manufacture the same product,&rdquo; and the Minister rejoins and says: &ldquo;The licence which I propose to give still stands because, in my opinion, the plant you have cannot produce the sulphuric acid of that quality which I think is required,&rdquo; or, perhaps, &ldquo;the plant you have has not the capacity and does not promise to have the capacity to fulfil the new demands which I foresee are going to eventuate in this country for sulphuric acid,&rdquo; to which the Galway man rejoins: &ldquo;I have made contracts for large supplementary installations and I am prepared to produce certificates that the quality of my sulphuric acid is of the quality of the sulphuric acid manufactured by any other chemical manufacturer,&rdquo; are we to have a situation where the issue is clearly joined between the Minister on the one hand and the aggrieved party on the other, and that the aggrieved party has no tribunal to go to except the Minister who, he believes, is the person that is doing him wrong?  Surely we have not reached that stage yet. Surely, a man in those circumstances ought to have the right to go to some impartial tribunal.  Let him state his case and let the Minister state his case so that justice may be done between the parties.  Is there any one of the ten Deputies present, who is prepared to stand for the principle that if a citizen of this State believes himself to be aggrieved by the Minister that he should not be entitled to go before the judiciary in order to get justice, and not be constrained to depend exclusively on the Minister who, he believes, is concerned to heap injustice upon him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the proposal in the Bill.  The obvious person to decide the matter is the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think that any other proposal would be foolish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What protection has the individual then?  This is to be a State company set up by the Minister. The Minister is to hold the balance, but can he claim to hold it fairly as between a company that is fathered by himself and an individual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that this company will not engage in any manufacturing process if that process is likely to be done satisfactorily by private enterprise.  That is the policy of the Government as expressed in the Bill.  It is framed, therefore, so as to provide that a public notice of intention to give a licence must be issued so that any person who feels that his claims have been overlooked can have them brought to attention.  The policy of the Government is to leave the development of these industries to private enterprise, provided private industrial enterprise is prepared to do it on a substantial scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole point&mdash;the interpretation of &ldquo;substantial scale.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to risk giving further illustrations because if I do we will get another dissertation on economic problems.  Suppose the company proposes to engage in the manufacture of synthetic dyes, the fact that some person is producing a <Col N="951" /> particular dye on a small scale somewhere should not be a reason why the manufacture of synthetic dyes on a large scale should not be attempted.  I want to make it clear that I am giving that merely as an illustration. Whether that particular process of manufacture would or would not be considered by the company I do not know.  Even if the company does, in fact, engage in some process of manufacture that somebody else is engaged on in a small way, it does not necessarily put that small scale producer at a disadvantage.  The commodities which are being produced are in normal times imported subject to no import restrictions whatever.  If there is a small scale producer producing products and selling them in competition with imported products it will not necessarily put him at a disadvantage to have the products produced within the country by this company.  It is clear that the policy of the Government is not to give a licence for the manufacture of any commodity which is being, or will be, manufactured on a reasonable scale by private enterprise.</P>

      <P>I found you out in the case of the industrial alcohol.  I must judge the Minister by what he has done.  What other criterion can I apply? People might doubt my veracity, but fortunately that is not the only proof I have.  The Minister has powers under another Act to give an exclusive licence which he operates in exactly the same way as the provisions of this Bill would apply&mdash;that is in respect of an industrial process which he declares to be a reserved industry.  I was sitting in my room in this House when a man came to me and said: &ldquo;Mr. Dillon, I voted for de Valera since 1918; I voted for Seán Lemass in Opposition and now as a Minister.  I set up a little business and I was doing nicely.  The next thing I was told was that a reserved industry <Col N="952" /> Order had been made for some fellow down in Portarlington.&rdquo;</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be an ambiguity in sub-section (6) of this section, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In this section, the expression &ldquo;chemical product&rdquo; means any substance, all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process, and includes industrial alcohol and any product or derivative thereof.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that is what the Minister intends.  I believe what is intended is that &ldquo;chemical product&rdquo; in this section shall be deemed to include industrial alcohol and any product or derivative thereof, to distinguish the use of that term from the occasion when, apparently, it is used exclusively for industrial alcohol.  I would like to ask the Minister this question. Taking that wide definition of the words &ldquo;chemical product&rdquo;, does it include all plastics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I should interpret it as including plastic powders, but not articles manufactured of plastics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, observe what sub-section (6) says.  According to the Minister, he will administer the Act as meaning that plastic powder is a chemical product within the meaning <Col N="957" /> of this section, but the section goes on to say: &ldquo;&lsquo;Chemical product&rsquo; means any substance all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process&rdquo;.  Can anybody who produces a plastic article say that no portion of that article was produced by a chemical process?  If it is common ground that the article is made out of plastic dust&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the word &ldquo;substance&rdquo; limits the meaning of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it would so limit the section as to exclude sheets of plastic&mdash;articles made out of plastics or by any moulding process. Take sheets of plastic with which the Minister is no doubt familiar.  Take &ldquo;Perspex,&rdquo; the product of I.C.I.  In the early stage it is a transparent plastic.  It cannot be said that, in its sheet condition, it is an article but it is certainly a product.  Manifestly, portion of it is produced or obtained by chemical process.  I cannot imagine that it is the Minister's intention to include that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to what the Deputy is objecting to.  Is the Deputy's objection to the use of &ldquo;any portion&rdquo; or to the phrase &ldquo;produced or obtained by chemical process&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the words are wider than the Minister himself intends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly &ldquo;any portion&rdquo; might be modified but the rest of the provision would have to stand&mdash;&ldquo;produced or obtained by any chemical process&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that what the Minister means is that the raw material of the plastic industry might become a reserved commodity for the purpose of this section.  I think that the effect of sub-section (6) is to extend that to plastics which have not been finally moulded into the form in which they are ultimately to be sold, such as the &ldquo;Perspex&rdquo; sheets to which I have referred.  There is time between now <Col N="958" /> and Report Stage to review that with a view to rectifying it.  I do not care very much because I think the whole Bill is rotten.  At the same time, I have a feeling that any law that passes out of this House should be properly drafted.  I have no doubt that that is one of the few things about which the Minister and I are agreed.  It puzzles me why the Minister wants the powers in Section 8, because he has full power at present under his quota regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If somebody wants to set up a plastic powder industry here, what is to prevent the Minister from making a quantitative restrictive order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like this section.  I know how a similar section operated in connection with the footwear industry.  The Minister knows that, in certain circumstances in which a certain type of leather was not available, manufacturers of shoes were issued with licences to import.  The manufacturer applied to the Department of Industry and Commerce to import calf hide and that application was referred to Portlaw.  They made a recommendation as to whether the manufacturer should get the licence or not.  Certain manufacturers did get licences but other manufacturers could never get a licence.  I presume that the decision was made on the volume of trade and the amount of leather purchased at Portlaw but, in one instance, I was satisfied that there was discrimination.  One manufacturer could not obtain a licence.  If this section is to be operated similarly, I object to it because it is open to the same abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what case the Deputy is referring.  If we proceeded as Deputy Dillon suggested, under the Control of Imports Act, and made an Order establishing a quota, then a register of persons entitled to import licences under that quota would have to be set up in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  Any person entitled to be on the register is <Col N="959" /> entitled to get his proportionate share of the quota.  Deputy Hughes must be referring to the question of duty-free licences and not licences under a quantitative restriction regulation. This provision is required because it is not practicable to proceed under the Control of Imports Act.  It is clear that if, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7, public notice is given of the intention to license this company to produce certain chemical products, there is a real probability that, in normal times, substantial quantities of the product will be imported and the situation affected to that degree, particularly, as in the case of some of these chemical products, the actual quantities by weight might not be very considerable.  The reason for Section 8 is that, having regard to the notice provided for in Section 7 of intention to engage in this process of manufacture, forestalling might occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the company are not supplying the full requirements of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the stage at which that notice would be given, nobody would be providing any of the requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the company is established and is not able to supply the full requirements, somebody has to get a licence to import.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We would work under the Control of Imports Act and a register would be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A register of importers would be established.  The Act provides the basis on which it would be established.  Every member on the register would get a licence for a portion of the global quota, determined in accordance with certain rules.  The register is based on purchases by the firms engaged in the business prior to the quota.  At some stage, we shall have to get a different basis but that is the present basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the provisions of the Act were designed to eliminate, so far as it could be done, any element of discrimination <Col N="960" /> or discretion so as to make quite clear what the rights of individuals were.  It could not be done absolutely because, in the last resort, somebody must decide upon the claims that are made, but the Act was framed to make it clear that every firm would know precisely its right under the quota arrangements and would be in a position to exercise it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy really believe that version of the present procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked a question but I do not want to discuss it because I do not think it is a good procedure in present circumstances.  I think a much better system is to relate quotas to internal purchases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The real procedure is this: If you get a monopoly tariff in this country and you are unable to supply the market, it seems obvious that citizens should be allowed to purchase supplies from abroad to make up the deficiency.  But not at all.  You are given an exclusive licence to import the commodity free of tax and, lest it might appear that the differential in price as a result of its being manufactured in this country would be too much, you are not only allowed but encouraged to bring in the article free of duty and to levy off the consumer in this country the extra cost that you intend to put upon him when and if you undertake its manufacture in this country.  The classic case of that was the case of the springs for interior spring mattresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, the mattress manufacturers of this country did a considerable export trade in manufactured mattresses.  They were informed one morning that as the interior springs employed in the manufacture of these mattresses were now being manufactured in Dublin, they would be required to buy their supplies from a purveyor who was prepared to supply them. They went in astonishment to the place indicated, only to discover that there was such a person in a basement.  For several months that gentleman became the exclusive importer of interior <Col N="961" /> springs used in mattresses with the result that the entire export of interior spring mattresses in this country vanished.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This has nothing to do with the restriction on the importation of chemical products, which is the sole matter dealt with in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we were told a moment ago by the Minister of the benevolent way in which he used an analogous power and how it is the solemn rule in the Department that if any quantity of materials is imported under licence, it is equitably and evenly distributed over every importer in the country.  The fact is that if you get a monopoly licence from the Minister and then persuade him that you have not got reasonable machinery to fill the bill, you will get the right to import the commodity exclusively and make the poor fool consumer in this country enrich you with the price which you will charge him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If you did, it would be contrary to law and contrary to the policy which the Government has consistently followed in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing it. I am dealing with the specific statement made by the Minister describing the method of restricting imports.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 deals with the restriction on the importation of chemical products.  What will happen is that certain people will get a licence to manufacture this commodity.  They will tell the Minister that they cannot install the machinery for, say, nine months after they get that order. Deputy Hughes believes that, in the <Col N="962" /> intervening period, all persons engaged in the sale of that particular commodity will be allowed to import it from the normal sources of supply.  Nothing of the kind.  The person who has got the licence will get a permit to import that commodity and will become the sole purveyor of that commodity in the area.</P>
      <P>That condition will continue until such time as he gets the machinery and equipment to manufacture it here. That may be in a month, six months or in 18 months.  In the meantime the Minister for Industry and Commerce will hold a meeting down at the Five Lamps in Gloucester Diamond and will tell the people that he has started a magnificent industry, while in fact the gentleman who is supposed to be running this industry will be importing the commodity and making his &ldquo;neddy&rdquo; on it during the period when he is sole importer for this country. That is nothing new.  That has been happening for the past ten years as anybody in business can tell you.  I have pointed out several times in this House that as long as this Government is in office that kind of thing will continue. There is no means of stopping it except to put them out and put somebody else in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely that the power conferred by this section will be exercised but, as I mentioned earlier, there was a factory operated by the <Col N="963" /> Minister for Defence for the manufacture of certain chemicals near the Park.  It is possible that some property of the State used in connection with that factory will be transferred to the company.  We do not want to give the company any reason for not accepting the transfer.  If there is a transfer there will be no question of stamp duty on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is piling Pelion on Ossa.  The House might care to know why this proviso is put in.  The Department intoxicated themselves by discovering that they could make one of the constituents of the head of a match in the course of their experiments on the bomb which was to be used to blow up the invader.  They approached Maguire and Paterson's to know if they would buy this constituent for the head of a match if they manufactured it here.  Maguire and Paterson's being a very rational firm said: &ldquo;Certainly, if we can get it as cheaply as we can buy it in Liverpool.&rdquo;  They were told by the Department that it would cost about 7/6.  Maguire and Paterson's replied: &ldquo;But we can buy it for 4/6.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I know there is not, that is why I mentioned it.  The Department replied: &ldquo;Very well; we will make it and you can buy it at 4/6 and we will bear the difference.&rdquo;  This is to be another of our great internal industries, but what tickles me is that Messrs.  Maguire and Paterson, being a hard-headed body of men, excellent employers with an excellent industry, say: &ldquo;We are prepared to play ball with you, provided you pay for the ball but do not try any of these tricks on us.  We are not going to be held up to ransom and pay out of our profits for your follies.  If you want to pay for your folly yourselves, we do not mind taking the results and using them.&rdquo; That is what Section 11 is, and I do not blame the poor Leas-Cheann Comhairle for not knowing what it meant.

      <P>I want to raise the question of the distribution of grants <Col N="965" /> by the Department of Education. Under the parent measure, the Vocational Education Act, 1930, the Minister is empowered to provide, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, for the making of grants to vocational education committees in aid of expenditure under the annual schemes.  Sub-section (2) of that section says that, in making such regulations, regard may be had to, amongst other things, the following: (a) the annual local contribution payable to each vocational education committee, (b) the amount of the rate required to raise such annual local contribution, and (c) the population of the vocational education area of such committee.  So far as I can see, from figures published by the Minister's Department, regard is not being had to these considerations when grants are being distributed, and we find the most extraordinary anomalies in the amount of grant given to certain local committees as compared with the amount of rates which are contributed locally.  I want, in the first place, to raise the case of Dun Laoghaire.  In the current year, we are providing from the local rates £5,340.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, in the case of Dun Laoghaire, the current year's contribution from the rates amounts to £5,340.  The grant from the <Col N="966" /> Minister's Department amounts to £8,671, a proportion of eight to five. Taking the total grants made by the Minister's Department in 1943-44, as shown in the report for that year, we find that the total grants for the entire country amounted to £345,440 and the contributions from local rates to £222,951.  There the proportion is roughly in the neighbourhood of three to two.  We come then to particular committees and we find this position: Limerick&mdash;grants, £13,206 and contributions from rates, £2,606; Waterford&mdash;grants, £7,839 and contributions from rates, £1,850; Tralee&mdash;grants, £5,074 and contributions from rates, £574; Wexford&mdash;grants, £3,289 and contributions from rates, £570; Sligo&mdash;grants, £4,059 and contributions from rates, £522; and Drogheda&mdash;grants, £3,100 and contributions from rates, £616.  I hold that these figures disclose that the grants are being distributed in an arbitrary fashion by the Minister's Department and that regard is not being had to the provisions of Section 53 of the Act of 1930, which stipulates that, in making grants, the Minister must give consideration to the amount of the contribution from the rates, the amount of the rate required to raise the contribution and the population of the area, and I hold that, on any of these bases, the grant which we are receiving in Dun Laoghaire in proportion to our contribution from the rates is not equitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the figure for Dublin.  What I want to convey is that, in certain cases, the proportion of grant to contribution from rates is as high as four to one, whereas, in our case, it is in the proportion of eight to five.  In other cases, you will find proportions of three to one and two to one, and I hold that that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, if not a deliberate evasion of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ascertain from the Minister what principle operates in his Department in distributing grants.  Is it merely an arbitrary decision, or is he <Col N="967" /> acting in accordance with the provisions of the parent measure?  I know that away back in 1930, when the original measure was before the House, a standard year was taken and on that particular year a basic grant was fixed.  But we have to realise that at that time several schemes of vocational education were not developed as fully as they are to-day.  I consider that it is unfair to continue to distribute the grants on whatever basis was arrived at then, if that is the basis upon which they are being distributed.</P>
    <P>Not only that, but some two or three years ago in Dun Laoghaire we suffered a cut in our basic grant of £1,650. We felt very sore on the matter and we interviewed the Minister and his Departmental officials with a view to the restoration of this grant.  The only thing that emerged from that interview, so far as my memory carries me, is that we were being cut to provide for, if you like, the poorer areas, forgetting that we in Dun Laoghaire carry a very high percentage of poor people and that we carry a very high percentage of youths, between 14 and 18 years of age, who are in need of vocational training and education. We argued then for a restoration of that grant, and I am sorry to say that our efforts were fruitless.</P>
    <P>What I want to convey is that this system of grants does not obtain in any other section of the Minister's Department. The grants for primary education are based on a common standard all round, irrespective of the locality, irrespective of the conditions of the locality, irrespective of local contributions to rates or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>Of course, I shall be told that it is a matter of local taxation.  Even so, I hold that in this matter of vocational education we should approach the problem of finance on the national basis and that we should have an equitable distribution of public moneys all round.  Now the Minister is attempting by way of Section 2 to bring about uniformity in the contributions from local authorities, in so far as he is fixing certain maxima in the rates in the £ which they may raise.  Again, I want <Col N="968" /> to stress and emphasise that this will not arrive even at an equitable local contribution from the various local authorities.  Take the case of Dun Loaghaire.  A penny in the £ will raise something like £800.  A penny in the £ in, perhaps, Tralee or Sligo&mdash;I do not know what the figures are&mdash;will raise considerably less.  Again you get even by way of local contribution, an inequality in the amount of money which different local authorities should contribute to local education.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this whole problem of financing vocational education and to put it on a national basis so that there will be equality; equality in local contributions, if you like, but certainly equality in the matter of the distribution of grants from public moneys.  The principle obtaining at the moment seems to be a Robin Hood principle of robbing the rich to give to the poor.  That may be quite a good principle for Robin Hood, but it is not a good principle for the Minister's Department.  It certainly is not in keeping with the provisions of the 1930 Act.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister how the amount of the grant in any particular case is arrived at.  Is full consideration given to Section 53 of the 1930 Act, particularly (a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (2)?  What are the other things which he takes into consideration when he allots a grant to a particular committee?  I think that it is unfair to Dun Laoghaire that we should suffer in this way, seeing that we put up by way of local contributions ten times more than some of the local authorities who are virtually receiving the same amount of grant.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The system of grant laid down when the Principal Act was passed in 1930 was that existing basic grants would be paid, that the existing grants payable to vocational education committees would continue and that, over and above this, the State would pay an equivalent, or perhaps more than an equivalent, to the rate in excess of, let us say, 3d. in towns and boroughs.  In other words, the fruit of that threepenny <Col N="969" /> rate was regarded as being equivalent to whatever the State was paying at the time and, over and above the threepenny rate, the State contributed in the counties in the proportion of one to one, in the City of Dublin in the proportion of one to one, and in Dun Laoghaire in the proportion of two to one.</P>
      <P>Of course, it could have been an argument with the City of Dublin committee&mdash;I do not want to say that they used it as an argument, but I daresay it did not escape their attention&mdash;that if Dun Laoghaire, which really was in a position entirely analogous to the City of Dublin, was to get the equivalent of £2 for every £1 raised over and above, as I said, the three penny rate, then the City of Dublin should get equal treatment. The Deputy has referred to the fact that Dun Laoghaire has a large number of poor people.  That may be, but it is an area which, as the figure he has given shows, could raise a very substantial amount of money even on a penny rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it is that the valuation is high or that the district is more prosperous, whatever the reason, the fact is that the £800 which can be raised on the penny rate is, I think, a proof that Dun Laoghaire is in a rather prosperous state.  We have to take into account the fact that, so far as higher technological education is concerned, a certain number of pupils from Dun Laoghaire will, I take it, come into the city, particularly if the programme for the new city schools and for the new technological institute comes into force. It will mean that whatever advanced education in the way technological education is being given would naturally be provided in Dublin.  I pointed out to the deputation to which the Deputy refers that the people of Cork City, which is not in the happy position of Dun Laoghaire of being able to have its inhabitants avail themselves to some extent of the facilities under a neighbouring scheme, have to provide a school of music, a school of commerce and a school of domestic economy.  Therefore, we have to make allowances for the fact that a certain amount must be spent there in providing higher facilities.  I remember visiting <Col N="970" /> the Cork Institute and seeing university students attending some of the advanced classes in chemistry, for example, and I daresay that is true of other courses.  It shows that the Cork Institute can do advanced work of university standard.  We must have regard to that in distributing the grants.  The main case that might be advanced for Dun Laoghire, or any other area perhaps, has not been made by the Deputy&mdash;that there has been any hold up.  If the Deputy could show that the scheme was weak financially, was not able to pay its way by reason of the present distribution of grants, or that we were in any way holding up necessary development by reason of our present policy, it would be a case that would be more worthy of examination.</P>
    <P>It is a point which I think is deserving of consideration, that if areas like Leitrim or the town of Tralee&mdash;which, by the way, would raise over £80 on a penny rate&mdash;are expected to carry on even their existing schemes, unless you are going to make the local rate-payers foot an enormous bill or unless you are going, on the other hand, to increase enormously the State subvention, it is difficult to see how they can carry on.</P>
    <P>A number of these areas had reached their maxima and we were giving them special assistance but if it is said to me, as the Deputy has said, that the Government should come to the rescue and should not expect small areas to carry their schemes, and should give them further financial aid, my reply is that this system of vocational education is based on local rating with State aid in addition.  While I admit that in certain of the smaller schemes an extra penny in the pound brings in very little and that it would take a large rate to produce sufficient for substantial development, nevertheless, the principle of contribution by the local authorities exists.  When one considers what parents have to pay for the equivalent of vocational education in post-primary education in the secondary schools or in some other way, the vocational education facilities are very inexpensive indeed.  As I pointed out on Second Reading, the fees are small and, as Deputy Alderman O'Sullivan <Col N="971" /> said, it is practically free.  If we were to charge parents in respect of the education the children are receiving under vocational schemes and if we were to rate them accordingly, they would have to pay far more than the existing rate.  The facilities the individual child is getting are altogether in advance of any direct cost that the ordinary parent has to pay.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that in distributing the moneys which the Government is prepared to make available more consideration must be given to the poorer areas.  In fact, the existing scheme, if it is to be criticised, ought to be criticised on the basis that perhaps the larger and more prosperous centres ought to be able to pay even more than is proposed here from the rates and that the State should contribute far more towards the poorer and more thickly populated areas where the amount that can be raised is necessarily limited.  That is my view. If there is a development, and if the question of the school-leaving age, and so on, enters into it, it is quite certain that if vocational education is to be one of the methods adopted to bring post-primary school facilities to the children in the country generally, the Government will very seriously consider whether they are not justified in continuing the policy of asking the local authorities to contribute a substantial share.</P>
    <P>If the burden is too severe on the local authorities, then all I can say is that I shall urge the Government to reconsider the question but, until it can be shown that the burden that is imposed on the ratepayer is too severe or that the local scheme cannot develop in the way the committee would wish, or that all the circumstances point to the fact that the Government must give additional assistance, I do not think I would have very sound ground for going to the Government and asking for more money.</P>
    <P>The fact is that in respect of the building that has been going on and for which we can congratulate ourselves, the State has been contributing, roughly, 50 per cent. in certain cases and more than 50 per cent., in other cases.  We are contributing in the proportion <Col N="972" /> of £3 from the national Exchequer to £2 from the local rates generally and while the Deputy may feel that Dun Laoghaire has a case, I feel, in view of the considerations I have put before the House, it is not such a strong case and it is not by any means the strongest case that could be made of all the schemes in question for asking the Government to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>Wherever it is clear that the existing machinery and the existing provision does not enable a scheme to be carried on satisfactorily, and there is no way out of it, I am prepared to take up the matter specially with Finance, but I am not satisfied that at the moment it is necessary to alter the basis on which we are working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that under our scheme this year we are catering for advanced courses in chemistry, economics, commercial law, and kindred subjects, courses which will enable students to qualify for secretarial, accountancy and technological examinations and that, so far as that is concerned, we are doing much the same type of work as Cork is doing.  We have distinguished men giving instruction and we have quite a number of university students&mdash;medical students and others&mdash;attending the courses.</P>
      <P>I do not agree at all with the principle that the better class areas&mdash;the higher rated and higher valued areas &mdash;should be starved of grants to feed the poorer areas.  That is a sound principle for national taxation&mdash;and that is just my point&mdash;but it is not an equitable principle at all to apply in the matter of local contributions, and particularly in the distribution of grants based on local contributions.  If I understood the Minister aright, he said that in Tralee a penny in the £ would raise only £80, whereas a penny in Dun Laoghaire raises £800.  All that I can say is that, looking at it superficially, there would appear to be something wrong with the valuation of Tralee.  If we are to keep on this rating system the time has arrived when there must be an effort made to provide some other basis of valuation so as to arrive at a uniform, equitable charge for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> The ordinary taxpayer has to pay for primary education through national taxation.  I hold&mdash;it is my own personal view&mdash;that the same should apply to vocational education, all the more so when you consider that the types of pupils you get for vocational schools are the sons and daughters of the poorer class parents.  Their sons and daughters go to the vocational schools to get some training to enable them to qualify to earn a living.  There is no analogy whatever between the secondary school pupil and the vocational school pupil.  The vast majority of secondary school pupils come from middle-class families whose parents can provide out of their own pockets for the education of their children. The vast majority of vocational school pupils are, as I have said, the children of poor parents, and it is essential that that education should be made available to them free of charge, if at all possible, or at least at a nominal fee. I do not want to advance any arguments that would seem to suggest that I want to increase the fees on pupils attending the vocational schools.  In fact, I want the very opposite.  I do want the Minister to consider revising the whole scheme of the distribution of grants.  If we are to advance in Dun Laoghaire on the lines which we envisage at the moment and develop our technological side, despite the fact that we are so close to Dublin, we feel in Dun Laoghaire that we should have our own independence, and that we should not have to depend on Dublin. I do not agree at all with the Minister that a big majority of our pupils in Dun Laoghaire come in to attend certain classes in Dublin.  A certain number may come in for domestic economy, but as regards the ordinary pupils in Dun Laoghaire very few of them come in to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have no figures on that aspect of the matter.  We intend to develop along advanced lines, and it is essential, if we are to do that and develop our schemes further in that direction, that we should get greater aid from the State than we are getting at the moment.  Our proportion this year, as I have said, is the proportion of eight to five, not two to one, and it looks with the present tendency to increase <Col N="974" /> the local charges which will come into operation when this scheme is in force, that the proportion will be still higher against us.  All that I am pressing at the moment is that the Minister would reconsider the whole problem of grants with a view to a fair distribution all round.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this amendment I want to say that on the Second Reading of this Bill I failed to gather from the Minister's statement the reasons for this very drastic measure. The reason appearing on the face of the section is that it is to remove certain doubts as to the operation of Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Act of 1944. In order that the House may clearly understand what is being done under this drastic provision I should like to direct attention to the position as defined in the Act of 1930.  By virtue of Section 27 of that Act, the Minister had power by Order:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;either upon or without any suggestion or complaint from a vocational education committee, remove from his office or employment any paid officer or servant of a vocational education committee (whether appointed by or transferred by this Act to such committee) whom he considers unfit or incompetent to perform his duties, or who at any time refuses or wilfully neglects to perform his duties or any of them, and may direct that a fit and proper person be appointed in his place in accordance with the law relating to appointments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-section (2) of that section the Minister could not remove from office any officer or servant of such committee unless and until he had <Col N="975" /> caused a local inquiry to be held under the Act in relation to the performance by such officer or servant of his duties as such officer or servant, and until he had considered the report of the person who held the local inquiry.  Now, in addition to that officers of the old technical instruction committees who had served under the British régime, and who later came under the authority of the Free State, were guaranteed by Section 99, sub-section (3) of the same Act that they would not suffer in remuneration or in the conditions of their employment any deterioration either in the amount of their remuneration or in the condition of their service.  In other words, these officers were given this guarantee by law that they would come into the new service under the new committees with at least the same conditions and the same remuneration as they had previously enjoyed.  One of the conditions was that they would have to have a certain minimum period of service before going out on pension.  I think the period was 25 years.  In addition, there was no maximum age at which they might be retired.  Any anxieties that these officers had on the creation of the new system were allayed by this definite guarantee given to them by law.</P>
    <P>In 1944 the Minister sought to take away, and did, in fact, take away from these officers by Section 6 of the Act of 1944 the conditions which they had hitherto enjoyed.  The Minister got authority to fix the age limit in respect of any officer or office either belonging to a specified class, description or grade, or for one or more specified offices, so that he can make a general age limit.  Under that provision, by making the age limit in respect of any particular officer, he can name a particular officer and say that he has to go at 55 or 60 years of age, or whatever the age may be.  In addition, he took powers under Section 7 to suspend officers.</P>
    <P>Under Section 8 he took further drastic powers to remove the holder of an office from that office for unfitness, for refusing to obey any lawful order, or for misconduct, where he was satisfied, <Col N="976" /> as a result of a local inquiry, that any of the statutory grounds for removal from the said office existed.  That was a definite worsening of the position of these officers, particularly the transferred officers.  Apparently, some case must have arisen and the Minister must have been advised that the powers which he took to himself in 1944 were not drastic enough to deal with particular cases and in this measure he seeks to bring in a more drastic provision and to remove any obstacle or impediment which might stand in the way of the exercise of this arbitrary and drastic power.  The section says that &ldquo;For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that, notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (3) of Section 99 of the Principal Act, Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the 1944 Act,&rdquo; to which I have referred, &ldquo;will apply to a person who (a) by virtue of the said Section 99 was transferred to and became an officer of a vocational education committee, and (b) is the holder of an office under a vocational education committee.&rdquo;  In other words, the Minister is getting arbitrary powers to remove any officer.</P>
    <P>I hold that this is a progressive deterioration of the position of these officers.  A definite statutory undertaking and guarantee was given to these officers in 1930 that their conditions pre-1930 would be preserved to them.  In 1944 these conditions were worsened.  There you have a definite breach of the statutory undertaking given to a body of officers.  That is a most reprehensible proceeding on the part of any Parliament&mdash;to guarantee by law certain conditions of service and subsequently to remove by law the conditions guaranteed to them; and not only that, but to seek now the most drastic powers to deal with these officers.  I know that the Minister may say that something similar has been done under the Local Government Act, 1941, in reference to officers of local authorities, but I ask the Minister not to follow a bad precedent.</P>
    <P>The rights of these officers are being filched away by this measure.  The pre-1930 officers, such of them as are left in the service, are not very numerous. Many of them came into the service <Col N="977" /> late in life from other vocations.  They were the pioneers of technical instruction, or vocational education as we call it now, in this country.  By reason of that fact it is only right and proper that they should receive fair consideration in any measure affecting their position.</P>
    <P>I hold that an invasion of their rights, such as is contemplated in this measure, is so drastic and extreme that, if exercised in an arbitrary manner, it might lead to very serious injustice in particular cases.  I am not suggesting that the Minister intends to exercise these powers arbitrarily, but the House should not give such drastic powers to any Minister, no matter how reasonably minded that Minister may be.</P>
    <P>I can see cases where a conflict may arise between an officer and an inspector of the Department, where the idiosyncrasies of a particular inspector and the idiosyncrasies of a particular officer may create a personal conflict that will result, perhaps, in adverse reports on that officer to the Minister. I can see cases arising where, as a result of this conflict, the Minister may be forced by his inspectors to investigate matters of that kind and, despite the best goodwill on his part, an injustice may be done.  The Minister knows that not so many years ago a grave injustice might have been done to a particular officer had not other minds been brought to bear on the matter outside the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The attitude I take on this is that a statutory undertaking given by a law of this House should not be broken unless for the very gravest of reasons. Once a statutory undertaking is given to a body of officers, it should be upheld through the years.  Surely the Minister has adequate powers under the existing law to deal with any officer for unfitness or misconduct? He can hold a local inquiry and following that inquiry he can decide on the fitness or unfitness or the misconduct or otherwise of the officer. That should be sufficient for any Department to decide a matter of this kind without the Minister seeking this extraordinary power which, in certain circumstances, may be exercised arbitrarily.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> I ask the Minister to withdraw this section from the Bill.  I feel that it may result in a grave injustice to particular officers.  I do not know if the Minister has any particular officer in mind in this measure.  If so, the measure is all the more represhensible because it is an effort to get, as it were, <i>ad hoc</i> at a particular officer, and it is therefore a measure that should not receive the endorsement of the House. If the Minister cannot see his way to remove the provision, I would ask him to meet the case I am trying to meet by my amendment; that is, to restrict the operation of this very drastic provision to future officers and to allow the present position to obtain as regards those serving to-day.  The pre-1930 officers who came in from the old régime cannot be very many; I have no idea what the number would be. If any of these men have reached an age at which their services are no longer considered necessary in the public interest, then the Minister can get rid of these officers by fixing an age limit for them under the 1944 Act.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a fair and equitable way of dealing with the matter. If he were not disposed to do that I would ask him to consider what the Department of Local Government do in relation to particular officers with technical qualifications who come to the Department late in life, that is, avail of the provisions of the 1941 Act, by which added years may be given to them.  Many of these transferred officers may have been 40 years of age on coming into the service and may not have 25 years' service to-day.  Even if they had, I think that would not give them a right to the maximum pension. Unless provision is made, a feeling of uncertainty and anxiety will be created.  I ask the Minister to withdraw the section, if at all possible, and, if not, to restrict its operation to those to be recruited in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  The 1944 Act, which amended the 1930 Act, did&mdash;in the sections referred to in Section 5&mdash; seriously interfere with the existing statutory rights of transferred officers. <Col N="979" /> At that time there was strong opposition here to the proposed sections. The Committee Stage had a very protracted passage and I think there was also vigorous opposition subsequently in the Seanad.  That opposition was shown not merely because it referred to vocational officers but because the principle involved in the sections&mdash; which are in the 1944 Act and which are made more objectionable by the proposed section in this Bill&mdash;is a very well-known principle, which should not be violated in an arbitrary fashion. That principle is that one party to a contract has no right to violate it to the detriment of the other, without making adequate recompense.  An ordinary contract between two parties may be broken by agreement or, if it is violated by one party, the other can secure redress.  But under the 1944 Act and under Section 5 of this Bill, the violating party is the Minister and, since he is doing it by statutory enactment, the injured person, namely, the employee of the vocational education committee, has no redress under the contract or in equity at law.  It is a most objectionable provision and I urge the Minister to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>These transferred officers, taken over under the 1930 Act, had reached advanced years in many cases.  They had spent considerable time, money and energy, both intellectual and physical, in reaching a high standard of proficiency and in securing these positions and found themselves, on that account, entitled to teach the higher classes and the most advanced subjects.</P>
      <P>The normal procedure would be that, if they would not qualify for the maximum pension on retirement, they would be granted one-third, or whatever period was deemed necessary, in order to qualify them for the full pension. Under this Bill and under the 1944 Act, the Minister sweeps away the redress which those people had, merely because his Department is not satisfied with the work or conduct of certain officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan has demonstrated clearly that, if the 1930 Act were not sufficiently strong to give the Minister power to remove unsatisfactory officers, he got that power in the 1944 Act, <Col N="980" /> which enabled him to remove persons who were unsuited for the office or unfit to carry out their duties.  If they were guilty of any misconduct whatever, after the Minister had held an inquiry, that person could be removed. Apparently, the Minister is not satisfied with all those stringent powers, but wants power, under Section 5 of the Bill, in case of any doubt under the 1944 Act, not merely to apply this to future officers but to those who contracted to accept the terms of service when they were taken over.  It is a well-known principle that, in any case affected by legislation, a corporation or body is compensated, possibly after an inquiry, while an individual is usually given the option of retiring on pension rights or of re-engaging on new terms, realising that he then takes on a new engagement with changed terms.  But in this case, these people were transferred. Apparently, they accepted whatever conditions were offered to them in 1930 and now, under the proposed reinforcement of the 1944 Act by this Section 6, they are to be adversely affected and have no redress.  It is a most objectionable form of legislation. It may inflict injustice&mdash;I suppose it is bound to do so, if anyone is removed from office as a result.  If the Minister does not consider it advisable to withdraw the provision, he should at least accept Deputy Coogan's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the appeal made by Deputies Coogan and Cosgrave in this matter.  One wonders why the Minister finds it necessary to introduce this section at all.  There was a very arduous discussion on the 1944 Bill and many of us thought the Minister was then taking too wide and too sweeping a power to deal with these officers.  There was general praise for the progress of vocational education throughout the country.  Surely the progress of the schools in that work is due to the teachers and officers responsible for guiding it.  Previous speakers have stated that, when these older officers transferred, they came in on definitely assured and guaranteed conditions.</P>
      <P>I do not know what happened to induce the Minister to take the very strong powers he took in the 1944 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> Something must have happened even since 1944 to induce the Minister to take this further and more drastic step.  It is now sought to include in Section 5 people who got specific assurances from the old technical instruction committees. They are receiving treatment of a very drastic character and treatment which is at variance with the assurances given them and the conditions under which they worked under the previous Act.  The Minister has power to remove any unsuitable officer.  He is not handicapped in removing, under certain conditions, such a person.  If the Minister finds it necessary to have Section 5, he should apply it only to officials who will join the service in the future.  There cannot be a reasonable case made for introducing a section to deal with persons who have been working under the guarantee of an Irish Parliament.  When we break our word as a legislative body to a responsible body of citizens, it is calculated not only to injure the citizens but to injure the Legislature itself.  We look for rectitude and high moral standards on the part of our Parliament.  When we give our word in a legislative Act, it ought to be regarded as a solemn bond and should not be violated.</P>
    <P>Under the amendment which we are discussing, the Minister would still have all the powers he is seeking to deal with officers recruited in the future, leaving existing officers to work under the guarantee which was given them.  They have honourably carried out their part.  There have never been any outstanding cases of dereliction of duty.  The general conduct of those officers has been satisfactory and the proof of that is to be found in the rapid strides which vocational education has made.  We should do nothing to mar those happy relations.  I join in the appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment and to utilise those powers only in the case of future officers, leaving the present protection to existing officers.  If he will not delete the section, I ask him to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I associate myself with the appeal which has been made to the Minister by Deputy Coogan, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Keyes to <Col N="982" /> delete this section.  I should not have spoken on this matter if I had not received strong representations.  The association of vocational education officers have discussed this Bill very carefully, with special reference to the section now under discussion.  The Minister has appealed on many occasions for close co-operation between those administering the Act and the teachers.  If the Minister is anxious for such co-operation, he should be prepared to go some way to meet a very reasonable request.  The only objection I see to this Bill is the section under discussion.</P>
      <P>Assuming that the Minister is not prepared to withdraw the section&mdash;he must have very good reason for the insertion of it&mdash;I respectfully request him not to implement it in cases in which, as Deputy Keyes pointed out, a guarantee has been given by Act of this House.  The Minister is giving himself very great powers by this section.  I am sure that, on the strong representations put up to him, he will be prepared to reconsider the matter and accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Coogan.  If the Minister is not prepared to meet the very reasonable request made to him and if the section goes through as it stands, would the Minister give a guarantee that, in the event of an officer being compelled to retire, years will be added to his service in order that he may qualify for full pension?  I know that there is nothing in the Bill which will give that as a legal right but I should be prepared to accept the Minister's assurance on the matter.  In view of the strong protests that have come from the organised body of these highly respected officials, I ask the Minister in all sincerity to meet the request made by Deputy Coogan.  If he does, I am sure the happy relations that exist between the Minister and his Department and these officials will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved so very calmly by Deputy Coogan.  On two occasions, he used the word &ldquo;reprehensible&rdquo;.  If this section goes through as it is printed, the word &ldquo;reprehensible&rdquo; could be used by every member of the Dáil. <Col N="983" /> What does Section 5, which the Minister wants to get through, state?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that, notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (3) of Section 99 of the Principal Act, Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Amending Act of 1944 apply to a person who (a) by virtue of the said Section 99 was transferred to and became an officer of a vocational education committee and (b) is the holder of an office under a vocational education committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan asked the Minister for a guarantee that nothing drastic would happen existing officials under this section.  What good is the Minister's guarantee?  Those officials got a guarantee from this House some time ago.  They were assured that their rights would be protected.  Now, some years afterwards, in a section, &ldquo;for the removal of doubts&rdquo; these rights are being removed.  What good is the Minister's guarantee in such circumstances?  We have no guarantee that he will not bring in a section in some other Bill to take from those officials rights they enjoy.  The best course would be to withdraw this section entirely and to substitute a provision which would be arrived at in agreement with the officers concerned and which would satisfy them that their rights were being protected. Deputy Coogan said that there was a man already marked for the operation of this section&mdash;a man who might have availed of the law as it stands.  If this section is aimed at one individual, as Deputy Coogan says, it is reprehensible. Fault may be found with an official in an inspector's report.  On personal grounds or public grounds, the person concerned may be shown this section and may be told that he had better retire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ask a guarantee, for what it will be worth, by way of an amendment to the Act that if such men have to go, a certain number of years' service will be added that will give them a reasonable pension.  Suppose, as Deputy Coogan says, that a man is transferred and comes into the service at the age of 40.  That man may not have 25 <Col N="984" /> years' service to-day and is he to be told to get out because himself and some inspector may have had a difference? I would ask Deputy Coogan to press, first, for the withdrawal of the section.  If that cannot be done, I would ask that he press the amendment to a division and, if necessary, come back on another occasion with another amendment until such time as there is an agreement on this question. These officers had a guarantee under an Act of Parliament, and that guarantee is now being taken from them by this sub-section.  There may be some doubts as to their position, but what doubt is there in anybody's mind about the previous Act unless the Minister wants to take from some individual rights which he already enjoys and of which he could get the benefit by a judicial decision?  I would ask the Minister to withdraw the section now before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is no foundation whatever, I can assure the Dáil, for the suggestion that this section is aimed at some particular individual.  The position, as those who were here during the discussion on the 1944 Act will recollect, was that it was quite clearly the intention on my part then, that Sections 6, 7 and 8 in the 1944 Act should apply to transferred officers.  I think that anybody who was present at that time&mdash;in fact, the concluding portion of Deputy Byrne's speech just now confirms it&mdash;will admit that was clearly the intention. The Deputy wonders why we are seeking to remove doubts.  The position is that it was sought to repeal under the 1944 Act, Section 99 (3) of the 1930 Act which is in specific terms.  It was found, and a legal opinion has been given, after the 1944 Act became law, not <i>á propos</i> of any case because no new case has arisen, that the general position relative to vocational education officers as a whole&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal opinion is that clear words would be necessary to make the matter quite specific, to indicate that the provisions which were intended to prevail under the 1944 Act <Col N="985" /> will prevail over Section 99 (3) of the 1930 Act.  I need scarcely go into the question again but I might remind the House that the officers in question, before the 1930 Act was passed, were officers of local authorities.  Had we not vocational education legislation, presumably the enactments which have since been passed dealing with officers of local authorities would apply to them.  It was because of that legislation in connection with rating, and dealing with local officers, etc., that it is necessary for the Minister for Agriculture and myself, in respect of agricultural committees and vocational education committees, to move in step with the practice as laid down by the Department of Local Government and Public Health when the 1944 Act was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained at the time that if the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, as he has done recently, makes an Order&mdash;and we all know that for many years the matter has been the subject of discussion; it is nothing new&mdash;it cannot be regarded as an injustice to the officers concerned that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should now intimate that he is making an Order fixing a retiring age.  Everybody agrees that that is a reasonable thing to do and that all the circumstances have been taken into account.  At the moment, if I make such an Order there is this legal doubt as to whether it will prevail over the provisions of Section 99 (3) of the 1930 Act.  I want to set that doubt at rest. We were only trying in the 1944 Act to do what the Department of Local Government was doing in respect to local officers generally.  There was a good deal of argument at the time to the effect that the Minister was taking arbitrary and drastic powers.  We had some amendments and I tried, as far as I could, while safeguarding what I thought was the essential interest of the vocational committees and the necessity of having schemes as efficient and economic to the ratepayers as possible, to meet the feeling of the House in the matter of officials who are in question, with respect to the matter of retiring age for example.  I do not think it can be said they were badly treated.  Had there been no vocational <Col N="986" /> education code, they would scarcely have done as well as they have done. They were taken into the new scheme. In some cases they were made chief executive officers.  They received higher salaries, they received promotion and others had opportunities of promotion made available to them.</P>
    <P>These chief executive officers hold very responsible posts.  In fact they are the keystone of the system of the local schemes.  I think it will be admitted that they are largely responsible for drafting the programmes of work, building, curricula and various other matters, the control of the staffs and planning ahead, that they are advisers to the local committee, that upon their shoulders falls the task of supervising and controlling local staffs. If they are doing their duty properly, they will not alone see that everything is done efficiently and economically but they will go out to the centres under the scheme, see how the work is going on and carry out as much personal supervision as possible over the work of the officers.  It can hardly be claimed that all that can be done effectively and that the public interest will be served effectively, if the person responsible is not in his full health and is not physically capable of undertaking it.  We have a number of chief executive officers, for example, who are over 65.  We have even some who are over 70.  It is not necessary for me to assure the House that this matter has been given the greatest consideration. I think that very few Deputies, if they were in my position, would have any doubt or reluctance about going ahead to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>We had the question of added years, and as I assured the House&mdash;I do not know whether it was the Dáil or the other House&mdash;in an official circular issued on 28th June, 1944, we informed the committees, and they are all officially aware of the concession which is available for those who either have not the 25 years' service when they reach the retiring age, or who spent some time teaching, either as secondary or primary teachers, and who had service in that way but who would not get credit for it, unless some arrangement was made to give them added years.  I think the committees generally are <Col N="987" /> satisfied now&mdash;two years have elapsed &mdash;that the powers we sought were, as I explained at the time, needed to deal with perhaps exceptional cases of inefficiency and so on.  We have not had such cases, but I still think it is necessary to have the power.</P>
    <P>The immediate matter which arises, however, is this question of the retiring age, and, if it is national policy that there should be a retiring age of 65 for officers of local authorities generally, I do not see how it can be argued that we should not have a similar provision in respect of officers of vocational education committees.  When the Order is made, there must be at least six months' notice, and I think the persons in question who are approaching 65 years of age have already got notice and that, with the concession regarding added years to which I have referred, no one can argue that he is being treated ungenerously or unfairly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of the added years is set out in a letter which I have had from the Minister for Local Government. In the case of officers who, prior to appointment as officers of technical or vocational education committees, had served as teachers in primary and/or secondary schools, the number of years they had served in primary and secondary schools may be added to the actual pensionable service, subject to a maximum of ten years.  In the case of officers whose pensionable service on retirement is less than 25 years and who are under 70 years of age, special consideration will be given to proposals of vocational education committees to add the difference between the actual pensionable service and 25 years, or the difference between the officer's age and 70 years, whichever is less, subject to a maximum of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We now get the position that the Minister has sought a legal opinion upon a hypothetical case and he assures the House that he has nobody in mind.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that the Minister should come to this House merely to meet a hypothetical case and to give himself <Col N="988" /> powers for a contingency which he does not expect to arise.  I am not at all satisfied that that is the correct explanation, and it seems an extraordinary state of affairs that, as there is no difficulty there, these drastic powers should be sought.  Again, I say there is a considerable weakness in the Minister's case.  Now we are in this position, that we are merely removing certain doubts. The Minister felt that, under the Act of 1944, he had given himself all these powers.  He sought legal opinion and found he had not given himself these powers in relation to the transferred officers.  Yet, he says he has no particular officer or body of officers in mind. Why come to the House at all in these circumstances?  Why not wait until the condition of things arises that would need such drastic treatment?</P>
      <P>Apart from that, I want to put this point of view to the House: these officers are not State servants.  They are appointed by the local committees and they are the officers and servants of the local committees, and the Minister is not a party to the contract.  The Minister's function in relation to appointments and dismissals is merely that of a sanctioning officer.  The appointment is made under Section 23 of the 1930 Act, subject to the approval of the Minister, and the approval of the Minister means, in effect, that the Minister and his Department must be satisfied that the particular appointee has the necessary qualifications for the office.  I hold, therefore, that the Minister's functions are satisfied once the officer is appointed under the regulations which obtain in his Department. Again, a dismissal may be made by the committee with the approval of the Minister, and, under the same section, a committee may not only dismiss but remove an officer with the approval of the Minister.  Surely the House will realise that no responsible vocational committee would keep in their employment an officer who was not giving value for his money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put this matter in its proper perspective, because I feel that, both in relation to primary teachers and vocational teachers, there is an attempt on the part of the State to encroach upon the privileges and rights <Col N="989" /> of these sections of the community. The Minister comes into this matter of vocational education really as the representative of the people, and, if you like, to ensure that the people's rights are properly protected.  In representing the people, he represents the parents, and locally the committee's functions are virtually to take the place of the parent in providing the necessary means of vocational education.  In our Constitution, which is so much extolled from time to time, it is laid down emphatically that the primary function of education intellectual, social, physical and otherwise, is vested in the parents, but we all know that no parent can set up a university, that no parent can set up a vocational school to educate his child.</P>
    <P>Again, under the Constitution, a parent may avail of the facilities provided by the State for the education of his children and it is only on that ground that the Minister comes in at all, but because the Minister supplies a certain proportion of the funds expended on vocational education, he arrogates to himself the right to come in as a party to the contract.  I am not at all clear that he can come in as a party to the contract merely because he happens to contribute by way of grant a certain proportion of the cost of vocational schemes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that the officials who came in as transferred officers came in under a definite contract, that these officials had certain conditions under that contract before the 1930 Act was enacted.  Whatever these conditions may have been, they were guaranteed to them by Section 99 (3) of the Act of 1930.</P>
      <P>An effort was made in 1944, apprently unsuccessful, to brush these conditions aside and to leave these officers in the position that they held office at the will and pleasure of the Minister.  That is, in essence, what we are getting at.  These officers, as I have said already, are the appointees and the employees of the local committees and not of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> I am not going to venture a legal opinion on the matter as I have not gone into it, but I hold that there is a conflict there, and that it is not at all clear to me that the Minister has this right to come in.  Undoubtedly, the Minister supplies the cash.  He prescribes the regulations under which officers should be appointed, dismissed or removed.  But he seeks now to give himself arbitrary powers and to deprive these officers of any protection whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I hold that these powers are so drastic and so wide in their nature that this House should not concede them, and I will again appeal to the Minister to withdraw the section.  If he cannot see fit to withdraw the section, and if he feels that these powers must be given, I think he has given his case away when he says that he got a legal opinion on a merely hypothetical case, that no case at the moment presented itself to his mind, that there is no case of difficulty with the Department, that there is no concrete case upon which he wants to exercise those powers at present, but he wants to be sure of his powers. Then let him take the powers but restrict them to future appointees.  Let the existing officers be given the benefit of the conditions which were guaranteed to them by this House in 1930.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to argue the case of men who are 65 years or upwards.  I think that, as a general principle, when men reach that age they should retire in favour of younger men.  But I agree that they should retire on full pension.  If these men came into the service in middle life, perhaps sacrificing other careers outside in commercial life, the same provisions that are applied to teachers, primary and secondary, should apply to them.  In the case of teachers, the Minister may add ten years.  In the case of other persons, he may add the difference between 15 years and 25 years, or between their age and 70, whichever is the lesser, but in no case more than five years.  Again, I say that all officers should be treated on an equal basis. I press on the Minister that under Section 6 of the 1944 Act, he has the right to prescribe a maximum age for <Col N="991" /> any class of officers or for any individual officer.  Surely, if there is a difficulty there, by merely exercising that right he can pension off those who, by reason of age, are considered unfit for their office.</P>
    <P>Might I remind the House that we do not pension our Supreme Court judges until they reach the age of 70? There may be men in the service of vocational education who are physically and mentally as energetic as our Supreme Court judges.  These men are administrative officers.  They have had a long experience in the running of schemes of education.  They have had a long experience either in commercial life or in teaching and, if they are active and fit men, there is no reason why they should not serve to 70.  But I am not going to press that point.  I think that, as a general principle, 65 should be the maximum and that the aged should make way for the younger, active and energetic officers.  I think that, with the developments which are taking place in vocational education, it is essential that we have in the executive posts, particularly as C.E.O.' s, the most active and energetic men that we can find.  If there are a number of those who must go, they can go under the powers already granted by this House and there is no need that I can see, and there is no case that the Minister has made, for the drastic measures he is seeking now.  I would again appeal to him to consider this matter, withdraw the section and bring in an amended section for the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say another word to the Minister.  His argument sounded most extraordinary. He said that these powers might not be necessary, that since 1944 no case had arisen, that he did not think a case would arise, and that he had got a legal opinion on a hypothetical case.  Certainly it seems extraordinary to me that the Minister thought it necessary to have a legal opinion on the phraseology of the 1944 Act when he had no particular case in mind.  I do not think it is the usual procedure in Departments to seek legal opinions on portions of Acts without a concrete case being decided upon.  The Minister stated that the retiring <Col N="992" /> age for local government employees had not found any opposition. I think it found quite strenuos opposition, except that there was one saving feature, namely, that up to a maximum of one-third of the salary rate was allowed for pension purposes in the case of those who had not reached the maximum number of years.  That certainly watered down the effect of the retirements under the Local Government Act.</P>
      <P>In general, I think it is desirable that people should retire at an age that will allow young people to advance more quickly than at present and that would also permit those who retire some years in which to enjoy their pension.  That being so, I think that in most cases the earlier retirement age was regarded as usual where manual or physical work was concerned.  But it is an extraordinary thing that in the case of judges of the Circuit, High, and Supreme Court not alone was the age limit not reduced, but some years ago, because I think a judge's birth certificate could not be found, they added two years to the retiring age, which is now 72 for Supreme Court judges.  I do not know whether as you advance in years you reach the mental optimum or not, but it is an extraordinary thing that for certain categories of State or semi-State officials, certainly people whose salaries are provided out of State funds, there is a tendency to raise the upward limit and in others a vigorous tendency to reduce it.</P>
      <P>I certainly suggest to the Minister that in this case, in view of the serious view which is taken of the 1944 Act and the proposed amendment by the officials and officers of the vocational education committees, he should accept Deputy Coogan's amendment. The only hope that these officials have in future is that the legal opinion which the Minister got will be as good as the earlier Fianna Fáil legal opinions. Then the Act may not be in doubt, but it may be wide open and they will probably be able to continue on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only to say that the case is not hypothetical.  I have had no particular officer in mind, and I have not raised any hypothetical case. A general opinion had been given that there was a doubt in the matter <Col N="993" /> and this doubt might possibly affect the making of an Order by me fixing the retiring age.  If such an order were to be challenged it would obviously be necessary to introduce legislation to validate it.  It seemed to me appropriate, when we were bringing in this measure dealing with other vocational education matters, to clear up this doubt.  Deputy Coogan asks, when we have already power to fix a retiring age under the 1944 Act, why bother about it now?  The reason is, as I have said, that we want to be quite sure that there will be no challenge, no doubt, about the action we take.</P>
      <P>May I remind him that most of the older officer to whom the retiring age would apply are in this category of transferred officers.  There would be very little use in making an Order fixing a retiring age if we excluded transferred officers, who make up the majority.  I think it would be absolutely meaningless to accept the amendment because it is quite clear that the sections in the 1944 Act cover the officers who have come in since 1944.  I am simply being asked to withdraw the section and, in view of the case I have made, which explains the matter fully, I am not prepared to withdraw.</P>

He says there is a doubt as to whether he can fix the retiring age and relate that to the transferred officers.  If that doubt is there and if it is well founded, as it may be&mdash;I shall not argue the merits of that now&mdash;then why not restrict the provisions of Section 5, to remove that doubt in relation to Section 6 of the Act of 1944? I would again appeal to the Minister to do that.</P>

The words &ldquo;seven&rdquo; and &ldquo;eight&rdquo; removed by the Minister, will give him the necessary powers and he can proceed to fix the age limit.  I would ask him either to accept an amendment from me on these lines or to bring in an amended section on Report giving effect to that.  The Minister clearly has made no case for the powers; there is no concrete case in mind; and now we get the case that it is to enable him to dispose of the people who are due for retirement.  Then he has a very easy way out and I am asking him to take that way out, by removing the phrase &ldquo;7 and 8&rdquo; from the section.</P>

      <P>Then it boils down to this, that the Minister wants these extraordinary powers, even though he may never mean to exercise them or need to exercise them.  That is an extraordinary case.  It is the first time I have come across a legal opinion based merely on a hypothetical case.  As a rule, a lawyer does not give an <Col N="995" /> opinion except on the facts of a concrete case.  I ask the House not to subscribe to any further invasion&mdash;an invasion has already taken place&mdash;of the rights of these officers.  They are not in a position to defend themselves in this House.  They are a small body in the community.  There is no question of Party politics or advantage in the matter, good, bad or indifferent, but it is a principle that I am fighting for.  A body of servants, who are not State servants but the servants of local committees, were given by an Act of this House an assurance, an undertaking in law, that their conditions would not be worsened after they transferred.  These conditions are filched from them now, merely on a hypothetical ground put forward by the Minister.  I ask the House to resist this invasion of the rights of a small body of responsible citizens.  They are not in any sense irresponsible.  Most of these officers are men of culture, men of great intellect, with long experience in public administration. We are not dealing with a body of criminals.  We are dealing with a responsible body of men who have given great national service.  I appeal to the House to support me in resisting this further encroachment on their rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This case has been put to the Minister in a very reasonable way.  As Deputy Coogan has said, it is not a political line-up.  It is merely a desire on the part of members of various Parties in the House to try to ensure that nothing unreasonable or reactionary is done so far as officers who were protected by the provisions of the 1930 Act are concerned.  I do not know how many persons are affected, in 1946, by the provisions of the 1930 Act.  It seems to me there cannot be a very considerable number. Having regard to the fact that the 1930 Act was intended to give them certain rights, which have up to the present been recognised, and that the persons concerned are a rapidly dwindling class, which will ultimately disappear, thereby enabling the Minister to exercise his normal powers under the <Col N="996" /> 1944 Act, I would suggest that the Minister might very well leave well enough alone.  This problem will disappear in the course of a relatively brief space of time and then the Minister will be dealing with the normal situation.  I doubt if it is wise for the Minister, at this stage, to seek to tidy up the provisions of the 1930 Act or the 1944 Act to such an extent as, unconsciously perhaps, to do injustice to people who felt that they had certain statutory guarantees, which may be abrogated by the power which the Minister is taking in Section 5.  The problem cannot be serious from the standpoint of the Department or one causing administrative difficulty. By passing Section 5 we may unconsciously do very considerable injustice to many old servants of vocational education authorities.  I appeal to the Minister to leave the position as it is. Whatever difficulties may exist will disappear in a short space of time.  I think the Minister is unconsciously acting unfairly in the matter by trying to tidy up the provision of vocational education legislation by Section 5 as drawn in this Bill.  If the Minister is not prepared to say off-hand at this stage that he will recognise the statutory rights which those people have had up to the present, perhaps he would reconsider the matter between now and the next stage so as to give an assurance to those servants concerned that it is not intended by the Legislature to interfere in any way with the rights which they believe they have at present.  If the Minister can see his way to do that, I feel sure that he will help to reinforce in the minds of the employees of vocational education committees the feeling that, so far as the Legislature is concerned, it appreciates the services which they have rendered in pioneering vocational education in this country, and at the same time make clear to all concerned that, when the State gives a guarantee in respect of tenure and conditions of service, it is not prepared lightly to break the guarantee which it thus gives to those who serve it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand Section 6 correctly, it is intended, under sub-section (4), to provide a subsistence allowance for the members of vocational education committees.  If that is so, I do not see why there should be any discriminations.  From my reading of the section there is an discrimination as regards certain members of committees who attend meetings.  If it is intended under the section to give a subsistence allowance to members who come a distance of over three or five miles, I think the mileage limit should be excluded.  If it is intended to provide a subsistence allowance for members who are engaged for three hours at a meeting of a committee or a sub-committee, the mileage limit should be cut out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why a member of a vocational committee attending a meeting of that committee or of a sub-committee of that body, if he happens to come within a mile or two of the place of meeting, should be deprived of the subsistence allowance, if there is one made available for his colleagues <Col N="999" /> who happen to come a distance of over three miles from the meeting place. Possibly this is something that did not occur to the Minister or the draftsman. There is no good reason why there should be such a discrimination.  On some of these committees there are members who happen to reside one, two or three miles from the town where the meeting is held and I do not think they should be discriminated against if you are providing a subsistence allowance for other members who come a longer distance to the meeting.  I would like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that if the member of the committee is living in the town where the meeting is held, it could scarcely be claimed that he should receive a subsistence allowance. This is a matter in which, unless there are very good reasons to the contrary, we ought to have the same regulations as govern the members of all local authorities.  The regulations have to be made still but unless there are some reasons for a change that I cannot see, I think the arrangement is fair enough. A person resident at a place not less than three miles by any route from his residence and obliged to remain away from his home for a continuous period of not less than three hours is indicated in the section and we must have in mind those definitely out of pocket or who have to provide themselves with subsistence in order to enable them to attend the meeting and transact the business.  I think those who are actually resident at the place of meeting would scarcely be deserving of the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that on one committee, at all events, at least two members would be under the three-mile limit.  Most of the men who attend these committee meetings are also engaged on other committees; they attend sittings of other local bodies and they try to fit in their time at each meeting.  The greatest adjournment you will have at one of these meetings is possibly for an hour; in many cases the adjournment is for half an-hour.  Are these men, simply because they do not happen to live over three miles away, to be obliged to hire a car to take them out one or one-and-a-half <Col N="1000" /> miles to their homes where they will have to rush a meal in order to get back to the deliberations of the committee?  I do not think that is fair or feasible.  If the Minister makes a subsistence allowance available at all, he should make it available all round.</P>
      <P>If these men are to be engaged for more than three hours at a meeting, or are on a sub-committee, in some other town, possibly my point might not arise, but in their local town, if they are engaged for over three hours, they may have to attend other bodies and they will have to have some lunch in a limited period of time.  I do not think it is fair to exclude them from the subsistence allowance.  I believe they would not have time to leave the town and they would have to try to get lunch in a hotel or restaurant. Usually when committee meetings are held, meetings of other bodies take place on the same day so as to facilitate the members who attend.  I think the Minister should make the subsistence allowance available to all the members.  I hope he will consider the matter sympathetically.</P>

      <P>Three miles is the rule. You must have some rule, whether it is two, three or four miles, and one can always make the case that someone is excluded.  A case could also be made that the expenses are not so sufficient, but we are providing on the basis of persons giving voluntary service. We have not agreed to the principle that there should be compensation, as might very well be demanded, for loss of remuneration or loss in some other way, which persons giving service on local authorities very often have to suffer.  I will consult the Minister for Local Government regarding the particular point Deputy Moran has mentioned, but I am sure that, no matter what regulations we frame, we will have these border-line cases.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>As will be seen from its Long Title, this measure proposes to establish two new Department of State, one to deal with Health Services and the other with the services which provide in various ways for the maintenance in varying degrees of family or individual income.  The Departments will be placed in charge of a Minister for Health and a Minister for Social Welfare respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided that the Bill when it becomes law is to be construed as one with the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, 1924 to 1939.  In this connection, Section 6 of the Act of 1939 is of particular importance.  Section 6 of that Act gives the requisite powers of adaptation and adjustment which will be required in consequence of the establishment of the new Departments.  Among other things, it enables the Government <Col N="1002" /> by Order to give a name to the present Department of Local Government and Public Health which will be more appropriate to its functions as these will be after the detachment of the Department of Health.  It may be anticipated that this name will be Department of Local Government and that the title of the Minister responsible for the Department under that name will be Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait and see.  The section I have mentioned furthermore authorises the transfer by Government Order of the administration of any service from one Department to another, thus enabling the appropriate transfers of functions to be made from the existing Departments concerned to the new Departments.  It provides similar powers in regard to the transfer of statutory powers from one Minister to another, and it also confers power to adapt enactments consequential on such changes or transfers as I have indicated.</P>
      <P>This Bill, therefore, in conjunction with the previous Acts and in particular with the Act of 1939, will provide the full machinery for the establishment of the two new Departments and for the transfer of the appropriate functions to them and for the several matters incidental to or consequential on these changes.</P>
      <P>The policy embodied in the proposals to establish a separate Ministry of Health and a Ministry of Social Welfare has been determined only after a close examination of the whole matter in all the Departments concerned, and after much deliberation and full and mature consideration by the Government.  In coming to its decisions, the Government has been fortified by the knowledge that it has public opinion behind it in initiating these progressive and far-reaching developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may now disclose, I think, that the examination of the problems involved in the changes began over three years ago.  At this point, it may not be out of place to recall that so far back as February, 1944, I made a public statement, <Col N="1003" /> foreshadowing the developments which are now taking place, and outlining some of the complexities which would have to be unravelled, before a separate Department of Health could be constituted.  I propose to repeat what I said then:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But one thing I do believe is that &lsquo;if our present health services are to be improved and developed&rsquo; upon the scale that modern progress and modern conditions demand, &lsquo;the setting up of a Ministry of Health will be necessary&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>An extract from a speech which I made to the University Medical Society, University College, Dublin, on the 21st February, 1944.  I continue the quotation:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The field of preventive and social medicine has become so vast, and the problems which modern conditions and standards of living are creating have become so complex, that they demanded the undivided attention of a mind continuously attuned to deal with them.  The setting up of such a Ministry, however, will require a great deal of careful thought, a great deal of preparatory work, and, therefore, quite a significant time before it can be undertaken.  For we have so entangled our public health services with our general civic administration that it is going to be a difficult task to disentangle them and to provide for our public health services an administrative system which will give us effective service and yet conform to sound principles of financial and democratic control.  For public health services cost money, and a great deal of money.  A large part of their cost is borne by the State; the balance, with the exception of capital expenditure defrayed out of sweepstake funds, is provided by local authorities.  We have amalgamated those authorities and consolidated their rate-raising powers, and, undoubtedly, this has resulted in greater economy and efficiency in the local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In doing this, however, we have been greatly facilitated by the fact <Col N="1004" /> that, not only have such authorities been responsible, directly or indirectly, for the local public health services, but they have been subject to the supervision of a common Ministry for Local Government and Public Health.  To separate the rate-raising and other functions of the local authorities from their public health functions, and to place them under the control of separate Departments of State, is going to be a delicate and difficult business, for we have to keep the machine going, and our approach to the task must be highly empirical.  But progress in that direction is, in my view, inevitable, and will have to be made sooner or later.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the following month, on the 31st March, 1944, the Government made an Order, delegating to the senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, certain of the statutory functions of that Minister.  This was a temporary measure designed to facilitate the establishment of the new Ministry of Health.  As was made clear by the Taoiseach in his statement in the House, and subsequently in the Seanad, this was, as I have said, a temporary measure.  On the 30th January last, the developments thus foreshadowed had reached the stage that the Taoiseach was in a position to announce that it had been tentatively decided that a new Department of Health would be established.</P>

      <P>On the 30th January of this year in a debate on Private Deputies' Business about which the Leader of the Opposition professes to be so much concerned on occasions.  It is very gratifying to note that, apparently the only point of difference between the Taoiseach and the other members of the House on that occasion lay in the fact that he was unable to give an undertaking that the new Department would be set up immediately. So anxious were other Parties in the House that this should be done that the Taoiseach's undertaking to set up such a Department in due course was regarded as unsatisfactory.  Notwithstanding <Col N="1005" /> his undertaking that not only a new Department of Health but also a new Department of Social Welfare would be instituted, the House divided&mdash;and divided entirely on the question of the urgency with which those Departments should be established.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is reported as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to this particular question of the formation of two new Ministries, in the Dáil on at least two occasions I indicated what the position was in this respect.  There has been, as you know, a very strong <Col N="1006" /> public demand, and, I think you will admit, a very widespread demand, that there should be a Minister for Public Health.  I do not know whether Senators are in favour of this being done or not, but there has been a strong demand and the Government has considered it.  The view taken by the Government is that the situation at the present time makes it desirable that we should have this Ministry.  There is contemplated a certain reorganisation, a certain extension of the public health services and to supervise this reorganisation and extension and also to administer the services when they have been reorganised, we think a Minister is necessary.  I think it is right that I should point out what perhaps some may not realise, that there is a considerable difference between a Parliamentary Secretary and a Minister in matters of this kind.  My opinion is that generally it is not a good practice to delegate, as we have done in the matter of public health, to a Parliamentary Secretary powers which almost take him outside the supervision of the Minister.  When you do this, the Government as a whole, which has collective responsibility, has no way immediately of dealing with the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary is outside; he has in a sense a greater amount of liberty in a situation like that than the Minister.  The Minister has to share the collective responsibility and is immediately responsible to the Government.  He has to meet direct criticism which he would not probably hear if he were not coming to the Government meetings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have rather exceeded the limits which I had anticipated I should put on myself when I proposed to quote from what the Taoiseach said, but I quote the argument to indicate why important functions, such as would attach to a Minister of Health, cannot properly be delegated or handed over to a person who does not share in the collective responsibility that is borne and accepted by all members of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government, as I <Col N="1007" /> have indicated, has been taken after full and mature consideration.  I think the extracts from speeches, some made so far back as almost three years ago, indicate that a great deal of attention and very careful examination was given to this matter.  If matters had proceeded as then planned, the publication of the White Paper would have preceded the establishment of the Department of Health.  Deputies would then have had before them in advance a statement of the need for the new Ministry as well as an outline of the reforms which are proposed in the public health services.  While it would not be possible for me, without encroaching very greatly on the time and consideration of the House, to go into the question as fully as the White Paper would have done, I propose at this stage to give a general outline of the circumstances in which reform of the public health service must be undertaken.  This review, I trust, will also make it clear that the reform cannot be carried out satisfactorily except under the direction and inspiration of a new Minister, a Minister who will be concerned solely with all matters that directly and immediately affect the health of the individual and the community.</P>
    <P>In treating of these matters, however, I should like to emphasise that I shall not attempt to set out in detail the precise proposals by which the reforms are to be effected, for, in regard to those, the new Minister for Health must have the last word with the Government and the first word with the House.  I may say, however, that the measures themselves have been the subject of close consideration by the Government, so that very little time will be required by the Minister for Health and his advisers, to review the progress that has already been made and to submit definitive proposals to the Government for acceptance, preparatory to the publication of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Now as to the necessity for the new Department of Public Health.  The Local Government Act, 1925, defined the duties of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in relation to public health.  According to <Col N="1008" /> that enactment, he was to secure the preparation, effective carrying out and co-ordination of measures conducive to the health of the people, including the prevention and cure of diseases, the treatment of physical and mental defects, the initiation and direction of research and the training of persons for health services.  A similar but somewhat wider definition of Ministerial functions in relation to health is included in the Public Health Bill of 1945.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The duties thus imposed upon the Minister for Local Government and Public Health relating to health matters involve Ministerial initiative and supervision in the various fields of activity affecting the health of the community, including the preservation of close contact with the work of county and city medical officers of health, and the direction of the day-to-day administration of the numerous services which deal with special aspects of public health.  The detailed public health work which has been supervised heretofore by the existing Department includes the conduct and development of local maternity and child welfare schemes, and the schemes for the medical inspection and treatment of children attending elementary schools. The scope of these schemes will become much wider under that part of the Public Health Bill which proposes to provide comprehensive mother and child health service.  The Minister for the existing Department also supervises the provision of free milk and school meals, arrangements for the welfare of blind persons and schemes for the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases.  His functions in regard to the tuberculosis service have been greatly extended by recent legislation, while difficult problems relating to medical education and post-graduate training and research, standardisation of foods, control of proprietary remedies, bacteriology and serology are pressing insistently for attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again under the Public Hospitals Act, 1933, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is charged with responsibility for the allocation of the Hospitals Trust Fund as between <Col N="1009" /> local authority institutions, voluntary hospitals and other agencies.  He thus finds himself involved in the detailed supervision of the financing of the voluntary hospitals, as well as of the design and erection of new institutions of all types, or of additions to existing structures, in accordance with a planned scheme of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The Public Assistance Act of 1939 makes the same Minister responsible for the general direction and control of the administration of public assistance in its various forms, namely, home assistance, whether in cash or by way of special allowances in kind; maintenance of aged and chronic infirm persons and other classes in county homes and suchlike institutions and the boarding out of children.  Then the same Act also imposes on him most important functions in relation to the medical facilities provided up to the present by way of medical assistance in patients' homes, in dispensaries, in local authority hospitals or in other hospitals approved by him.  He must, therefore, closely supervise the work of public assistance authorities and their officers.  He has, in this connection, to determine the numbers and types of district institutions to be provided and maintained by local authorities, to decide the continuance or discontinuance of particular institutions and to regulate the classes of patients or inmates to be maintained in each of them.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>In reply to four Parliamentary Questions yesterday, with reference to a change in the price of Irish turkeys in Britain, the Minister for Agriculture stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In an Order made by the British Minister of Food increased prices were prescribed for turkeys as from 1st September, 1946.  There was no differentiation in the Order between home-produced and imported birds and consequently the increased prices applied to imports from this country. In a letter dated 23rd October, <Col N="1010" /> addressed to the High Commissioner, London, the Ministry of Food stated that it was decided to have a differential price between home-produced and imported birds; that this was to be effected by reducing the price for imported birds and that the imported price was to apply to our turkeys. This was the first official intimation received of the proposed reduction in our price.  Appropriate representations have been made to the Minister of Food on various grounds including the superior quality of our turkeys but, so far, these representations have not proved effective.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Because of the seriousness of the cut in price to many housewives, we were forced to put down these questions, with a view to eliciting information on the matter from the Minister, but the information we got in the reply was not very helpful.  We all appreciate the care and personal attention given by many housewives to the rearing of turkeys and to bringing them to a point at which they have earned a name second to none in the British market.  As a matter of fact, Irish turkeys to-day are the finest birds and are superior to the best Norfolk.  The report in last week's daily Press came as a bombshell to these people who looked forward to a decent price around Christmas.  The report emanated from the other side and our Department was completely silent on the matter.</P>
    <P>The problem affects an export quantity of goods valued at approximately £1,000,000.  I think we export in the neighbourhood of 70,000 cwts. and the loss, if it is to be a loss, of 9d. in the lb. means a substantial sum of approximately a quarter of a million. The Minister got notice, he informs us in his reply, of this action on the part of the British Minister of Food on 23rd October.  In his reply, he I presume, inadvertently omitted to reply to that part of my question in which I asked whether the price for the coming season was discussed by him or by officers of his Department during their recent food talks in London.  In reply to a supplementary question of mine, he informed the House that this question was discussed, and, having <Col N="1011" /> examined the whole problem, I am forced to conclude that the Minister must have fumbled and completely mishandled the negotiations in London in recent weeks, because if the price of turkeys was discussed in London, agreed to by both parties and copper-fastened there by the Minister, it is inconceivable that there should be unilateral action of this sort by the British Minister.  If it is unilateral action in face of a definite agreement made a few weeks ago, surely the Minister has a case which could be and ought to be straightened out in a very short time.</P>
    <P>It seems an extraordinary situation that our birds should be put into the category of foreign birds.  They are put into the worst class, on the same basis as birds from the Argentine and Hungary, when, on merit alone, they are far superior to that class of poultry.  One is entitled to ask what has become of Imperial preference and what has become of our rights.  If we are entitled to all the advantages to which the Taoiseach claims we are entitled because of the peculiar association he has in his mind with the Commonwealth, are they to be ignored by the British Government and the British Minister of Food and are these products of ours to be put into the foreign grade?</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary, in view of the fact that a special invitation was sent by the British Minister to come over to London a few weeks ago to see what could be done in the way of increased imports of food from this country into Great Britain, in view of the seriousness of the food situation there, and, I take it, to see what could be done to stimulate and expand production here with a view to increasing exports, we get, as a result of the visit of that special mission and all the expenses incurred by our delegation, an increase of 1d. per 1b. on a mere handful of beef animals&mdash;about 20,000 animals, animals which are misfits and which do not fall into the category of forward stores.  We get a mere 1d. per lb. on that small number of animals.  The Minister told us yesterday that, as a result of the negotiations, we are not to get a better price for our eggs, that we are to get <Col N="1012" /> only the same price as we were entitled to get under the 1943 and 1945 agreements and are to be fined 9d. per lb. on turkeys, if the decision of the British Minister is to be implemented.</P>
    <P>I do not think the House can commend or congratulate the Minister on his work and the work of his delegation. The result is certainly very poor and very disappointing.  It has often been said here that we do not want to go hat in hand, and we do not suggest that we should go hat in hand, but we certainly feel that when a responsible Minister goes across to London to meet the responsible Minister on the other side, whatever negotiations take place, clear decisions ought to be taken and a definite understanding arrived at, so far as the various categories of food discussed are concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have some satisfactory answer for the House on this matter.  We are at least entitled to a full and frank statement as to the position.  The country is entitled to know what has taken place and why it is that, a few short weeks after the Minister's discussion in London, action of this sort is taken by the responsible Minister on the other side.  I hope that the Minister is in a position to inform the House that everything is being done by himself and by his Department to readjust that figure.  I am anxious to give the Minister all the time he may require because I understand that he is to make a full statement on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes has asked me to make a full and frank statement on the position with regard to any negotiations which might have taken place on the price of turkeys and I shall be very glad to do that.  It will be remembered that a conference concerning, <i>inter alia</i>, a long-term contract for the supply of eggs to the Ministry of Food took place last September between Mr. Strachey and myself at which the High Commissioner and officials of the Ministry of Food and my Department were present.  Conferences were also held between British and Irish officials and trade representatives in regard to poultry prices and their relation to the proposed eggs contract.  It was never suggested at any of these meetings that <Col N="1013" /> there would be an early change in the prices prescribed for turkeys from 1st September, 1946, and it was understood that these prices would be continued to the end of the season at least.  As the negotiations were conducted on that basis it must be assumed that the British representatives also held that view.</P>
      <P>My Department learned, however, towards the end of last month that it was being rumoured amongst poultry dealers in London that the Minister of Food was about to amend the Order made by him on 30th August in regard to turkey prices and that the amendment was likely to be detrimental to the interests of our poultry producers. This was the first intimation the Department received of any impending change in the price of turkeys.  The matter was immediately referred to the High Commissioner in London to ascertain whether there was any foundation for the rumour.</P>
      <P>It was only after the High Commissioner had made inquiries in the matter that the Ministry of Food informed him of the proposal to reduce the price of Irish turkeys while maintaining the price promised to British and Northern Ireland producers.  This was to be effected by fixing different prices for home-produced birds and imported birds and putting all imported turkeys, good, bad and indifferent, in the same category as regards price. The maximum retail prices announced for imported turkeys were less than those for home-produced by 7d. per lb. for plucked, undrawn birds and 9d. per lb. for drawn and trussed birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the war years the condition, quality, preparation and packing of our turkeys were kept up to a very high standard by constant supervision even though there was then no competition from other imported birds.  Furthermore, when supplies from other outside sources were not available in Great Britain and home supplies were being sold to distributors without much regard to the matter of equitable distribution we, in order to co-operate to the fullest possible extent with the declared policy of the Ministry of Food, prohibited export except to the Association <Col N="1014" /> of Distributors operating under the Ministry, and the whole of our exportable surplus was sent to centres designated by that Association.  Our turkeys this year will, as in previous years, be amongst the very best on the British market and it would be unjust if, notwithstanding their excellent quality, they were now to be arbitrarily classified as amongst the worst for price purposes.  This action would without any doubt prove a serious discouragement to producers and shippers.</P>
    <P>The proposal in regard to our turkey prices appears particularly unfortunate when it is remembered that, no matter what arrangements the Ministry of Food may make, it will not be possible to distinguish between good English and good Irish turkeys when they are on sale in the shops.  What would most likely happen in fact is that Irish turkeys would be retailed as home-produced and no benefit would accrue to British producers or consumers.  The only beneficiaries would be the distributors who might get, over and above their fair trade margin, a further profit of 7/- to 16/- per bird according to size.  In these circumstances I contend that our turkeys should be sold on the open market for what they will fetch, subject of course to the overriding maximum fixed for home-produced turkeys.  I do not ask for a guaranteed price but I think it unfair that the Minister of Food should intervene to deprive us of true market value.</P>
    <P>In the course of negotiations the British Ministry were informed that most of the enhanced poultry price was to be used to improve our egg prices with the object of maintaining or increasing supplies of eggs for export. They encouraged this interchange of funds and we had reason to assume that there would be a substantial fund for egg production from the increase in the turkey price.  That may now have to be abandoned and, although our costs of production and feeding difficulties are not less than in Great Britain, the prices allowed by the Ministry for our poultry as well as our eggs may be considerably less than those allowed for home-produced.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of September, after the increased prices had been <Col N="1015" /> announced by the Ministry, a Press notice was issued intimating to our producers that 3d. per lb. over the previous prices would be paid on all exports of dead birds and the balance of the increase in the Ministry of Food's prices would be utilised for the improvement and development of our poultry and egg industry as a whole. Having made that promise we feel bound by it.  We cannot now go back on it for the remainder of this season, and if the existing turkey price is reduced the result will be that, instead of having a bigger fund from the turkey money to be used for the purpose of increasing egg exports next year, we shall have no fund from that source.</P>
    <P>It may not be realised by the man in the street, although it must be well known to the Ministry of Food, that the number of turkeys sent from this country to Great Britain in 1940 and 1941 was over 500,000 each year; in 1942 and 1943 the average was 700,000 a year, and in 1944 and 1945 the average was over 800,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is practically all Christmas trade.  A certain number of turkeys go on the market previous to Christmas but it is all regarded as Christmas trade.  One of the reasons advanced for the proposal to differentiate between the prices of home-produced and Irish turkeys is that before the war home-produced turkeys always commanded on their merits a higher price than imported birds and, therefore, it is not unreasonable that they should do so now.  In considering this argument it must be remembered that all turkeys imported into Great Britain before the war had to be marked so as to indicate the country of origin.  The object of this regulation obviously was to warn purchasers that the imported birds were inferior and should not command as high a price as unmarked, that is, home-produced birds.  Notwithstanding this great disadvantage, I find that during the months of November and December, 1938, the wholesaler to retailer prices of our turkeys at various markets in <Col N="1016" /> Great Britain were the same as those for Northern Ireland birds.  I am informed that, except for specially bred and fed Norfolk birds, Irish birds obtained during these months the same prices as were paid for home-produced. Comparing our prices with those of birds from Central Europe, from which a large part of imported turkeys was supplied, the figures available show that ours were consistently the higher, the difference in our favour ranging from 2½d. to 5d. per lb.  In these circumstances there is an unanswerable case for classifying our turkeys on their merits amongst home-produced for price purposes.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Minister of Food has announced maximum prices for turkeys in two classes, home-produced and imported and, further, that he has informed our High Commissioner in London that our turkeys will be put into the imported class and will therefore rank for the lower price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the attitude of the British Government in this matter and their obvious intention to get our turkeys at the lowest possible price, the price paid for inferior Central European turkeys, would the Minister ask the Government to consider the question of setting up an organisation to buy Irish turkeys in the month of December for the purpose of distributing them at a reduced price, subsidised by the Exchequer, to tens of thousands of people in this country who are unable to get turkeys? In that way we could use our own good turkeys for the benefit of the people who produce them and thus get over the difficulties which have arisen because of the British Government's attitude.  We have £100,000,000 sterling in the Bank of England and surely our assets in that respect can be utilised to finance turkey production in this country for the benefit of our own people instead of the benefit of others.</P>

      <P>No.  That is the difficulty. In all these negotiations it was, of course, across a table what the prices were to be, and so on, and when that <Col N="1018" /> was all over the Minister made his Order announcing what the prices were to be.  Of course, we must admit that he did not say that he was not going to change them again in the middle of November but during all the negotiations there was never any suggestion that there would be a change in the price of turkeys before the end of this season.</P>
