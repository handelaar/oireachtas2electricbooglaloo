    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the high price of clothing and footwear is an important contributory factor to the present high cost of living; if he will take steps to ensure that the price of these articles is reduced as soon as possible; and if he can give any indication of when the quality of these commodities will be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The wholesale and retail prices of cloth and clothing are controlled under the provisions of the Emergency Powers (Cloth and Clothing) (Maximum Prices) Order, 1945. This Order fixes maximum wholesale and retail margins which may be taken on such articles sold by a manufacturer or imported.  These margins have been progressively reduced since the first Order controlling cloth and clothing prices was made in 1943, and the practicability of further reduction is under continuous examination.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers' prices of these goods are also regulated, and during the past six months reductions have been made in such prices which had the effect of reducing retail prices by from 8 per cent. to 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The wholesale and retail margins on footwear are similarly controlled, and recent reductions in manufacturers' prices have had the effect of reducing retail prices by from 3 per cent. to 8 per cent. for various classes of footwear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> I do not agree that the quality of clothing and footwear is inferior, having regard to the nature of the raw materials available.</P>
    <P>It should be understood that the present high prices for articles of clothing are due to the high cost of imported materials.  Lower prices would be practicable for some classes of clothing if certain imports were not facilitated, particularly the importation of materials from South America, but in such event, the total supply would be substantially less and employment in clothing industries would be greatly curtailed.  There were increased imports of linen, cotton, woollen and worsted piece goods during 1945, but the cost of such imported goods also rose during that period.  As increased supplies of materials become available it is to be assumed that the over-head costs of manufacture of clothing will be reduced, but there can be no substantial change in clothing prices unless and until the cost of imported materials falls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Irish wool may in the future be sold at reduced prices, will the Minister see that the cost of manufactured articles will be brought down at a corresponding rate to what the price of wool will be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that the quality of cloth is as good as it was some years ago.  I think the ordinary poor person who has to pay such a big price for cloth is not of that opinion.  The quality is not as good.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the serious hardships imposed on people engaged in manual labour, and the poorer classes in towns and cities, as a result of the present limited butter ration, particularly in view of the fact that substitutes are difficult and expensive to obtain; and if he will state if the position is sufficiently improved to permit of a substantial increase in the weekly ration of butter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is now in a position to state whether the Killarney Urban District Council has yet furnished the report, requested by his Department in March, 1942, on a proposed water supply for Killarney; and, if so, if he will state when the report was furnished, and if it is his intention to insist on having a 24-hour water supply available in Killarney.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for providing an adequate water supply in any area rests on the local sanitary authority, not on my Department.  I am, however, fully aware of the importance of improving the Killarney supply and on a number of occasions during recent years the matter has been brought to the notice of the urban district council. As already explained to the Deputy in reply to his previous question, the submission of detailed estimates for the alternative schemes under consideration, which was requested on the 19th March, 1942, is awaited.  In reply to an inquiry from the Department last September, the urban council stated that nothing was done during the war years owing to the absence of the consulting engineer and to the fact that cast iron pipes could not be procured.  They have since appointed another consultant whose proposals are now awaited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will make inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the certification of the death and the cause of death in the case of the infant, Francis O'Brien, who died on 17th September, 1945; and whether the procedure adopted in this case is approved by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from inquiries which have been made in this case that a certificate of the cause of death could not be issued for the reason that a registered medical practitioner was not called in to attend the child during its illness.  On receipt of the coroner's certificate that an inquest was unnecessary, the registrar was under a statutory obligation to proceed to register the death.  In the column headed &ldquo;certified cause of death and duration of illness&rdquo; the registrar recorded that there was no medical attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied, where information is brought to the office of his social service organisation that a child has been found dead in its pram in a condition of advanced emaciation and its body covered with sores, that that child should be hurried into its grave without any attempt being made by the social service to come to the assistance of the family where that child has died, although it is known to them that there are four other children, one of whom is half-dead with rickets at the time?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary not think that, in those circumstances, there should be some officer of the child welfare scheme or of some branch of the social service who would go to that house, ascertain what the needs of that family were, and take steps to ensure that no other of the four children would suffer the lamentable fate of the infant that died in the circumstances I have described?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that a reliable person saw the body of the child and described it as emaciated to the point that it consisted of skin and bone; that a reliable witness described the condition of deplorable poverty that obtained in the room where the child died and that another witness alleged that the body of the child was covered <Col N="2171" /> with sores and that it had been a healthy child in the past?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary not further aware that, to assume that a child of that kind, who showed signs of diarrhoea before its death and died from gastro-enteritis, is a wholly unjustifiable assumption, inasmuch as infant diarrhoea may be a symptom of a wide variety of infant diseases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I have is that a reliable witness saw the infant's body emaciated to the point of skin and bone.  It was lying in its perambulator, dead.  Is there anybody in this State, with all the money we are spending on social services, whose duty it is to go to that family and, whatever it costs, to provide them with the wherewithal so that no other child will be reduced to skin and bone and will die in its pram?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary how could any doctor certify that the child died from gastro-enteritis if he had never seen the child?  How could he form an opinion if the only symptom was diarrhoea, which is a symptom with almost every child in that condition?  That is what I complain of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been drawn to an advertisement issued by the Dublin Board of Assistance offering appointments to nurses; if he is aware that, in the conditions of service laid down for these appointments, nurses living out are to be paid the sum of 10/- a week as a rent allowance; if he is further aware that this rent allowance is completely inadequate; and if he will direct that the board offer adequate wages and substantially increased rent allowances to these nurses and to others similarly appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy presumably refers to the recent advertisement inviting applications for appointments as temporary nurses at St. Clare's Hospital, Ballymun Road, Glasnevin.  The conditions of appointment require the nurses to reside outside the institution, but an allowance of £25 per annum is granted in lieu of residence.  This emolument is in accordance with the usual allowance granted by the Dublin Board of Assistance in such cases, and in the circumstances, I do not propose to take action as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is not possible to get a room in a tenement house for 10/- a week in Dublin at present?  Will he say where these nurses are to be accommodated for 10/- a week?  I say that it is not possible to get a room for 10/- a week and under these circumstances will he consider increasing the allowance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy, I do not propose to interfere. I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the basic salary of nurses is <Col N="2174" /> £81 per annum, emergency bonus £18 4s. Od., allowance in lieu of residence £25, allowance for uniform £9, value of meals £52, and there is an extra £10 per annum for registered sick children's nurses, making a total of £185 per annum.  I think the salary is not unreasonable.</P>

      <P>In page 6, before Section 10 (5), line 56, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) If at the time when the estimate of expenses of a county council for a local financial year is considered in pursuance of Section 24 of the County Management Act, 1940 (No. 12 of 1940) the area on which a portion of such expenses is properly chargeable cannot yet be determined, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such portion shall be included in such estimate in the prescribed manner as a county-at-large charge and raised accordingly by means of of the county rate for the said year;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  provision shall be made in the <Col N="2180" /> prescribed manner in the accounts of the council for determining how much (if any) of such portion should have been charged on any area other than the whole of the county;</P>
    <P>(c) if, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this sub-section, it is determined that any amount should have been charged on an area other than the whole of the county an appropriate adjustment shall be made in the prescribed manner in the county rate for a subsequent year by means of an increase in the sum charged on such area and a reduction in the county-at-large charges.</P>
    <P>Under the Public Bodies Order, a method has been in force for allocating provisionally the areas to be charged with certain expenses, where the expenses themselves or the areas have not yet been definitely determined. The validity of this provision has not been challenged, and I am advised that there is no doubt with regard to it, but the amendment, in fact, gives statutory authority to a particular provision in the Public Bodies Order of the year 1925.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, before Section 14, line 26, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>14.&mdash;(1)  Where a hereditament which is situated in a county but not in an urban area and which is not a small dwelling within the meaning of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928 (No. 4 of 1928), is unoccupied at the making of the county rate, such rate shall be made upon the person (in this section referred to as the owner) who is for the time being entitled to occupy the hereditament and, upon such rate being paid by the owner, he shall be entitled to claim and receive from the council of the county a refund of one-twelfth of such rate in respect of every completed month (reckoned from any day of one month to the corresponding <Col N="2181" /> day of the next month) during which the hereditament is unoccupied either for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs thereto or because the owner is <i>bona fide</i> unable to obtain a suitable tenant therefor, in the case of a hereditament to which the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946 (No. 4 of 1946), for the time being applies, at the maximum rent for the time being permitted under that Act or, in the case of any other hereditament, at a reasonable rent.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a rate is made by virtue of this section on the owner of an unoccupied hereditament, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the hereditament is subsesequently let by or on behalf of the owner, and</P>
    <P>(c) the rate or any part thereof is in arrear and unpaid,</P>
    <P>the rate collector by whom the rate is collectible may, in addition to and without prejudice to any other remedy for the recovery of the amount of the rate so in arrear and unpaid, serve either personally or by post on the occupier of the hereditament a notice stating the said amount so in arrear and unpaid and requiring the occupier to pay to the rate collector or his successor in office all rent then due or thereafter to become due by him in respect of the hereditament until the said amount is by such payment or otherwise discharged, and thereupon the rate collector or his successor in office shall have the exclusive right to recover, receive and give a good discharge for all rent required by the notice to be paid to him.</P>
    <P>(3)  A rate made by virtue of this section on the owner of an unoccupied hereditament shall not be invalidated by any error or defect in the statement of the name of the owner or by the use of the description &ldquo;the owner&rdquo; without any name or addition, and the rate shall be recoverable from the owner notwithstanding any such error or defect or the use of any such description. <Col N="2182" /> The House will perhaps remember that, when the Bill was in Committee Stage, I refrained from moving what was originally Section 22, on the ground that, in the Rent Restrictions Bill, there was a provision relating to rates on unoccupied controlled premises, and it was proposed to take the opportunity, during the later progress of that Bill, to delete that provision, and, when that was done, to move on Report to reinsert the original section as it appeared in the Local Government Bill, as originally circulated. Accordingly, this amendment appears with amendment No. 6 on the paper, but we have decided to extend perhaps the provisions a little and to have a separate section dealing with rates on vacant premises in county areas as well as with rates on vacant premises in urban areas.</P>
    <P>This amendment, which I suggest should be taken with amendment No. 6, deals with the rates on vacant premises in the county, and, as will be seen, the rates, where premises are unoccupied, will be charged on the owner, but the owner will be entitled to be recouped for the rates in respect of these premises, if he shows that the premises have been unoccupied for repairs, or alterations, or because he cannot get a tenant at the controlled rent, or, if the premises should happen not to be controlled, at a reasonable rent.  The refund will be made to him at the rate of one-twelfth for every month during which the premises were so unoccupied, but I should like to make it quite clear that the onus of showing that the premises are unoccupied by reason of the fact that they are the subject of repairs or alterations, or because the owner cannot get a tenant at the controlled or at a reasonable rent, will rest on the owner of the premises.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the section &mdash;particularly Section 6&mdash;does not limit the amount to a refund of six months' rates as in the case of the Cities of Dublin and Limerick.  The circum stances, I suggest, in the rural areas and smaller towns, are such that a limit to the refunds might occur in some cases where premises could not possibly be let for any purpose.</P>

      <P>This is a most cumbersome and difficult section to understand.  I submit it introduces a completely new principle into the Bill. The Minister goes much further than he even said he would.  There is a proposal here that the rate collector shall recover rates by taking possession of the rent of a house.  I would like to hear the Minister on that aspect.  The Minister talked about allowance being made if a house were unoccupied, provided that the owner established that he was unable to get a tenant at the regulated rent.  That does not appear in the section at all.  What the section says is very wide&mdash;namely, a suitable tenant.  We are all aware as to what house owners nowadays classify as suitable tenants.  Nowadays a man with one or two children is looked upon as a very unsuitable tenant indeed.  I would like to hear the Minister elaborate on that a little more.  This is one of the sections (if I may say so again, with respect), that I am extremely doubtful should be discussed on the Report Stage of the Bill.  It is something which has not been before us in this Bill up to now.  I think the Minister should give the House a fuller explanation (1)  of the necessity for this, and (2)  of the way in which it is expected to work.</P>

      <P>I have explained that in the Bill, as originally approved on Second Reading, there appeared Section 20 dealing with rates on vacant premises in urban areas.  I have said that for convenience it would be quite simple&mdash;and I do not think it would be unprecedented or contrary to rules or order&mdash;if a verbal amendment were made to introduce here after the word &ldquo;urban&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and county&rdquo;.  I do not think an amendment of that sort, if moved, could possibly be objected to because we want to make it quite clear exactly what we propose to do.  In order, if you like, that it will be easier to discuss, we have introduced two separate sections&mdash; one dealing with premises in urban areas and one dealing with premises in county areas.  The section originally in the Bill was Section 20.</P>

It was understood that when the corresponding provisions had been removed from the Rent Restrictions Bill this section would be reintroduced into this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading; but we are now discussing the effect of these proposals and we are discussing it in Committee.  We may welcome, particularly in respect of rural areas, a provision by which premises which are vacant for adequate reasons will not have rates levied upon them.  By that particular kind of <Col N="2185" /> relief we will get rid of this appalling anomaly which was so widespread where houses were reduced to a dilapidated condition by the removal of roofs, or in other ways, in order to escape being classified as habitable houses or houses capable of occupation. But I think there are aspects of the proposal here that require attention.</P>
      <P>The amendments contemplate the possibility of a dispute arising between a local authority and the owner of a premises whereby, in the case of ownership passing from one to another, the local authority will regard the outgoing owner&mdash;if I may so describe him &mdash;as liable for the payment of rates which, in fact, he escaped; that is, the local authority considers the possibility that they will disagree that a house before it was occupied by, say, owner B was not vacant by reason of the fact that there were additions, or alterations, or repairs being made thereto or by reason of the fact that a suitable tenant at a reasonable cost could not be obtained.  The new section, as it stands, means that the local authority will have the power of deciding whether or not a suitable tenant could have been got and that a reasonable rent would have been paid by such suitable tenant.  Coming to that conclusion they can themselves issue an instruction to the rent collector and the rent collector will immediately, by virtue of the terms of this section, take possession of the rent payable by occupier B in respect of a debt that had occurred in the opinion of the local authority before his time. I submit that here you have a question of fact and a question of judgement which should not be left to either the local authority on the one hand, if it is the local authority the Minister has in mind as being the body that should come to the decision, or to the rate collector, if the rate collector is the person who is being given a judicial function in this matter by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that it is utterly unreasonable, if it is not actually unconstitutional, for the Minister to seek by this section to confer a judicial function on a local authority or on a rate collector that would empower them to adjudicate <Col N="2186" /> on the question of whether a particular tenant was a suitable one and one offering a reasonable rent.  That is a matter that should not be left to either the local authority or to the rate collector and at least the District Court should be brought in to decide these matters before it would be possible to consider reasonable that occupier B should be called upon to hand over rent in respect of a debt that was owed to the local authority by a previous person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should you do that in any case?  I take it that the former occupier was liable for the rate.  If he gets away without discharging his liabilities to the local authority and if the local authority are not quick enough to collect the rate that has accrued under the occupancy of the former occupier, why should you turn around then and saddle someone else with the responsibility of paying his debts?</P>

      <P>A great deal of fraud is perpetrated under the existing law and will be under this section.  County councils have come across cases before now, where men would not let premises for any rent, however reasonable. There have been cranks and faddists who would not let their premises under any provision.  Instead of setting out to safeguard persons who have unoccupied premises, the Minister should see that the local authority would be safeguarded to a greater extent and <Col N="2187" /> that all dwellings that are fit for occupation should be rateable.  That is the opinion of local authorities, that all dwellings that are in good order should be rateable and that rates should be collected in respect of them. At the present time and at any time when there is great shortage of dwellinghouses there is no reason why there should be a refund of rates in respect of any house that is unoccupied if the house is occupiable and is in proper sanitary condition.  There is no reason for such a provision and local authorities should be allowed to collect rates on any dwellinghouse that is occupiable.</P>

The Minister has not given us a definition of an unoccupied hereditament.  I would like to have a definition of an unoccupied hereditament in the country because it might serve a man's purpose very well not to have a dwellinghouse occupied but to use the out-offices attached to the dwellinghouse and to use a workman's house in the yard.</P>

It is a well-known fact that, as Deputy Mulcahy himself admitted, in order to evade the payment of rates upon houses or buildings which might have been used at some time or other, the houses are virtually dismantled. I do not know whether or not the Leader of the Opposition thinks that that is a good thing.  I gather that he does not.  I think he welcomed this provision, because at least it would remove that inducement from people wilfully to put their property into a condition in which it could not be occupied or used for any <Col N="2188" /> useful purpose.  That is what we are trying to do here.  At the same time, we do not want to benefit a man who wilfully refuses to allow his premises to be occupied.  The purpose of the section is made quite clear.  First of all, he has to pay the rates.  He is bound to pay the rates.  The rates are levied and charged on him, in the first place, but he is entitled to claim and to receive a refund from the council if he can show that the hereditament is unoccupied either for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs&mdash;I think that no person can regard that as being unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better go and read the common law reports in relation to that matter and he will find that there is a long series of decisions dealing with that.  I could not possibly undertake to give the Deputy the benefit of all the legal learning that has gone to determine that point.  Most county councils would appreciate when a hereditament is unoccupied for the purpose of this section because, remember, they are the people who have to make the refund; they are, as the section goes, the proximate judges as to when a refund should be given.  If the Deputy will permit me, I was saying that the owner of the premises was entitled to a refund and could claim a refund when he could show that these premises were unoccupied either for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs, that is to say, that they were not in his own occupation and that they were not in the occupation of a tenant and that additions, alterations or repairs were being carried out to the premises or because the owner is <i>bona fide</i> unable to obtain a suitable tenant therefor. Deputy Morrissey suggested that the owner might regard a tenant who had children as being an unsuitable tenant. It does not matter what the owner's opinion is.  The opinion that counts in the first instance in the matter is the opinion, I assume, of the county council.</P>

      <P>Of the manager, certainly, the properly constituted authority.  We are not going to have the council meet to determine whether a person with or without children is a suitable tenant for premises which are not occupied.  So that, so far as Deputy Morrissey's suggestion is concerned, that this amendment would in fact be of advantage to the man who would not let premises to a tenant who had children, I think it is clear that there is no substance in it.  We are not going to assume that a county manager would take up that anti-social attitude because, if he did, I think he would be speedily dealt with. Deputy Mulcahy, who has got very fond of litigation and law, suggests that before any claim can be allowed under this section we should initiate court proceedings; that the district justice should be called in to settle what is not a question of law, but a question of fact that could quite easily be settled, to the satisfaction of the rate-making authority, at any rate, by any ordinary person of common sense.  I think it would be a preposterous procedure that a man having premises to which alterations or repairs are being carried out and who is entitled to a refund under this section in regard to rates charged on him in respect of these premises should, before he can get that refund, have to take proceedings in the District Court.  That is what Deputy Mulcahy suggests.</P>

It is a decision and an opinion formed in regard to facts.  The Deputy asked who is to adjudicate in this matter, who is to exercise this judicial function.  He said first that it ought to be a judge.  He then mended his hand a little and said that, instead of a judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court, he would be satisfied with a justice of the District Court.  I <Col N="2190" /> think that would be altogether too cumbersome a method for dealing with an ordinary matter of business and with an issue which could be determined by an ordinary man of common sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we have the next hare started by Deputy Mulcahy again.  The Deputy wants to know what is all this about in sub-section (2) of the section.  The sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where (a) a rate is made by virtue of this section on the owner of an unoccupied hereditament....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He said that these might be rates payable by a previous occupier.  That is where Deputy Hughes got his idea about a previous occupier&mdash;from his Leader, Deputy Mulcahy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What about paragraph (c)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to (c). Where the rate or any part thereof is in arrear and unpaid, the rate collector would be entitled to require the person who subsequently entered into occupation of these premises to pay over to him towards the discharge of the unpaid rates which were due by the owner the rent otherwise payable to the owner.  That has nothing to do with the question of the previous occupier, unless the previous occupier happened to be the owner.  So long as the premises are otherwise unoccupied the rates are chargeable on the owner.  But a case might quite conceivably arise where an owner, knowing very well that he would not be entitled to a refund in respect of unoccupied premises, because he could not show that these premises were unoccupied by reason of the fact that additions, alterations or repairs were being carried out to them, or because he could not find a suitable tenant for them, might not pay any rates at all, even though the rates were charged upon him.  Then, having got tired of keeping the premises unoccupied, he might quite easily let them to a tenant who would pay him the rent which he demanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2191" /> In that event, this is the remedy which the county council has.  The owner has not paid the rates.  The premises become occupied.  The rate collector is entitled to collect the rent towards the discharge of the rates properly payable by the owner of these premises.  He is entitled to do that without prejudice to any other steps he might choose to take for the collection of the rates which are due.  I do not see what all the pother has been about.  There is nothing new in that principle.  Surely, if the rates are due by the owner, then any income arising out of the premises can be quite easily, in accordance with the law, diverted to the discharge of the owner's rightful debts to the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section contemplates two persons.  One is the owner of the unoccupied premises.  The Minister forgot to say that this was an Act of mine.  I knew he forgot something.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, there are two persons contemplated, the person who owns the property, which happens to be an unoccupied house, and the person who enters into occupation of that house.  If the rate collector or the local authority wakes up to the fact that before the second person entered into occupation, the owner owed certain rates, the rate collector can demand from the second person, the occupier, that he should pay to the local authority the rent due to the owner until such time as the debt owed by the owner to the local authority is paid off.  Suppose the occupier says: &ldquo;I will not; I am going to pay the rent to the man who rented me the house.&rdquo;  The position then, before the law as it would stand, would be that the local authority has a case against the owner in the first instance for not having paid the rates and against the occupier in the second instance for not having paid over the rent demanded by the local authority under the Act as it would appear if this section is inserted.  The intention is not to proceed against the owner of the property, who is the real breaker <Col N="2192" /> of the law in the matter, but against the newly-manufactured criminal under this section, the person who becomes the occupier and who will not pay over the rent demanded under this section as a payment in lieu of rates.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister say why, in the name of common sense, the action that would lie at law on the part of the local authority against the person who is withholding the rates should not be taken, and why, in an inequitable way, they have to bring some person in between and say: &ldquo;It will be easier to get it off this poor fellow; the man of property is a fellow who might stand up against us, but the unfortunate person, who is not a man of property, and who has to rent a house from somebody else, will be an easier mark; he will be cowed and overawed&rdquo;?

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like if the Minister would try to make clear the meaning of this rather obscure amendment. He has told us it is not for the purpose of collecting any arrears that may have accrued through the occupancy of a former tenant.  While the house is unoccupied no rates could accrue, so that that house would not be rateable until the new tenant would come into occupation.  So far as I can see, the meaning of the section is that once you assess the owner you assess him for the 12 months and when the new tenant comes in, and the rates are not collected off the owner, then you are given power to collect them off the occupier for the end of that particular year before you assess the occupier for the new year.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has not given us any satisfactory explanation as to the purpose of this amendment.  He has not told us if it is for the purpose of collecting arrears.  How do the arrears accrue?  He said they are not arrears from any old tenant, and he must admit that while the house is unoccupied no arrears could accrue. Where do they come from?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When the rate is made by virtue of this section on the owner of an unoccupied hereditament or tenement and such hereditament or tenement is subsequently let by or on behalf of such owner and such rate or any part thereof is in arrear and unpaid, the rate collector by whom such rate is collectible may, in addition and without prejudice to any other remedy for the recovery of the amount of such rate so in arrear and unpaid, serve either personally or by <Col N="2194" /> post on the occupier of such hereditament or tenement a notice stating the said amount so in arrear and unpaid and requiring such occupier to pay to such rate collector or his successor in office all rent then due or thereafter to become due by him in respect of the said hereditament or tenement until the said amount is by such payment or otherwise discharged, and, upon such notice being so served, such rate collector or his successor in office shall have the exclusive right to recover, receive, and give a good discharge for all rent required by such notice to be paid to him.&rdquo;</P>

I can assure Deputy Mulcahy that we in Drogheda did take powers to go in and collect the rents until the rates which were due were paid off.  It is quite true to say that an unoccupied house can legitimately claim a refund for six months only.  After that it becomes liable for the full rate.  The case I have in mind actually took place during Deputy Mulcahy's term as Minister for Local Government.

He started by suggesting that it was argued here that before the owner of a premises which he considered should be regarded as unoccupied could get relief, or a refund of rates, he should go to the court.  On the contrary, what was suggested here was that the owner of a premises could not be denied the relief that this section proposes to give him, in respect of an unoccupied house, by the local authority, without a reference to the District Court for decision by a body with judicial functions, on the question of any claim so made by the local authority, that a suitable tenant was available for the house and that a reasonable rent was obtainable.</P>

This section is going to complicate the matter.  County council and other bodies are operating the existing law in regard to such property for a considerable time.  I do not see any reference to the existing law or to an amendment of it in this section.  In a large number of cases local authorities come across cases where fraud is attempted. I could point out a half-dozen residences that could be let at substantial rents, but the owners refuse to let them.

      <P>It does not complicate it; it simplifies it, unless a person is going to be so perverse that he is going to close premises or not allow repairs to be made.  If you like take up this attitude that whether a man is to maintain his premises or not or cannot make any use of them, then he must pay rates.  Otherwise what is going to happen to the demands we heard in this House from time to time to induce farmers to improve their premises and to give them concessions in respect of rates on improvements? Is the only person who is to receive no consideration to be the man who, having built houses or business premises, tries to maintain them in a habitable condition and as an economic unit?  The other condition in which a person is entitled to a refund is when he cannot find suitable. premises or premises at a reasonable rent.  Are we to come to this situation that if a man cannot get a suitable tenant he is going to be mulcted in rates?  What inducement will there be to any private person to go ahead with building for the purpose of letting to other individuals if property is to carry these disadvantages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this section is to simplify, from the point of view of the local authority, the position in regard to rates or unoccupied premises.  It makes the rates chargeable, in the first instance, on the owner and the owner is entitled, provided he satisfies certain conditions, to claim and to get a refund, but only for so long as the premises are genuinely unoccupied, <i>bona fide</i> unoccupied in accordance with the provisions of the section. The moment they cease to fulfil these conditions, the rates are properly chargeable upon him and we have sub-section (2) to deal with that situation and with kindred situations.  So far from being too concerned about the rights of property owners, we have in this section done something to ease the position of county councils, to meet equitably the position of owners of property which is unoccupied for <i>bona fide</i> reasons&mdash;not because the owner <Col N="2199" /> happens to be an anti-social person but because he is trying to maintain his property or because he cannot get a suitable tenant for it.  In these circumstances, I think that, instead of being criticised by Deputies who have not read the section, we ought to be congratulated by them when they appreciate what we are trying to do.</P>

      <P>The arrears arise for the purpose of making a refund.  That is what it means.  The Minister is not fair to Deputy Allen and I think there is a good deal to be said for Deputy Allen's point of view.  Let me put this example to the Minister.  Suppose a big farmer, occupying a substantial unit of land, buys a neighbouring farm&mdash;he might buy two or three neighbouring farms, which would not be desirable&mdash;on which there are a good dwellinghouse and out-offices.  He wants to use the land as an out-farm and it is unlikely that he will get what is described as a suitable tenant for the house, because a man does not want to take over such a house without getting the unit of land with it.  The man who has bought the farm, however, wants the land, but does not want the house, so that we are going to turn an entire district into a ranch by encouraging the buying of farms of that sort and preventing other men from occupying them and rearing families on them.  I do not think that sort of thing should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>First, the local authority or the rating authority.  This applies only to hereditaments which are not in urban areas.  Let us take the case of an area where there is no trouble about the situation.  The rating authority has power to make the owner pay for the whole year in one payment and thereafter to refund it to him month by month.</P>

      <P>Yes, certainly; and we have not yet had any explanation as to why an owner should be put into a position where he may <Col N="2204" /> refuse and say: &ldquo;I am not going to pay this debt for which I am not responsible to the local authority.&rdquo; He then becomes a criminal under this Act; but instead of proceeding against the real criminal we here are providing for the local authority to proceed against the lesser criminal&mdash;that is a person who to-day is not a defendant in these matters or even a possible defendant until this Act becomes law. I think the Minister and Deputy Walsh fell too easily into the temptation to accept my invitation to say that this idea was a child of my brain. I do not recognise the child after the recent discussions we have had in this matter, and I want to suggest that if the Minister gets any more ideas like this we will need a kind of cinematograph apparatus here in order to give the House some chance of understanding what is involved in this, because the processes through which the Minister's brain has gone in dealing with this particular matter could only be adequately portrayed by some rather up-to-date type of photographic apparatus.</P>

    <P>(3)  A rate made by virtue of this section on the owner of an unoccupied hereditament shall not be invalidated by any error or defect in the statement of the name of the owner or by the use of the description &ldquo;the owner&rdquo; without any name or addition, and the rate shall be recoverable from the owner notwithstanding any such error or defect or the use of any such discription.</P>

      <P>I suggest that this is treating the House with absolute contempt.  The Minister has succeeded in convincing the Chair that the introduction of a completely new principle <Col N="2213" /> and a new section on Report Stage is in order.  So far for that.  Surely if there is any point in Committee discussion and in discussion on Report Stage in this House it is that the House should understand what it is discussing. Surely, if a Minister brings in a Bill here, a new Bill, and if, on Committee and on Report, he brings in amendments of his own, it is the duty of the Minister to explain to the House why it is necessary that the Bill should be amended in this way.  The Minister referred to amendment No. 3.  Amendment No. 3 was dealing with buildings situate in the county as distinct from the urban area.  We are dealing exclusively, in this amendment, with buildings in an urban or borough area. I submit that if we are to have useful discussion, if we are to know what we are doing in relation to a Bill of this importance, it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister to give as full an explanation as he is capable of giving dealing with an important new principle such as this.  Surely that is the purpose of any discussion in this House on this or any other Bill.  Or, does the Minister want the House to pass a Bill or a new section of a Bill on which he is not prepared to inform? The Minister knows quite well that he has sources of information at his disposal that ordinary members of the House have not got.  The Minister I take it brought in this particular amendment for one reason.  Surely we are entitled to know what that reason is.  That is what we are asking.  We are not asking for anything to which we are not entitled and I suggest that the Minister, in courtesy, apart from any question of duty, should give the House that information.</P>

This is all the more regrettable in view of the fact that the Minister has been allowed to do on this Bill what was never allowed to be done in this House since it was set up, to do something which is not only in flat contradiction of the whole practice and procedure of this House, but in <Col N="2214" /> flat contradiction of the Standing Orders.</P>

The Minister refuses to give the House any explanation of it, except to say that he has explained it previously.  That is not a practice that has been adopted in this House as long as I have been in it, over a period of 20 years.  The Minister, following that practice, might tell us, when we came to the last amendment, if any Deputy asked for an explanation, that he had already given it at some other time.  I suggest the time to give an explanation of this amendment is when the Minister is moving it.</P>

Previously, as I <Col N="2215" /> understand the position, the test was that the premises were empty and untenanted.  Now we are introducing four new conditions: that the premises are unoccupied by reason of the fact that they are vacant for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs, or that the owner has been unable to make a <i>bona fide</i> letting of the premises.  We are introducing four entirely new conditions as a test of non-occupation.  On this side of the House at least we should like to hear from the Minister what are the reasons for this new departure, and I submit that we are entitled to that information. Furthermore, as has already been indicated, these amendments introduce on the Report Stage an entirely new principle into this Bill which, in the opinion of this side of the House, is entirely out of order.</P>

      <P>The old test is further complicated by reason of the fact that the owner has to show that he is <i>bona fide</i> unable to let the premises to a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent.

He has a perfect right to object to X, Y, or Z as tenants, either on the ground of their credibility or on the ground of social objection or any other reasonable ground.  If, in these circumstances, he objects to taking X, Y, or Z are we to reach the position that the urban council can come along and say: &ldquo;You will have to take X, Y or Z or else you will be liable for the rates&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>This discussion has done some good, because we have now got some statement from the Minister trying to discriminate between amendment No. 6 and amendment No. 3 which does not go very far.  I think a fair test of the information given to the House is this: would anybody who does not know anything about the law relating to rates in respect to either urban areas or non-urban areas say that his mind has been clarified by what has been said in this House?  I do not think he would.  I think a person who came in here with some sort of standing as an expert on rating would find himself considerably confused. It must be understood that these are amendments put up for the first time.  It is not as if this matter was discussed thoroughly and this was merely bringing into form the result of a fruitful discussion at an earlier stage.  They are brought in now for the first time.  I think the test as to the information given by the Minister to the House is, how far the House is <Col N="2219" /> enlightened on the different rating systems, particularly as these rating systems bear upon unoccupied dwellings in urban and non-urban areas. The Minister has had information suddenly given to him by his informers and he told us there is a certain reference in this to the Rent Restrictions Act just passed.  That was a late thought to him, I must say.</P>

I am glad I was not here, if the debate was anything so confusing as it is now.  Deputy Martin O'Sullivan asked a question which surely could have been replied to.  He asked what was a suitable tenant and what was a reasonable rent.  These are matters on which court decisions have been given arising out of other Acts over the years, but the Minister's comment was that the decision as to a suitable tenant would be made by the local authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion was made that the courts would decide what was a suitable tenant and what was a <Col N="2220" /> reasonable rent, and the Minister recently made the addition that it will be the local authority in the first instance.  I presume the same thing applies in the other case, namely, that the local authority will say whether it thinks that there is lack of occupation for the purpose of enabling alterations, additions or repairs to be made. I suppose, again, it will be the local authority which will decide whether the owner is <i>bona fide</i> unable to obtain a suitable tenant.  There may be a suitable tenant in the offing and there may be a tenant offering reasonable rent and there may be a case where the owner would be <i>bona fide</i> unable to get such a person.  He may not know of such a person being in the vicinity.  I understand now from the Minister that the local authority will decide that in the first instance.  What I am anxious to discover is whether the courts will decide that in the end.</P>
      <P>The courts have from time to time laid down who would not be regarded as a suitable tenant, who would be unsuitable by reason of previous history in regard to occupied premises, habits he had shown and had already proved to the satisfaction of the courts. A man might not be suitable also on financial grounds, even though he might offer what was regarded as a reasonable rent for a period.  Men often make efforts which they are not in a position to carry out.</P>
      <P>The reasonable rent is the matter about which I am anxious.  Has that been changed by the framework in which the phrase is now enclosed?  A reasonable rent in the past, when free disposal of property obtained, meant a rent which the owner of the property considered reasonable.  I should imagine that is no longer the case. There have been tests applied.  The courts have made a comparison with neighbouring premises of a similar type and by that system they arrive, in respect of a certain premises, at what is a reasonable rent.  But all this has now been put into a peculiar setting which more or less says that it is the duty of people to let property so that the local authority can get the benefit of the rates paid on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is there any intention to <Col N="2221" /> make any change in the old-time court attitude towards a reasonable rent because of the peculiar framework in which this matter is encompassed? There is definitely a new slant on this subject.  Anybody reading the new sections will see the idea lurking in the background that property ought to be in occupation and there is the onus on a person who has not let property to show why he leaves it unoccupied.  The idea of the two sections is that property ought to be in occupation.  I should like to know from the Minister if the courts are to be asked to put a new interpretation on reasonable rents, having against that an acceptance of the idea that rates ought to be derived on property and, therefore, property ought to be let.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The amendment proposes that where a hereditament is unoccupied by reason of additions, alterations and repairs, the rates shall be paid, but that application can be made and, where it is considered by the local authority that the hereditament was actually unoccupied for the additions, alterations or repairs, then the rates can be refunded.

    <P>26.&mdash;(1)  Where a hereditament <Col N="2226" /> situated in a town which is not an urban district is, on the date of the commencement of this section, held (whether together with or without other premises) under a lease which binds the lessor to pay or allow a deduction or set off against or otherwise to relieve the lessee from any rates made by the commissioners of the town payable in respect of the hereditament, all rent payable under the lease in respect of a period commencing on or after the date of the commencement of this section shall be reduced&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of an annual rent, by an amount equal to the amount of the rates made by the commissioners of the town in respect of the hereditament for the local financial year expiring at the commencement of this section to which the relief afforded to the lessee by the lease lawfully extended, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of any rent other than an annual rent, by an amount which bears to the rates made by the commissioners of the town in respect of the hereditament for the said local financial year to which the relief afforded to the lessee by the lease lawfully extended the same proportion as the period by reference to which such rent is calculated bears to one year.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section, the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; includes any contract of tenancy, whether in writing or verbal, whereby the relation of landlord and tenant is created, and the words &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; respectively include the landlord of and the tenant under such tenancy.</P>
    <P>This section provides for the adjustment of rent under town commissioners and corresponds to Section 19.  When town charges are raised, the rated occupier becomes liable.  Under an existing lease, the lessor has to pay the rates in urban areas.</P>

    <P>The rating authority makes a rate by passing a resolution and making it accessible in the rate book.  In the case of a county council, the chairman and two other members present at the meeting make a statement under seal that the rate has been made by the county council.  In the case, however, of town commissioners, where the total number of commissioners is nine, no less than six commissioners must sign the rate book.  Under the Bill, the provision in the Act of 1847 to this effect will be repealed, but the repeal will not come into effect until the Bill generally is put into operation.  The purpose of the amendment is to dispense with the necessity in the current year for six members to sign the rate book.</P>

      <P>28.&mdash;The poor rate made by the council of a county for the local financial year beginning on the 1st day of April, 1946, shall not be invalidated by reason of the fact that, subsequent to the estimates meeting, held under Section 24 of the County Management Act, 1940 (No. 12 of 1940), at which the said council determined a rate in the £ to be levied for the purposes of the construction and maintenance of roads, the said council, in anticipation of an increase in the receipts by way of grant from the Road Fund, reduced the said rate in the £ and made the poor rate for the said year accordingly.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to meet the situation which arose in the case of a few counties this year.  When the increased allocation from the Road Fund was announced this year, some county councils had already made their rates and had made them upon a much higher scale than would have been necessary, if they had been aware of the increased allocation from the Road Fund.  Under the existing law, they could not alter the rate in the £ which they had determined and this amendment will validate any change they have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment for the purpose of permitting local authorities, at a considerable amount of inconvenience, to rectify the position created by the futility and incompetency of the Minister's Department, in not making the allocations from the Road Fund at such a date as would enable local authorities, sitting down to discuss what moneys they would have to raise by rates for the coming year, to know what contribution they were to get from the Road Fund for the maintenance and upkeep of roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to validate here an illegal action taken by local authorities.  I have in mind a specific county council which considered this matter and which was advised that, as the law stood, it could not mend its hand, when they had the information that an increased grant was forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That council was rightly advised, but the position was that some other councils took a chance and decided to strike a lower rate.  On the point which Deputy Mulcahy has raised, I am quite prepared to admit that the allocations from the Road Fund were made known at a very late date, but I can say in regard to that that it would have been unfair to the county councils to have made the allocations at an earlier date, because we would not have been in a position to estimate what was going to be the effect on the Road Fund of the increase in the petrol ration and, consequently, in the motor vehicle duties payable. We could not possibly have anticipated that so many more vehicles would have been put on the road, that the reaction to the restoration of the petrol ration would have been so favourable, and, therefore, we, quite rightly, I think, waited until we saw what was the <Col N="2231" /> maximum amount we could give, and we gave that accordingly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may say that was blameworthy, but the only alternative was to have taken a rather conservative view of the position some weeks earlier and to have released much smaller grants than we were in fact able to release.  I thought it was better, since we had the money and since it was essential that the work of restoring the roads should be begun as early as possible, even though it did mean that, in one or two cases, county councils had already made their rate, to release the larger sum.  I thought it was much better to proceed and release the large sum.  With regard to what Deputy Hughes has said, he is quite right. The county councils who have already struck their rates and which, subsequently to the release of the notification of an increased grant in the road fund, adopted a lower and I might say a fictitious rate, acted illegally.  Their second rate could be quashed in court. It is to deal with that situation and to validate the reduction in the rates which they made that we are here to-day.</P>

      <P>The Minister now tells us that when considering the responsibility of the Department in relation to the maintenance and upkeep of the roads instead of approaching the problem from the point of view of a realisation of the fact that we are now 12 months after the end of the war the Minister made, or was preparing to make, his allocation, not in respect of the urgent and necessary work essential on the roads, but in respect of the amount of money which he calculated would come to the Road Fund. Surely the Minister realises that the Exchequer stands behind the Road Fund and that on many occasions there have been borrowings from the Exchequer for the purpose of the Road Fund.  The present debacle illustrates very clearly the way in which the Department is breaking down, not only in the manner in which it is dealing with its legislative work but in the manner in which it is dealing with its ordinary administration when it can make an announcement so late as to completely upset <Col N="2232" /> the machinery for striking a proper and adequate rate on the part of a number of local authorities.  In relation to the work carried out on the roads it is quite obvious that the Minister was waiting to see how the barometer was rising in order to calculate how much money he would make available for the Road Fund in the present year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in that respect, but I do say very emphatically that he has not been fair in the treatment he has meted out to the various county councils.  I protest strongly that there were sources of information available to some county councils that were not available to others.  The responsibility is on the Minister to ensure that whatever information is available should be available to all.  Possibly they were sources of political information. I think that is not good enough and I want to emphatically protest against an administration in a Department which permits that to happen.</P>

      <P>29.&mdash;(1) A hereditament which but for this section would, as regards any local financial year, be a small dwelling within the meaning of the Act of 1928 shall not, as regards that local financial year, be a small dwelling within the meaning of the Act of 1928 if on the 1st day of April in that local financial year the owner of such hereditament within the meaning of the said Act is a State authority.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a gale of rent paid, before the passing of this Act, to a State authority by the occupier of a hereditament was, in purported compliance with Section 6 of the Act of 1928, increased by a sum (in this sub-section referred to as the increase) purporting to represent part of a rate purporting to have been made in respect of the said hereditament under Section 4 of the Act of 1928, for the service of a particular local financial year, then, unless the increase was returned by that State authority to such occupier before the passing of this Act, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  That State authority shall pay the increase to the rating authority by whom the said rate was made,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the increase when so paid to that rating authority shall be deemed to have been paid by that State authority at the request of such occupier in respect of a rate lawfully made on such occupier in respect of the said hereditament for <Col N="2239" /> the service of the said local financial year.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the Act of 1928&rdquo; means the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928 (No. 4 of 1928);</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;State authority&rdquo; means any authority being&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a Minister of State, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the Revenue Commissioners, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the Irish Land Commission, or</P>
    <P>(d)  the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is to place the occupiers of small dwellings owned by State authorities in the same position as occupiers of dwellings that are not small dwellings, that is to say, it will make the occupiers of dwellings owned by State authorities liable for rates in future. This will mean that the rates will not be collected by the owner, that is, by the State.  It will not make any difference to the rates payable by the occupiers but it will mean that these rates will have to be collected by the rating authority.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 17, before Section 38, line 21, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>38.&mdash;(1)  Any two or more road authorities may, by resolution under this section passed by each of such authorities, establish a joint committee of their members to consider proposals for an application for a bridge Order to be made by any one of such road authorities and to facilitate the obtaining of the consent of every such road authority to the terms of such an application.</P>
      <P>(2)  A resolution passed under this section by each of several road authorities shall state&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the general character and purpose of the work,</P>
      <P>(b)  the number of members from each such road authority who are to be members of the joint committee established by the resolution, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the manner in which the expenses incurred by such joint committee are to be defrayed by the several road authorities.</P>
      <P>(3)  A joint committee of two or more road authorities established by a resolution under this section shall consider proposals for the application in respect of which they are so established and shall furnish to each such road authority a report setting out the terms in which, in their opinion, such application should be made and, for the purposes of such consideration and report, Section 46 of this Act shall apply as if the committee were a road authority.</P>
      <P>(4)  The expenses incurred by a joint committee established under this section by two or more road authorities shall be defrayed by such authorities in the manner specified in the resolution establishing such committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new section is intended to meet the case made by Deputy Broderick for provision by which road authorities might meet and reach agreement regarding an application for a bridge <Col N="2242" /> Order.  It will be recalled that on Committee Stage Deputy Broderick said that if two county authorities come together and reach agreement on an application for a bridge Order it was undesirable that the whole processes involved in Part IV of this Bill should be put into operation and this section is included so that a joint committee may be formed of the members of two or more local authorities and that by that means the preliminary inquiry may be dispensed with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary says, this is an amendment to meet the point made by Deputy Broderick but sub-section (2) provides for a resolution to be passed by each of the several road authorities.  Surely there is some necessity for referring the decisions taken by the committee before those resolutions are passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should think the section is fairly clear.  Two road authorities may desire to come together and dispense with the preliminary report and the inquiry and establish a joint committee of their members to consider proposals.  In doing so they have to indicate the general character and purpose of the work and also to provide for their expenses.  I do not follow what the Deputy means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If they should pass conflicting resolutions, the general provisions in Part IV of the Bill dealing with bridge Orders take place.  The Minister would have to refuse the application for the bridge Order if there is anything that is not desirable or anything which shows conflict of opinion.  Then the preliminary report has to be prepared and inquiry held. It is only if all goes well that this section becomes operative and the Minister must be the person who finally decides whether all does go well between the two authorities.</P>

      <P>In page 18, Section 40, to delete sub-section (1), lines 5-7 and substitute the following three sub-sections:</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to sub-sections (2) and (4) of this section, the Minister may make the bridge Order in such terms as he thinks proper.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister shall not make the bridge Order unless, either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  every road authority to which the bridge Order applies has consented to such application, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the following things have been done&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a preliminary report has been prepared and furnished under Section 38 of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  a local inquiry has been held under Section 39 of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  every road authority to which the Order applies was given notice of the inquiry, and</P>
      <P>(iv)  the Minister has considered the report of the inquiry.</P>
      <P>(3)  The giving by a road authority of consent to the application to such road authority of a bridge Order shall be a reserved function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment follows on from the previous amendment and enables the Minister to dispense with the making of a preliminary report and the holding of a local inquiry when the terms of a bridge Order have been agreed upon by all the road authorities concerned. <Col N="2244" /> It will be noted that the Minister now makes a bridge Order subject to two or three main considerations:&mdash; (1)  that he must have a preliminary report and a local inquiry and he must ensure that every road authority has been given notice of the inquiry before he makes the bridge Order, unless the road authorities concerned have already consented to the application by means of having formed a joint committee.  It will be noted in this case that the giving by a road authority of consent to the application of such road authority to the Order is a reserved function; in other words it is for the county councils concerned to make a decision as to the action of the joint committee and in approval of their submission to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. This Bill is of a somewhat technical nature and I arranged, on that account, to have an explanatory memorandum circulated with it.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the laws in respect of hire-purchase and sales upon credit and I feel sure that a Bill having that purpose will be approved in principle by the Dáil and any discussion which may take place upon it will be confined to the details of its provisions, which would ordinarily be considered on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to protect the interests of persons who acquire goods under hire-purchase or credit sales agreements and who, owing to their circumstances, may be, as the law stands, subjected to undue difficulty or hardship and may be unable to protect their own interests.  It is not proposed to interfere, and I think the House will agree it is not desirable that it should interfere, with the legitimate activities of owners and finance companies in the sphere of hire-purchase, as their activities, in general, serve a useful purpose by enabling persons of modest means to obtain the earlier use of furniture, bicycles and similar commodities, than would otherwise be possible for them.  Moreover, in so far as hire-purchase and credit sale arrangements facilitate the acquisition of motor lorries, machinery and other industrial equipment, they encourage commercial and industrial expansion, particularly by small-scale concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transactions of that kind, hire-purchase and credit sale transactions, <Col N="2249" /> had been increasing steadily in volume in this country, as in other countries, in the years prior to the outbreak of the war.  In 1938 the value of goods which were acquired under such agreements was approximately £1,500,000 and there is every likelihood that, with the resumption of normal trading facilities, that figure will be exceeded in the future. It is accordingly clear that the hire-purchase system has become an important factor in the social and economic life of the community and that, as such, it is desirable in the community's interests that it should be kept free from abuse, in so far as it can be kept free from abuse, by means of legislation.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the position in regard to trading of that character was investigated by an inter-departmental committee, and the report of that committee showed that only a small number of complaints had been received from aggrieved persons and that, generally, there was no evidence that there have developed so far, in this country, any widespread abuses in the hire-purchase system.  Nevertheless, the existing law in regard to hire-purchase is unsatisfactory in many respects and there have been some instances in which traders had availed themselves of the unsatisfactory nature of the law to take unfair advantage of persons buying goods by these methods.  The Bill, which is designed to prevent wrongs in the future rather than cure wrongs which have already occurred, is being introduced to make sure that serious abuses do not develop in the future.  I should add that the expansion of the hire-purchase system has created similar problems in other countries, and in passing this Bill we will be keeping abreast of the practice elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The object of the Bill is, as I have said, the protection of persons who, owing to their circumstances, are not in a position to protect themselves.  It is not intended to interfere with the hire-purchase business to any greater extent than is necessary to achieve that purpose.  The scope of the Bill is, accordingly, limited to cases where the hire-purchase or credit sale price <Col N="2250" /> does not exceed £100.  It is assumed that persons in a position to acquire goods of a value in excess of £100 should be able to look after their own interests.</P>
    <P>One of the unsatisfactory features of hire-purchase agreements, at the moment, is that the person who acquires goods by that means frequently has no idea of the cost to him of the hire-purchase facilities, and he is only aware of the fact that, by paying instalments over a certain period, he will acquire the ownership of the goods.  A person may, in that manner, be induced to pay more for hire-purchase facilities than he would agree to if he had a full knowledge of the facts. The Bill seeks to remedy that position by providing that the hirer of goods will be furnished, prior to the making of an agreement by him, with information as to the cost price of the goods as distinct from the hire-purchase price.  The same arrangement will apply in respect to credit sales exceeding £5 in value.</P>
    <P>Hire-purchase agreements are at present covered by the law of contract, and a person hiring goods, who wishes to return them to the owner, may find that under a minimum payment clause in the agreement, he has contracted to pay the greater part of the total hire-purchase price, whether he continues to hire all the goods or not.  The Bill seeks to remedy that position, by enabling the hirer of the goods, if he has taken reasonable care of them, to terminate a hire-purchase agreement before a final payment is made, and to return the goods, by giving written notice and paying half of the total purchase price, or paying the amount due at the time of the termination of the agreement, whichever sum is the greater.  Payment of at least half the total hire-purchase price affords reasonable compensation to the owner of the goods, who is also entitled to receive any installation cost that may have been incurred.  In order to ensure that no person, through ignorance of the law, will be prevailed upon to forgo the right to return the goods, it is provided in the Bill that any agreement containing a contracting-out clause will be void.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2251" /> A common feature of hire-purchase agreements is a clause giving the owner of the goods the right to enter the premises of the hirer of the goods, and to seize the goods without further ado in the event of the hirer defaulting in payment.  The effect of such a clause is, that a person who has paid a considerable proportion of the cost of the goods may, owing to inability to pay an instalment, lose possession of all the goods without obtaining any credit for what he has paid.  It is unavoidable from time to time that persons obtaining goods by the hire-purchase system should, owing to temporary financial troubles, have to return goods, but that is a different matter from permitting a trader to seize all the goods without compensation, merely because an instalment was not paid.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that any clause in an agreement providing for the entry of the owner on to a hirer's premises to seize goods is void, and further, that where one-third of the hire-purchase price is paid, the owner can regain possession of the goods, even if there has been default in the payment of instalments, only through the court. Where an application for the recovery of the goods comes before the court the court will have power, if it thinks fit, to postpone the return of the goods, in order to enable the due amount to be paid, or to transfer ownership of part of the goods to the hirer, and to return the remainder to the owner.  It is also provided that where there is more than one agreement, appropriation of the instalments by an owner, in such a way as to deprive the hirer of his rights under each separate agreement, is prevented.</P>
    <P>Another source of abuse in regard to hire-purchase agreements is that the anxiety of persons in poorer circumstances to avail themselves of hire-purchase facilities provides an opportunity for owners to dispose of inferior quality goods to such persons who, when they find the goods are unsatisfactory, may also discover that the hire-purchase agreements into which they entered, precludes them from suing the owner of the goods for breach <Col N="2252" /> of warranty.  There are sections in the Bill which provide that the same conditions as to warranty, quality, and the like, will apply to hire-purchase transactions as to ordinary commercial transactions.  These are the main provisions of the Bill and, with regard to them, I feel sure there will be little difference of opinion amongst Deputies.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may think that the legislation should go further, but I ask them to keep in mind that, while it is desirable to eliminate the possibility of abuse arising out of hire-purchase agreements, it is also, from the social and economic point of view, desirable to facilitate and to ensure the continuance of commercial transactions of that nature.  I should also point out that the Bill aims at reducing law costs, by providing that proceedings for recovery of goods may be instituted in any district court, provided the hire-purchase price does not exceed £25. At present such proceedings cannot be taken in the district court, except in the Dublin area.  I have dealt with the main provisions of the Bill, the need for which I assume will be generally accepted, and I recommend it to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a replica the English Act of 1938.  The only difference is that in the English Act there are three limits, £50 in the case of hire-purchase of motor cars, £500 for the purchase of live stock, and £100 in the case of other transactions.  I think all Parties agree on the principle of the Bill, that it is unobjectionable, and that it is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1937, a commission on hire-purchase was set up by the Government, and amongst its recommendations was that hire-purchase in this country largely partook of the nature of money lending, that it was not so much <i>bona fide</i> hire-purchase business as a cloak <Col N="2253" /> for the activities of money lenders.  In that respect it is essential that the House should be careful to ensure that whatever is done now will leave no loophole to money lenders to hide their activities behind the framework of a Bill of this kind.  The Commission also recommended that property bought by way of hire-purchase should become, as from the date of the payment of the first instalment, the property of the purchaser.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, the real difficulty about hire-purchase up to now has been that property never came into the ownership of the purchaser until every penny of the purchase price had been paid.  Cases of considerable hardship arose under that heading.  There is, for example, in England, a recorded case of a gentleman who entered into a hire-purchase agreement for the purchase of a piano. He paid £57 by way of instalments.  He became unemployed around the period when the last instalment was due and found himself in the position that, under the existing law, he had to return the piano and was held to be liable for the balance of £3.  It was to get rid of abuses of that kind that the Bill of 1938 was passed in England.</P>
    <P>There were other cases of people in poor circumstances who bought furniture on this system.  If they had paid £19 10s. 0d. in respect of a purchase price of £20 and then defaulted through no fault of their own&mdash;by reason perhaps of unemployment&mdash;in the payment of the last 10/-, the owner could enter the house almost by force and seize the furniture.  The purchaser again is in the position of having to forfeit the furniture and of being still liable for the balance of 10/-.  The courts in England, in order to get over that hardship in the law, generally decreed that the balance be paid by instalments of 1d. per month or a ¼d. per week.  I do not know if any cases of that kind cropped up here or came to the notice of the commission.</P>
    <P>The commission, in addition, recommended that the cash price, in addition to the hire-purchase price, of the article being purchased should be plainly marked, and the Bill carries out the recommendation of the commission in that respect, but in addition to having <Col N="2254" /> the cash price and the hire-purchase price marked, I submit that the interest should be clearly set out, so that the purchaser will appreciate not only that he has £x to pay, if he pays cash, and £y, if he buys on the hire-purchase system, but that he is paying by way of interest, so much per cent. in order that the doubtful nature of the bargain he may be making may be brought as forcibly as possible to his notice.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation put forward by the commission was that the Government should set up some supervision by way of inspection of hire-purchase shops, of traders engaged in this system of hire-purchase.  That was, of course, essential, having regard particularly to the peculiar nature of the transaction.  Invariably, these gentlemen engaged in this system of business at that time sold articles of doubtful quality, and, by a species of very persuasive business methods, they were able to foist these articles sometimes on unwilling housewives in the absence of their husbands. The husband, as a result, found himself in the position that he had a dud article in the house for which his wife had signed an agreement in his absence and that he had no option but to pay for the dud article.  That was not the only unsatisfactory feature of the transaction, because, if the husband defaulted in the payment of an instalment, the article was promptly seized and sold to the next housewife, and then seized again after a short period, and so it went on.  Very often, one article went through eight or ten of these transactions.</P>
    <P>It is to curb abuses of that kind that this Bill is introduced, and my concern is to ensure that by whatever measures we are taking now we will curb once and for all the activities of these gentlemen.  The Bill goes a certain distance towards restricting their activities in insisting that the agreement shall be in writing and, not only in writing, but signed by the hirer himself.  These agreements are very detailed and certain parts of them are set out in block letters which the prospective hirer can very easily read. These are generally the parts that are set out to induce the hirer to buy.  The <Col N="2255" /> really vital parts which are going to catch him are printed in such small lettering that very often one would require a microscope to read them, and for that reason many people sign these agreements without really knowing what they are signing, and very often even a skilled lawyer would find it very difficult to know what exactly was the nature of the agreement.</P>
    <P>These agreements were very skilfully drawn up by large multiple concerns, generally trading on a nation, or perhaps a continent wide basis, and they had the benefit of the most expert lawyers and were so devised that there was no escape at any time for the hirer.  We want to ensure that in approaching this problem we leave no backdoor open by means of which these gentlemen can drive a coach and four through this measure and resort to some system of renting, as apart from hiring or selling articles on the basis of a credit sale.</P>
    <P>On that point, I should like to see some limit of time&mdash;say, two to three years&mdash;prescribed for transactions of this nature.  There is a recorded case in England of a lady who bought a perambulator on the instalment system. When she came to pay her last instalment to the hire-purchase firm, the gentleman in charge of the shop said: &ldquo;How is the baby?&rdquo;  and the smiling mother answered: &ldquo;She is being married to-morrow.&rdquo;  That type of thing should not be allowed to continue, because it is prolonging the risk for the hirer, and a working man who may be subject to some system of casual employment may find himself in a position in which he has to face long gaps of unemployment during which he may default in an instalment through no fault of his own.  There should be some limit of time to these transactions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the limit set out in the Bill, the limit prescribed in the 1938 Act was £50 for the hire-purchase of motor cars.  To my mind, that seemed ridiculous because it did not in any sense enable the artisan or the small earner&mdash;the wage earner or small-salary earner&mdash;to purchase a car on the hire-purchase system.  I <Col N="2256" /> think it only right that these people who feel that they can find the money should have the same rights as any other class.  The limit of £50 was admittedly not intended to reach these people, while it did of course provide amply for the case of the poor person who bought a limited quantity of furniture on this system.  I suggest that, having regard to the different purchasing power of £100 to-day as compared with £100 in 1938, we should consider a higher limit.</P>
    <P>I took the trouble to go through the Second Reading debate on the Bill in the British House of Commons, and I find that the person responsible for the Bill, Miss Ellen Wilkinson, recommended a limit of £100 then, because the County Court jurisdiction limit in cases of that kind was £100.  That was the reason she gave for the limit of £100&mdash;the reason of course being that she wanted to keep cases of this kind within the ambit of the County Court for the purposes of costs.  Now our limit in the Circuit Court is £300; and I would respectfully recommend that should be the limit in this Bill.  It would enable the Bill to cover the type of case I have mentioned, namely, the hire-purchase system for the purchase of motor cars by the lower salaried and wage earning classes.  £100 to-day will buy very little more than perhaps a wireless set and a few chairs.  I think that where young people are setting up home and when it is now no longer questionable that these people should have the right to furnish their homes out of income as distinct from capital we should raise this limit and encourage them to buy under this system. Most people to-day in the middle classes are buying their furniture, household requisites, and amenities of all kinds by way of this eystem.  So far as the system has gone on the other side a County Court judge has declared that the only thing that is not now saleable by way of hire purchase is a coffin.  Every article of every class in Great Britain is available under this system.  I think therefore that there is a good case for extending the limit of £100.  I would go even further and say that once we accept the principle of hire purchase there is no reason why there should be any limit so long as <Col N="2257" /> the proper safeguards are provided by the law.  One member in the debate on the English Bill went so far as to suggest that this principle of hire purchase should be extended to enable prospective tenants to purchase their own homes by way of hire purchase, subject of course to a mortgage.  I notice Deputy O'Connor smiling when I make that suggestion.  But I do make it in all seriousness.  It is sound in principle&mdash;and perhaps sounder&mdash;and a better security for the lender if you extend the principle to house purchase as distinct from a depreciating asset such as a motor car.  I am not saying that that view met with any support on the other side but it was certainly expressed.  I advance it here not because I advocate the extension of that principle to the purchase of houses but merely in support of the argument for the raising of the limit from £100 to the jurisdiction limit of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The other ground upon which I advocate that extension is because money to-day has deteriorated so much in purchasing power as compared with 1938.  £100 in 1938 would be represented to-day by something over £200 in purchasing power.  I am not quite clear as to whether the Bill extends to all classes of hire-purchase.  The Act applies to every hire-purchase or credit sale agreement, the purchase price or total purchase price not exceeding £100.  I want to ask the Minister if that includes hire-purchase agreements with such bodies as the Electricity Supply Board and the Gas Company?  Would they be included within its scope? They have a system whereby they hire out certain apparatus during the hiring period, which is generally indefinite and they undertake responsibility not only to repair the article hired out but also to replace it.  Poor people who avail of this arrangement in regard to household articles, such as electric kettles, electric cookers, electric irons and so on pay year after year for these articles but never own them.  I am not quite clear as to whether or not we should construe this to include such bodies within the scope of this Bill, if for no other reason than the one I have already advanced, namely, the unscrupulous <Col N="2258" /> element in the hire-purchase trade.</P>
    <P>I am sure that element exists here as elsewhere and that it may seek the loophole to get around this Act and induce people to rent these articles.  If a system of that kind were allowed to grow up under a hire-purchase trade &mdash;I do not think for a moment that the Electricity Supply Board or the Gas Company would resort to unscrupulous methods&mdash;I feel then that we would have to come back again to this House for legislation to restrict activities of that kind.  I do not want to go through the whole Bill as outlined by the Minister.  The provisions which amounted to forcible entry by agents of the hire-purchase system is now checked.  That is a very desirable decision and I do not need to comment upon it further.  They are, as I have already indicated, those set out in the 1938 Act and they are well known to anybody who has any experience of these matters.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it would be desirable to consider adding to the powers of the court the right to vary agreements if the court was satisfied that such agreements were likely to create undue hardship upon the hirer or that they were unconscionable in their extent.  Having regard to the fact that the commission which investigated this matter in 1937 came to the conclusion that the hire purchase system as then prevailing was a cloak for the activities of money lenders, I again want to emphasise to the House the need for closing every possible door to this type of unscrupulous activity carried on under the guise of hire purchase.  We may have to put down amendments on the Committee Stage to tighten up certain aspects of the Bill as regards the jurisdiction which is being conferred upon the District Court.  I am not quite clear as to whether the provision as set out will work in favour of the hirer&mdash;&ldquo;The District Court shall have jurisdiction in any action by the owner of goods let under a hire-purchase agreement to enforce a right to recover possession of the goods from the hirer where the hire purchase price does not exceed £25.&rdquo;  What I have in mind is the possibility that if this is <Col N="2259" /> allowed to stand as at present expressed it may mean that it would be possible for the hire purchase firm to take action in the Dublin District Court and compel a hirer perhaps to come from the country to defend his action.  The English Act prescribes that jurisdiction shall be in the court where the hirer resides or carries on his business or where he resided or carried on his business at the time of the payment of the last instalment and it may be necessary to set out more clearly the jurisdiction of the District Court so as to prevent a hardship of that kind arising, because, quite obviously, if a country hirer had to come to Dublin to defend his suit, in nine cases out of ten there would be no appearance.  We, on this side of the House, endorse the Bill and we may have something more to say on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will meet with the approval of practically every Deputy.  There is, however, the point referred to by Deputy Coogan with regard to the limitation of £100.  I cannot see any reason why there should be that limit.  I have in mind people who purchase farm machinery and lorries who make very good livelihood out of it.  I should like to see them protected.  I have seldom come across a case where there was seizure of goods because of failure to pay instalments, but occasionally one hears of a person who may go into a business and be caught up in this kind of thing.  He may have half or more than half the purchase price paid when there may be failure to pay.  I should like to see such persons protected, at least by resort to court action such as is set out in other parts of the Bill.  There is a limit of £100, if I have read the Bill properly.  I should like that to be extended to £400 or £500.  I do not see any reason why it should not be.  Young people, particularly in rural districts, may wish to invest in the purchase of tractors or lorries.  I do not see that there would be anything wrong in protecting them by this Bill.  Now is the time to do that.  I do not understand why there should be a limit of £100.  That may protect those who buy a motor bicycle <Col N="2260" /> or a second-hand car.  Otherwise, I like the Bill.  I like its general trend.</P>
      <P>Many people consider that hire-purchase, in any shape or form, is bad.  They would prefer to be without a thing if they could not buy it outright. Cases occurred in the past where people bought motor cars on the hire-purchase system and, having contributed practically the full purchase price, they failed, through ill-health or accident or some unforeseen cause, to meet the full liability and the goods were seized and their money was lost: there was no refund.  Apart from the limitation of £100, I think the Bill is an excellent one and I am sure the Minister will see his way to increase that limit to £400.  £100 may be a useful figure for people in the city or town but it would be very necessary to cover the case of people in rural districts who may start a business in which they would find very lucrative employment but which they could not start if the hire-purchase system was not available.  These people should be protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I come across many cases in business where hardships are caused by the operation of hire purchase agreements.  I think most of the cases I have come across would be dealt with by this Bill and that the hardships and grievances that arose will be to a great extent cured by this Bill.  I was rather disappointed, however, to note that the Bill is limited to cases where the total price is under £100.  Other Deputies have referred to that point and suggested that the limit should be increased.  I would go further and suggest that there should be no limit at all.  I say this Bill is a good Bill.  It protects the interests of people who take goods on hire-purchase and at the same time it is reasonably fair to the people who sell the goods on these terms.  While it is a good Bill, I cannot see any reason why anybody should be excluded from it.  At least some of the provisions should apply to all hire-purchase agreements.  Take for instance the provision which forbids the agent of the seller to enter the premises where the goods are, for the purpose of seizing them.  Surely that provision should apply to every hire-purchase <Col N="2261" /> agreement without any limit whatever.  I intend to say more on that on Committee Stage but I would suggest to the Minister that, as the Bill is a good Bill, everybody should get the benefit of it no matter what price they are prepared to pay for the goods. I would like to see in the Bill some provision to limit the extra amount that could be charged over the cash price in the hire-purchase price. Deputy Coogan referred to hire-purchase as being something akin to money-lending.  With that I agree. Under the Moneylenders Act there is a limit on the rate of interest which may be charged on a loan but we have here no limit on the extra amount that may be charged over the cash price because the purchaser is paying the price in instalments.  I am sure that matter was considered by the Minister and his officials and there must be some reason for the omission of that limit.  I would ask the Minister to agree with that as I consider there should be some restriction. No matter what competition there may be there will still be people who will charge excessive rates of interest, as moneylenders do, and I think some limit should be placed upon them in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that it might have been possible to apply the same principles of mortgage to goods as already apply to land.  The principle is, once a mortgage always a mortgage, so that the mortgagee never gets the right to take possession of the land; he merely gets a right to have it sold and if he gets more for it on the sale than is due to him under the mortgage he must hand it back to the mortgagor. There is no such provision in this Bill in regard to the hiring of goods, which is really the same thing as the mortgage of goods.  I do not know if it would be possible to work out any provision like that, that when the goods would be seized there would be an obligation put on the owner to sell the goods and if he realised anything more than was due under the hire-purchase to give the excess to the party who had hired the goods.  Subject to a few suggestions I will make on Committee Stage, I want to congratulate the Minister <Col N="2262" /> on bringing in the Bill.  I think he has made a fine effort to do justice to all sides, and that is not an easy thing to do.</P>

      <P>Since this Bill affords protection where none already exists, it is obviously to be welcomed, but in my opinion it does not go far enough to check the abuses which are said to be associated with this particular system.  The Minister indicated the main effects of the Bill, and I think they are worth underlining.  They are that the cost price and the hire-purchase figures will have to be in future clearly indicated; that the owner may not enter the premises and seize at will, that he may not easily recover possession even in default of payment when one-third of the cost has been paid; that the hirer can cancel his contract when half the purchase price has been paid; there is protection of the courts in certain circumstances, and the Bill aims at lower costs of litigation in the District Courts, which has been referred to, and there is a form of protection in so far as the quality of the goods is concerned.  Like the other speakers, the first defect I find in the Bill is the limitation of the price which will be necessary to protect the purchaser, namely, the figure of £100.  I think that figure is an arbitrary figure, and is possibly merely taken from the British Bill of 1938.  We had better get the background of that Bill, which was sponsored by Miss Ellen Wilkinson in a rather unfriendly Parliament so far as she was concerned, because she was lucky in the draw in the ballot for Private Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Committee Stage Miss Wilkinson had to forgo a lot of the things that she introduced into the Bill in order to ensure that the main principle of her Bill would be preserved. I believe that this was one. Apart altogether from her troubles in connection with that Bill, the fact remains that, since this Bill is obviously framed on the same lines, £100 to-day bears no relation so far as the cost of household goods is concerned to £100 in 1938.  I agree that something can be said for removing the ceiling altogether. But at least a very good case can be made for raising the ceiling of <Col N="2263" /> £100 so far as any couple buying a suite of furniture at present are concerned. Most of that money would now go on a suite of furniture to equip one bedroom.  Apart from the question of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court extending to £300, there are merits in the case for raising the figure to £300, or removing the figure of £100 altogether.  That is a matter we can discuss in Committee.</P>
    <P>The other defect I see in the Bill&mdash; here again we have the background of the 1938 British Bill&mdash;is where an individual wants to cancel his contract, having paid a certain number of premiums.  I believe that one of the things on which Miss Wilkinson was exceedingly keen was to enable the purchaser to cancel his contract after one-third of the payments had been made.  Vested interests were, however, arrayed against here in the Committee Stage and she finally had to give way. It was put up to her that an individual might purchase a bicycle in June on the hire purchase system, run that bicycle to death, and then give it back in September; in other words, that the advantage would be in favour of the hirer as against the owner.  On that she gave way, as her main desire was to preserve the principle of the Bill. She had eventually to agree to one-half of the payments.  I think that in connection with certain articles which would not suffer great depreciation we should permit a hirer to void his contract after one-third of the payments had been made.  That is also a matter which we can discuss in Committee, perhaps with good results.</P>
    <P>I must confess I do not share Deputy Coogan's optimism with regard to what I call the kernel of this whole matter, that is, on the question of the display of the cost-price figure and the hire-purchase figure.  It sounds very nice, but in actual practice something else occurs.  If my information is correct, a number of these firms operating this system work on a basis of 100 per cent. profit and, therefore, the addition of 2½ or 5 per cent. for interest under the extended payment system, which may seem reasonable, is in fact entirely deceptive, because these firms are exclusively <Col N="2264" /> engaged in the hire-purchase business and their cash sales are negligible.  Therefore they base their whole business on this hire-purchase system, building it up on a 100 per cent. profit basis.  The clause in this Bill which is intended to be valuable and to indicate to the unwary purchaser what the cost price is and what the hire-purchase price is and, by a simple sum in arithmetic, what eventually it will cost the individual, is not going to work out as expected.</P>
    <P>The root cause of a good deal of the trouble in connection with this matter is that some of these people are charged exorbitant prices, very often for inferior goods.  I understand there are cases where suites of furniture are palmed off as walnut or mahogany which in reality are made of ordinary plain wood with a veneer of the more valuable kinds of wood.  Therefore the individual, in my opinion, is doubly &ldquo;rooked,&rdquo; because he is paying an exorbitant price on the one hand and getting an inferior article on the other hand.  One solution for that is a form of licensing of firms for the carrying out of this particular type of business under which they would be subject to State-imposed conditions, and if these conditions were violated at any time they would be put out of business. This business is now getting to a serious stage and the main point is to ensure that the public will be protected. The other course would be to ensure that the purchaser would have the right to apply to the Prices Section of the Minister's Department to ascertain what is a fair profit so far as these people are concerned.  If the figure of 100 per cent. profit is correct, the House will agree that is exorbitant. It is obviously going to impose a burden on the purchasers which they cannot continue to bear.</P>
    <P>I understand also that some of these firms indulge in very objectionable practices which amount almost to intimidation so far as certain hirers are concerned.  If the hirer fails to make a series of payments, I understand it is not an uncommon practice to have a telegram sent to that individual stating that a van will call next day to collect the goods.  One can <Col N="2265" /> readily appreciate what the effect would be on people residing in certain localities if such a van arrived.  Their credit would be immediately ruined.  I am informed that such a practice is in operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a certain warranty so far as goods are concerned.  I think there is a slight flaw in that respect, because the Bill does not say who is to decide as between the owner and the hirer if there is a dispute regarding the quality of the goods. There is an extensive business being carried on by advertisement and some of these firms do a very big business in the country.  The Bill provides that it will be quite sufficient if the goods are selected from a catalogue.  The safest thing to do would be to have an inspection&mdash;as the Bill requires in one section &mdash;of the goods to ensure they are of the right quality but when taking it from an advertisement or a catalogue there is no safeguard as to what ultimately will be the type of goods the individual will receive.</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that this is a good Bill in certain respects.  It affords protection where it is very badly needed, but it could go much further and remove abuses associated with this particular business.  It is obvious that this business is growing at the present time.  As to whether it is good or bad for the community as a whole, I am not in a position to say.  I can imagine it would serve its purpose all right if you had on the one hand a reputable trader who would be satisfied with a reasonable margin of profit and on the other hand an individual in a position to assess his own commitments and obligations and, over and above all, his capacity to pay.  Unfortunately, the reverse obtains in a good many cases. This Bill will aim to protect the gullible public or, as the Minister says, the individuals who have to be protected from themselves.</P>
    <P>The centrepiece of my observations would rest around the question of the control of the existing prices of such firms, particularly those engaged in the manufacture of furniture.  If my figures are correct, I think the House will agree that those prices are exorbitant.</P>

      <P>My first comment, on reading the Bill and the notes that accompanied it, was: &ldquo;Better late than never.&rdquo;  I must congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this measure, which I must consider too long delayed.  Even in its present form, the Bill is a tremendous advance on much of the social legislation over a period of years.  Comment has been made frequently in the Press, from the pulpit and from various platforms regarding this traffic known as the hire-purchase system and the cruelties and hardships inflicted on very poor people&mdash;and even on people in moderate circumstances&mdash;on account of the methods by which the toll is collected from the hirers.  In some cases, it has been so abominable that I have wondered why some Government at some time had not taken the matter in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe in retrospective legislation and have registered my protest in this House and outside it against retrospective legislation, but I am just wondering if a case that has come under my notice in the past few weeks&mdash;since the objects of this measure reached the public through the Press&mdash;has caused something in the nature of a stampede amongst several of those people in the trade.  I received a letter within the last couple of weeks which tells of the wife of a soldier, serving in our national Army during the emergency, who bought a sewing-machine on the hire-purchase system on the 7th November, 1944.  She paid £1 down, according to the agreement, and £1 a month and had paid £9 in all on the machine, which was hired out to her for the sum of £17.  Thus, she had paid £1 more than one-half of the original price, for a second-hand sewing-machine.  Her husband became ill&mdash;and, as the Minister is aware, an Army man going sick has to suffer certain reductions in his pay&mdash;and during that period she fell into arrears with these instalments.  A member of the hiring firm visited her house, accompanied by a man with a hand truck.  He said he called for the usual instalments and she handed him 10/- on account. The other man went into one of the apartments and dismantled the <Col N="2267" /> machine.  He took the head off and carted it away.  The woman was told to call down to the office and she would be interviewed by the manager.  When she did so, the manager handed back the 10/- and told her he no longer had anything to say to her, as they had withdrawn the machine from hire.  She is thus at the loss of this £9.</P>
    <P>I know that such cases would be safeguarded under this Bill.  I said I did not believe in retrospective legislation, but if there could be a case made for it, this is one of the hundreds of cases.  No doubt, many such instances will be related during the debate on the Committee Stage of this measure and they may influence the Minister to yield in some respects to the case put up by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>I, too, may have some amendments to suggest, and from what I know and from what I feel is manifested particularly in this measure, I believe the Minister will give due consideration to any suggestions made by way of amendment. If he is not able to accept the amendments as printed, probably he will go some way to meet the opinions of those Deputies who are in a position, through their daily contact with the people, to give him examples of the hardships that occur.  I know that the Minister, through his officials and through members of his Party, has also such information.  I feel certain that many Deputies like Deputy O'Sullivan and myself will have something to say on the Committee Stage, when perhaps the Minister will hear of other cases worse in their details than the one I have just related.  I am very pleased indeed that the Minister has introduced this legislation.  As I say, it is better late than never.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When a Bill of this kind for which there is general approval is introduced here, there are almost invariably demands that it should go much further than it does.  Personally, I would be inclined to be rather cautions about urging the Minister to extend the Bill much beyond its present provisions.  It would be better to see how it operates and, if we find it does not cover all the cases of hardship, it might be amended in a year or <Col N="2268" /> two.  This Bill is a complete innovation so far as this country is concerned and it will require some study, to see how it will operate and particularly to see whether there is any method by which its provisions can be evaded.  That is the most important consideration, as I am sure no Deputy would like to see a coach and four driven through any of the Bill's provisions.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to know if the Bill applies to firms which finance credit purchase of machinery and implements, such as motors, lorries, tractors and so on.  There are financial firms which do not actually sell the goods but which provide the necessary finance for hire-purchase arrangements.  As far as I know, there have not been very many or very serious complaints in regard to the operations of such firms.</P>
      <P>In many cases, as Deputy Blowick pointed out, their operations have been beneficial to certain people.  I, personally, have known men who purchased tractors, threshing sets, lorries and other farm and agricultural machinery through such firms, and who have made good as a result of these transactions, completely clearing off the entire debt out of profits made with the machinery.  I think that such firms can discharge a useful and beneficial function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In advocating the raising of the limit to £100 it would be well to consider whether the raising of the limit might not have the effect of preventing such firms from carrying on a business which is beneficial.  It has been said by various Deputies that this is a good Bill and that, therefore, it should not, even if the limit is raised or if there is no limit at all, affect anybody who wishes to carry on business in a proper way, but we all know that regulations are irksome and if a private firm is carrying on a type of business which is beneficial to the public and which is not an injury or a hardship to anyone, it is undesirable to limit its operations by regulations. As a matter of fact, State regulations should be applied only when they are necessary.  On the other hand, while I see that it might be desirable to have some limit such as is provided in the Bill, it might be, perhaps, raised somewhat and I think that in the initial stages of the Bill's <Col N="2269" /> operations, there should be some limit. There is a tendency at the present time, if I may say so, to molly-coddle the citizen in every possible way and to take the view that the ordinary citizen is incapable of managing his own business.  I think that is a tendency that should not be encouraged. I think the State and the Government in the past few years have been too much inclined to take the view that citizens are incapable of doing their own business.  There are, of course, evils which must be guarded against, and I think this Bill makes a reasonable attempt to guard against them. For that reason I recommend it to the House.  There may be some minor amendments required but certainly the Bill should be carefully studied in the Committee Stage to see if there are any loopholes by which its provisions can be evaded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coogan said that this Bill bears a close similarity to the British Hire Purchase Act of 1938.  That is correct.  The Bill differs from the British Act only in certain details of scope and phraseology.  The recommendation made by the interDepartmental Committee, which examined this question, was that legislation similar to the British legislation should be enacted here.  In the framing of this Bill, we had the great advantage of reports on the operations of the legislation in Great Britain and, I may say also, the advice of people who were familiar with the operations of the British Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it desirable that we should not experiment too freely in this field. One cannot accurately forecast the effects of legislation of this kind, and it is necessary to keep in mind in that regard that provisions which might unduly restrict the operation of hire-purchase arrangements might have serious economic consequences.  Some abuses there have been in the hire-purchase system but, on the whole, the system has been beneficial to the people and the imposition of undue restrictions or the taking of unreasonable powers of supervision may tend to kill it with serious repercussions, not merely on the country's trade and commerce, but upon the facilities <Col N="2270" /> available to people in the lower walks of life.  The investigation made by our committee showed that there was very little evidence of abuse of the hire-purchase system in this country. We knew from reports published by other Governments that abuses had developed elsewhere, and it was reasonable to assume that similar abuses might appear here.  It was decided, therefore, to introduce legislation in advance of the appearance of these abuses rather than wait until the need for legislation became more obvious.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the operation of the hire-purchase system has been beneficial. It is carried on in the main by reputable firms who would not resort to undesirable practices.  I should say that it is likely that a very high proportion of the total number of bicycles sold in this country are sold through hire-purchase arrangements. A large number of people are able to obtain bicycles, because of the existence of hire-purchase facilities, who could not otherwise accumulate the purchase price.  The same might be said of wireless sets.  Many people have been able to raise their standard of living by reason of the development of this method of trading.  We should not unnecessarily impose restrictions on it which might unduly check it, unless it is clear that these restrictions are necessary to eliminate real abuses.</P>
    <P>Deputies have urged that the limit fixed by this Bill on the value of goods to which it applies should be raised and that further powers of control should be taken.  Deputy Coogan suggested that we should have powers of inspection of trading establishments where hire-purchase transactions are entered into.  Deputy O'Sullivan went further and asked that we should have power to license traders engaged in this form of business and to avail of that power to withdraw such licences and put such traders out of business when evidence becomes available that abuses have taken place.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies before putting down amendments of that character in Committee to consider the point of view expressed by Deputy Cogan.  That point of view has, I think, tended to <Col N="2271" /> be obscured in the discussion by emphasis on the possibility of abuses.  I notice that very many Deputies, while expressing themselves as being perturbed at the general extension of the State's powers of supervision and control of industrial and commercial activities, still urge a further extension of the State's control and supervision in specific instances.  The particular point of view that I want the House to consider is whether it is desirable that the State should go further than is proposed in this Bill in supervising, controlling and restricting this form of business.</P>
    <P>We were doing something here which runs contrary to the main stream of established practice.  In the past the State's attitude towards commercial agreements freely entered into by citizens has been merely passive and confined to providing safeguards against fraud.  Our whole legal system affecting commercial transactions is based on the principle that the buyer of goods must protect himself.  Deputy Coogan will remember the Latin phrase <i>caveat emptor,</i> let the buyer beware. Ordinarily the State could take the position that people buying goods under hire-purchase agreements or any other method must protect themselves, see that they get good value for their money, and that they do not enter into agreements which are unfavourable to them.  We decided we could depart from the principle of <i>caveat emptor</i> in respect of classes of persons who, experience has shown, will not always, under hire-purchase agreements, protect themselves.  How far should we go in that regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but the Deputy, for instance, can go into a bank and borrow money and the State does not interfere.  If he makes a mistake in relation to the amount he borrows, or in relation to the amount of interest he must pay, that is his own business.  A person may buy a motor car or a threshing set or a house under a hire-purchase or a credit purchase agreement.  It is his business to see <Col N="2272" /> that he makes a good bargain, that he knows all about his obligation, and that he is not entering into commitments that he will not be able to meet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is discussing quite a different matter.  I think he should let me proceed to discuss hire-purchase agreements.  Investigation has shown that certain classes of persons do not, in fact, take measures to protect themselves, and hire-purchase agreements and credit-sale agreements have been entered into which are unfair to the buyer of the goods and of which the buyer of the goods is not fully aware until an agreement is operated against him.  For that class of person it is reasonable for the State to enact protective legislation. That was what was done in relation to money lending; that is what is being done here.  But, when we go beyond that class and consider the man buying a motor lorry costing £500, £600 or £700, or a man buying a house or a threshing set, is it not reasonable to expect that such a man will carefully read the agreement he signs, or will get legal advice if he requires it, and protect his own interest? Is it necessary that the State should extend the sphere of its operations to cast its protection over transactions of that kind or take any power of supervision or impose restrictions of the type which this Bill proposes to put into force in relation to smaller scale transactions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can discuss these matters fully in Committee if amendments are put down, but I ask Deputies to consider that point of view.  While a case can be made for putting upon the State the obligation to eliminate abuses of all kinds and protect persons against the possibility of making mistakes which are detrimental to their interests, there is another point of view which should not be lost sight of, and that is, that ordinarily it is desirable that citizens should protect themselves in commercial transactions into which they enter voluntarily and that the State should not intervene in such <Col N="2273" /> transactions unless there is good reason for it.  We think there is good reason for the State imposing those restrictions in respect of hire-purchase agreements for the sale of goods of limited value to persons concerned with such purchases.  We do not think there is a similar case for imposing these restrictions upon sales of property or goods of much higher valuation, where the people concerned are well able, or should be well able, to protect themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan asked if the measure relates to goods such as gas cookers hired by gas companies.  It does not. This Bill relates only to goods sold either on hire-purchase agreements or credit-sale agreements.  If a gas company hires a gas cooker, there is no sale.  In fact, the practice has grown up of hiring wireless sets.  A person gets a wireless set and pays half a crown a week hirage.  At no time is it his property.  It remains the property of the firm which hires it to him.  I do not think there is any abuse in relation to transactions of that kind.  The type of abuse with which this Bill is concerned cannot arise.  The person gets the wireless set, pays half a crown and can terminate the agreement any time he likes.  He is under no continuing commitment.</P>
    <P>I am not aware there is any evidence which would justify an action by the State to control transactions of that nature.  The answer to Deputy Coogan's question is that this Bill does not apply to hirage contracts of that kind.  It applies only to sales, whether hire-purchase transactions or ordinary credit-sale arrangements.</P>
    <P>The provision in relation to the District Court certainly is not intended to make it possible for the transfer of cases to the Dublin District Court.  It is intended to give every District Court jurisdiction in cases of this kind where the value of the goods is £25 or less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <P>I do not think that is necessary.  I feel sure there are rules of court which regulate matters of that <Col N="2274" /> character, and I doubt if it is possible for a party to a transaction in Donegal to take proceedings arising out of that transaction in the Dublin District Court area.  I would not like to express an opinion on that matter because I do not profess to be familiar with the rules of court, but the only purpose of the section in the Bill is to give the District Courts throughout the country the same jurisdiction in relation to these transactions as the Dublin District Courts now have.</P>

      <P>The present situation is that the District Courts outside Dublin could not deal with these cases.  We are extending their jurisdiction and the new procedure will help to keep down any legal costs that may arise.  Deputy Martin O'Sullivan queried the provision which requires the payment of half the purchase price on the termination of the contract by the hirer.  I think that provision is reasonable. We must take into account not merely the interest of the hirer of the goods but also the interest of the seller of the goods.  When the seller has parted with the goods to the hirer he is not merely taking the risk of loss on the transaction; he is also depriving himself of the possibility of selling these goods to somebody else.  I do not think it is unreasonable to require that the hirer, if he desires to terminate the transaction, should be under obligation to pay to the seller half the purchase price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the provision in the British legislation.  I feel that on merit the provision is sound.  Hire-purchase arrangements are made in relation to various classes of goods.  It has frequently been said that a new motor car loses one-third of its value when the buyer drives it home.  The mere fact that it has been sold and used on one occasion by the buyer reduces its resale value.  The same is possibly true of wireless sets, vacuum cleaners and other commodities.  It certainly would be true of the volumes of books, histories and so forth, which were the <Col N="2275" /> commodities mainly concerned with hire-purchase agreements when this system of trading began to develop, and it is not an unreasonable protection for the seller to oblige the hirer to keep his contract or suffer the loss of half the purchase price if he desires to terminate the contract before that amount has been paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony referred to the cruelty and hardship that has been inflicted under the hire-purchase system but he will, I am sure, agree with me, that many advantages have been conferred, and that we should not allow legislation to go further than the minimum extent necessary to prevent the possibility of abuse, while facilitating the transaction of business on that basis which helps many people.  The Bill is not one which will be contested in principle in the Dáil.  Most of the matters raised in the discussion can be raised again, and no doubt will be raised in Committee, when we can consider them more fully.  I conclude by urging Deputies, when considering amendments to the Bill, not to proceed along the lines of extending its scope or powers of the State to interfere in transactions of this kind.  I think it is a good rule to confine the restrictions suggested by the Bill, and the power of supervision over such transactions by the Government, to the narrowest limit necessary to prevent the possibility of abuse.</P>

      <P>I understand that we are to be heard more widely throughout the world as a result of proposals that the Minister has put before the House, and that he has actually taken steps to put into operation. If we are going to be heard more widely throughout the world I think we ought to be heard by the kind of voice that we have so common in Ireland, and that is so pleasant to hear.  It may be on the street, in the country, going up an Irish hill or along a river that voices that are delightful <Col N="2277" /> to hear and that refresh the spirits are heard.  Many of the most attractive voices can be heard in every corner of the country but we do not seem to be able to get them on the radio.  I ask the Minister, now that we are going to be heard more widely, if some more serious effort than was made in the past could be made to get types of Irish voices, both male and female, that we have, and that ought to be heard from Radio Éireann.  I do not know anything that would add more to the prestige of our broadcasting than to have heard over it the kind of delightful Irish voices, of men and women, that we never hear except on isolated occasions from the Irish broadcasting station.  The second point I wish to refer to concerns the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Gaelic League.  Would it not be nearly time that in Irish announcements from the Irish broadcasting station we would be able to get somebody who could say, with the proper Irish enunciation, &ldquo;Radio Éireann&rdquo;, because we have not got it yet?  Until &ldquo;Radio Éireann&rdquo; is properly pronounced from our Dublin broadcasting station I think we ought to call it something else.  We ought to be able to find somebody who is able to pronounce these words as an Irish speaker would properly pronounce them, now that we have celebrated the anniversary of the founding of the Gaelic League.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so much concerned about the pronunciation of &ldquo;Radio Éireann&rdquo;.  I think very few people in the country are concerned about it, and that it should be debunked long ago.  I am concerned with more material things, and particularly with broadcasting as it affects Cork and district.  An impression is abroad that it is the intention of the Minister to close down the Cork station.  Is it not true that in the last few months there was a staff revision of the three sections, namely, Athlone, Dublin and Cork?  Is it not also true to say that all the skilled workmen in Dublin have been up-graded from Class 2 to Class 1, but that an exception was made in Cork, as none of the skilled workmen there was up-graded? I have to ask why?  They possess equal skill, but they have not <Col N="2278" /> been up-graded in the same way as their fellows in Athlone and Dublin.</P>
      <P>This is one of the questions which I am sure the Minister will find it rather difficult to explain, although he may answer.  We are told that the only reason which operated in making this distinction or this difference was that the duties of the officials or operators in Dublin were more onerous than the duties performed in Cork.  That is not correct, because the work is of a similar character, demanding the same kind of experience and training.  The original staff in the Cork station comprised one director, one engineer and four operators.  That staff now consists of one supervisor and four operators. Again, I have to ask why?  Why differentiate?  The operators in Dublin and Athlone have a higher rank than those in Cork, and my statement on this whole matter could be summarised in four or five whys.  I want to know why these things have taken place and why the operators of the system in Cork have been discriminated so unfairly against.  So far as I know, no logical explanation has been given to these operators in Cork and they are rather anxious to know how they stand in the matter.</P>
      <P>Another practice which has grown up is that of sending operators from Dublin to Cork on the occasion of certain broadcasts.  They have been sent down to Mallow and to Cork, and that one item alone would account for some at least of the increased expenditure. I have indicated that there is no necessity for that discrimination, because the men who operate the system in Cork are just as highly skilled and just as highly efficient as any operators in Athlone and Dublin. There is undoubtedly a feeling in Cork that the Department is prejudiced in some way against the staff in Cork.  I have no doubt whatever that the Minister would not be guilty of any such prejudice &mdash; I know him too well to attribute anything of that character to him &mdash; but it demands some sort of inquiry, and, the sooner that inquiry is established, the better for all parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It brings home the lesson to me that a system like that would not be <Col N="2279" /> tolerated in any business concern I know of, and it makes one very suspicious of State interference in matters of this kind.  This should be a kind of business undertaking, and no business undertaking that I know of would dream of bringing a number of men from Dublin to Cork to perform an operation which could be performed just as well on the spot by the members of the Cork staff.  I know that in other Departments of Government such things have taken place, even resulting in staffs being made redundant, but that is another matter which is not related to this Vote.</P>
    <P>I hope the position I speak of will be inquired into, with a view to having it remedied as soon as possible. Above all, I am particularly interested in the reason for this discrimination, not so much in relation to the personal matter of the staff as in relation to the broad general principle of good, clean and decent administration.  I think the House is entitled to know why it is that these highly skilled men&mdash;men who are as highly skilled as the men in Dublin&mdash;should be discriminated against, as they have been in the way to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the matter of broadcasting, I have a considerable amount of sympathy with the Minister and with the directors of Radio Eireann, because it is very difficult always to know what the public want.  It is an entirely different kind of service from that provided by the Press.  A newspaper proprietor can judge the feelings of his readers by the sales of his paper.  In respect of broadcasting, there is no such guide, because, once a person purchases a receiving set, he is not compelled to listen to a particular station.  He can listen to any station he likes and the fact that the number of people with wireless licences tends to increase does not indicate that the service provided by our Department is popular.  The fact that broadcasting is a completely different service from anything else we know is, I have always felt, a source of confusion and tends to mislead those who control broadcasting in relation to entertainment or education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2280" /> The Minister may feel that, because so many people are licence holders, broadcasting commands a very wide and far-reaching influence over the feelings and opinions of our people, and he may be inclined to exaggerate the importance of the service on the basis of the large number of licence holders in the country.  But the Minister has to bear this fact in mind, as we also have to bear it in mind, that broadcasting does not exert the same influence over the minds of the people as, for example, the Press, or even the cinema.  The receiving-set is introduced into a number of homes, but it does not hold the centre of the stage. In the ordinary home, it is just a sideshow. The main interests in any family are the ordinary family interests, the ordinary conversations, the ordinary household duties and so on, and the radio is more or less an intrusion into, or interruption of, the family life of our people.  It cannot be said to command such an influence as one might be inclined to assume it does command, in the light of the number of licence holders in the country.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said to command such an influence as one might be inclined to assume it does.  The number of licence holders throughout the country cannot be taken as an indication of the influence it might be said to command. If the Minister wished to estimate and calculate the place which broadcasting holds he would first have to disguise himself as a very ordinary citizen in order to go into the ordinary homes and find out for himself to what extent the programmes which he provides are being listened to, and the amount of interest taken in them.  If he were to do that I am afraid that he would be bitterly disappointed.  I am not saying that the programmes which are provided by foreign stations are more widely availed of.  I am merely pointing out that the people do not turn on the radio to the extent some people appear to imagine.  It is, as I say, very difficult in the ordinary normal household to &ldquo;listen in.&rdquo;  In the ordinary family where there are children&mdash;as there ought to be&mdash;there are considerable distractions.  Children have got to do their school home-work and they have got to carry on the ordinary conversation <Col N="2281" /> which is both desirable and necessary in any family; and the radio must be turned off at such times.  We are, I think, rather inclined to exaggerate and overrate the importance of broadcasting to the community in general.  It does not compare in any way with the influence wielded by the cinema although the cinema does not enter into every home.  When people go to the cinema they go prepared to enjoy whatever programme is being provided for them.  The entertainment is completely in the hands of the gentlemen in Hollywood and elsewhere and the cinema patrons devote their entire attention to the programme provided. It is not the same with broadcasting. The artist, who is seeking to entertain the community through the medium of broadcasting, has a very, very difficult task in his endeavour to hold the interest of the ordinary people.  That is why I say that those who are preparing our programmes should bear in mind the difficulties with which they have to contend and the obstacles that they must overcome in order to capture and hold the interests of their listeners.</P>
    <P>For that reason I hold that it is absolutely essential that we should provide lighter programmes than those usually provided by Radio Éireann.  We should provide more comedy and more humour in order to catch and hold the attention of the ordinary listener.  The heavy educational programme is invariably turned off; so too, to a very great extent in the average home, is the high-class classical music; so too, to a great extent is the major portion of the Gaelic programme.  I would suggest&mdash;I know that I shall be severely censured and probably severely criticised for making this suggestion&mdash;that there be less music in our programmes, less Gaelic, and less of the heavier type of educational programme.  I would suggest there should be more drama, more good singing, and more light comedy. I think drama plays a very important part in broadcasting.  Plays are an enormous source of attraction.  They hold an audience.  They are listened to. They make a much better impression than a long and heavy lecture or a talk.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would like to <Col N="2282" /> say that I think very useful work is being done in the matter of historical plays and drama.  I think such historical plays have a very good effect from the educational point of view.  At the same time they are a source of entertainment and they can be listened to with interest.  They help to educate and to cultivate an interest in the history of our nation, and to bring before the lives of the ordinary people the outstanding personalities in the history of our country.  In regard to singing, I think it is high time that those who are employed or who volunteer their services should learn to sing distinctly and to enunciate the words of any song which they are singing.  We all know the remarkable popularity enjoyed by the late Count John McCormack&mdash;a world-wide popularity.  That was due not only to the high quality of his art, not only to the depth of feeling with which he sang, but also to the excellence of his diction which enabled the listener whether he was listening to a gramophone record or to the radio to follow precisely the words of any song sung by the late Count John McCormack. Now it is almost impossible to follow the words of nine out of ten of the singers who sing on Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I think that is due to a great extent to carelessness.  It is a thing which could be avoided.  In regard to speaking over the radio it is of course essential that those who speak should have some technical training both in voice production and in the use of the microphone. I know myself that it is exceedingly painful to listen to broadcasters from Radio Éireann.  One would imagine in many cases that they had rammed the microphone down their throats.  Not only can you hear the words they speak so sibilantly and harshly, but you can also hear the sound of their lungs and the beating of their hearts and other internal organs.  This might be very interesting to the listener if he happened to be a medical doctor who might be interested in such things.  I think that this is a matter which requires a little expert technical advice.  Now, I was listening to the radio last Sunday night and I heard an appeal made by Deputy Dockrell.  I was very favourably impressed by the manner in which his <Col N="2283" /> address came across the radio.  As a matter of fact, it was much better than many of those who habitually broadcast from Radio Éireann.  It may be perhaps that some people have what is known as a broadcasting voice and others have not.  That may be.  But surely that is a matter in which there could be, with advantage, some improvement.</P>
    <P>I think the people connected with broadcasting from Radio Éireann have completely lost a sense of humour, or else they feel that the Irish people have lost their sense of humour.  They would seem to believe that anything that is not deadly serious, that is not of the type of information contained in circulars sent out by the Civil Service, is sacrilegious and should not be broadcast. People who work, who lead strenuous lives, like a little light entertainment and they expect it from the radio, and it should not be difficult to provide it for them.  We all know that generally the Irish people have a highly developed sense of humour.  If a group of people meet in the evening at a farmhouse or at the chapel gate on Sunday they are able to provide plenty of hearty laughter for themselves.  There is no reason why Radio Éireann should not be able to provide light entertainment for the community.</P>
    <P>It appears to be more or less an obsession of Radio Éireann that they must not offend any of their listeners, and I think that tends to cramp their style.  A little contention or healthy controversy would be welcome.  Contentious arguments or discussions on vital topics would be enjoyed by listeners.  The newspapers invite their readers to use the correspondence columns for the purpose of argument and controversy in order to excite interest. The same should apply to broadcasting.  People like listening to arguments for and against any particular proposition, and they like hard-hitting. It tends to arouse healthy interest, always provided that the scale is fairly held between the contestants. There should be a fair chance for the expression of every point of view and the contestants should be allowed to state their cases fairly and fully without <Col N="2284" /> favouritism being shown for one side as against another.  That applies to every type of argument&mdash;political or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have a complaint to make.  I have listened to and I have been deeply impressed by the annual programmes commemorating Easter Week.  They are always excellent and very impressive. That programme is official in the sense that Radio Eireann stands over it.  It is in the same position as, say, an editorial.  Therefore, I suppose, we can hold Radio Éireann responsible for it.  There is a mistake made practically every year that in the desire to impress listeners as to the immensity of the achievements of the leaders of Easter Week, there is always a tendency to discourage other political leaders and particularly those who immediately preceded the Republican leaders of Easter Week.  That is undesirable.  Nothing is added to the honour or glory of the men of Easter Week by discrediting those who preceded them.  It is not necessary because those who took part in that great movement stand so high that their status need not be enhanced by lowering the status of the Parliamentary Party which preceded them. Frequently on Radio Eireann and practically every year we hear it announced that the country, politically, was sunk into a condition of corruption and depravity from which only the Rising of Easter Week could have raised it.  Nobody will accept that.  It will be accepted that, whether those who were the leaders of the national movement prior to Easter Week were wrong or right, they certainly were men who, at least, compare favourably with political Parties of the present day, and even with the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is necessary in a matter of this kind to hold the balance fairly.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty in seeking to portray historical events which are within living memory.  There is a tendency to be prejudiced and biased.  It is difficult to hold the scales as fairly as they might be held in relation to matters of more ancient history.  I entirely agree with the policy of <Col N="2285" /> publicising and paying tribute to those engaged in important national events and of bringing to the notice of listeners outstanding national personalities. That is a very important function.  I believe it can be provided more adequately by drama and by plays than in any other way.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Minister the few suggestions which I have made, namely, that we should get clearer and better speaking in talks and other broadcasts, clearer and better singing and more and better plays.  It is difficult, I admit, for a service such as Radio Eireann, catering for an audience which is invisible, to give perhaps the type of entertainment which is required. The audience contributes a great deal. It assists the actor and also, I suppose, the producer and perhaps the author. For the purpose of broadcasting, the audience is invisible as far as the producer and the artists are concerned and that is a disadvantage.  It was a pity that when wireless broadcasting was introduced radio sets were not invented so large that only one could be provided in each parish.  If that had happened, you would have got much better services, much better programmes, and much more appreciative audiences, because if people had to pay to go into a hall to listen they would insist on good programmes and, by their active interest, they would ensure that good programmes would be provided.  Unfortunately, broadcasting has been introduced as a kind of service which interrupts the ordinary life of the family and in that way it does not command the position of power and influence which it would otherwise command.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a proposal to provide a new short wave station.  I was wondering what particular function that station will perform.  Will it be used mainly or exclusively for sponsored programmes, or will the programmes be similar to those already provided from Athlone?  I feel that it might not be undesirable to extend the sponsored programmes if facilities are provided, because at least there would be an opportunity for the listener to compare what the private firm can provide in the way of entertainment <Col N="2286" /> as against that officially provided by a Government Department. As a result of the competition between the two, it might be possible to improve both.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite Deputy Cogan's strictures, I must say, as one who listens pretty frequently to our own station, that on the whole, bearing all the circumstances in mind, it does its work reasonably well.  As has been said in previous debates here, the main trouble is the lack of money to bring the station to the pitch to which we should all like to see it brought.  Until there is plenty of money expended on the station it cannot compare as favourably as we would like with stations across the water or on the Continent. A move in that direction is being made in the Estimates this year by provision of a certain amount for a short wave station.</P>
      <P>I should like to make one criticism. I may be alone in my view, but I wish to express it.  A short time ago I saw a news paragraph indicating that it was to be the policy of Radio Eireann to extend its sponsored programmes, apparently for revenue purposes.  I take the view that individuals like manufacturers of certain products who want to use the radio have another well-known and recognised medium of advertising, namely, the newspapers. I suggest that the Minister should not be putting himself in competition with the newspapers which employ large staffs at decent wages, so far as I know.  An individual putting over such a programme has to blare out the value of the product concerned and one has of necessity to listen to that portion of the programme.  In my opinion, it destroys the value of the programme as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make one exception to that, and that is the sponsored programme of the Hospitals' Trust.  The Hospitals' Trust is associated with a national undertaking. My experience is that its programmes are exceptionally well prepared and exceedingly well put over. They are very pleasant and very acceptable as a whole.  I make that one exception.  I hope, however, that the Minister will not bring our station down to the standard of certain Continental <Col N="2287" /> stations before the war which did not stand very high in the estimation of people interested in broadcasting.</P>

      <P>When I came into the Chamber I heard Deputy Anthony criticising something in connection with Cork.  I do not know exactly what it was.  Perhaps it was in connection with an item on the Estimate which I might also mention.  For some years there was a pretty good row going on with regard to the remuneration of the news staff of Radio Éireann.  I thought that the matter was satisfactorily adjusted.  I am not quite clear from the figures before me whether the salaries attaching to the reporting staff are acceptable to the National Union of Journalists.  I am, however, intrigued to know what is meant by the item in the Estimates with regard to a news correspondent at 90/- a week and another item with regard to an individual in Cork doing similar work for 30/- a week.  I do not know if that is what Deputy Anthony was referring to.  It struck me as strange that there should be such a provision under these categories in Dublin and in Cork with such a striking disparity between the figures.</P>
      <P>There are other figures running through the Estimate which have the old bad mentality of the Post Office so far as wages and salaries are concerned. We shall have more to say about that on the Minister's Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It is time that that mentality was left behind and that a high standard was set so far as the broadcasting station is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Estimate, but when I hear Deputy Cogan advocating sponsored programmes, I want to protest against sponsored programmes, the Bird's Custard programme and everything else, which lower the level and the dignity of our national broadcasting service.  I hope the Minister will give some attention to that.  Surely it is time to cut out these and to show that we have some dignity and culture <Col N="2288" /> in this country.  I do not want to compare our station with any other station. I think we ought not to do that.</P>
      <P>We do not want any highbrow stuff here.  We want to cater for our own people who have simple tastes and possibly right tastes because they are simple.  We ought to cater for them. On the whole, I think our station is doing pretty well.  Some improvements could be made and I am sure will be made; but I think we ought to give credit where credit is due.  For instance, I think the dramatic productions are excellent and very entertaining. The musical recitals are reasonably good.  But, so far as discussions and talks are concerned, there could be a considerable improvement, particularly in regard to agricultural matters in a country like this where we want a lot of technical information. A considerable amount of useful education work could be done in that respect.  Mr. G. O. Sherrard, who broadcasts on horticulture, is excellent and very interesting; he has a very fine voice and I think a lot of people interested in gardening listen-in to his broadcasts.  I am merely giving that as an example of what could and should be done.  We should take the same line in agriculture and should get experts of his type.  In the past we have had interesting discussions between farmers which were very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the technical side, we should get recognised authorities.  I listened recently to some talks on agriculture by individuals who gave their own experience, telling of their failures and successes.  That is not very interesting, as no one cares a button about the success or failure of individual farmers. It is information we are looking for generally all over the country.  The farmer who comes home from his work tired out, and sits down in a decent chair, is maybe too tired to read, but he may listen very patiently to what is being said over the wireless.  For that reason, the radio could be used culturally and educationally to great advantage.  I believe Radio Éireann is doing fairly well.  I am looking for further improvements, however, and I end by saying again that the Bird's Custard programmes should be cut out, <Col N="2289" /> so as to maintain the level and dignity of a broadcasting service of which we can be proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend subscribing to this debate, but I was in the House during portion of Deputy Cogan's speech and I find myself in thorough disagreement with Deputy Hughes.  I believe that, while Radio Éireann has improved from what it was, it is a long way from receiving the complete approval of the ordinary citizen.  I think that Radio Éireann is the best part of the time closed down. It opens at 1 o'clock in the day.  Why should the station not open at 9 o'clock and provide breakfast-time music? My experience in knocking around and listening to comments by people on Radio Éireann is that they are totally disgusted with the whole plan of broadcasting.  Many of them say they are paying a licence fee of 12/6 and have to have recourse to the B.B.C. programmes most of the time. Personally, I very seldom find time to sit down and enjoy the Radio Éireann entertainment, but when I do, the only programmes that interest me are the sponsored programmes of Hospitals Trust and the racing commentary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Hughes' comment about the sponsored programmes. Many merchants and manufacturers like to advertise and sponsor their products and that is what the people want, in my opinion.  The principal part of the programme enjoyed by the vast majority of our citizens is the Irish Hospitals Trust programmes.  It is the best feature of Radio Éireann, and I was very pleased to see it was extended recently in length of time.  It is a part of the programme which provides very varied entertainment for all listeners.  Question Time has been a great feature of Radio Éireann and a most popular one, and it is educational.  If we had more artists like Joe Linnane and others who have a very popular name, more entertainment would be provided for the listeners.  Some arrangement should be made with the G.A.A., whereby all the Leinster, Munster and Connaught finals would be broadcast. I thought that, during the transport <Col N="2290" /> difficulties, those Provincial Finals would have been put on the air.  I hope some arrangements will be made in the future to have the G.A.A. championship matches for each province broadcast.  All fans of Gaelic games are interested in them as well as in the All-Ireland Finals, and the supporters of the game should be assisted in following the finals in each province.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan stated it would be better to have arrangements made whereby there would be only one wireless in each parish.  I do not know how that would work out.  For instance, I would not like my house to be the one where the parish radio would be kept. I wonder if Deputy Cogan can suggest whether the wireless should be in the local hall, in the parish priest's house or in the local publichouse. Wherever it might be, I do not think the idea would work; at any rate, it would bring in very little revenue.  I agree with Deputy Hughes that there should be more discussions and debates, especially on agriculture. There were farming talks some time ago by Mr. J. J. Bergin of Athy, I think.  It is surprising the number of farmers in most remote parts of the country who look forward to securing advice and education from those talks.</P>
    <P>The programme has been improved very considerably, but it has still a long way to go.  We could do with a lot more sponsored programmes, additional talks and discussions and less high-brow music, and more of the latest modern songs.  That would provide listeners with the type of entertainment they believe they are entitled to from Radio Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. B. Corish Mr. B. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the value of the wireless in general should not be under-estimated, as Deputy Cogan seems to under-estimate it.  Most people are agreed that the radio has become part and parcel of the people and of the home.  It is quite natural for every single person, as soon as he comes home to lunch or tea, to turn on the wireless, whether he listens or not. It has become a habit.  In that respect, Radio Éireann, as our Irish broadcasting service, has certainly contributed in no small measure to the <Col N="2291" /> entertainment which wireless does provide.  I consider that Radio Éireann is one of the few broadcasting stations in the world where there is a real effort made to disseminate culture not alone to Europe but to the whole world.  I can quite see Deputy Flanagan's point and Deputy Hughes's point when they talk about sponsored programmes and Bird's Custard and to my mind therein lies the snag.</P>
      <P>People who sponsor the Bird's Custard programme evidently know how to present what I might term musical shows to the people.  It is unfortunate that we must depend on these industrial firms or manufacturers for the type of shows which the people want.  My suggestion to the Minister would be that if the broadcasting officials could present shows like those of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes or could present programmes in the same manner, utilising the same type of music, there would be no objection from any Deputy here as to the type of productions at the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan urged, and I think Deputy Flanagan supported him, that we should get away from highbrow stuff, but God forbid that we should ever descend to the same kind of variety and humour or the canned jazz music that we sometimes get from the B.B.C. and other stations.  That is the reason that I suggest that Radio Éireann can serve a useful function in preserving some sort of culture in Ireland. Deputy Cogan looks for less of the Irish language in broadcasts.  I think it is only fair to admit that the type of encouragement given to the Irish language by wireless broadcasts is one of the easiest and most acceptable types of encouragement that the language can get.  Possibly Deputy Cogan does not like the Irish language to be stuffed down the people's throats but I suggest to him and to every other Deputy, that it is only by such subtle methods of propaganda as broadcasting can provide that the Irish language has any chance of surviving.  It may not be possible to force the language down people's throats but if one is sitting at his tea or lunch, whilst a broadcast in the language is in progress, one unconsciously <Col N="2292" /> seems gradually to pick up the language by learning a word or two every day.</P>
    <P>Radio Éireann does give us many good programmes and I think one of the most notable features of broadcasting in Ireland is the lunch time gramophone concerts.  In these concerts you get items of various types.  You get classical music, semi-classical music, and sometimes we go down to Bing Crosby and Big Bill Campbell.  Country Deputies are usually concerned with matters of this kind, in so far as they affect their own constituencies and I would appeal to the Minister, speaking on behalf of my own constituency, but particularly on behalf of the town of Wexford, that the gramophone concerts should start not later than 12.30 p.m.  Many people in Wexford, Enniscorthy and Gorey are engaged in foundries and workshops. They go home to lunch at 12.30 and they arrive at their houses about 12.35 or 12.40.</P>
    <P>They may have to leave their houses at a quarter past one and consequently they have only a quarter of an hour to listen to what is a very admirable programme provided by the lunch-time concerts.  On the other hand, very few working-class people who are out from work during the day, listen to Radio Éireann from 2 to 2.30.  I think it would be to the advantage of the people in general if the lunch-time gramophone concerts were scheduled to start half an hour earlier.</P>
    <P>As a country Deputy, I should also like to appeal to the Minister to employ more country artists.  I am not suggesting that the officials in Radio Éireann are all Dublin people but they are people who possess what I might call a city mentality and they are more or less inclined to frown sarcastically on the efforts of people who possess any type of talent, down the country. Let me assure them that in provincial towns there are musicians, actors and elocutionists who are capable of providing as good, if not a better programme, than many of the artists employed in Dublin.  I know there is the difficulty of travelling and that the question of expense is involved, but I think that in order to encourage the use of wireless and to <Col N="2293" /> induce our people in the country to take a greater interest in the programmes, country artists should be encouraged to make their services available to Radio Éireann by paying them suitable fees and expenses to enable them to travel and to derive some small profit from their contributions.</P>
    <P>Once again I should like to congratulate the Minister on his efforts to make broadcasting accessible to the people of the whole country.  The late Deputy for County Wexford had occasion to complain repeatedly of reception in the town of Wexford.  The Minister met him on several occasions and sent some of his technicians down there.  I can assure him now that reception in Wexford from Radio Éireann is at least as good as that from any of the British broadcasting stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that the Minister is thinking of having a new short wave station erected.  That is a very important project, particularly as far as people outside the State are concerned, who are desirous of listening to Irish programmes.  In the past they never had any comfort or satisfaction because reception was very bad.  It is to be hoped that this short wave station will remove all cause of complaint on that score and that on occasions like Saint Patrick's Day, Christmas and other important festivals they will be able to listen-in to the programmes from their own country and to hear whoever is speaking on behalf of the Government or the people of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadcasting is very important in so far as it contacts a number of people inside and outside the State and enables us to convey to people, who do not read of activities here, news of interest.  I think that when this new station is erected we should have a special programme for Irish people living outside the country and even a special programme for those who are cut away from us by the unnecessary and artificial Border.  I have urged before that the radio should be used for the purpose of bringing home to the people outside this State the position of this country, the fact that there exists this unnatural Border and that <Col N="2294" /> the Irish people desire to have it abolished.  The radio would be one of the means by which we could bring to the notice of the people living outside the State outstanding points in the history of the country, both past history and present-day history.  Our broadcasting station could be very educational, not only in the Irish language but in the English language.  It could do many things to help the people from the point of view of inculcating a civic spirit and developing a sense of civic duty.  In sponsoring a programme of that sort the station would be helping the people to understand the Irish language.  A good sharp talk could be given on the ideas behind the programme and the reasons why the Irish language was being fostered. Some people treat the Irish programmes with sarcasm as well as those who speak the language for the purpose of helping others to learn it.  I think that if they were given an idea of what is behind such a programme they might begin to understand the purpose of it, and eventually might start to learn the national language themselves.</P>
    <P>The programmes as a whole are pretty good.  I am not in a position either to praise or to condemn them. As a rule, I do not listen-in to the radio except perhaps for the news bulletin.  As Deputy Flanagan has said, I think that the station should open earlier in the day.  I would suggest 8 o'clock in the morning so that people might be given the early news. That, I think, would prove of interest to workers.  Before starting out in the morning they would like to know what had happened since the last news bulletin was given out about midnight.  I think that if they could hear the news over the radio when sitting over their breakfast it would help them to digest it.  Some Deputies may smile at that. We all know that it is not a good thing to rush our meals.  Most people like to read the newspaper while they are at their breakfast.  That gives them time to digest the meal properly.  The same effect, I think, would be produced if there was an early news bulletin.  It would be almost as pleasant as listening to the birds singing in the early morning.  Some people may get up in <Col N="2295" /> the morning with very sore heads after the night before.  If they were able to turn on the wireless before leaving the house, it might help to change their whole outlook for the day.  I think it would be a very good idea indeed if the station opened at an earlier hour and provided music and other entertainment for listeners.  The children's hour could also be made very entertaining and educational.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in getting up was to tell the Minister that I am very pleased with the service.  I hope that, when the short-wave station is in operation, it will be used for the purpose of bringing to the notice of people outside the country some knowledge of our history, our culture and our ideas, and in particular the fact that we have here an artificial partition of our country which is held by armed force, threats and pressure.  It is surprising, especially since the war started, the number of English people who take an interest in the broadcasts from Radio Éireann.  One of the main reasons for that was that they were desirous of hearing unbiassed war news.  They wanted to hear an uncensored version of the German and English war news. I know that during my travels, especially in Great Britain, many people told me that they would hurry home in order to hear the Irish news bulletin. When the short-wave station is in operation I am sure that those people will be even more eager to hear the news sent out from our station.  In conclusion, I may say that I am very pleased that we are progressing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the general programmes of Radio Éireann.  The director of the station, who possibly has more to do with it than anybody else, is also to be congratulated.  Professor Joad, one of the Brains Trust who broadcasts frequently over the B.B.C., recently visited Killarney and Cork and spoke on the accents of people in different countries.  He also wrote some articles on the same subject.  One of the things he has said is that the Irishman has captured him completely, and that, of all the accents that he has ever heard, the Irish <Col N="2296" /> accent is the most fascinating.  I have not lived very much out of Ireland. I have visited England, Scotland and Wales.  I have listened to English as it is spoken by people in different countries, and almost always I could discern from the accent of the speaker the country that he or she came from. I agree with Professor Joad in the views that he has expressed.  Right off, I make the claim that I think the best English in the world is spoken in this House, though I would exempt myself from that.  I do not like to mention names, but I think that without exception, from the Taoiseach down, the very best English in the world is spoken here.  We use language to convey our thoughts, and the best language is that which is most easily understood.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to refer to people who are earning their living, but I think that those who speak English over the radio here have never accepted English as she is spoken by the natives of the country.  I think they should get away from that.  They adopt the Rathmines, Ballsbridge and haw-haw kind of stuff.  That is the standard adopted to a great extent, and I do not like it.  It is not speaking English in the way that the members of this House speak it.  I am sorry that that seems to be the kind of standard which many of the broadcasters adopt.  They speak as if they were afraid to open their mouths. They should open their mouths so that we might understand them.  I have heard old soldiers say on their return to Ireland from service in the colonies&mdash;my native county at one time was a garrison county&mdash;that they could more easily understand the English language when spoken by the people of this country than when it was spoken by English people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did you get away from that standard?  Though many of these accents do not please me, a few do.  I heard an Englishman comment on a very famous broadcaster.  Michael O'Hehir.  He has made a wonderful impression in England and he is a glorious talker.  One can understand every syllable that man utters and it is a pleasure to listen to him.  Drop that <Col N="2297" /> Oxford accent, which is supposed to be the best in the world.  Dublin claims it and Aberdeen claims it.  Not much &ldquo;haw-haw&rdquo; attaches to Oxford but I detest the Rathmines-Ballsbridge stuff.</P>
    <P>I suggested here on the last occasion that you pay more attention to the G.A.A.  I mentioned that you should get the captain, the vice-captain or some playing member in the old All-Ireland finals to broadcast.  You could give 20 minutes to a hurling broadcast and 20 minutes to a football broadcast. You could go back for 45 years and get men capable of speaking on those games.  You would have Christian Brothers and former national school boys broadcasting then and you would have real Irish accents.  These old sports will not be boasters; &ldquo;they shouldered their crutches and showed how fields were won.&rdquo;  You would have a variety of accents amongst the winners of the All-Ireland championships. Speaking from memory, you would have 20 or 25 counties represented in connection with hurling and football.  The script could be arranged under the aegis of each county committee. Let the county committees select their men.  I know many of those old men who are living in my native county and it would be very interesting to listen to them.</P>
    <P>You certainly owe a duty to the G.A.A. above any other organisation.  I did some Press work in my younger days when I was foolish.  I remember coming across an essay by Kickham in which he said that the games were killed in Kilkenny or Tipperary in the 40's by the British Government. You had no G.A.A. in '98 or '48 or '67 but you had in 1916.  It was around the Gaelic club in each parish that the movement was built which led to our being here.  I see good in every game &mdash;from ping pong to hurling.  I like to see games played, but we have a national game which should get more prominence.  It was the G.A.A., as I remarked, who put us here.  In the late 40's, or in the 50's, when a crowd of young men collected to play one parish against another, or for one side of the road to play the other side, Mr. Justice Shallow, according to Kickham, used <Col N="2298" /> arrive with a party of &ldquo;peelers&rdquo; at his heels.  He would declare the assembly illegal and then read the Riot Act.</P>
    <P>About a week later, the bailiffs and rent-warners went around telling the families of the hurlers who were tenants-at-will to keep their boys at, home or their rents would be &ldquo;riz&rdquo;. Of course, they stayed at home and that killed the games.  The landlords were good judges.  Highgates was then high treason and the &ldquo;clout&rdquo; of a hurling ball endangered Queen Victoria's crown.  Thousands of listeners would love to hear the story of those old finals and the views of the men who took part in them.  We have two such men here.  We have Deputy Spring, who was captain of the Kerry team, and we have Deputy Donnellan, who took an All-Ireland cup across the Shannon.  There is a certain gentleman in the House and I should like to hear him talk about his finals. He is closely associated with broadcasting. I think that he has four All-Ireland medals.  That is our director of broadcasting.  I saw him play in those finals.</P>

Numbers of <Col N="2299" /> people wait in country houses on Sunday night to hear the results.  He is very good but he does not get time enough.  I suggest that he should get more time.  Our All-Ireland finals, as described by Michael O'Hehir, are world-famous, and I say he is the best broadcaster in the world.  Many will come close to him but that is accepted in England.  Plenty of our old Gaels will open the eyes of listeners if you do what I suggest and arrange for these talks on former finals.  These men were the means of bringing us into this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the staff of Radio Éireann, I should like to say that the appreciation of their efforts which has been shown is very gratifying and I am sure it will be very encouraging to them in the future.  They do not claim to have reached perfection, by any means, but their efforts to improve the station are very much appreciated. I am sorry that Deputy Mulcahy found that the voices on Radio Éireann were not satisfactory.  It is extremely difficult to get good voices.  Hundreds of people have been examined as announcers from time to time.  Unfortunately, the microphone magnifies every defect in the voice and that applies also to singing.  I suppose we shall never get a voice that some people will not dislike and criticise. What we have chiefly to aim at is clarity.  Possibly, some of our announcers, in their attempt to be as clear as possible, use an accent which has not sufficient of the blás to please some Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony raised the question of the engineering staff in Cork.  The position is that the work done in Cork is not up to the same standard of difficulty as that in either Athlone or Dublin. Pay is given according to the skill required.  For the present, at all events, I cannot hold out any promise that we can do more for Cork than we are doing.  We have been trying to give as many broadcasts as possible from all over the country, because our policy is to decentralise. So far as pay is concerned, it will be determined by the standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2300" /> Deputy Cogan mentioned that the radio does not have as much influence as people possibly think it should have. Of course, households vary.  I know perfectly well that in some households people dislike the radio, or perhaps their children are engaged in other pursuits.  On the whole, however, I think the permeating influence of the radio is very widespread.  It has not, perhaps, got the same capacity for impressing people as the pictures. There is no doubt that the visual things make more of an impression than things that are merely audible.  At the same time, I think it has a very continuous and permeating influence and often, if there are good talks put out on the radio, people discuss them afterwards and the ideas spread.  As a means of effecting the raising of standards of culture and putting our standards before the outside world, I consider it is of enormous importance.</P>
    <P>We give a good deal of drama. Deputy Cogan said we ought to give more drama.  I believe we give quite a considerable amount of drama.  One thing about drama is that it requires a great deal of organisation.  Good drama is, perhaps, one of the most expensive items on the radio and it takes a considerable time to organise.  It means nearly the whole evening goes with drama, so that I do not know that we could properly balance up our programme if we gave any more drama than we do give.  We try to balance things so as to give sufficient to suit everybody.  We give a considerable amount of songs and a certain amount of orchestral work and a certain number of other items.  We try to balance them one against the other.  It is only by watching things and correcting and revising, that the station can arrive at a better balance.</P>
    <P>Ae regards humour, there were certain criticisms made that we have not much humour on the radio.  It is the hardest thing in the world to be funny, especially on the radio, because you have not the visual assistance.  We had a special example of that in the case of the Irish pantomime, which was such an enormous success and so very funny, but when we tried to deal with it as something to which you could only listen, it became almost impossible.  It <Col N="2301" /> was really difficult to put it on the radio.  Being funny on the radio is the hardest thing of all.  Occasionally we have succeeded, but I hope we do not succeed in being funny without being aware of it; I hope we will never be unintentionally funny.</P>
    <P>The question of controversy on the radio was raised.  It would be a very good thing if we could put on controversial topics, but it is hard to do that without giving cause for criticism. Usually the Minister gets lambasted for doing it.  We proceed on the lines of exercising prudence in that matter.  If a way could be found to put on a good controversy without having subsequent criticism of that type, it would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan said that the main criticism of the radio was that we were not spending enough money.  We will be spending considerably more.  The whole question of the short-wave station is involved.  We shall have to increase our staff and probably I shall have another Estimate to submit to the House as soon as we have our plans properly laid.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by several Deputies to sponsored programmes.  One could see from the discussion to-night that the House was divided on our policy, so perhaps we are justified in taking a middle course.  I agree with Deputy Hughes that we must have regard to the standard.  A certain national standard must be observed. We do not want to be classed with stations like Luxembourg and other stations where it is a matter of sheer advertisement from beginning to end. It is only fair that we should give an opportunity to Irish producers to advertise.</P>
    <P>We are very limited in our methods of advertising, because we have very strict rules.  We do not want to interfere with the normal advertising business of the newspapers.  We do not advertise small things or advertisements of the kind the newspapers go in for&mdash;a lot of patent medicines, and so on.  We advertise only Irish products.  The companies must be 51 per cent.  Irish before we allow their advertisements on the radio.  The <Col N="2302" /> hours also are limited.  Reference was made to the increase of advertisements and it was suggested that that might mean people coming along at hours outside the hours we stipulated.  In the evening when it is most normal for people to listen-in we do not allow advertisements. We allow them late in the evening. Perhaps at 5.30 or 6 o'clock or during the afternoon we may allow advertisements, but we do not allow them during the hours when we have a programme which we believe the people like, during their recreation hours.</P>
    <P>The explanation in reference to the correspondents is that they are only part-time and the amount of work is small.  It was Deputy O'Sullivan who raised that point.  We have tried to do the best we can with our news staff but the position is by no means as we would like it yet.  It is one of the things to which we will have to pay special attention.  When we come to deal with the short-wave station we shall have to consider our whole news service.  We will want certain things about which I shall have to come to the House again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes put his finger on one of our weaknesses and that is agricultural talks.  We are actively engaged in discussions with the Department of Agriculture so as to get first-class agricultural talks.  It is extraordinary how unwilling farmers are to tell us about all the grand things they do in the country.  Even the experts are not willing to talk.  They prefer action to words.  There is considerable difficulty in getting them to go on the radio, but we have great hopes of being able to organise things on methodical lines.  We must express gratitude to the few people who have talked about their farming experiences.  Their talks were well received throughout the country. We are always glad to hear criticisms because it shows that our people are interested in listening-in and anxious to get the very best we can give them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan wanted to have an all-round the clock radio programme. I am afraid we cannot do that because it would be extremely expensive.  It would mean not only electrical costs but the cost of staffs.  You would require <Col N="2303" /> an enormous staff of people to put on a variety of material sufficient to cover the period the Deputy has suggested.  Even the British Broadcasting Corporation, which spends such enormous sums, records many of its programmes and repeats them because it cannot keep creating programmes for every hour of the day. We have tried to improve the quality of our programmes within the limited hours at our disposal.  Perhaps with the passing of the emergency, the increase in the number of licences and the return of better conditions we may be able to improve the situation and possibly extend the hours.  I might mention that I took a special note of Deputy Corish's suggestion to have the programme on at 12.30.  I think that is a good idea if it can be managed.  It is only fair that we should try to cater for workers at that hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot to mention that &ldquo;old time&rdquo; is kept in rural Ireland and that men on the farms go to dinner at 12.30, so that the suggestion will cut both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>All these things will be considered.  The criticism of our programme with reference to the G.A.A. is hardly fair, because we put on provincial finals and other matches. Sometimes, unfortunately, the engagements clash and we have to make a choice.  We cannot put them all on. Following a suggestion made last year we have increased the time for Seán Ó Ceallacháin.  I was glad to hear the very appreciative remarks of Deputy Corish.  The Deputy is taking the same interest that his father always took in Radio Éireann.  I was especially glad to hear that reception in Wexford had improved.  It has always been a source of concern that there are stretches of the country, due to some geographical causes, where reception is not as good as in other places.  I am very glad to hear that reception is better now in Wexford.  The Deputy suggested the engagement of more country artists.  Under our scheme we hope to go more through the country <Col N="2304" /> for broadcasting purposes.  There, too, we would want a special staff, as the organisation and the getting of people into form is quite a work in itself which will take some time.  The tendency will be to develop more country broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies asked about the short-wave station.  I think from the discussion that has taken place everybody appreciates the value of establishing a short-wave station in Ireland. The intention really is to reach the Irish race throughout the world.  We are going to attempt to do that, and for that purpose we want to raise our standard as much as we can, to make our programme as Irish as we can while, at the same time, showing that we are drawing upon the very rich deposits of our Irish culture, our Irish language, our Irish history, our literature, our folklore and our music.  We want in all these respects to indicate what Ireland has always stood for.  All these things contribute to what might be called the civilisation that belongs to the smaller nations of Europe and, ranking amongst them, we must keep up our standard.  Nobody will question the fact that we stand out as a distinguished nation in these matters.  Perhaps we have not come out as much as we should.  Owing to the conflict of history we have a lot to make up in all our shattered institutions in order to give both our own people and those in the outside world the full benefit of our heritage.  The short-wave station will not be heard in Ireland, except in a few places, because the nature of short-waves is such that they go up very high, and come down very far away.  For that reason the short-wave programme will be almost entirely for export purposes.  I am saying that because, when we have expended money on the short-wave station, people may be disappointed when they will not be able to hear it.  It will probably be heard in a few places in Ireland, but in very few, because if it is put out into the ether to reach the United States, South Africa and Australia naturally we will not hear it in this country.  A considerable portion of the programme will be repeated on the medium wave but, perhaps I had better not anticipate that now, as we <Col N="2305" /> will have another Estimate to deal with organisation.</P>

      <P>Post Office expenditure for the financial year 1946-47 is estimated at £3,549,320.  This represents a gross increase of £216,055 on the provision for 1945-46 of which £206,000 is due to increased emergency bonus and to the provision of extra staff to meet continuing growth of work.  There are off-setting decreases of £34,645, leaving a net increase of £181,410.  The main variations in the Estimate as compared <Col N="2306" /> with the past year are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-heads A (1) to A (4)&mdash;Salaries, etc.  The net increase of £91,180 on these sub-heads is due, mainly, to increased emergency bonus amounting to £87,028.  The remainder arises from normal incremental increases and from additional staff provision necessitated by growth in various classes of work, including additional remuneration to sub-postmasters for increased business: also to the transfer of staff expenditure amounting to £38,240 from the former &ldquo;O&rdquo; sub-head, now abolished.  There are off-setting savings from retirements, reduced provision for extra duty, etc.</P>
      <P>Sub-head D&mdash;Purchase of Sites, etc. The decrease of £6,050 is due to provision having been made last year for the purchase of a new stores warehouse.</P>
      <P>Sub-head E (1)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Rail.  There is an increase of £5,170 due to increased payment to Córas Iompair Eireann for conveyance of letter mails on restoration of train services.</P>
      <P>Sub-head E (4)&mdash;The extra £5,200 provides for an increase in the amount payable by this Administration in respect of the conveyance of letter mails between Holyhead and Dun Laoghaire in the event of the normal frequency of service being restored.</P>
      <P>Sub-head E (5)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Air.  The reduction of £5,705 is due mainly to the clearance of arrears of outstanding accounts in respect of British Commonwealth air services.</P>
      <P>Sub-head G (1)&mdash;Non-engineering Stores.  The increased provision of £26,810 is for the purchase, now that normal conditions are returning, of additional supplies of mail bags, letter boxes, cycles and mechanical transport, and for additional costs arising out of the grant of increased mileage rates for private cycles, of which a greater number is now in use than heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head I (1)&mdash;Engineering Establishment, Salaries, Wages and Allowances. The increase of £17,795 arises out of additional emergency bonus and increased provision for staff, labour, <Col N="2307" /> etc., mainly for telephone works.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K&mdash;Engineering Materials. There is an increase of £29,750 due to provision for increased purchase of engineering stores for new construction and renewal work, etc.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L (3)&mdash;Contract Work. The increase of £5,555 provides for increased construction work under contract.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments. The increase in this sub-head is £5,040.  These repayments are in respect of annuities created under the Telephone Capital Acts, which authorise the Minister for Finance to borrow money for the development of the telephone service: the repayment provision to be made each year is determined by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (1)&mdash;Superannuation Allowances.  There is a decrease of £17,030 in this sub-head.  This is mainly due to reduced provision for additional retiring allowances under the Superannuation Acts, and for marriage gratuities; offset by increased emergency bonus and the growth in number of pensions.</P>
    <P>Of the sub-heads relating to Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services, Q (1)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances of Engineering Staff&mdash;shows an increase of £1,330, due mainly to provision for increased emergency bonus and additional staff.  Sub-head Q (2) is increased by £14,615 to provide additional radio equipment.</P>
    <P>Sub-head T&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash;shows a small decrease of £1,935.  A reduction is expected in the receipts from railway companies for works performed for them and from other administrations for agency services performed on their behalf.  The reduction will be largely offset by increased receipts from Savings Bank funds and from the sale of engineering stores, scrap, etc.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that the separate sub-heads (&ldquo;O&rdquo;) relating to the Post Office Savings Bank which appeared in former Estimates have been discontinued and the various charges incorporated in other sub-heads. The relatively small expenditure which was included in these sub-heads <Col N="2308" /> did not differ in character from that contained in other sub-heads.  On the other hand, the discontinuance of the separate Savings Bank sub-heads will facilitate accounting.  The total costs of administration recoverable from Savings Bank funds is, of course, still shown in item 5 of the Appropriations-in-Aid (sub-head T).</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the financial position of the three main services&mdash; postal, telegraph and telephone&mdash;on a commercial basis at the end of 1944-45, the latest year for which complete figures are available, was more favourable than I had ventured to hope last year.  It was as follows:&mdash;postal service &mdash;deficit: £20,101; telegraph service&mdash; deficit: £122,663; telephone service&mdash; surplus: £267,289, showing at 31st March, 1945, a net surplus of £124,525 on the three services.  It is estimated that, notwithstanding growing costs, the profit on the services on a commercial basis at 31st March, 1946, had risen to £182,200.</P>
    <P>With the cessation of international hostilities, the many difficulties which have impeded the operation of all the Department's services in recent years are beginning to lessen.  Foreign mail services are gradually resuming and, except to Japan and some of the territories formerly occupied by Japanese forces, a more or less regular letter service is once more available to every country.  The time occupied in the transmission of foreign correspondence by surface services is, however, still very far in excess of the pre-war standard. There will, no doubt, be gradual improvement as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Parcel post services to many countries abroad are still suspended. Despite this handicap, foreign parcel post traffic as a whole has improved. During the past year, 12,200 foreign parcels were dispatched as compared with 4,800 during the previous year; while 635,000 were received as compared with the previous figure of 281,000.  Some 25 per cent. of the parcels despatched were for the United States and 91 per cent. of those received were from that country.  The outgoing parcel traffic is still less than half that of pre-war years, but the inward traffic is much greater.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> Transatlantic air mail traffic, after remaining static for some years, now shows a marked upward trend, over 11,000 lb. of mail having been despatched last year as compared with 8,000 during the year preceding.  This increase is probably largely due to the speeding-up of mails carried by air to and from the United States, but, no doubt, also, in degree, to the increased contacts with visitors to this country since the cessation of hostilities.  The average time for transmission by air between Ireland and the United States is now only three days.</P>
    <P>Air mail services are again in operation to all European countries, except Germany.  The 6d. Commonwealth air letter service, to which I referred last year, was introduced in September last and the traffic has progressively increased. Foreign money order services are being gradually reintroduced.  Difficulties as regards rates of exchange give rise to delay in restoration.</P>
    <P>Coming to home services, the position is that the internal mail services are still adversely affected by the restricted services of Coras Iompair Eireann although the restoration in August last of passenger services on all week-days and the re-opening of branch lines have helped to improve matters.  It has been possible to arrange for the resumption of certain travelling post offices which were withdrawn in April, 1944, and the day to day uniformity of despatches and arrivals has been largely restored. We are, however, hampered by the continued absence of night mail trains on the midland section, by the absence of suitable night mail connections on certain southern section branch lines, by the non-running of night goods trains on the Dublin-Wexford line on Saturday and, generally, by the longer times now taken by the trains for the journeys.</P>
    <P>Every improvement in railway services that could be of benefit to the Post Office is availed of.  The use of buses for letter mails has been resorted to as far as practicable and has tended to improve the mail arrangements, particularly in the midland section.</P>
    <P>The continued improvement in the petrol supply position during the past year has, with just a few exceptions <Col N="2310" /> due to local difficulties in procuring tyres, enabled us to return to motor-working on routes where horse-working had been temporarily employed. Departmental motor services have been further restored and now cover approximately 80 per cent. of the pre-war mileage.</P>
    <P>In Dublin City, a considerable improvement has been effected in morning deliveries as a result of an easing in the gas supply position which has enabled earlier staff attendances to be arranged.  There has also been an improvement in the time of morning delivery in Dún Laoghaire concerning which complaint was made in the House last year.</P>
    <P>Cross-Channel services are still adversely affected by the continued restriction of the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead sailings to one a day in each direction.  I have no information as to when an improvement may be anticipated, but, in any event, I expect that, before long, discussions with the British administration as to the transfer of the cross-Channel letter mails to air will be re-opened.</P>
    <P>A recent development was the introduction, in January last, of surcharge air mail services to and from Great Britain.  Although restricted in scope, this service has substantially improved the postal facilities to and from cross-Channel offices.</P>
    <P>I have had under consideration the question of improving the postal delivery facilities on rural posts on which a less frequent delivery than six days a week is afforded.  The total number of such posts is approximately 5,200 and of these about 3,500, serving about 70 per cent. of the rural population, have a daily delivery at present; some 50 others get a delivery on four to five days a week; 1,700 have a thrice weekly delivery; while some 30 very remote areas, mainly islands, are served on two days a week only or less. I find that the cost of granting a six-day delivery all-round would be very substantial and would involve a heavy deficit on the postal service as a whole. Indeed the existing rural services, such as they are, are already operated at a loss in very many instances.  I am satisfied, however, that I would be justified <Col N="2311" /> in spending another £20,000 a year on the rural posts and I have pleasure in announcing that I have secured the approval of the Minister for Finance to do so.</P>
    <P>The details have yet to be worked out but the expenditure of that sum should make it possible to grant an additional day's delivery to the areas of limited service and may possibly permit of more being done in some cases.  These improvements will be carried out as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The increase in telegraph traffic and revenue, which manifested itself in recent years as a result of emergency conditions, continues.  The loss on the service during the financial year just ended is estimated at £121,000 as compared with £123,000 approximately for 1944-45.</P>
    <P>The telephone service continues to grow.  Traffic during the past year shows large increases.  Trunk calls increased by 553,000 over the figures for the previous year and local calls by 5,000,000.  Since pre-war days trunk calls have increased by 3,820,000 and local calls by 18,000,000.  Telephone revenue increased correspondingly and for the first time in the history of our telephone service passed the £1,000,000 mark to reach the figure of £1,006,200.</P>
    <P>While these figures are very satisfactory in themselves the rapid growth of traffic involves serious difficulties for the Department in its endeavours to maintain a satisfactory and efficient service by reason of the fact that there are not sufficient circuits or exchange equipment for the enormously increased load.  I have already on various occasions explained to Deputies the serious difficulties caused by the impossibility of procuring during the emergency, except in the most limited quantities, renewals of essential construction stores and equipment and very many important items were not obtainable at all.  In this connection it may be no harm to state, once more, that we started the emergency period with a reserve of three year's supplies, but this reserve and the limited supplementary stocks we subsequently managed to procure proved insufficient <Col N="2312" /> for the unanticipated and unprecedented requirements brought about by the emergency.</P>
    <P>Almost from the outset a huge new network of communications had to be provided for the defence services and, subsequently, traffic soared to record proportions.  In spite of the difficulties, however, we managed to carry on reasonably well&mdash;I might indeed say surprisingly well in the actual circumstances&mdash;but only by employing to the utmost every possible expedient that could be devised to extend the life of old plant.  The shortage of new construction stores rendered it, however, quite impossible for us to provide, during the emergency years, the additional circuits which would have ordinarily been erected to carry the increased traffic, with the result that, in spite of the best efforts of the Department and the staff, the standard of service, particularly at busy periods, is not what it would be under normal conditions.</P>
    <P>Although the period of belligerency is happily over, the end of the emergency, so far as it affected supply conditions for communication materials to this country, has not yet been reached. It is true that in some respects there has been a marked and welcome improvement in the position, but some vitally important items of equipment are still unobtainable.  Even in these latter cases, however, there is an improved outlook, because we now have promises of delivery at some future and not too far distant date.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding, however, our restricted supplies, we succeeded in erecting last year some 600 miles of new trunk overhead circuit, and we intend during the coming year to undertake a substantially enlarged programme. In addition, three-channel carrier systems were provided last year between Dublin and Tralee and Dublin and Limerick.  Lately, delivery has been obtained of a new type of carrier equipment&mdash;a &ldquo;12 channel&rdquo; system&mdash;by means of which it is proposed to provide additional circuits on the Dublin-Limerick route.  This equipment embodies some of the most recent technical developments and, although <Col N="2313" /> difficult problems may be involved in employing it under the conditions that obtain in this country, it is hoped that it may be possible to have the new channels working in the coming summer.</P>
    <P>The cross-Channel service has been very adversely affected by the heavy growth of traffic and there is urgent need of additional circuits.  Arrangements are being made in co-operation with the British Post Office for the provision of 12 additional channels in the submarine cables.  These, when installed, will result in a material improvement in the service: they may be ready by August next.</P>
    <P>The position as regards the taking on of new subscribers is, I regret to say, still unsatisfactory.  Although, last year, we gave service to 1,069 new subscribers there are, at present, some 4,000 applicants on the waiting list, of whom over 2,500 are in the Dublin area.  There are two main factors limiting the provision of service freely to applicants at present, namely, (a) shortage of spare circuits in the underground cables in cities and towns, and (b) shortage of switchboard equipment at a large number of exchanges throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In normal times underground cables for subscribers' service are provided on a systematic basis well in advance of the spare wires in the cables being used up.  During the emergency, supplies of cables were obtainable only in the most limited quantities, with the result that there is now a widespread shortage of underground spare circuits. It will, therefore, be necessary to lay new cables extensively in the cities and large towns.</P>
    <P>As regards exchange equipment, the position in Dublin is that spare terminations at the Crown Alley, Ship Street and Merrion Street exchanges are approaching exhaustion and arrangements have been made for a major extension of the Crown Alley Exchange to provide for present and future needs.  A contract for the extension was placed in July last and installation will, it is hoped, be completed by the end of this year.  In the meantime it will be necessary to continue to restrict the provision of <Col N="2314" /> subscribers' service in areas served by these three exchanges.  The position as regards spare terminations in the other automatic exchanges (Terenure, Rathmines, Clontarf and Dún Laoghaire) is fairly satisfactory but, to provide for the future, a contract for extending each of them was placed in November last.</P>
    <P>In order to relieve pressure in the main switchroom at Exchequer Street exchange an auxiliary switchroom has been provided to deal with cross-Channel and Northern Ireland calls and to take a certain amount of other trunk traffic from the main switchroom.</P>
    <P>In the provinces additional switchboards are required at numerous exchanges.  Supplies are on order and first deliveries have recently been made.  Installation will be arranged with the least possible delay.  In some cases, namely, Cork and Waterford, complete replacement of the exchanges on conversion to the automatic system will be necessary and the necessary steps are in train.</P>
    <P>Special attention is being given to the question of improving the position generally by the clearance of waiting applications for service, by the provision of additional trunk circuits, by the installation of further exchange equipment and of underground cabling. Additional staff, technical and workman, are at present being recruited and will be argumented later as far as may be necessary.  Every effort will be made to deal with the situation generally with the utmost possible expedition, but it is important at the same time that I should make clear that no immediate rectification of the position can be expected in view of the magnitude of the task and of the uncertainty of deliveries by contractors. It will take from 12 to 18 months at least to clear waiting applications for subscriber service.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the &ldquo;five-year plan&rdquo; for the installation of a telephone call office at every Post Office now without service which had been decided on.</P>
    <P>There are over 900 such offices and as most of them are situated in remote areas the construction work involved will be very heavy.  The scheme will <Col N="2315" /> have to be spread over a number of years and the selection of offices to be equipped each year must be determined on engineering grounds, the object being to carry out the work in such order as will enable the whole scheme to be completed in the shortest time possible.</P>
    <P>A start is being made on the scheme this year and it is hoped that it will be possible to provide about 180 call offices.  We also expect to provide about 40 new kiosks, mainly for the provinces.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated from what I have said that our activities during the coming year, so far as telephones are concerned, are likely to concentrate mainly on a rectification of existing shortcomings rather than on any large scale expansion.  I hope, however, in connection with a new Telephone Capital Bill which will be necessary to make funds available for future development, and which will be shortly introduced, to indicate in some detail our plans and ideas in regard to the future.</P>
    <P>The value of contracts placed by the Stores Branch last year was £967,810, a decrease of £462,401 on the figures for the previous year but, although expenditure was lower, there was an increase of approximately 10 per cent. in the number of contracts and orders. The value of contracts placed for articles manufactured or assembled within the State was £625,717.  The falling-off is, of course, due to the easing of the emergency situation, the reduction of the Defence services, etc.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest tasks of the Stores Branch during the past year was the provision of civilian suits for discharged soldiers, a task which was complicated by the unexpectedly rapid rate of demobilisation.  The services of the branch were also availed of in connection with the Government's scheme for the relief of distress in Europe under which a large variety of stores and commodities was supplied to various countries.</P>
    <P>There has been a general improvement in the position regarding imports from Great Britain.  This has enabled <Col N="2316" /> the Post Office factory to resume its normal activities and the employment situation is now sounder than it was when the factory was burned down in November, 1942, and the prospects generally are brighter.</P>
    <P>With regard to Post Office buildings, the Department continues to be hampered by the difficulties which confront the building industry everywhere. This is unfortunate as Post Office accommodation as a whole has become very congested by reason of the large volume of work falling to the Department as a result of the introduction of various new social services during the emergency, particularly children's allowances.  The difficulties in this connection have been considerably increased by the enormous development of the telephone which has already taken place and the certainty of further considerable expansion.  The position is one which is causing the Department no small anxiety and special measures are being taken to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The new Postmen's District Office in Whitehall is nearing completion and should be ready for use some time during the summer.  The Office of Public Works is engaged in the preparation of working drawings, etc., for the new post office and exchange at St. Andrew Street, Dublin.  In view, however, of the magnitude of the undertaking, it will be some considerable time before building operations will commence.  Early priority as regards materials, etc., will be given.</P>
    <P>The growth in Savings Bank business was well maintained during the past year.  For the second year in succession the number of deposits accepted exceeded the million mark, and for the first time the value of deposits exceeded £10,000,000.  Compared with the previous year, deposits at £10,630,000 showed an increase of £2,280,000 and withdrawals at £4,959,000 an increase of £1,520,000.  The balance to credit of depositors on 31st December, 1945, was £32,754,000.  The number of accounts remaining open increased by 56,000 to 599,000.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme whereby Army gratuities payable to demobilised defence personnel are lodged in the Savings Bank 20,000 accounts involving <Col N="2317" /> a sum of £1,010,000 were opened.  The scheme is, of course, not yet completed.</P>
    <P>In addition to ordinary deposits a sum of £1,080,000 was deposited by way of investment of moneys received by the Minister for Finance for the credit of Trustee Savings Banks, and £61,000 was withdrawn.  Interest amounted to £103,000.  The balance to credit of the banks with the Minister for Finance increased by £1,122,000 to £4,266,000.</P>
    <P>Investments by the public in Savings Certificates during 1945 totalled £1,549,000, an increase of £38,000 on the previous 12 months.  Withdrawals amounted to £725,000, leaving a net saving for the year of £824,000 as compared with £892,000 for 1944.  The increase in withdrawals may be accidental or it may be due to traders having more scope for obtaining supplies or to a tendency on the part of the public to spend more as a result of the end of the war.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to refer to three matters affecting the staff of the Department which, although purely matters of internal administration, may be of interest.  The first relates to night telephonists employed in the Central Telephone Exchange in Dublin.  These were formerly employed on a part-time basis but their posts have recently been converted to fulltime status.</P>
    <P>The second concerns the engineering branch.  Linemen in that branch who are responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of telegraph and telephone installations have much travelling to do and have heretofore been supplied with motor-cycle combinations for this purpose.  Experience showed that a more efficient maintenance service could be provided by the use of light motor vans instead of the combinations, owing to the greater carrying capacity of the vans and the greater protection they afford in bad weather to the men concerned.  Accordingly, it has been decided gradually to replace these combinations, numbering in all 52, by light vans.</P>
    <P>The third matter affects only the accountant's branch at present, but it is likely to have much wider repercussions <Col N="2318" /> later.  Deputies may recollect that when the Minister for Finance spoke in November last on a resolution regarding Civil Service re-organisation, he was kind enough to refer very favourably to the efficiency of Post Office methods of work.  That tribute was, I think, fully merited, but the achievement of maximum efficiency is a continuous process and my Department is continually seeking new ways of bringing about still greater efficiency in personnel and organisation.  We are now trying out some experimental measures in the accountant's branch which has been selected as a suitable proving ground because of the volume and variety of the work there.  One of the measures consists of a continuous and systematic review of organisation and methods by means of a minute examination of working techniques.  The examination aims at economising effort and relieving the staff of strain and monotony.</P>
    <P>Another measure has been the establishment of a reception and training school for entrants to the branch.  The initial course of training lasts from eight to 12 days, during which the entrants are given short lectures and practical instruction to acquaint them with the code of Civil Service rules and conduct, and with the technique of office work, and to give them a general background of knowledge about Post Office services.  The results so far are very promising and if further experience continues favourable the practicability of adopting similar measures in other sections of the Department will be investigated.  I desire, in conclusion, to express my appreciation of the excellent service rendered by the staff of the Department as a whole during the past 12 months.</P>

</Debate>
