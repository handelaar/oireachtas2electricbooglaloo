      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the recently reconstituted Harbour Boards of Kinsale and Skibbereen (Baltimore) find themselves in a serious financial position owing to the fact of having no income from shipping during the war years; and if he will consider the making of a grant to these boards to enable them to enter on their new duties free from the debts incurred during these years.</P>

      <P>The accounts furnished to me by the Kinsale Harbour Authority show that their financial position was no worse on the 31st March, 1946, than it was on the 31st March, 1940.  A grant has recently been sanctioned from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote for repairs to the pier and sea wall.</P>
      <P>The liabilities shown in the accounts of the Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Authority for the year ended 30th September, 1945, are no greater than they were immediately before the emergency.  The harbour authority were empowered in 1943 to collect rates on fish landed in the harbour but do not appear to have done so.</P>
      <P>There are no funds at my disposal which would permit of the discharge of the indebtedness of these or other harbours.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 226) Order, 1946, for particulars as to the customs duties chargeable on wireless telegraphy apparatus and parts thereof.</P>
      <P>The duties now in operation were imposed primarily for the purpose of encouraging further development in the assembly and manufacture of wireless receiving sets and wireless components generally.  Although transformers other than those used in broadcast receivers have, on occasion, been made to special order, none of the articles specified in the question is at present manufactured in the country on a commercial scale, but arrangements are being made to secure the manufacture and complete assembly of a full range of components in the near future.</P>
      <P>The issue of duty-free licences in respect of variable condensers, wire-wound resistances and coil forms has been recommended by me to the Revenue Commissioners for use by firms engaged in an approved degree of manufacture and major assembly of wireless receiving sets.  Duty-free licences are not being recommended to any person or firm in respect of radio transformers.  It is not the general practice to furnish the names of the firms to whom these concessions have been granted and it is not possible, from the information in my Department, to give the quantity and value of the items mentioned which were imported under licence.</P>

He states that the tender of the contractor referred to is for delivery up to six miles from his quarry, whereas the council's figure of 16/- provides for delivery within a radius of 12 miles from the council's quarry; and, further, that this figure of 16/- was fixed when work commenced in the quarry and the overhead costs would therefore be high.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the continuing decline in the dairying industry; that this position will inevitably lead to a serious shortage of our most valuable foods, milk and butter, in the future; and if so, if he will indicate what steps, if any, it is proposed to take in order to arrest the decline in this most important branch of our greatest national industry.</P>

      <P>While there has been a decrease during the emergency years in supplies of milk delivered to creameries, <Col N="1633" /> this decrease does not appear to be due to reduction in cattle stocks.  The number of cows and in-calf heifers kept on farms shows no significant change. As regards the latter part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the White Paper on Guaranteed Market and Prices for Dairy Produce issued in January last.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state why and when the Bailechiaragain School (Number 13127) was removed from the list of schools scheduled as being in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht; in what <Col N="1635" /> way the children, teachers, and parents are affected by such removal; what examination was carried out in the district before such removal; the total number of houses in the district, and the number and percentage of these in which Irish is the natural language of the home; the total number of school children and the number and percentage of these who speak only Irish in the home; and the number of children coming from homes where Irish is not spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Bailechiaragain National School was removed, as from 1st July, 1945, from the list of schools scheduled under Rule 121 (1) of the Rules and Regulations for National Schools as situate in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. From that date school children of the district were not eligible for participation in any schemes devised solely for the benefit of Fíor-Ghaeltacht pupils and the teachers were ineligible for grants paid under Rule 121 (1).</P>
      <P>The school was removed from the list after examination of the results of the investigation of applications for the £2 grant in the school years 1941-42 to 1944-45.  Since the grant is given in respect of these children only, in whose homes Irish is the everyday language, I am satisfied that the results of the investigation of applications for the £2 grant reflect the extent to which Irish is used as the language of the home in any district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of Irish in the homes of children attending the school is the primary factor in deciding whether or not a school should be scheduled as a Fíor-Ghaeltacht school and for this purpose it was not necessary to ascertain the number of houses in the district or the number of those in which Irish is spoken; what the Department required was information as to the number of homes in which there are children attending school and the number of these in which Irish is the language of the home.  From inquiries made it appears that the number of houses in the Bailechiaragain school-district <Col N="1636" /> in which there are school-children is 21; the number of these in which Irish is the home-language is nine (percentage 43 per cent.); the total number of school-children from the school-district attending Bailechiaragain school is 55 and Irish is the home-language of 22 (40 per cent.); the number of children coming from homes where Irish is not the home-language is 33.</P>

      <P>There are three amendments in my name which, ordinarily, would be proper to the Committee Stage; but, owing to the peculiar nature of this Bill, I want to submit that it was impossible to put them down for the Committee Stage because the information upon which they are based did not emerge until during the debate that took place on the Committee Stage.  I did not know, and I do not think anyone else in the House knew, that the Minister contemplated, in certain circumstances, the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia by Ceimicí, Teoranta, until the Committee Stage.  I did not know until the Committee Stage that the Minister denied the right to any citizen, from whom he proposed to withhold a licence, to go to the courts in order to have certain matters tested there.  I did not know until the Committee Stage that the Minister was engaged in some obscure negotiations with Messrs.  Maguire and Paterson about the material wherewith to make match-heads.  Without these three items of information, I could not have formulated these amendments. It is for that reason that they have not been tendered at an earlier stage of the Bill.  For these reasons, I respectfully submit that, exceptional as their character may appear to be, I have a right to move them on the Report Stage.</P>

The matters to which the Deputy referred seem to me to be implicit in the Bill and, if the Deputy had any doubts on the matter, he could have elicited that information from the Minister on the Second Stage.  The amendments are much too substantial <Col N="1649" /> to be submitted on the Report Stage and I am not allowing them.</P>

      <P>The Minister informed us that the provision made in this measure for the company to extend its activities is to enable it to carry out a certain amount of research and that no financial provision is being made to finance these activities in a commercial way; that if necessary, the necessary measures will be introduced at a later stage.  We tried to make clear on the various stages of the Bill what our attitude was: that so far as any research is necessary to explore the possibilities of developing an industry in this country we are not opposed to it, provided such an industrial development is economic and does not throw any undue burden back on the community, and, particularly, on the primary industry.  So far as any research is necessary by this particular company, if the Minister feels that this is the right company to carry out such developments, there might be no objection.  But we certainly do object to empowering this company to make a final decision as to whether it is economically possible to do certain things here.  We felt that there should be some sort of independent tribunal set up which would carefully examine the proposals to be made by this company and that that tribunal should be satisfied as to the possibilities and how far it is economically possible. Personally, I was principally concerned regarding the proposed production of sulphate of ammonia here.  I felt this was not the type of organisation to make a decision on that matter.  I was particularly keen that an independent, impartial tribunal should examine the proposal.  I am convinced that the question has at present wider ramifications than the Minister appears to be aware of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the war Great Britain discovered that synthetic sulphate of <Col N="1650" /> ammonia does not give the results that were expected, that Chilean nitrates were substantially superior, the reason being that Chilean rock contains the trace elements so essential in the soil. These trace elements like manganese, magnesium, iron, boron, cobalt, and so on, were absent from the synthetic product.  The British Sugar Corporation has definitely established that the syrup produced from beet grown on synthetic sulphate of ammonia was unbalanced and gave rise to difficulties in crystallisation.  These are matters that require expert and up-to-date advice and consideration.  I do not think you have attached to this institution the type of individual who is concerned with and well informed on matters of that sort.  Again I want to emphasise that, so far as we are concerned, we are opposed to the procedure the Minister has adopted in this measure.  It will not get impartial examination and it will not take into consideration, from an agricultural point of view, the results that have been obtained in Great Britain and other countries and the change in outlook in regard to synthetically produced sulphate of ammonia as against the natural product from Chile.</P>
    <P>The Minister was not prepared to meet the House in that regard.  He felt this company was competent to make a decision.  We felt that there was no indication of competence so far as the record of the company was concerned. While not reflecting on the individuals, we felt that the company would not take an impartial view and that they were not an impartial body to examine this proposal in an impartial way.  For that reason, we were forced to oppose the measure and to express our dissatisfaction with the Minister's proposal.</P>

      <P>How Deputies of this House can preserve equanimity and calm in the presence of the request that has been made of them now surpasses me to understand.  The Minister for Agriculture has just run away out of this House.  Is there any Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Benches who will deny that the Minister for Agriculture stated, from that seat over <Col N="1651" /> there, within the last six months, that a proposal was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce before the war to establish a factory for manufacturing sulphate of ammonia in this country and that he, the Minister for Agriculture, vetoed it because it meant a permanent addition of at least 10 per cent. on the cost of sulphate of ammonia to the farmers of this country?  Did he say that or did he not?  Every Deputy knows he did. Would you not have to despise a man who, having pledged his faith and reputation to resisting that proposal in defence of the section of the community after whose interests he is charged in honour to look in this House, is not here when it is brought forward again by a colleague who does not give two straws for the agricultural industry of this country?  Where is the Minister for Agriculture? Cowering down behind the Speaker's Chair.</P>

      <P>This Bill is designed to put a tax of 2/6 per acre on every acre of land that is tilled in this country in perpetuity.  Consider the history of this company.  Does this House remember the circumstances in which the industrial alcohol industry was launched?  In 1934 or 1935 we were told that there was an immense surplus of potatoes in the country and that Fianna Fáil had a brain wave to get rid of them.  They were not going in for any old-fashioned methods like feeding them to pigs or feeding them to live stock.  &ldquo;The British market was gone, thank God.

      <P>Certainly.  If we are going to perpetuate an industry of this kind, we certainly want to know what the object is.  That codology went on for four years.  Then we had the Act of 1938.  If Deputies will look up the official records of this House, they will find that Deputy McGilligan, and, I think, Deputy O'Higgins, from these benches, suggested to the Minister that industrial alcohol produced in these plants would be likely to cost 3/6 per gallon, that, as he proposed to use it as a substitute for petrol by an admixture system, and that as petrol was then available for 4d. and 5d. a gallon, it would cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Industrial Alcohol (Amendment) Bill&rdquo;&mdash;that is the title of it.  &ldquo;An Act to change the name of the company&rdquo;&mdash;I shall deal with that in a moment&mdash;&ldquo;formed under the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1938, to authorise an extension of the objects of the said company, to control the importation of chemical products, to amend the said Act in certain respects and to make provision for certain other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;  It continues the powers of the Government.  Let me describe to the House how these powers are now being used.  Three and sixpence was the price the Minister sneered at as being unthinkable and he said industrial alcohol was going to be produced for 1/9 per gallon.  Seven and sixpence per gallon is what the alcohol is costing now. Potatoes were to be the raw material. Sugar beet from Monaghan and Louth, and treacle from Cuba, are the raw materials to-day.  Remember one <Col N="1655" /> of the reasons for the shortage of flour in this country is that we have no ships to bring in wheat but now we are using ships to bring in treacle for this industrial alcohol factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure you, Sir, we are, and we intend to raise revenue for the purposes of this Bill by raising the price of the industrial alcohol produced out of Cuban treacle, to compel the petrol distributors to use it, and to pay the Government for it and to appropriate the profits of that transaction to such activities as the Minister wishes to conduct through Ceimicí, Teoranta, without coming back to Dáil Éireann.  And the Dáil is asked to do that with its eyes wide open! Under the legislation consisting of the first Act, the 1938 Act and this Bill, the Minister has power to charge anything he likes for industrial alcohol.  He can raise the price of industrial alcohol to £1 per gallon.  He can force the petrol companies to buy it and to put it into the petrol and he can authorise the petrol distributors to charge such prices to the consumer as will compensate them for the use of industrial alcohol.  So that, in fact, the Minister's power to raise revenue under this Bill, to do anything he likes, is unlimited and our experience to date has been that he has not hesitated to use it.  One and ninepence per gallon was the only figure he first mentioned, but he has already put the price up to 7/6 per gallon, and he does not conceal the fact that he has collected £150,000 in certain years in revenue from the industrial alcohol factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any Deputy in this House at the moment who considers that it is desirable to ship treacle from Cuba and to convert it into industrial alcohol in this country to be sold at 7/6 per gallon when you can buy petrol at 8d. and 9d. per gallon?  Is there any Deputy in this House who, in a time <Col N="1656" /> of acute sugar shortage, thinks it desirable to convert into industrial alcohol in the Carrickmacross factory a quantity of sugar beet which would produce for the consumers of this country some hundreds of thousands of tons of sugar?  Are we all gone stark, staring mad?  Do Deputies in this House consider it right that when the Cork Yeast Company has put in the most modern machinery that any company in Ireland can have for the manufacture of rectified spirit, we should authorise this Government-financed company to manufacture an identical product with a view strictly to limiting the market available to the private enterprise of the Cork Yeast Company?  If we sanction that, in regard to rectified spirit, are we embarking on a code of legislation which will enable the Government to set up a rival factory in any industry they care to enter, financed and sustained out of the taxpayers' money and designed to destroy the enterprise of somebody who has invested his own capital elsewhere in the country?  I do not believe there is a single Deputy in this House who believes in that, and yet Deputies over there will all trot like sheep into the Lobby.</P>
    <P>I know the various purposes for which this Bill is designed but it is extremely difficult to get people to believe them.  The truth of it is that this is one of the more grotesque brain children of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he wants to bury it.  He knows that industrial alcohol has gone up the spout, that it is a fraud, that it has been exposed as a laughable piece of codology and a shameless waste of public money.  He knows that no rational man in Europe would sanction, in the times in which we live, the shipping of treacle from Cuba in order to manufacture it into industrial alcohol in Ballycroy.  Therefore, we are going to extend the functions of this company.  Why?  Because we want to drop the manufacture of industrial alcohol in at least three of the factories and cover up our tracks in the process.  He is ashamed to come before the House and say that this imbecile enterprise on which the Government embarked ten years ago has now finally collapsed, that we have got <Col N="1657" /> to dismantle the factories and sell them at the best price we can get.  That is the right thing to do.  But he is ashamed to admit that and so he wants to spend another £250,000 in saving the Fianna Fáil face and, particularly, his own.  He is the great genius of the land.  When the Tánaiste waves his hand, the largest office building in Dublin goes up in Kildare Street.  When the Tánaiste waves his hand, industries spring up all over the country.  When the Tánaiste waves his hand, millions march off to work, though we still await the day when he will snap his fingers and the first contingents of exiles will come sailing across the sea to fill up the positions which his genius has created for the labouring masses. I wish he would go down and see what happened in Ballycroy when he waved his hand.  He would see a deserted, abandoned wreck.  Our money paid the bill and it is now going to cost us as much more to get rid of it.  If we could get rid of it and cut our losses, that would be something.  But not at all.  The existence of these factories is to be justified.  They are all to start on research into the methods of manufacturing sulphate of ammonia.  Does any Deputy believe that tripe?  Does any Deputy believe that the methods of manufacturing sulphate of ammonia have not been exhaustively examined by Imperial Chemicals, Dupont's and the German dyers?  Is there any Deputy so idiotic as not to know that if he walks over to the National Library, the librarian will give him books wherein the several methods of manufacture of this product are set out in detail?  This business about research is the purest eyewash and fraud.  It is designed to pull the wool over the less sophisticated members of this House and, to judge from the source of the attempt, there will be little difficulty in determining where the bulk of them sit.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge to any person who is interested in agriculture, never mind industry, that the methods of manufacturing sulphate of ammonia fall into two groups.  Number 1 group is that whereunder you must manufacture the raw materials&mdash;hydrogen and nitrogen&mdash;yourself.  The other group <Col N="1658" /> of methods are those dependent on the user of by-products of other industrial processes.  Those persons who have access to the by-products of those industrial processes could acquire them as raw materials for this industry for virtually nothing.  If the by-products were allowed to evaporate into the air, they would be useless but, by confining and collecting them, instead of allowing them to evaporate, the manufacturers are able to get by-product prices for them from people who want to manufacture sulphate of ammonia. But if you set out to manufacture these raw materials in whatever from you want them&mdash;liquid or gaseous&mdash;by an industrial process primarily designed for their production, instead of having them at by-product prices, you will have them at the highest price at which it is possible to obtain them.  If you enter upon the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia from raw materials that cost you infinitely more than they would cost if obtained from persons more advantageously placed&mdash; in centres where other industries are conducted&mdash;the result will be that sulphate of ammonia will cost more to produce here.  If it costs more to produce here, it will cost the farmer who uses it more.  Deputy Hughes talks of the comparative value of Chilean nitrate and sulphate of ammonia.  How much Chilean nitrate will come into the country once the wizard beyond enters upon the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia?  There will be a prohibition on it.  Farmers will be told to take nitrogen for their land in the form of sulphate of ammonia or to do without it.  Furthermore, they will be told to take it and like it at the price they are told to pay. If anybody dares to protest, he will be told that he is sabotaging Irish industry and playing England's game and there will be poor &ldquo;goms&rdquo; up and down the country innocent and foolish enough to repeat that kind of trash as so many parrots.</P>
    <P>Is there a Deputy in this House who wants to raise the price of sulphate of ammonia by 2/6 to the farmers? There are five Fianna Fáil members in the House now.  Is there any one of the five who wants to do that?  Is there any one of the five who doubts <Col N="1659" /> that sulphate of ammonia will cost the farmer more if we proceed on these lines?  Remember what the Minister for Agriculture himself has said.  Do you believe that your own Minister for Agriculture was telling a lie when he stood up in that bench and said he forbade this plan because he knew it would result in additional cost being put upon the farmers?  If he spoke truly, do members of the Fianna Fáil Party think he was wrong and that we ought to put a charge, in perpetuity, on the land?  Are the Deputies on the far side so puerile that they are afraid to face that dilemma?  Are they afraid to make up their minds?</P>

    <P>The last reason for which I implore the House to vote against the Bill is <Col N="1660" /> as follows.  Section 8, incidentally, is the section under which the importation of anything which is a rival to the sulphate of ammonia manufactured by the Tánaiste will be prohibited. Section 11 has an interesting history. It appears to refer to stamp duty, but does the House know to what it really refers?  Match-heads&mdash;a daft, crazy scheme for manufacturing chlorate of potash to incorporate in the heads of matches.  Does the House know the history of it?  At one stage, when we were preparing to hurl back the combined forces of the German Reich, the United States of America and the British Commonwealth of Nations, which, as we remember, were all about to invade us at any moment, we determined that the most effective instrument for that purpose was a smoke-bomb and, accordingly, plant was installed in the Magazine in the Park to manufacture smoke-bombs.  The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, I need scarcely tell you, was at the back of this project.</P>

      <P>Section 11 was put into the Bill to take over from the Army all the rubbish collected by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures for the manufacture of smoke-bombs in the Park.  One would never dream that, to read it, but that is its purpose, and I dare the Minister to deny it.  In the process of manufacturing the smoke-bombs, he scorched all the trees in the Park and when the threatening invader had been disposed of, the chief ranger in the Park said: &ldquo;For God's sake, take yourself and your smoke-bombs out of the Park, or there will not be a blade of grass left or a leaf left on a tree.&rdquo; The Minister was evicted, leaving behind him the treasure trove which he had planted there to manufacture the smoke-bombs.  One of the constituents <Col N="1661" /> of these potent weapons of defence is, I think, called chlorate of potash.  It is a chemical product which is an integral part of a smoke-bomb, but which can also be used as an integral part of the head of a safety match.  The wizard of industry, the Tánaiste, then had a brain-wave.  He would take over the smoke-bomb apparatus and start a grand new industry in Ireland, the manufacture of the raw material for the heads of safety matches.  There is only one firm manufacturing safety matches in this country&mdash;Messrs. Maguire and Paterson&mdash;and a deputation from the Government was dispatched to the board of Messrs. Maguire and Paterson to find out if they would buy the products of this factory.  If my information is correct, the board said: &ldquo;No, we will not.&rdquo;  Further representations were made and the board eventually said: &ldquo;What do you want to charge us for it?&rdquo; to which the reply was &ldquo;7/6 per lb.&rdquo;  Messrs. Maguire and Paterson said: &ldquo;We can buy it for 4/6 in abundance in Liverpool or from any factory in Great Britain but, for the sake of peace and because you were very kind to us in the Budget a couple of years ago when you knocked ? of a 1d. off the box of matches and left it to us, if you, the Government, like to pay out of the pockets of the taxpayer the difference between 4/6 and 7/6, we will give you 4/6 for the chlorate of potash.&rdquo;  Section 11 is the charter of this great new industrial development in Ireland to manufacture a commodity which is to cost us 3/- a lb. so long as we produce it.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary wants to know how many it will employ.  I do not know, but of this the Deputy may be pretty sure: if it employs a manager, a secretary, two assistant secretaries and a dozen workmen, it would pay this country well to give them all their salaries in perpetuity, with the right of survival to their children and their children's children, under a plan analogous to the pension scheme in respect of Lord Nelson of Trafalgar, and it would save us money.  Do not let us yield <Col N="1662" /> to the superstition that work is something we ought to yearn for.  In so far as we can occupy our faculties outside the process of earning our living, we may use them far better than in the manual labour required to make chlorate of potash for the heads of safety matches, and if all these people can be pensioned and allowed to follow their bent or their hobby, or to use their faculties in some other direction, we should not compel them to make chlorate of potash and lose money on the transaction, if it would be cheaper to give them pensions.</P>
      <P>I am so sick of watching this combination of fraud, pretence and deceit, so sick of seeing our people corrupted by misrepresentation as to what is being done in their name, that I sometimes almost despair of restoring any kind of decency or straight-forwardness in the public life of this country. I know the rotten and fraudulent propaganda which will be started in connection with this Bill and I know the shameless clamour which will be initiated to blackmail the agricultural community into accepting this burden of 2/6 per acre in perpetuity as a patriotic duty.  There is nothing patriotic about it; there is nothing commonsense about it; there is nothing in it but an effort to save the face of Fianna Fáil and justify the various economic imbecilities with which they have tied themselves into knots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it right, however, to say this in conclusion: so long as you have a majority in the House, you can do these things, but they will be undone sometime. Have no doubt of that.  All these shameful and rotten transactions will one day be put right.  The longer they are allowed to survive, the more precarious the state of our people will become and the greater the hardships which the simple people who live upon the land will have to endure.  It is their democratic right to choose that if they will, but, some day, reason and decency will reassert themselves in this country, and, when they do, this kind of folly will disappear, all the other blisters which Fianna Fáil have put upon our people will be remedied, the resources of our people, the wealth of our people, will be used for worthwhile things and these imbecilities will <Col N="1663" /> survive only in their memory as a warning of the price which has to be paid for putting people like the Tánaiste in the position he occupies to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Hughes misunderstood the provisions of the Bill in one important respect.  He referred to my observations that the Bill contains no proposals for altering the financial structure of the company and assumed therefrom that it would not have available to it capital resources to undertake new forms of manufacture without fresh legislation.  That is not quite the position.  I stated that the company could not undertake any new form of manufacture involving a substantial capital expenditure without fresh legislation; but there is available under the original Act a proportion of the amount there provided, which could be utilised to finance a limited extension of the company's activities. The original Act authorised the Minister for Finance to invest in the shares of the company to a maximum limit of £500,000, but the total amount invested under that provision by the Minister for Finance is approximately £275,000.  So it will be appreciated that the company could extend the scope of its activities in some directions and to a limited extent, without the necessity for fresh legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>To the extent of £225,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I did state was that any major development, such as the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia, would involve additional capital far in excess of that unused balance and could not, therefore, be undertaken without fresh legislation to provide the capital required.  There is a provision in the Bill to ensure that any proposal to authorise the company to engage in the manufacture of a chemical product must be published, so that private business firms who feel that their interests might be adversely affected by the proposal will have an opportunity of knowing what is intended and making objection.  That publication of intention to license the company to undertake any form of chemical manufacture ensures that there will be no extension of the company's <Col N="1664" /> activities without due notice.</P>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy Hughes had in mind when he said that this company would not have available to it expert advice on the matters which it is going to examine or concerning the production of chemicals on which it might engage.  It will have available to it, either in its own organisation or otherwise, the most expert advice that is available in the country, and I cannot imagine any more suitable organisation to carry out the investigations which we contemplate than this company.  Whatever objections there may be to the continuance of industrial alcohol manufacture, I do not think it can be seriously contended by any responsible person that the organisation of this company is not eminently suitable for the work we are now proposing to give it, or that the scientific and engineering staff available to it are not as highly competent as any similar body in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the company has been in some way at fault in carrying on the manufacture of industrial alcohol.  I doubt if that suggestion can be supported by any reference to the facts.  It is true, of course, that the facts have been distorted. Not merely have they been distorted during debates in this House, by a Deputy from whom we expect nothing else, but they have been, to my astonishment, distorted in no less a place than the leading article column of the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  I stated, when introducing the Industrial Alcohol Bill originally, that industrial alcohol could be sold at a profit by this company at 3/- a gallon.  I find that the <i>Irish Independent</i> misquoted that statement in an extraordinary manner: they gave me as having stated that industrial alcohol would be sold at a profit of 3/- a gallon.  A statement that it could be sold at 3/- a gallon at a profit is entirely a different statement from that attributed to me, that it could sell at a profit of 3/- a gallon.  In fact, the <i>Irish Independent</i> proceeded to make a fantastic calculation based upon that misinterpretation, to the effect that the company should have made a profit of £225,000 per year, which would represent very nearly a 100 per cent. return on the invested <Col N="1665" /> capital.  If they had attempted to advert to the known facts, they would have realised how fantastic was that assumption and the calculation based on it.  That, however, is the statement I made&mdash;that, on the basis of costs as existing before the war, the known price of fuel, the anticipated wages that would be paid to the workers employed and the cost of the potatoes and barley that would be purchased as materials, industrial alcohol would be manufactured and sold at 3/- a gallon and at that price would realise a profit. In fact, that happened.  Industrial alcohol produced by the company before the war was sold at 3/- a gallon and realised a profit.</P>
    <P>During the war years, as I said in introducing the Bill, the production was irregular.  The House will remember that one of the primary purposes in establishing the industry was to operate a device by which a floor would be put to potato prices.  It was felt that, if there were an organisation in the company, prepared to purchase potatoes at a previously announced price and take all those that might be offered to them, it would effectively prevent potatoes falling to an uneconomic level, as they had done for many years prior to the war.  During the war, of course, entirely different circumstances operated and the factories were only brought into production from time to time as circumstances appeared to require.  It was certainly not desired to attract to the factories, for the purpose of manufacturing into industrial alcohol, potatoes that might be required for other more necessary purposes.  Consequently, the experience of the war years is no reliable guide to the normal costs of producing industrial alcohol.  Prices were fixed in relation to the actual cost and so as to prevent the company making a loss.</P>
    <P>Before the war, the company had utilised imported molasses to supplement its output from potatoes and latterly it has made arrangements to resume the importation of molasses to a limited extent.  Any increase in production which results, or improved continuity of production over a longer season will, of course, effectively <Col N="1666" /> reduce the operating costs.  This year the company has experimented in the production of alcohol from sugar beet &mdash;sugar beet which was grown mainly in Donegal and in other areas in which beet for the manufacture of sugar was not grown previously and where, in fact, it would not be economic to grow it for sugar.  A limited acreage was contracted for and grown, but the results of that working are not yet fully known.</P>
    <P>With regard to sulphate of ammonia, I want to make it clear that, whatever may be the results of manufacturing it in this country, the position is at present&mdash;and will be for the future&mdash; that, if we do not undertake its manufacture ourselves, we will be dependent for a supply on a monopoly concern operating in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which will supply us with whatever quantity they consider convenient and at whatever price they choose to charge.  Deputies opposite may regard that as a more desirable arrangement than having it <Col N="1667" /> manufactured here.  I could not agree with that point of view.  It seems to me to be economic imbecility, a phrase which I heard while dozing here.  I do not know in what connection it was used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it suits the point of view which Deputies opposite have expressed.  We examined the possibility of manufacturing sulphate of ammonia before the war.  May I say, in passing, that nothing which the Minister for Agriculture has said in that connection differs from what I have said?  We examined it very carefully because it appeared to be an industry suitable to this country.  It is true that it requires a great deal of electricity, and that we could not hope to provide the large amount of electricity required at as low price as electricity can be generated and supplied in some other countries; but there were natural advantages, including the large deposits of gypsum in the County Monaghan, a necessary raw material, which would off-set the higher charges that would exist here for electricity, and which appeared to make it possible for us to produce sulphate of ammonia as economically as it was or is being produced in any other country.  There was a protracted examination.  At the time, the price of sulphate of ammonia here was an uneconomic price.  The price had been cut for supplies to this country. Deputies can work out for themselves why that should have been so: why a concern in another country should sell sulphate of ammonia here at a lower price than it was selling it in the country where it was being produced. But that was so.  It gave a temporary advantage to purchasers of sulphate of ammonia in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various processes of production, and we had to consider which process was most suited to our circumstances, or most likely to be economic in operation here.  There was a very strong desire on the part of the Minister for Agriculture that we should so endeavour to organise the <Col N="1668" /> production here as to involve no increase in price.  It seemed from the examination we gave it that some increase in price, over and above that actually prevailing here at the time, would be necessary by any of the processes which we investigated.  The price at which we could have manufactured it before the war was about £6 10s. 0d. a ton.  The price at which it was being supplied at the time was about £6 a ton.  The difference was regarded as not being inconsiderable before the war.  The price to-day is £17 a ton.  If we had succeeded in establishing the industry here before the war&mdash;the most substantial item in the cost of production is the capital charge arising from the provision and erection of the plant&mdash;we would have it now at a price which would probably be less than half the price at which we can buy from abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, we did not succeed in doing so.  Now, whether it would be practicable to establish the industry here in the near future is a matter for investigation.  Clearly, we could not supply the quantity of electricity earlier than probably the year 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, however, it would certainly be that year before we could hope to have the plant established and in production.  Whether it would be possible to get delivery in time of the substantial plant and equipment which would be necessary, is also a matter for examination.  There are still some questions to be settled concerning the process to be used and certain other matters upon which competent technical opinion would be required, including the location of the plant.  These are matters which we hope this company will examine, and examine with the intention of solving <Col N="1669" /> any difficulties that may exist, and so make possible the establishment of the industry here.  If they do succeed in solving the remaining difficulties and convince the Government that the establishment of the industry is practicable then the procedure set out in the Bill, and outlined by me in introducing the Bill, will be followed. Notice will be given, and if, following on the publication of that notice and the consideration of any objections that may be forthcoming from persons interested in the industry here, it is decided to grant a licence, then we will have to come back to the Dáil with a new Bill to provide the capital required, and the Dáil will have an ample opportunity of discussing the matter and of deciding on the issue involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any agricultural expert that the Deputy can think of is available. I should like to make it clear, <Col N="1670" /> however, that if it should be decided to go ahead with the industry&mdash;and I hope myself it will prove to be practicable because I think it is a particularly suitable industry for us to contemplate&mdash;then the merits of the proposition can be fully debated here. There is certainly no intention to put a tax on any land in order to start the industry.</P>
      <P>The manufacture of chemicals required for the production of explosives, and utilised during the war for the production of matches, by the Department of Defence, has terminated.  I expressed here on the Second Reading a considerable doubt as to whether any of those electro-chemical industries will prove practicable in this country, very largely because of the high cost of electricity as compared with certain other countries, and for certain other reasons.  Deputy Dillon, of course, is completely misinformed in that regard. The attitude of the firm to which he referred was that they wished to take over this plant and process from the Department of Defence and continue the manufacture of those chemicals. They were produced at that plant by the Department of Defence at a high cost.  That is admitted.  The plant was a very make-shift affair, and the system of organising the factory was not conducive to economical working, but they did ensure a supply of an essential commodity for the period during the war when that commodity could not be obtained otherwise. Whether or not this company will engage in the production of these chemicals is a very open matter.  I do not want to suggest that it will do so. The possibility of production on a more economic basis than has proved practicable up to the present will be investigated by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any other matter that I want to deal with.  The purpose of this Bill is clearly limited to extending the powers of the company so that it can legally investigate these commercial possibilities which we have in mind and carry on these different forms of manufacture, if it should be licensed to do so, in accordance with the provisions set out in the Bill.  We could have set up <Col N="1671" /> another organisation for the purpose. If we had done so, there would have been at least a saving of Dáil time, and a certain saving of wind on the part of a certain Deputy if we had established another organisation instead of using the existing organisation, the Industrial Alcohol Company, but it seemed to us to be a more efficient and a more economical arrangement to use the organisation of that company.  That is why the Bill is on these lines.</P>

    <Title>Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1946&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to implement an arrangement for enabling payment of benefit in respect of unemployment insurance contributions acquired in the British unemployment fund, by reason of service in the British forces during the war, to be made out of that fund to men and women ordinarily resident in this country who are unemployed on their return here.  The Bill also provides for the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Acts so as to enable unemployment benefit in respect of unemployment insurance contributions acquired in our unemployment fund by reason of service in the Defence Forces to be paid out of that fund to certain unemployed, demobilised members of the Defence Forces resident in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the question of making with the British authorities a reciprocal arrangement for the payment of unemployment insurance benefit to persons in credit in one fund while unemployed and resident in the other country has been taken up with the British authorities on a number of occasions.  It was following a renewed approach in that matter that the arrangement concerning ex-members of the British forces emerged.  These proposals were discussed at a conference held in London last July and the implementation of the arrangement necessitated legislation both in Great Britain and here.  The British legislation, entitled the Unemployment Insurance (Éire Volunteers) Act, 1946, was recently enacted and enables effect to be given to the arrangement on the British side.  That British Act provides that the cost of paying benefit to persons concerned will be met by the Minister of National Insurance out of the British unemployment fund and for that purpose advances will be made out of that fund to meet the estimated cost.  The implementing legislation here is embodied in the provisions of this Bill relating to special benefit which may be brought into operation by Order.</P>
      <P>The British proposals also suggested the opening of discussions for the purpose of examining the question of making a reciprocal arrangement of general application, that is to say, of application to civilian workers under the British National Insurance Act, 1946.  The provisions of that Act relating to unemployment insurance will, however, not come into force for some time yet and, until they are in force, the British authorities will have no legal power to enter into such a reciprocal arrangement.  It is expected, however, that discussions concerning a reciprocal arrangement of that character will be opened in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they agreed to enter into this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1675" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They have agreed to enter into discussions concerning the matter.  This Bill provides for the payment, during the period of operation of the arrangement, of special benefit to unemployed discharged members of the British forces with service in these forces at any time during the war period, which is defined as the period between 3rd September, 1939, and 14th August, 1945, who were ordinarily resident in this country before that period of service and in respect of whom not less than 30 contributions have been credited in the British unemployment fund in respect of the two years immediately preceding the first claim for benefit.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for special benefit will be subject to the fulfilment of the conditions and to freedom from the disqualifications for the receipt of unemployment benefit under our Acts as now in force here, other than the conditions and disqualifications relating to unemployment insurance contributions paid under these Acts, which are, of course, inappropriate.  Special benefit will be payable at the appropriate rate of unemployment benefit payable under the British Acts.  Increases of special benefit in respect of one adult dependent and not more than two child dependents within the meaning of our unemployment insurance code will be payable to the same rate as increases of unemployment benefit in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase, under the British legislation at present in force, in respect of an adult dependent is 16/- per week and in respect of each of the first two dependent children 5/- per week.  The aggregate amount of special benefit payable to any beneficiary under the Bill will be equivalent to the amount which would be payable at the appropriate British rates, including payments in respect of dependents, for a period of 180 days.  That aggregate amount will be subject to reduction in any case in which unemployment benefit has, since the claimant was discharged from the British Forces, been paid in Great Britain.  There is power to reduce the rates of special benefit but not to alter the aggregate amount payable.  A reduction, therefore, in the <Col N="1676" /> rates of benefit would involve an extension of the period of 180 days provided for in the agreement.</P>
    <P>The existing machinery established under our Unemployment Insurance Acts in connection with the determination of claims to benefit and questions arising on claims by insurance officers and by courts of referees and the umpire will apply to claims for special benefit and all questions arising in connection therewith.  There will be a right of appeal to a court of referees against a decision of an insurance officer, with further right of appeal, in the usual circumstances, to the umpire, whose decision will be final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>Under the Acts in force here, the determination of questions as to whether additional benefit in respect of dependents is payable devolves on the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The same arrangements are proposed for the determination of questions in connection with additional special benefits in respect of dependents. Except in so far as they are inconsistent with the arrangement, the provisions of our Acts and the regulations under our Acts will apply to special benefit.  Sums which are received by way of special benefit whilst statutory conditions are not fulfilled will be recoverable from the recipients under the provisions of our Acts.</P>
    <P>There is a special scheme of insurance established under the Unemployment Insurance Acts for persons employed in the insurance industry. Persons insured under that scheme receive payments of out-of-work benefit when unemployed and are otherwise qualified.  Neither that out-of-work benefit, nor unemployment benefit out of the unemployment fund, nor unemployment assistance under the existing unemployment assistance scheme, will be payable in respect of any day for which special benefit is payable.  The lapse of time during which a person is receiving such benefit will not, however, affect any rights to unemployment benefit under our Unemployment Insurance Act or out-of-work benefit under the insurance industry's special scheme which had been acquired before receiving special benefit and which he might otherwise lose.  As I have <Col N="1677" /> stated, the cost of paying the special benefit will be met out of the British unemployment fund.  The Bill, however, provides that the cost of administration, which would be difficult to determine and would not be very considerable, will be paid out of the moneys voted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As regards the other Part of the Bill, the position is that under our Unemployment Insurance Acts, unemployment insurance contributions in respect of full-time service in the Defence Forces since the 2nd September, 1939, are credited in the unemployment fund to certain discharged members of the forces.  Contributions in that fund are not, however, as the law stands, available for benefit purposes to persons resident outside our territory.  Under the provisions of the Bill, unemployment benefit in respect of contributions credited by reason of service with the Defence Forces will during residence in the Six Counties be payable to unemployed demobilised soldiers who were ordinarily resident in that area at any time before enlistment and who are otherwise qualified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there reciprocity on the part of the Six-County people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the arrangement made with the British authorities applies in respect of the Six Counties. It was not considered necessary, however, to make an arrangement of a similar character in regard to payments from our fund to our soldiers in the Six County area because the number is very small.  I think the number of claims to date does not exceed one dozen and no special arrangement is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that Section 8, sub-section (4), of the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920 may not, through lapse of time since the soldier was discharged from the forces, disqualify him from receiving unemployment benefit, the insurance year following his discharge will be ignored if no unemployment insurance contributions were paid during that year.  Deputies will appreciate that, under the law as it stands, if no unemployment insurance contributions were paid during a year, then previously paid contributions are not eligible for benefit purposes until additional <Col N="1678" /> contributions have been paid. Because of the lapse of time, that provision might operate to disqualify our soldiers resident in Northern Ireland from availing of this scheme and, consequently, we are providing here that that year, if no contributions were paid in it, will be ignored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would excused contributions for the subsequent year also operate in his favour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that these soldiers are now in benefit and will be entitled to draw benefit within the limits prescribed in the Act.  They will not, however, be able to draw benefit continuously unless there are other contributions paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At present you are giving him a free year and therefore it operates in this manner, that if the soldier does not pay contributions within a year after his discharge from the Army, his right to benefit still holds good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose you get a case in which the soldier does not pay any contributions for a year after the discharge, because he is in bad health, and suppose the bad health continues for 15 months, not for 12 months, do I take it that the extra three months of the second year will not operate against him, in other words, that they will be regarded as what are described as excused periods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it this way: those soldiers, ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland, were demobilised from the Army here.  On demobilisation, they were placed in credit in the unemployment fund.  Benefit could not be paid in respect of that credit, however, because they were resident outside our territory.  We are now proposing to pay them benefit in respect of that credit even though they are resident outside our territory.  Unless, however, we ignore the year that has elapsed since they have been demobilised, there are other provisions in the Act which will prevent them getting it. We are proposing to direct that these other provisions will be ignored, that that year which has passed will be <Col N="1679" /> deemed not to have existed, so that they will be immediately in credit in our fund and will be able to draw benefit if they are eligible, that is, if they are unemployed and otherwise conform to the requirements for receiving benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly clear, but I want to know the position if in the second year a soldier is ill for a period.  If resident here, the period of illness would be regarded as an excused period.  Would that also operate in the case of the person resident outside our territory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as they are concerned, they are being put in precisely the same position as any other person in benefit in the unemployment insurance fund.  The one thing that has disqualified them for receiving benefit, namely, the fact that they were resident outside our territory, is being removed.  Similar provision is being made in respect of any soldiers of our forces resident in Northern Ireland who would be entitled, not to unemployment insurance benefit, but to out-of-work benefit under the insurance industry's special scheme.  These are the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would have much preferred to have brought here a Bill implementing a more general arrangement with the British authorities providing for some reciprocal scheme for the payment of unemployment insurance benefit in respect of all classes of workers and not merely soldiers demobilised from the forces.  The position is, however, that the British authorities are only now acquiring the legal power to make such reciprocal arrangements.  These powers will become effective when the appropriate part of the National Insurance Act is brought into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to its coming into operation, there will be discussions which we hope will result in some satisfactory arrangement between the two countries.  In the meantime there is no reason why we should not carry out this more limited arrangement which will ensure the payment through our organisation of unemployment insurance at British rates to British ex-soldiers resident in <Col N="1680" /> this country who would otherwise be debarred from receiving any benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We have on many occasions before approached the British authorities with a view to having a wider and a more permanent scheme in respect to unemployment insurance brought into operation on somewhat the same lines as obtain in regard to national health insurance. There are a number of substantial difficulties to be overcome but a decision has now been made to meet in an endeavour to work out a practical scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must not have been listening to me.  I have already spoken at considerable length on that matter.  This Bill relates only to former members of the British forces.  The Bill as it stands will enable benefits to be paid at British rates to ex-members of the British forces resident here subject to a maximum period of 180 days.  Under the Bill power is given to reduce the rate of benefit and to extend the period of payment but not to reduce the aggregate amount which a man may get.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister quite grasped the query put to him by Deputy Byrne.  I am sure Deputy Byrne meant to ask the Minister whether he proposes at an early date to make representations to the British authorities with a view to securing the payment of benefit for men who worked in munition factories and in other types of employment during the war and who are now resident here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, and I think all sections in the House will welcome it, firstly, as an effort on the part of the British Government to repay the obvious debt of gratitude which they owe to those who served in the British forces, who accumulated unemployment insurance rights under the British statutory law, and who were unable to execute these rights against the British Government because of the fact that they reside here.  The fact that the British Government has now recognised the rights of those who served in the British army to unemployment benefit at the rates appropriate to the British Acts is, I think, a welcome gesture so far as this House and the country generally is concerned.  We all share with the Minister the view that reciprocal arrangements ought to extend much further than they do, so far as this Bill is concerned.  The sole purpose of the Bill is to make the reciprocal arrangements operate so far as demobilised British army personnel are concerned.  While that does meet some part of the problem, it fails to meet the bigger problem which is to have reciprocal arrangements made to cover the large number of our people who worked in British industries and munition factories during the war.  The Minister has indicated that under the new British Insurance Act, the Minister for National Insurance in Britain has taken power which will enable him to enter into discussions on the question of reciprocity with our Government here.  That is a welcome development. <Col N="1682" /> I gathered from what the Minister said that it is his intention to initiate these discussions even before the British Government have taken power to enter into reciprocal arrangements.  I hope that every effort will be made to impress on the British Government the debt of gratitude which they owe to those who manned the British factories during what was for Britain a very critical period and those who served in the organised and regimented classes of employment to which they were allocated during the years of the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government knows very well that each week our people are employed in British factories, unemployment insurance contributions are deducted from them and it is quite obviously unfair for the British Government to deduct contributions with the wilful knowledge that these contributions can never enable the insured person to receive benefit if he exercises his natural right ultimately to leave that employment and return to this country.  It is true that he can claim unemployment benefit if he is unemployed and remains in Britain but if, as is the natural development for almost all of these persons, they give up their employment at some time and return to their families in this country or to employment in this country, the payment of contributions whilst a man is employed in England means that when he comes back to his family here he cannot execute a claim for unemployment benefit against the British Government unless he has served in the forces.  He cannot enforce a claim if he worked at any other type of employment in Britain.  I know the Minister is alive to the importance of this discussion because of the substantial movement of our population to Britain during the war years.  I know the matter will be pressed but I think it would be quite appropriate to make it clear in this House on this Bill that all Parties in the House recognise that the British Government has a moral obligation in this matter to enter into reciprocal arrangements under which people who worked in Britain during the past seven years will be entitled to claim unemployment insurance benefit when they become unemployed here. These people made a very substantial <Col N="1683" /> contribution to British production during the war and they have every right to be paid unemployment benefits by Britain if they exercise their right to return to this country.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Bill to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention and that is the difficulty of ascertaining what rate of benefit a man is likely to get under the Bill.  It would be necessary to read the Minister's speech to get that information. I can see the difficulty of embodying a schedule in the Bill because of the fact that the rates of benefit may vary from time to time but I should like to see some provision made to enable a person to know what he is going to get under the Bill.  It is not possible to obtain that information by reference to the Bill.  I can see the difficulty of putting in a schedule but I suggest that the Minister might devise some way of making the British rates known to those who want to make claims for benefit under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I think that the principle enshrined in it should long ago have been given effect in the case of the many thousands of workers who have been compelled to go into employment in Britain.  I am disappointed that it has not been possible to include in the Bill members of what may be described as a civilian army.  We all know that those who left the country during the war period were under control.  They did not go to Britain when they liked and they did not go to whatever part they liked. They had to go to those places for which they were booked and British officialdom has complete records of their places of residence during the war period and of the time they spent at each place, even down to hours. Seeing that nothing is impossible in accountancy nowadays between nations, I fail to see why the civilian army could not have been included in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sad aspect of this matter is the number of widows who have got pensions neither from the British Government nor from the Irish Government. Through some bungling in Britain, there was no record of their husbands' <Col N="1684" /> service.  Some men who went across did not attach themselves to approved societies and the welfare officers seem to have been so busily attending to the welfare of others that they overlooked those men.  As a result, many widows are compelled to live on home assistance or go into employment.  If they go into employment, they cannot qualify for a non-contributory pension. The Minister may not be aware of the extent of that unfortunate situation.  It is a matter which I hope will be considered in later advances under this scheme.  I must express disappointment that men who were in uniform can be provided for while men who did not put on uniform are unprovided for. The Government had just as great a check on the men and women who went into civilian service, called the &ldquo;national effort&rdquo; or the &ldquo;war effort&rdquo;, as they had on the men in uniform and they should have been included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister and his Department on bringing about this very satisfactory state of affairs.  I join with other members in giving all the encouragement possible to the Minister to press for a scheme of reciprocity for the large civilian army which went over to munition areas in England.  Many of our men lost their lives in the bombed areas there.  They took all the risks they were asked to take and they were fully under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They could not move from one area to another without the consent of the authorities, and the conditions under which they worked were in accordance with Government regulations.  I encourage the Minister to go ahead and see what can be done for these men. There are haphazard guesses at the number of men who went over to England in those years.  The number 100,000 and the number 175,000 have been mentioned, and others say that between those joining the British Army and civilian workers, 300,000 men and women did their part to the best of their ability.  While this friendly feeling exists between the Minister's Department and the British Department, I hope the Minister will achieve something more and that those men who <Col N="1685" /> have five or six years' British stamps to their credit will get some benefit.</P>
    <P>One of the sections of this Bill states that the increase of unemployment benefit in respect of dependent children will be limited to not more than two.  We all know that workers' families in Ireland are very large.  They number from six to eight very often, and what is to happen a man who has four or five dependent children?  If it were possible to increase the maximum number from two to whatever figure will be applicable here at the time, the Minister would be doing good work.  Is there any flaw in the agreement which is not obvious at the moment?  For instance, will a widow be entitled to the widows' and orphans' pension? Will she get the pension on a contributory or non-contributory basis?  Will these arrangements entitle the widow to get the British benefits or, if they do not, will she be disqualified from getting ours?  Will she be told that British stamps do not apply in this area and that, therefore, she is not entitled to the widows' and orphans' pension?  If anything is left out, the Minister might be good enough to tell us.  A number of us in this House had pleaded for these reciprocal arrangements. I congratulate the Minister on his achievement and I hope he will go further and meet with the same cordial and friendly reception when negotiating on behalf of civilian workers as he met with in the case of soldiers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his Department on this agreement and on the very friendly negotiations which are in progress between the Minister's Department and the Ministry of Labour in England.  I make a special appeal to the Minister to have those friendly negotiations continued.  Special interest has been aroused amongst the emigrants who are presently employed in Great Britain as a result of the legislation before the House, which provides only for those Irish citizens who joined the British Defence Forces.  As Deputy Pattison pointed out, the civilian army is deserving of most sympathetic consideration. I understand that groups of Irish citizens employed in England are holding meetings there requesting the Ministry of Labour to enter into negotiations <Col N="1686" /> with the Minister's Department with a view to seeing that allowances will be paid in respect of the amounts deducted, under the unemployment regulations, from wages in England.  Like other Deputies, I have received a request in this connection.</P>
      <P>At a public meeting in Bristol, at the Irish Social Club, the following resolution was adopted: &ldquo;That we communicate with representatives of the Dáil relative to the Unemployment Insurance Bill, the text of which has been made public recently, to the effect that Irishmen who served in the British Forces during the war are to receive full benefit from British stamps in Ireland.  We Irish workers, therefore, claim the same rights, as thousands of Irishmen have been working here for the past six years.&rdquo;  I believe that the request which Irish workers in Great Britain are making is a very reasonable one.  I was very proud to listen to the statement made by the Minister to the effect that he is in negotiation with the responsible authorities in Great Britain, and I hope that these negotiations may bring to a satisfactory conclusion the demands of the Irish workers over there.  These men rallied to the cause in Great Britain for five or six years when they could not secure suitable employment in order to maintain their families at home and special consideration should be given in view of the very large number affected. Deputy Byrne gave a rough estimate of the numbers and said that one figure mentioned was 175,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These men and women, together with their relatives here, would deeply appreciate it if legislation to cover them were introduced and I am sure that such legislation would be welcomed by all sides.  I believe, with Deputy Norton, that there is a moral obligation on the British Government to treat fairly and justly these workers who rallied to their cause.  It is a grave injustice that these people cannot secure benefit in respect of the stamps they hold and in respect of which deductions were made from their wages in Great Britain.  Many of those who are anxious to return to Ireland are prevented from doing so by the knowledge that no provision exists for the grant of benefit in respect of five <Col N="1687" /> or six years' stamps which they have to their credit.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure sincerely and I am glad to note that the British rates are to be paid.  These rates are most satisfactory, but I suggest that, when these rates are paid to those who qualify, there will be a certain amount of discontent amongst the large numbers of Irish workers who, we hope, will be covered by future legislation and who will qualify for the rates here. When the British are setting the example of paying the standard rates, the Minister should take the opportunity of increasing the rates payable here and so ensure that the benefits which those unfortunate enough to qualify will receive will at least be on the same scale as those payable by the British Government who have been good enough to agree to cover those who served in His Majesty's Forces in recent years.  The Minister deserves thanks for the successful outcome of the negotiations with the British Ministry of Labour, but I appeal to him to do everything he can to bring to a successful conclusion the negotiations in progress with regard to the huge army of civilians who deserve every consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister on his achievement, in cooperation with the British Government, in making it possible for Irish members of the Defence Forces of Great Britain to receive unemployment benefit in respect of contributions they paid into the unemployment insurance fund there; but, while congratulating him, I want to impress upon him the importance of being successful in his negotiations for the payment of unemployment insurance to those civilians who went across to England.  These civilians are in no way different from the people who donned the British uniform whether in the Royal Air Force, the Royal Navy or the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They took practically the same risks, in living in bombed areas, and they contributed to the war effort of Great Britain just as much as the others.  If what is sought is achieved, it will be no credit to the British Government <Col N="1688" /> because these Irishmen who left this country to secure work in Britain made their contributions to the fund in Britain and they were the man power which the British Government wanted to carry on the war successfully.  If it is achieved, the Irish people who will benefit will certainly owe nothing to the British Government.  England owes something to these people in so far as they did a job of work for her.  It was unfortunate that we had to export them, but when man power was at a premium, England was very glad to get them, and the least she can do is to make repayment in some way for the sacrifices which this country and the individuals themselves made.  With other Deputies, I congratulate the Minister on the successful result of the negotiations, but I press him to negotiate further with a view to securing the same benefits in relation to the payment of unemployment insurance for civilians, for the ordinary war-time workers who went across, at least.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour the desirability of introducing this measure.  I regard it as a measure which has come late in the day. Neither do I agree with some of the statements made about the debt of gratitude which Britain owes to our workers who went across.  Our workers had to go by reason of economic necessity and there is no use in destroying a good case by building it on a false thesis.  I have no doubt that, when the British Government are approached in the ordinary way, they will do justice to these people.  I am more concerned with the position of the widows of many of these men who went across.  I know numbers of cases in Cork of widows of men who died across-Channel while engaged on war work who are debarred from receiving either contributory or non-contributory pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are dozens of such cases in Cork City alone.  There is one case of a widow who applied for a non-contributory pension and whose claim was rejected on the ground that 104 weeks had not elapsed and 104 contributions under the Acts had not been paid by or in respect of her late husband from <Col N="1689" /> the date of his entry into insurance. Her claim was turned down simply because her husband went across to England and got work and naturally paid no contributions into the unemployment insurance fund here.  That is the kind of case the Minister had in view when he indicated that, at some later stage, he hoped to be able to make some further reciprocal arrangements with the authorities on the other side.</P>
    <P>I should say that, in this case, the referee confirmed the decision that she was not entitled to a pension, but she was informed later that her case had been reconsidered in the light of Emergency Powers No. 382 Order but that it had been decided that the provisions of the Order did not operate in her favour as her late husband was not insured for a period of 52 weeks and 52 contributions had not been paid by or in respect of him.  These are the types of cases the Minister should look into. They are not very numerous and the fact that they are small in number should appeal to him, as well as the fact that they are good sound cases for immediate attention in the matter of pension.</P>
    <P>The position in which our workers who contributed compulsorily to the insurance scheme on the other side were debarred from receiving benefit when they came over here, is remedied in this Bill, but I hope the Minister will also see his way to include in the further negotiations with the British authorities these people I have mentioned, widows whose husbands died in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped that discussions with the British authorities, for the purpose of examining the question of making reciprocal arrangements of general application under the British National Insurance Act of 1946, concerning unemployment insurance benefit payments will be opened in the very near future.  I want to make it clear that those discussions will have nothing whatever to do with widows' pensions. The discussions which may follow on the enactment of this Bill will relate to the possibility of introducing a scheme by which unemployment insurance benefit earned by reason of contributions paid in one country can be drawn <Col N="1690" /> by the individual concerned when resident and unemployed in the other country.  That has nothing whatever to do with the widows' pensions scheme, which is part of the national health insurance scheme, in so far as the contribution is collected by means of national health insurance stamps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, there is existing statutory authority for reciprocal arrangements relating to national health insurance and it would not need the enactment of new legislation to alter the present arrangements. There is at present no statutory authority, either here or in Great Britain, for reciprocal arrangements relating to unemployment insurance. The British have got that authority under their National Health Insurance Act, but the appropriate part of that Act is not yet in force.  The discussions will precede the coming into force of that part of their Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the fact that there are men who have worked in Great Britain during the emergency period and whose widows now are getting contributory pensions here because of a reciprocal arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The discussions I mentioned as pending with the British Ministry of National Insurance will relate to unemployment insurance and will not cover widows' pensions, which are a different matter, and so far as our organisation is concerned, are in the custody of another Minister.  Of course, there are difficulties which we must not ignore, but it will help to remove some of them if this scheme relating to ex-soldiers works effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefit under this Bill will be payable only to people who are unemployed. <Col N="1691" /> Deputies made reference to civilian workers in Great Britain earning credits in the British Unemployment Insurance Fund who might want to come home here.  The fact that they come home would not entitle them to benefit, even if there were reciprocal arrangements now, as persons are not entitled to benefit if they leave their work voluntarily and, of course, they are not entitled unless they are unemployed. These soldiers who have been demobilised are in benefit and will be in benefit when this Bill is passed, but they must fulfil every statutory condition which an Irish worker would have to fulfil to draw unemployment benefit, before they become entitled to draw the special benefit which the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>It is most important to us that we should enforce the Bill in that spirit, as if there should appear, to the British authorities, to be an inclination on our part to pay out their money to claimants here, without proper examination of their eligibility, they would be much more reluctant to enter into a reciprocal arrangement of wider application and of a permanent character later.  I think it is true to say that some of the difficulties in the mind of the British officials, arising in connection with such a reciprocal arrangement in the past, arose out of the fact that a number of workers who go for seasonal work or temporary employment in Great Britain are land owners here.  Many Deputies know that the problem of the land owner in relation to the unemployment insurance scheme is a perennial one with us.  We have had many arguments as to when an owner of a small farm of land can be deemed to be unemployed. We have held that he is not unemployed if there is work which he can do on his own land.  Many of the Irish workers in Great Britain who go for seasonal work and return here are in that class and I can anticipate very considerable difficulty in dealing with such workers, who will feel that, when it is a matter of paying out British money, we should show no hesitation in determining the facts of their case in their favour.  However, we will deal with that problem when it arises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> There are also difficulties by reason of the fact that our code has tended to diverge from the British code. Originally, there was one Act for both countries.  That divergence has not merely affected the rates of benefit and the rates of contribution, but has spread through all the code of legislation enforced here.  Some Deputy queried as to why the special benefit under this Bill is payable only in respect of two children.  That is one of the difficulties.  The British children's allowances scheme is different from ours, allowances ceasing to be payable when the worker becomes unemployed.  Instead of drawing his children's allowance, he goes on the unemployment insurance fund and draws the increase in benefits in respect of the children for which that fund provides.  Under our scheme, the children's allowances under the Children's Allowances Act are payable in all circumstances, whether the worker is employed or unemployed and the rates payable in respect of children under the unemployment insurance scheme and the unemployment assistance scheme take regard of that fact.</P>
    <P>In trying to adjust that difficulty, the British proposed the arrangement which this Bill contains&mdash;that the worker here entitled to benefit out of their fund will be paid benefit at their rate in respect of an adult dependent and two children, but will continue to draw the children's allowance under our scheme in respect of further dependent children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a person entitled to special benefit, he will draw it at the British rates and out of their fund in respect of his wife, himself and two children and he will continue to draw our children's allowance in respect of any further children.  If he were unemployed in Great Britain he would receive the same rate in respect of himself and his wife and two children, but would draw from the British unemployment assurance fund&mdash;and not from the children's allowances fund&mdash;in respect of additional children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be some difference, but it was the simplest method of adjusting the difficulty.  So far as the British payments are concerned, we will be acting as agents for the British authorities, paying their money to people entitled under their regulations.  The rates of benefit will be those in force in Great Britain.  To meet a point raised by Deputies, arrangements will be made to provide a leaflet which will inform claimants of the amounts they are entitled to receive.</P>
      <P>There is a possibility that there will be some discussion concerning the difference in the rates payable to these workers and payable to our own workers.  It is necessary to bear in mind that the contribution in Great Britain is much higher than here.  We could pay higher rates by means of a higher contribution.</P>
      <P>This is an insurance fund.  Whatever goes out of it must come into it, and the present rate of contribution barely supports the present rate of benefit. If it were desired to increase the rate of benefit, then there would have to be an increase in the rate of contribution also.</P>
      <P>However, there is little more to be said about the Bill as the principle has been accepted by everybody.  It is an arrangement of limited scope which may, however, lead to a subsequent arrangement of general application and of a permanent character, which would be a very substantial advance indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when speaking of the making of an arrangement for the payment of unemployment insurance in respect of people working in Great Britain, emphasised rather strongly that unemployment insurance is not paid where, on the one hand, a man is working, and where on the other hand he has left his employment by his own desire.  It is that last point that I want to deal with.  People went to Great Britain under very peculiar circumstances and under great emergency pressure.  They do not belong to Great Britain, and naturally <Col N="1694" /> would be looking to get home and to re-establish themselves here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss that point.  That is one of the matters that must be discussed when we re-open this question with the British authorities.  The point is that workers at that time going to Great Britain for employment were going under an arrangement which would require them to come home at the end of a stated period.  The British authorities argued that they thought that there was no injustice done to those workers if they took contributions from them, and undertook that they would pay them benefit in respect of those contributions while they remained in Great Britain.  That argument had force if the workers were free to remain in Great Britain.  If, however, British wartime regulations compelled them to come back, we contended that there was an obligation on the British authorities to do something about their unemployment insurance contributions.  As the Deputy knows, that situation did not arise.  The contracts under which they went to Great Britain terminated without their being required to come back.</P>
      <P>Clearly, one of the matters that will have to be discussed will be the circumstances under which a worker will be eligible for benefit by reason of the fact that he exercised a personal decision to come back to this country even though that meant that he voluntarily left his employment over there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion which appears on the Order Paper in the names of Deputies MacEoin, Bennett, Fagan, Cosgrave, and myself:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion, in view of the strain placed upon the land and on the farming community by six years of compulsory tillage under emergency conditions, that a modification of the Tillage Order, 1946, would result in a greater and more securely saved grain crop in the year 1947, and calls upon the Minister for Agriculture to amend the Tillage Order, 1946.</P>
      <P>I want to say, at the outset, that this motion was not designed or put on the Order Paper merely for the purpose of providing an opportunity for attacking the compulsory tillage Order.  It is not intended in that way.  The intention is to provide an opportunity for the House to discuss the terms and the application of the Order for the coming sowing season, and to bring before the Minister and his Department the handicaps, the difficulties and the hardships, and in many cases the heavy financial losses that have accrued to many farmers during the emergency. We have a sense of our national responsibility in this matter.  We appreciate the Minister's responsibility and the Government's responsibility in so far as they must ensure, as far as it is possible to do so, adequate supplies of essential feeding and bread grain.  The Minister has this advantage over us that he has better information so far as supplies of imported wheat are concerned. A lack of information in that regard is a considerable handicap to us in discussing this matter.</P>

    <P>It is all-important to appreciate what the position is regarding supplies. There appears to be some confusion on that matter so far as one can learn from the information which is appearing in the newspapers.  I have some Press cuttings here which indicate that the United States is very much perturbed that there may be a crisis due to the accumulation of grain there.  It is indicated that reports from Washington <Col N="1696" /> give confirmation of the nervousness of American officials on the imminence of a collapse of the world grain hold-up.  American officials are reported to be anxious to get wheat moving overseas since they are perturbed about the possibility of being left with a surplus by the next harvest. Sir John Orr has referred to this matter.  The Canadian position, so far as the harvest is concerned, is that it has issued a warning that if the surplus wheat that is on their hands in the New World is not moved to the consuming countries it may precipitate a serious crisis.  It is reported that the Canadian wheat crop is much bigger than last year&mdash;419,000,000 bushels, against 306,000,000 bushels last year.  In the case of the maize crop there is also a very substantial increase.  It is pointed out that there were difficulties in getting the wheat down to the ports and to the silos and elevators at the ports&mdash;the Atlantic and Pacific ports.  From recent reports it is stated there appears to be a flow of grain down to the ports for export purposes.  The U.S. Government reported on the 18th November that the wheat crop is in &ldquo;good to excellent&rdquo; condition with the best moisture supply for several years.  Autumn moisture, it is pointed out, is the main determinant of that vital crop.  The report goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With nearly two-thirds of the season still to go, the U.S. Government has already bought more than half the wheat required for its full season's export programme, which ends on June 30th, 1947.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that for the season that ends on 30th June, 1947, the season for export purposes, the United States has already accumulated at the ports more than half of its supplies.  We were informed recently by the Minister for Supplies that the supply position for this season is more precarious than it was in any season during the emergency.</P>
    <P>Mr. Strachey, Minister of Food, replying to a question in the British House of Commons, made it clear that while the supply position was not so much the problem, the transport position <Col N="1697" /> was acute.  The strikes in America seriously affected and retarded supplies.  This, he stated, was partly the result of the decontrol of transport and partly the result of the series of maritime strikes in the United States.  In the last few days, he said, the stoppage of the soft coal industry had added a further and most serious complication.  He went on to say: &ldquo;It is this transport position which will govern the flow of cereal supplies to this country over this winter rather than any question of the amount of the cereals potentially available in North America.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The ability of North America to supply the world's requirements has been very substantially improved because of the bumper harvests this year. It is pretty obvious the difficulty of getting the grain conveyed to the consuming countries is one of transport.  I do not know whether we can complain very much in that regard.  We evidently have ships that we can afford to send, even to Cuba and Chile and other countries, for the raw material for the alcohol factories, but I do not want to stress that.</P>
    <P>So far as the operation of this Order is concerned, the Minister will agree there is scarcely any change from the terms of last year's Order.  I was struck by this peculiar characteristic of this Order, that it is designed to make it simple of administration.  It is a Civil Service Order pure and simple and it is administered by the Civil Service and the inspectors.  We give absolute power under it to these people to enforce its terms and conditions. In that regard we differ very much from Great Britain, because in Great Britain, notwithstanding the very critical position there and the responsibility of carrying on in a life and death struggle and organising the tremendous forces that had to be organised to repel the threatened invasion, they were capable of providing machinery to allow farmers to appeal against the decisions of inspectors.  In each county there was a committee set up, known as the County War Agricultural Committee, and any farmer who felt aggrieved by an inspector's decision had <Col N="1698" /> a right to bring his case before a committee of his own county men.  These committees were composed of the right type, with a patriotic outlook, and fully aware of the responsibility placed on them to ensure an adequate supply of food.  They judged each case and came to a decision, and that decision was final and binding.</P>
    <P>That was not so here.  We had bureaucratic control, young inspectors approaching farmers double their age and dictating to them what should be done and the fields which should be broken.  That gave rise to great difficulties and to a certain amount of hardship, where men had to break fields that they felt were unsuited for tillage and more advantageous, because of their position in relation to the farmyard, for other purposes.</P>
    <P>We recognised the need of the compulsory Order during the emergency, but when the emergency ended we believed that compulsion should not continue.  We are vigorously opposed to the Minister's intention of continuing any compulsion here.  We are opposed to giving power to the Minister to send an inspector into a farmer's yard to tell him how to operate his farm.  We believe that by demonstration and by an efficient advisory service, the farmer should be encouraged to carry on mixed farming. We are vigorously opposed to the system that provides for compulsion and bureaucratic control.  We feel that, in certain circumstances, in certain districts and under certain conditions a reduction in the amount that must be tilled under the Order would not necessarily mean a reduction in the amount of grain and other food produce.  We believe that asking a man to do tillage he is incapable of doing even reasonably well is not good policy.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we believe that there are large numbers of farmers not properly equipped to carry out the tillage programme envisaged in this Order.  The result is that the job will not be properly done.  Ploughing is done in a haphazard fashion, cultivation is not properly carried out, the seed bed is not properly prepared and the crop from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; cannot be successful.  In tillage particularly <Col N="1699" /> a good system of husbandry is necessary.  If that is absent, not merely does the individual suffer but the nation as a whole suffers.  That is the basis of our case.</P>
    <P>If there is an opportunity for a reduction, there ought to be one, even if the supply position from overseas is not so encouraging.  On many farms in those districts where you have not a tillage tradition you might get as good results from some reduction in the application of the Order.  In the tillage districts you have a tradition and that is handed down from father to son.  You have the necessary equipment there and, generally speaking, there is no difficulty.</P>
    <P>As regards the type of land where you have a tillage tradition, God so designed that land that it is free from weeds and it is easier to carry out tillage. In our circumstances and with our wet climate, in the districts known as the non-tillage districts the handicaps are not usually appreciated and there are great difficulties that have to be surmounted so far as this Order is concerned.</P>
    <P>In those non-tillage districts there was, during the emergency, a shortage of equipment, lack of technical knowledge, and the unsuitability of land for tillage purposes.  The Minister may say that that is all humbug, but I think the emergency has proved that what I say is true.  The late Minister for Agriculture on more than one occasion stressed this aspect of our agricultural economy, that there was a good reason why we had tillage in certain districts, like the district I come from, in County Wexford, South Kildare and portions of Cork.  There was good reason why there was dairying in Limerick, Tipperary and other districts where dairying has been handed down by tradition.  There was good reason why people adopted a live-stock grazing system in Meath and Westmeath, first, through the creation of things and, afterwards, through the natural evolution of things.  Men who went through the hard school of experience, down through generations, eliminated those methods of husbandry that were unprofitable and adopted those systems that suited the particular circumstances, the soil conditions, and the <Col N="1700" /> economy in operation in our relations with Great Britain so far as our surpluses were concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the compulsory tillage Order during the war has proved the wisdom of those words.  Fancy men on land in high altitudes, above the 500 or 600 contour line, with a thin poor soil, bleached completely of calcium, highly acid, being compulsorily obliged to grow wheat there.  It is absurd.  It is not only absurd, but unjust and unfair, because anyone who knows anything about tillage knows that it is utterly impossible to get results there. Even before he puts his hand to the plough, such a man knows from experience that he cannot hope for success. Because the compulsory tillage Order is there and the powerful bureaucratic machine, if an inspector goes down and tells him that he must toe the line and conform with the conditions and terms of that Order, he has no redress.  There is no court of appeal.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, people in another country, even in the stress and strain of war, were able to provide the right for an individual to state his difficulties and how utterly impossible it would be to carry out his responsibilities under the tillage Order.  We also know that there is any amount of land in this country liable to flooding.  This particular year proves the amount of damage that can be done to crops on these lands.  Yet the individuals on these lands have no redress, no court of appeal.  We had the powerful bureaucratic machine steam-rolling them again.  Then we had a shortage of fertilisers and a lack of any system of proper husbandry, which made for deterioration of the soil and of the fertility of the soil.  Then, again, in districts where they had not the tradition of tillage, they continued to sow a cereal crop year after year on the same land with disastrous results.  As I said, many people were asked to produce beyond their capacity and the work was done in a very poor haphazard way.  A decent seed bed was not produced, and this resulted in financial loss.</P>
    <P>I have here a letter that Deputy Fagan handed to me from a man in County Westmeath, which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" />&ldquo;I see that a motion is to be brought in the Dáil against compulsory tillage.  Here are some figures which may be of interest to you and you are at liberty to use them in the motion.  In 1945 I sowed 14 barrels of wheat at £4 4s. 0d. per barrel. From this I got a return of 45 barrels, for which I got 55/- per barrel. In 1946, I sowed 14 barrels of wheat at the same price and got a return of 46 barrels, for which I was paid 52/- per barrel.  In 1944 the yield was even lower still.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have a number of letters in somewhat similar terms.  I was in Tipperary recently and met a man who is a very keen farmer.  He complained that he had something like 32 acres of land under tillage and that, through no fault of his own, he did not get the price of the seed out of that land.</P>
    <P>We know that any amount of land was badly treated.  As I said, cereal crop after cereal crop was sown for three, four and five years and the land was then put down in a very haphazard way to grass.  That is bad, foul work which will have its reactions on the future capacity of this country to produce food.  The Minister must have received some letters about the difficulties that some people experienced in trying to manure land.  The compulsory tillage Order does not provide for the possibility of folding sheep on the crop.  The Order says that the crop must be separated from the land. There again the Minister might consider allowing people to sow crops like rape, or at least of allowing sheep to eat the crop on the land.</P>
    <P>So far as my constituency is concerned, we had a strike in North Kildare this year.  I put it to the Minister that, if he is going to apply the compulsory powers which he has announced for this year, the farmers are entitled to some guarantee so far as the provision of labour to save the crops is concerned.  The Minister cannot, by a compulsory Order, compel people to do a certain job and then feel himself relieved of further responsibility.  The Minister must appreciate the difficulties that a number of farmers had to face in North Kildare.  By a piece of <Col N="1702" /> luck, the strike eventually collapsed owing to the abnormal weather conditions. Surely it is not unreasonable to suggest to the Minister that at this stage, a couple of years after the war, if the supply position is bad and if we must have compulsion to the extent provided for in the Order, the farmers are entitled to have some undertaking from him so far as the provision of labour is concerned.  The labour problem has been acute, not merely in Kildare, but in other counties as well. So far from giving any stimulus to production, the Minister has stopped the manure vouchers this year.  The farmer's position has been worsened financially.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked the Minister a question as to what extent the increase in the agricultural grant has met the statutory increase in wages made by the Agricultural Wages Board early last summer.  The Minister told me that the increase in the agricultural grant was approximately £600,000 and that the difference between the two was the difference between £600,000 and £1,000,000; so that on the Minister's own showing the agricultural community is placed at a disadvantage amounting to £400,000.  Even at that, I am rather critical of the Minister's figures.  I think the gap is much wider than that.</P>
    <P>Under the compulsory tillage Order, the Minister is looking for the same amount of tillage as last year or the year before, namely, three-eighths of the arable land.  We feel that there ought to be some effort made to reduce that for the coming year to 25 per cent., or one-quarter.  We also believe that there are certain areas which ought to be exempt from wheat.  I put it to the Minister that our aim ought to be to produce the maximum amount of food from the land; that we are interested in live stock and live-stock products, and that we are short of essential food for that purpose.  The Minister is particularly anxious to increase our production of eggs for export purposes by 100,000 cases this year.  The Minister knows that if we bridge that gap it means an increase of 4½d. per dozen.</P>
    <P>We have any amount of land, particularly on high altitudes, which is absolutely unsuitable for wheat-grow- <Col N="1703" /> ing, but where, under the Order, a man is bound to put in a certain quantity of wheat.  It is not possible to get an economic return for that wheat.  It would be possible to get a decent crop of oats or potatoes.  It is possible to grow crops on acid land, crops that are tolerant to acid conditions.  The Minister knows that it is not possible to grow crops like wheat, barley and beet, which are not tolerant to acidity, on acid soils.  The Minister has made much capital out of guaranteed prices and secured markets.  It is true that we have a guaranteed price for wheat and a secured market but that is of very little use to the man whose land is unsuitable for the production of wheat or whose land is acid.  The Minister a few years ago had little appreciation of the degree of acid in the soil of this country and even some of his experts had no appreciation of the extent of the acid soil problem but since the establishment of the new section in his Department the Minister must have a fuller realisation of the extent of that problem.  It is enormous. A great deal of the land which we hoped would yield good results in wheat-growing and where, it was suggested by the Minister, there was built-up fertility that could be drawn upon during the emergency, was found to be unproductive because of the soil condition. In certain areas, land that had been in grass for years, when put under tillage, produced straw but not wheat, owing to the condition of the soil.</P>
    <P>All these difficulties have imposed grave hardships and burdens on the agricultural community.  I live in a tillage district and I want to emphasise that, relatively speaking, we had very little difficulty and were able, without any trouble, to comply with the terms of the Order but I appreciate the enormous difficulties that faced these people who had not the tradition of tillage. They had not the equipment.  They had not soil suitable for tillage or suitable for the production of the particular crops that were designated in the Order.</P>
    <P>We are asking for a full examination of the whole circumstances.  The operation of the Order in the coming year ought not to be merely automatic as <Col N="1704" /> far as the Department is concerned.  It is too late now to adopt the British system of county committees to which an individual farmer might appeal and have his case examined.  So far as individuals are concerned who are ill-equipped to carry out this Order, it is possible that, if the Minister is prepared to meet us on this matter, more discretion would have to be given to inspectors.  Much as I dislike that, I suggest it is better to give that discretion than to ask people to continue to endure the hardships they have had to bear in recent years.  Taking all the circumstances into account, on the information that is available from reputable sources, from men like Sir John Boyd Orr, from the United States and Canada, we feel that the supplies are there and that the difficulty is shipping. It is not for this season we are planning, but for next year's crop. There is then scarcely justification for continuing the full implementation of the Order that has been in operation and that was necessary during the emergency.  Surely there must be an opportunity next year for a relaxation of the Order and, if that is so, we are pressing for an undertaking from the Minister that the matter will be very fully and carefully examined.  I am not pleading for the old tillage districts. These districts are quite competent to carry on and to produce what they have been producing in recent years but I do certainly plead very strongly for those people who are not able to produce.  It is beyond the capacity of their land to produce and, for that reason, they are doing the job damn badly.  That means that they are not merely suffering themselves but the nation is also at a loss because the land so employed could be better utilised in producing other classes of food or live stock.</P>
    <P>A question was asked here to-day about the reduction in dairy produce and the substantial fall in the amount of butter that is in cold store at the present time.  The Minister must know that the problem of compulsory tillage is reacting on our dairy industry and that inevitably it must have the effects suggested by Deputy Halliden to-day.</P>
    <P>That is our case, and we are putting <Col N="1705" /> it to the Minister as strongly as we can.  We wish to stress the point that we are in the difficulty that we do not know what the supply position is but we feel, through the information that is available to us through the public Press&mdash;that is the only source available&mdash;that an opportunity exists for the Minister, in certain districts where hardship is obvious, to modify the terms of the Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion proposed by Deputy Hughes and I support the views that he has expressed.  This is in every respect a very serious question for the country. In view of his reply to Deputy Halliden, yesterday, that he did not propose to make any modification whatever in the tillage Order I feel the Minister has already decided the case against us.  When that question was put to him yesterday, the Minister should have postponed his reply until this motion had been disposed of but he can tell us this evening that the decision is already made and that there is no use in our talking to him on the subject.  Notwithstanding that he has hoisted his flag and that he is not going to move from the tillage Order, he should take notice of the case that will be made to him this evening. Deputy Hughes has covered the ground of the supply position and the difficulties of the agricultural community and I do not propose to add to that because the case has been well put.</P>
      <P>The food supply in any country is a very important consideration.  How important it is in this country has been shown by the anxiety that was felt during the harvest season this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on my feet, I should like to thank the people of the towns and cities who came out voluntarily to help the agricultural community in the saving of their crops.  They did so from no ulterior motive but merely because they wished to assist in conserving the nation's food supply.  In carrying out that work a great number of them, perhaps for the first time, were able to form some idea of the difficulties under which the agricultural community had to work.  In gratitude for their help in the saving of the harvest, I admit that the agricultural community have <Col N="1706" /> a responsibility to see to it that food supplies will always be available from the agricultural community for the towns and cities and the people as a whole.  Foodstuffs, however, have a varying degree of quality, and when the Minister told Deputy Halliden yesterday, in reply to a question, that he did not intend to make any modification of the tillage Order, I think he was going too far, because the Minister and his Department must be satisfied that there is a situation to-day of very grave import for the whole community and for agriculturists in particular.  The Minister knows well that seed wheat this year is of very great value and that it should not be used on land that is going to produce a poor crop.  Wheat should be sown only on land that is capable of yielding the highest possible production.</P>
    <P>Last year in certain areas throughout the country the Minister's officials, tillage inspectors and others, acting, of course, as they should act&mdash;I have no complaint to make of their conduct because they were acting in accordance with the tillage regulations&mdash;insisted that farmers must sow a certain proportion of wheat, even on land that was not capable of producing a satisfactory crop.  Once a farmer had so many acres of arable land, the Order provided that he must sow so much of that land in wheat.  To my own knowledge, in many parts of the country that was sheer waste of (1) good seed wheat, (2) good land, and (3) of opportunities for food production.  If oats or barley had been sown on that land, which was much more suitable for a crop of that kind, we would have got a much better return.  Take parts of North Longford, for instance.  Farmers there with holdings of five or ten acres had to sow a half-acre or an acre of wheat, as the case might be.  They were compelled to put in that seed wheat.  I admit that it was not a good season upon which to form a judgment but they find now that the yield was only about two barrels to the acre. They had, it is true, a powerful crop of weeds, but if they had been allowed to utilise that land, as they had been prior to this year, they would have a fairly good crop of oats and the food <Col N="1707" /> value of the crop would be proportionally greater.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says there can be no modification whatever of the tillage Order, he is speaking with his tongue in his cheek because no person, not even the young inspector who is sent out to supervise tillage, could stand over that as a result of last year's experience. Therefore we shall have a situation arising where the law says one thing and it is then left to the discretion of some tillage inspector to see whether the farm is capable of complying with the regulations or not.  That creates the feeling that there is favouritism in some areas and the result will be that jealousies of one kind or another will arise.  I therefore put it to the Minister that this year, when seed wheat is of great value, it should be sown only on land on which it will give the greatest yield.  The Minister may tell me that that is a very difficult matter and Deputy Hughes has said that he is not going to ask the Minister to adopt the system tried in Britain under which local committees, having a special knowledge, decided the type of crop that should be sown on certain lands.  The Minister, however, could make an Order that there should be exemptions in certain areas and that it might be left to the discretion of the farmer, who knows best what his land is capable of producing, what type of crop should be sown on it.  It is well known that some farms produced much more food this year than ever before because of the volunteer labour that was available.  I think it is admitted that in 1945, owing to lack of workers, a great many farmers lost a considerable part of their crops.  This year, notwithstanding the bad season, I think we shall find that owing to the utilisation of volunteer labour we shall have a larger return.  However, we cannot get volunteer workers every year.  I do not suppose that we could ask volunteers to come to our assistance next year even if it were a bad year.  My point is that the Minister by using a discretionary power in regard to the areas where certain crops should be sown, could get better results and a greater quantity of produce than he is getting at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> I want the tillage Order to be modified in a very positive way.  It is an impossible task for a young inspector to go down and tell a farmer what he should or should not grow.  The result is that sometimes you have unseemly disputes between the farmer and the young fellow which generally end in court.  That does not help the production of food.</P>
    <P>I feel, therefore, that when the Minister is sending out these young men, he should give them some instructions in conformity with the views which he expressed himself at certain meetings throughout the country, that if the full tillage area was cultivated by the farmer with the intention of producing the greatest amount of food from it, he should not be too rigid in regard to the sowing of any particular crop on that farm.  That, of course, was off the record, if you like.  That was not the law but I feel that instructions of that kind could be legalised by the Minister making the necessary modifications of the Order.</P>
    <P>On the question of the amount of tillage, I think it is an admitted fact &mdash;Deputy Hughes has made the case and made it well&mdash;that with a lesser amount of tillage better done, you would get better results.  One acre well-tilled and with the seed-bed well prepared would produce a greater result than a greater amount of land badly tilled.  I suggest to the Minister that that matter be examined in great detail.  To have the tillage Order automatic without any examination, is, in my view, bad business and the Minister should see that the whole question is examined.  He should take the opinion of his agricultural instructors and committees of agriculture as to what crops can best be produced in their counties.</P>
    <P>Two or three other things will militate against the farmers this year.  The Minister has been very positive in declaring that the tillage Order will take effect for 1947 as for 1946 but he withdraws the vouchers for manures for each barrel of wheat.  That is equivalent to a reduction of 2/6 per barrel in the price of wheat.  The vouchers are not cashed yet and we do not know what we are to get but, although in theory we have a guaranteed price for <Col N="1709" /> wheat, the Minister, by his action, automatically reduces the value of a barrel of wheat by 2/6.  When one thing was automatic, the other should have been automatic as well.  The Minister has not said why he took that step.  He simply fires the compulsory tillage Order for 1946 back at us.</P>
    <P>I should like to learn from the Minister what stocks of grain were carried over since last year.  What stocks of oats were carried over by merchants since last year?  Is the Minister satisfied that the best use is being made of last year's crops?  What stocks of potatoes went bad last year?  Did we require all the potatoes and oats we grew last year?  What stocks of last year's wheat crop have seed growers and seed distributors and what use is being made of them?  These are questions about which the Minister should inform the House before he forces this Order on the country again.  In parts of the country, a great effort is made to produce potatoes and oats.  It is said that, in food value, potatoes are next to wheat.  But when the farmers have produced the potatoes, there is not a halfpenny obtainable for them in May, June or July.  The result is that, in a great number of cases in which farmers have not silos, there is a huge waste. In supporting this motion, I suggest that the Minister should give us all this information before enforcing this tillage Order in the ruthless way which he proposes.  I ask the House to pass the motion and to impress on the Minister the necessity for a very positive modification of the tillage Order before proceeding further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The first duty of the holders of land is to provide food for the people of the country.  The Government are responsible&mdash;and only the Government will be held responsible&mdash; for seeing that that food is produced. Anybody reading the newspapers during the past three weeks or a month could see complaints day after day as to the quality of the bread and the anxiety to reduce the extraction to 80 per cent.  That does not look as if there were hopes for plenty of wheat during the coming year.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture is anxious to attend to the wishes of my colleagues <Col N="1710" /> opposite that they should have offals for their pigs, cattle and poultry.  Those offals cannot be provided while the present percentage of wheat extraction remains.  I am sure the Minister desires to reduce that extraction as quickly as possible.  Deputy Hughes told us about the farmer who had not a tillage tradition and who put in grain crop after grain crop in his land.  Did Deputy Hughes mean that there should be one law, so far as food production is concerned, for one type of farmer&mdash; the big fellow&mdash;and another law for the other type of farmer&mdash;the small fellow?  Is that Deputy Hughes' idea?</P>
      <P>I have before me the Official Report of the Dáil proceedings of the 22nd November, 1946.  That was only last week and, on that date, Deputy Hughes moved a motion dealing with, amongst other things, &ldquo;the extent to which allottees have failed to make good and the reason for their failure&rdquo;. In dealing with that motion, he said: &ldquo;It must be appreciated that the disposition and utilisation of the land of the country is of fundamental importance in the whole economic structure of the State&rdquo;.  He went on to say: &ldquo;The attitude of economists the world over, the experience of the world during the war years and the condition of the world so far as the provision of food for the people is concerned, bring more clearly to our minds the necessity and the vital importance of ensuring that the land of the country is utilised to the best advantage in the national interest, that it is disposed, tenanted and held by the technicians&rdquo;.  That was Deputy Hughes last week.  What kind of technician was the joker who put in three or four grain crops one after the other?  That is the man Deputy Hughes stands up for to-night. He is to be kept because he is a rancher, because he is a big fellow, because he has a lot of land, but the 25 acres of the small fellow are to be disposed, tenanted and held by the technician.  That is the attitude Deputy Hughes is adopting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that there are large areas of the country in which the tillage tradition, as it is called, does not exist.  I have seen them myself.  On our way up here last year, I brought the Leas-Cheann <Col N="1711" /> Comhairle to the window of the train to show him the way the farmers in Deputy Bennett's constituency, if one can call them farmers, sowed wheat.  They had a pair of horses under a corn drill and the two boyos were seated happily up on the box and driving away, but nobody knew whether there was anything in the box or not.  We passed along the same way about four months afterwards and I brought the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to have a look at the crop the boys were growing.  There was not one-third of the seed in that field.  There were big gaps where there was no seed at all, and the wheat they threw into the machine at the headland did not take them half way.</P>
    <P>I admit that that kind of thing took place, but if a man does not know how to farm himself he can very easily get somebody who will farm for him.  Let him get that person, whether by contract or otherwise.  The function of the land of this country is to grow food for the people, and I say that the Minister and his Government are the people who will be held responsible by the community, if there is any shortage of food in the next 12 months, and rightly so.  As to the ways and means adopted by the Minister's advisers, I might have a lot to say, but I am absolutely adamant on the point that the responsibility is on the Government to see that sufficient food is provided and that sufficient land is ploughed to provide that food.  That is the compulsory tillage Order.</P>
    <P>The duty of the farmers is to provide food, or the raw material for the food, and I should like to know, and I hope I shall hear from the Minister when he speaks in this debate, what he has to say to the other branch of the industry, the branch which converts that raw material, which the farmers have produced by their sweat and their toil and which is at present rotting along the fences, into food and what action he proposes to take to compel these gentlemen to provide a vital food for the people.  I say that as the representative of over 75,000 farmers who grew beet this year.  The responsibility is on the Minister and his Government to see that that raw material is turned into food, and I hope the Minister will <Col N="1712" /> lose no time in the matter because every day counts and every day that passes sees less sugar available.</P>
    <P>I am also rather surprised by part of the Minister's Order.  It has been alluded to by Deputy MacEoin.  There was an increase of 5/- per barrel for barley and a decrease of 2/6 per barrel in the raw material of the staple food of the nation&mdash;wheat.  If wheat is essential&mdash;and the Minister knows the losses which this harvest entailed for the agricultural community as is plainly evidenced by the 100 per cent. extraction&mdash;why the cut in price?  Does the Minister think the farmers have got too much?  I insist on bringing the costs of production of wheat before the prices tribunal as soon as the Minister gets the Bill through and sets up the tribunal, but there is no justification whatever for this cut in the price of wheat.</P>
    <P>The Minister is paying too much heed to his advisers and I say that as one who paid his share as a result of their advice last year.  The nation lost 144 barrels of wheat as a result.  I had made provision for seed for 48 acres of wheat last year.  The seed was lying on the quayside in Sweden, an export licence having been got for it, when the Minister's advisers stepped in.  What was the result?  I put in 20 acres of pedigree Atle seed wheat which gave me 10 barrels per acre.  I put in eight acres of what the Minister's advisers said was good seed, which gave me 4½ barrels to the acre.  I claim to be as good a judge of seed as the hoaryheaded sinners who are the Minister's advisers in this matter and when I found the kind of seed I had, I put 10 acres of oats in.  The harvesting of the 10 acres of oats cost me £70 in labour alone and, after harvesting, it was practically unsaleable.  That is what I paid for the advice given by the Minister's advisers in preventing the import of the 250 barrels of Atle wheat from Sweden last year.  They said there was plenty here.  It cost me over £400 and that is more than the carcase of any Minister's adviser is worth.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the compulsory tillage Order which compels a farmer to till a certain acreage of his land and which compels a farmer to put a certain proportion of that land under wheat.  I am dealing with the facts as I find them and giving the benefit of my bitter experience to this House.  I cannot support this motion on any account.  I hold that the Minister and the Government cannot be relieved of the responsibility to see that the nation is provided with food. Neither can the farmer be relieved of his responsibility in the production of that food, nor can any one of the essential industries, engaged in the conversion of the raw material produced by the farmer into that food, be relieved of their responsibility.  It is from that standpoint that I approach this whole question.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin thanked those who helped to save the farmers' harvest. We are thankful, too, but there would have been no necessity for that if our skilled workers were paid a decent wage and if our farmers were paid for their produce sufficient to enable them to pay that decent wage.  You find a fellow sweeping the yard in the beet factory, the smallest paid man in it, receiving £4 9s. 0d. per week, and the farm labourer who has to work in the rain, the slush, the frost and the cold, getting £2 7s. 6d.  Instead of pulling the beet, the farm labourer is going to try to better his conditions and get into the shelter of the sugar factory at £4 9s. 0d. in the yard or at £8 1s. 0d. as a buckshee cook in the factory itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a bad plan and I do not think the local committee plan will work now with any success.  I can well understand a body of men going in there with the mentality of Deputy Hughes, who would say that the big fellow with 200 acres, because he did <Col N="1715" /> not know how to till, should be let off, but the small fellow with 25 acres should be made till.  Committees with such a mentality will not work and that is proved by the statements made by Deputy Hughes last Friday and to-day.  On the one hand, he puts down a motion to drive out any small farmer who is not tilling his land and who is not a technician, but to-night he says that the big fellow, because he does not know how to till and is fool enough to put in four crops of grain one after another, should be let off.  Fancy a committee of five or six men like Deputy Hughes, travelling about and saying how much each man should till in a county, who should be let off and who should be made till.  That would not stand water for five minutes.  I might have a different mentality from most Deputies here as regards land, what land is for and the duties of a farmer.  On behalf of the agricultural community, I claim that everything we can produce here must be protected, that we must get the cost of production plus a profit, particularly when compelled by law to produce a certain crop, as in the case of wheat.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the Minister's action in making a tillage Order this year and reducing the price of wheat by 2/6 a barrel is a fair move to make, considering the bad harvest the farmers have had.  I cannot understand, either, his move in increasing the price of barley by 5/- a barrel, unless he has taken cognisance of the proposal that I made the other day when I had a question down asking that the &ldquo;pubs&rdquo; in the country should be allowed to open for four hours on a Sunday.  If that proposal of mine were accepted, it would mean that we would want more barley.  My opinion is that those who can well afford it should be made pay towards helping out the farmer in the difficulties that I speak of.  I refer to the breweries in the country.  I saw barley at 52/- a barrel and it went to nearly 60/- a barrel.  I am not interested in Guinness's shares or in the profit tax that Guinness has to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of barley, and the getting of an economic price for what you are compelled to grow under a tillage Order, has a lot to do with it. In my opinion, the price for the quantity of barley that is required for brewing in this country should be fixed at 75/- or 76/- a barrel.  If a decent price is given the farmers will grow plenty of it.  There will be plenty of supplies then&mdash;for those poor devils that I am so keen about&mdash;in the &ldquo;pubs&rdquo; on Sundays, and there will be a good income from exports.  We hear a lot here from time to time about our exports.  I suggest that it is the duty of the Government to see that the price paid for an article produced under a compulsory tillage Order is at least an economic one&mdash;a price showing the cost of production, plus a profit.  The price for wheat fixed by the Minister this year does not show that.  I know, of course, it will be said that any increase in the price of bread will mean a rise in the cost of living.  That is the first thing we always hear when the farmer looks for anything, but when any other class of the community looks for an increase good care is taken to fix it up.  The Minister, I suggest, ought to revise his prices under the compulsory tillage Order.  I was hoping that the prices tribunal that he promised a fortnight ago would be introduced and be in operation before Christmas.  When it is brought forward we will be able to see to what extent the farmer has been robbed during the past six years, as well as what is an economic price, based on the cost of production&mdash;plus a profit&mdash;for the commodities produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this motion is not only a foolish one but that it is extremely wrong.  Any proposal that would remove responsibility from the Government for seeing that the country is provided with food is a wrong one.  It is the responsibility of the Government to see to that.  When I make a comparison between the speech that Deputy Hughes made last week and the speech that he made to-night on this motion I feel bound to say that he has gone down at least 100 per cent. in my estimation.  On the one hand, he is <Col N="1717" /> looking for relief for the 200 acre farmer who he says knows nothing about farming&mdash;the man who has not a tillage tradition&mdash;while last week he was insisting that the smallholder with 25 acres should be put out of his land by the Land Commission unless he tilled his land and produced food, unless, as he said, he was a technician in food production.  These speeches show that the Deputy has a peculiar mentality.  I should not like to have a dozen men of the mentality of Deputy Hughes on a committee in my county to be the judges as to who was to till and who was not to till.  While, as I say, I think the motion is a foolish one, I, at the same time, would ask the Minister to see, firstly, that an economic price is paid for what is produced under compulsion, and, secondly, that when essential food commodities are produced by the farmers that no interference will be allowed in having those raw materials converted into food for the nation.  That is the responsibility that rests on the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before the harvest of this year a member of the British House of Parliament advocated there that the farmers of that country should be provided with straw hats to protect them during the harvest.  The error of judgment which that man committed should be a warning to all public representatives to be very circumspect and careful when planning future policy in regard to agriculture.  I am afraid that Deputy Corry will never profit by that sad experience.  This motion, in my opinion, has been prudently worded.  The speeches made in proposing and seconding it were also phrased in prudent language.  There was no extravagant language used and no extravagant demands made.  A reasoned appeal has been made to the Minister, based on his experience over a period of six years, as well as on the changed circumstances which have arisen owing to the termination of the war, to consider if it is not now possible to modify in some way the tillage Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Corry that it is the first duty of the land to provide food for the people.  There is <Col N="1718" /> a great variety of foods which the land can produce and there is very little land in this country which is properly farmed, whether it is good pasture or good arable land, which is not producing good food of some kind.  Merely to dogmatise and repeat slogans of this kind does not solve any problem.</P>
    <P>I think it will be found possible to increase the total food supply of the nation by giving attention to the request made in this motion.  It will certainly be agreed by the Minister and every official of his Department that an acre of wheat that fails is of less value to the nation than an acre of potatoes or oats that grows successfully and, in-so far as it may be possible by administrative action to prevent the growing of wheat on land where it is almost certain to fail, I think it would be contributing materially to increasing the total output of food for the nation.</P>
    <P>The case for a modification of the wheat quota can be supported by a variety of arguments.  We can take, first of all, the prospect of an improvement in the world's wheat supplies.  It is reasonable to hope that the wheat supplies of the world will substantially increase during the next year and that there will be a possibility of getting those supplies transported to this country.  That is a matter upon which Deputies may not have as much information as the Minister but, apart from that, it should be possible to secure as good a home-grown wheat supply by certain modifications of the Order as we are getting by the present rough and ready wheat quotas.</P>
    <P>When the Wages Board was set up and wages were fixed for the entire State, there was more or less a flat rate.  Then, gradually, as the Wages Board acquired some experience, they began to modify the Order and they struck a different rate of wages for different areas.  It seems to me that there is no reason why the Department of Agriculture, in the light of the experience they have gained over a period of five or six years, should not be able to modify the wheat quota Order so as to give relief to areas where wheat has proved unsuccessful during past years. In the first year of the wheat quota, <Col N="1719" /> there had to be a rough and ready scheme but, as the Departmental officials have now gained experience, it should be possible to exclude from the operation of the Order many areas which, by the nature of the soil and the contour of the land, are not suitable for wheat-growing.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Wicklow we are graded as one of the first-class wheat-growing districts and we are compelled to produce the maximum quota of 10 per cent.  Anyone who knows County Wicklow is aware that there are very large areas there which are, perhaps, poorer than are to be found in any other county in Ireland. Surely it should be possible to segregate certain areas, to exclude them from the operation of the Order.  If that is not possible, it should be easy now to give to the inspectors, as a last resort, a considerable amount of discretion. They have gained experience and I am sure the Department has confidence in their ability and it would not be unreasonable to give them a discretionary power to exempt certain areas or modify the Order in so far as it relates to farmers whose land is of an inferior nature.</P>
    <P>Those modifications would save a considerable amount of good seed wheat.  There is a danger that there may not be sufficient seed wheat available for the needs of the nation during the coming year and it would be a grave disaster if a large quantity of the limited wheat available is taken by farmers and sown in land where it will not grow successfully.  That would be sheer waste.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;If you want to modify the Order and reduce the quota in certain areas, are you prepared to counterbalance that by providing for an increase in other areas?&rdquo; An increase in the production of wheat may be secured by inducement in areas where wheat has been grown successfully.  Last year was a very unsatisfactory year for cereal crops, yet there were areas where wheat did quite well&mdash;where it did as well, at least, as oats and was more easily harvested. Given a fair inducement, I think the farmers in such areas would be prepared to grow considerably more than their quota and thus counterbalance <Col N="1720" /> any loss that might arise from a reduction in other areas.</P>
    <P>If the prices tribunal which the Minister proposes to set up at our request and at the request of Deputy Corry comes into operation in the course of the next few months, on costs of production alone it will be bound to recommend an increase in the price of wheat. That increase will give some encouragement to farmers, who have land suitable for wheat, to increase their acreage.</P>
    <P>The proposer of the motion suggests that we could modify the general tillage quota and bring about a reduction of 25 per cent.  In this connection we ought to have regard to what the crops produced are needed for.  After providing the wheat quota, the other crops produced are required in a great measure as animal feeding and if the farmer, in his wisdom, thinks he can produce from good pasture a better foodstuff than he would get from tillage land, he ought to be allowed to do so. Really good pasture fed to cows will probably produce more milk or butter than would be obtained from an inferior tillage crop.  That is a consideration which must be carefully borne in mind.  You are not increasing the much-lauded food supplies by forcing the farmer to till his land, growing a crop and feeding it to stock when, as a matter of fact, he could, without tilling that same land, grow a better crop for his stock.</P>
    <P>Unlike the public representative who advocated straw hats for farmers during the harvest, Deputy Halliden and myself, on the eve of the autumn Recess, drew the Minister's attention to agricultural conditions.  We drew the Minister's attention, in particular, to the danger of a shortage of agricultural labour for the harvest.  Our forecast of the position, I think, was not imprudent.  As events proved, there was a very serious shortage of labour for the harvest, which was overcome in many districts by the voluntary help of people in the towns, but which, in many districts, also resulted in considerable loss and difficulty to the farmer.</P>
    <P>When we are asked to comply with the tillage Order, we ought to have an <Col N="1721" /> assurance from the Minister that he will not allow a situation to develop during the coming year in which there will be a serious shortage of labour in agriculture and in which there may be, through organised action, an interference with the supply of labour available. Measures ought to be carefully planned in advance to ensure that during the critical periods for agriculture, the sowing season and the harvest season, there will be no withdrawal of labour and no serious shortage.  That is a matter which requires careful planning, and the farmer has the right to expect and demand that it will get the attention which it deserves, having regard to the fact that the farmer will be treated as a criminal if he fails to comply with the tillage Order.</P>
    <P>After labour, or perhaps it should come before labour, we need to have an assurance from the Minister that nothing will be left undone to secure adequate and suitable seed supplies. If the home supply of seed for our cereal crops is not sufficient, steps should be taken to investigate the possibility of importing supplies.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of a matter which I might have referred to when dealing with the question of the wheat quota. One of the arguments which might be put by the Minister against a reduction of the wheat quota might be that other nations might object to any reduction of the wheat quota here, or they might use it as an argument for refusing to give us a sufficient allocation out of the world's wheat supply.  But if it is true, as I believe it is, that seed wheat may be very scarce, the Minister will have an adequate answer to that argument. He can say that he cannot compel farmers to grow larger areas of wheat than there is seed available for.  In that way, it may be possible to overcome the objection to a reduction in the wheat quota.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anyone will seriously suggest&mdash;I am sure Deputy Corry's suggestions are not taken seriously&mdash;that there is behind this motion any desire to discriminate between the large farmer and the small farmer.  There is no desire, I am sure, to give a greater measure of <Col N="1722" /> relief in the matter of the relaxation of the tillage Order to the very big farmer as against the small one.  I believe that any relief which is given should be based on the condition of the soil in each area and on the results which the farmer obtained after endeavouring to the best of his ability to grow the crop within the past few years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry cannot have it both ways.  He came into the House to-day to attack the ranchers.  Only a few weeks ago, he was attacking the henroosters. He seems to be under the impression that attack is always the best form of defence; that unless he is attacking somebody, he is in a futile and weak position.  I think it is the duty of the State, of the Minister and of the Government to be fair to everybody, to be fair in the administration of these drastic regulations which the emergency demands.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Corry that local committees cannot serve a useful purpose.  If we are to accept Deputy Corry's view that local committees are always corrupt, immoral, influenced by political considerations, and have no sense of responsibility, then we must definitely decide that there is a very poor future before this country, because it is local committees of the ordinary people who are and who must be truly representative of the people.  If the people are so immoral and so corrupt as Deputy Corry suggests, then, of course, we must depend upon dictators from the Minister's Department.  But I have still some confidence in the ordinary, decent people of this country, and if committees of responsible farmers were selected in various counties or in districts of counties, I think they could give very useful assistance to the Department and its officials in carrying out this and similar Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion in the full knowledge that the responsibility rests on the Government and on the shoulders of the farmers.  I am certain that the movers of the motion are sincere in their efforts to ensure production of the food supply for the nation no matter what may happen.  I am satisfied that, as Deputy Hughes <Col N="1723" /> pointed out, a reduction of the tillage quota, to the extent of, say, one-eighth, may be accompanied by increased production.  It will be admitted by farmers familiar with tillage operations that owing to the increased area of tillage that has to be cultivated by individuals a lot of the tillage is done in a slipshod manner or, as we say in the country, half done.  With better cultivation, higher concentration on the work, the cultivation of a proper seed bed, and a fairly liberal application of artificial manures&mdash;and we are assured by the Minister of a certain quantity for the coming season &mdash;I am fully convinced that, even with a reduction of one-eighth of the tillage quota, we would still have more wheat and more cereals than we are getting under existing conditions.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister would be meeting the wishes of the farming community if he would use all the means at his disposal to ensure a quota of wheat for seed for the coming season.  It is a well-known fact that the seed is worn out.  With imported seed or with improved seed we should get an increase of from one and a half to three barrels per acre of a cereal crop.  That is a very important consideration and I was surprised to hear Deputy Corry state this evening that he was denied the right to import a certain amount of seed wheat.  Recently, the Minister said, in reply to a question of mine, that he did not see much hope of importing seed wheat for the coming year.  Many farmers, carrying on an old practice, are anxious to import samples of wheat to improve their own stock.  Those who do that also help to improve the stocks of their neighbours who may not be in a position themselves to import.  I would suggest that the Minister should do all he possibly can to ensure that a quantity of seed would be imported for the coming year. If there is a reduced quota of tillage, the machinery available would be better able to cope with the work. Consequently there will be better seed beds, better ploughing, better cultivation, which will tend to produce a better yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of labour. Having had experience of the last harvest <Col N="1724" /> and the conditions that prevailed, many people fear that the labour question will be a very serious one for the future.  As Deputy Corry pointed out, it is very hard to blame the rural worker when he sees his colleagues in industrial concerns getting a much higher wage.  He pointed out that one of the lowest paid men of those who are now on strike was getting £4 9s. 0d. a week while the agricultural worker, who is a skilled operative, is the lowest paid worker in the State.  For that reason, the Minister should yield to the demand that has been put forward in this House to set up a commission of inquiry into costs of production plus profit plus a decent wage to the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposed reduction of one-eighth of the quota, I have made a rough estimate of comparative acreages.  The target that was aimed at over a number of years was 700,000 acres.  Taking the yield of seven barrels to the acre, that would mean 4,900,000 barrels of wheat.  If the tillage quota were reduced by one-eighth, the acreage would be reduced from 700,000 acres to 612,000.  With better husbandry, with a fair application of artificial manure and with an increased yield of one barrel per acre, the reduced acreage would produce 4,900,000 barrels, which would be equivalent to the yield of seven barrels per acre on 700,000 acres.  I am sure the Minister would agree that the improvement in cultivation and the application of artificial manures would give at least an increase of one and a half barrels to the acre, which would represent, on 612,500 acres, 5,206,250 barrels of wheat.  I am convinced that with the remedies I have suggested we could and would produce 5,206,250 barrels of wheat for the nation.</P>
    <P>Taking all the circumstances into consideration, the scarcity of labour, weather conditions and so on, the farmer would face the target with greater confidence and courage, if the tillage quota were reduced, and would try to improve the yield that we have got for a number of years.  Many Deputies will agree that the actual yield over a number of years was far below the seven barrels to the acre <Col N="1725" /> that was the average.  I give my experience as a threshing-machine owner and I know as a fact that in some cases the yield was as low as two barrels per acre.  On fair land, even with conacre, the yield was as low as four barrels to the acre.  I think, as I said before, that even by reducing the quota and by the application of a sufficient quantity of manures to the area under tillage, the yield target would be exceeded even by more than the figures I quoted a moment ago.  Machinery, as we know, is limited to a very great extent, particularly in the areas which engaged in tillage prior to the emergency.  Certainly I would say that, even with this reduction, by the people realising their responsibilities to the nation and the Government, we should be able to secure an adequate supply of food.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the other aspect of the tillage situation, the labour position, I think that for the coming year every effort should be made to ensure that adequate help will be available for farmers at harvest time.  Every farmer and every grain-grower will, I am sure, thank the volunteers who from the cities and towns gave of their best during a very difficult period last harvest to ease the situation for the farmers.</P>

      <P>Everybody who volunteered for work during the harvest must be thanked and complimented. Even if the volunteers did not take off their coats, they went out with a good intention.  You must admire people, no matter who they were, whether they were workers, paupers or millionaires, who went out with the good intention of helping to save the food of the nation.  I hope that for the coming season, the Government will instruct local bodies to release men, if there is danger of a labour shortage confronting farmers during the harvest. In conclusion, taking the figures I have given for the yield target, whilst realising <Col N="1726" /> my responsibility to the people, I am convinced that, with the reduced quota, if adequate facilities are placed at our disposal in the way of machinery and if we are guaranteed adequate supplies of artificial manures, there will be an ample supply of grain produced for the needs of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody denies that during the emergency it was necessary for the Minister and the Department to operate a compulsory tillage Order to ensure the production of necessary food for the people.  Happily the emergency, so far as the war is concerned, is over.  If there is still some trouble in the transit of food from one country to another, it does not seem at all improbable that in the coming year conditions will be much better in regard to the supply of foodstuffs than anything we have experienced in the last six or seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and Deputy Corry have referred to counties which had not a tradition of tillage but I believe that in most of the counties of this State, even though there was not a great deal of tillage done, there was still some tradition of tillage left amongst the people and when the necessity arose they were able to go into tillage and did go into it.  I think the Minister will admit that even in counties like Tipperary and Limerick, in which there was a small acreage under tillage prior to the emergency, the people met the Minister very fairly and that representatives of the various Parties fell into line in asking the people to produce the necessary food. We expected that, when the emergency was over, things would revert to their normal state.  Normal conditions in this country were somewhat different from normal conditions in other countries inasmuch as we had greater varieties of agriculture in this country than in any other country in the world of similar size.  Nature made it so and the experience of farmers for generations proved it to be necessary.  We had extensive tillage counties and dairying counties, like my own county and Tipperary, while again in the west of Ireland we had counties producing sheep and wool, but all counties, taken together, were producing the various <Col N="1727" /> items of food necessary for the people. The land was worked to produce the maximum of food that could be produced in the various areas.  We want if possible to revert to that system.</P>
    <P>Nobody suggests, if the Minister assures the House that the wheat situation is still serious, that wheat should not be grown.  We have not suggested that wheat should not be grown still if it is necessary.  I do not think that, even in areas where wheat is not a very suitable crop, the farmers will refuse to grow it if they realise that it is necessary for the life of the nation. We do believe, however, that there can be some diminution in the area under tillage without causing any diminution in the vital food supplies of the country. In fact, as the motion states and as Deputy Hughes has argued, it seems probable that from a lesser acreage with more intensive cultivation we would reap a greater harvest.</P>
    <P>There are other items of food that, if not as necessary to the people as bread, are almost as necessary.  There are, for instance, milk and butter supplies.  In the part of the country I represent, the people normally do little tillage but they produce milk, butter, cheese and other things to a great extent and they engage in pig-rearing which is a corollary to dairying. During the war years, the production of butter has fallen extensively and it is still falling.  It is possible that in a few years' time, with the gradual drop in the number of cows, the butter position will be as serious as the bread position was during the emergency. I do not want to be a false prophet but I am very perturbed about that condition of affairs.  People are getting out of dairy cows in my county.  I believe they are getting out also in Tipperary and other counties.  The Minister assures us that the number of cows has not fallen.  If that be so, the farmers in counties other than the dairying counties must be producing cows.  They must be producing cows in the midland and eastern counties. Almost every farmer I know in Limerick and Tipperary has reduced the number of his dairy cows to some extent.  Nearly every creamery I <Col N="1728" /> know has reduced its production of butter.  It would be extraordinary if it were otherwise because the number of dairy cows is down and the creameries cannot get the same quantity of milk as they got heretofore.  Virtually every farmer within 20 miles of my home, in the richest dairying county in Ireland, has reduced the number of his cows.  There may be a few who have not done so but they would be better off if they had, because they have tried to stick on to the same number of cows on diminished pasturage, with the result that the cows are only half-fed. It was inevitable that the number of dairy cows should be reduced in Limerick because the best of the pasturage was tilled.  The inspector who came down did not tell the farmer to till the worst of his farm.  The farmer himself would not devote the worst portion of his farm to the production of food.  He generally selected the driest and best part of his land and that had been his best pasturage.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed about the statistics mentioned by the Minister.  I should say that they are not reliable.  If the statistics show that the number of dairy cows is not going down and that production is still stable, all I can say is that the statistics lie.  I believe that the manner in which the statistics are collected is not reliable.  I am sure that Deputy Halliden, Deputy Ryan, Deputy Fogarty and the other Deputies who come from the dairying counties are aware that the number of dairy cows has been reduced.  It is a question whether it is worth while producing butter or not, whether the present ration of butter for the winter is sufficient for the working people of the cities and towns.  I do not see where more is to come from this year and I do not see any chance of that quantity being available next winter if conditions remain as they are.  The Minister should consider whether the general area of tillage should be so reduced as to permit the dairy farmers to strengthen their herds, so that there will be a better supply of butter.  In speaking as I do, on behalf of a dairying county, I am not suggesting that the maximum amount of food should not be obtained from every acre of land.  I am not suggesting that, if the <Col N="1729" /> necessity arises, we should not still grow our percentage of wheat or that it should not be produced outside the tillage areas, if necessary.  But there is a necessity for reducing the required 37½ per cent. of arable land to a reasonable amount.  In that way, dairy farmers would be permitted to get as near normal conditions as possible in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are other arguments, apart from the question of milk, in relation to the tillage Order as it affects counties like mine.  Unfortunately, ours is a wet county.  Dairying is, of course, a wet operation.  Our land is wet.  In at least three or four areas, the rivers are in a state of flood at times.  On one occasion, I saw several men harvesting in rubber top-boots because the water was up to their ankles. Only spots in the field were sufficiently dry for stooks.  I saw other tracts of land in my county with three or four feet of water.  The crops on that land were never cut.  I scarcely know a farmer with a holding of any size who had not to leave some portion of his corn uncut.  These are all things which have to be considered when deciding whether it is wise or not to insist upon a 37½ per cent. ratio of tillage.  Is it wise to drive the dairy farmer out of business?  He is going out of it gradually.</P>
    <P>Each year he has to till the required percentage of his land and he has to pass on to new parts of his farm if he is not to do as Deputy Corry mentioned and grow grain crops year after year on the same land.  In choosing the new land for cultivation, he has to cut in on his pasturage.  One can talk about ley farming and the results that will accrue from working the land and putting cattle into fresh pasturage but that cannot be done in Limerick.  If you break up a field in Limerick and somebody suggests that you put in grass seed and turn your cattle out in six weeks, I know what is going to happen to the field.  You could not put dairy cattle out on the land in my county within two years after letting it out.  You would have a sea of mud if you did so before a fair sod had been established.  The farmers have had a double quantity of their best pasturage used up in tillage.  The position is that <Col N="1730" /> most of them have about 60 per cent. of their original cows.  They will have about 50 per cent. next year.  Once they get out and realise the trouble they have been spared, it will be difficult to get them to go back.  The dairying farmer has been decried as a lazy man.  I know no farmer who has to work as hard as the dairy farmer.  No man has to work under the same conditions. He has to work on Sunday, Monday and holiday.  Some of them had, willy nilly, to reduce their herds owing to the tillage Order and they will not put themselves back into the same position again.  If one looks at the <i>Limerick Leader</i>, which supports the Government in my county, he will find two pages devoted every Saturday to advertisements of auctions of herds. The people are going out of dairying and still the Minister tells me, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corry that there is no diminution in the number of cows, that the statistics show that the number is stable.  Again I say that the statistics lie.  Everybody knows that farmers are reducing their number of cows. Farmers who had 100 cows in my county have reduced them to about 50. I do not know of any herd at present of more than 50.  There were numerous herds of 40.  The average herd is now in the region of 15 or 16 cows.</P>
    <P>However, that is all beside the point, except for the purpose of emphasising the fact that, with a lower percentage of compulsory tillage, we will get a greater amount of food.  It would be possible to give greater attention to a smaller acreage of cereals and, if the Minister wishes, let that cereal be wheat.</P>
    <P>We are prepared, as dairy farmers, to grow our percentage of wheat, if the Minister still thinks it necessary, although ordinarily I should not say that it is an economic proposition because we have never been able to keep up with the average production of wheat in other counties with lighter land than we have.  I should say that the average production of wheat in my county this year would not be more than four or five barrels per acre, which would not pay for the seeding. However, it will be done again, if the Minister wants it done.  It is not an economic proposition but if the necessity <Col N="1731" /> arises, it will be done.  I believe, however, that a good case can be made for a reduction in the general tillage Order to permit people like the farmers in my county to till a smaller area and to get back into pasture as fast as they can for their dairy cows. I may be met with the argument that that is getting away from the work and getting back to the dog and the cow, but it must be remembered that for every eight cows you put on the land in Limerick, a man is put at work, and for every eight or ten acres of grain you put down in Limerick, in lieu of cattle, you take a man out of work. That is beyond yea or nay.  There is more labour attached to a herd of dairy cows than to a countryside of tillage as those of us who have engaged in both types of farming know. I possibly have more experience of both types than most Deputies.  I have had more experience of wheat-growing in this and in other countries than most Deputies, because, at one part of my life, I did engage in wheat-growing&mdash;not in small plots of ten, 15 or even 30 acres, but in a country where wheat was the staple crop and where one saw nothing but wheat for miles and miles, so I believe I know something about the growing of wheat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the areas which had no tradition of tillage. There was very little tillage in my county, but there was a tradition, and, when the emergency came, there were very few farmers who did not know how to grow wheat.  They did grow it, when the necessity arose.  Another peculiar thing about wheat-growing in my county is that there are areas in which wheat cannot be produced economically, while in other areas, on the Kerry side of the county, the farmers can grow wheat and are anxious to grow it.  Nature probably had something to do with that, because, looking back 100 years, I find that the same conditions prevailed.  There was practically no wheat-growing in the dairying districts of Limerick 100 years ago, but it was grown extensively in the other districts of the county, so extensively that at one time, in order to get greater crops of wheat after growing it for years, they burned the topsoil, and <Col N="1732" /> I recently came across old leases in which it was a condition of a letting that the land would not be burned.  We produced wheat under these conditions 100 years ago, year after year, and when it would no longer grow, we burned the land to get a bumper crop for a year or two.</P>
    <P>Nature prohibited the farmer from experimenting with too much grain-growing in the richer areas.  He did not grow it in the Golden Vale, in Limerick or Tipperary, because, even 100 years ago, the land was better suited to other crops.  That has continued down through the centuries and when some of our great-grandchildren talk in this House in years to come, they will be speaking of the same conditions. There will be parts of the Twenty-Six Counties which will go in for one farming operation and other parts which will go in for another, and as little interference as possible with that system is all for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe we can get back a little from the Order now and we should do so. We do not in this motion ask the Minister for anything impossible.  We do not even ask him for a reduction in the area under wheat.  If the Minister still thinks it necessary, even in areas where wheat cannot be grown economically, that the farmers should grow it, well and good, but we do say that there can be a great reduction in the general amount of tillage without at all impairing our position in relation to the production of a vital food.  We say further, that a reduced acreage of tillage, properly carried out, will produce a greater amount of food per acre and we say finally that, in those areas in which tillage was not carried on extensively, in which dairying and other forms of farming were carried on, there will be a greater production of food of other kinds than there is now and that, on balance, the people will probably be better provided for than they are under the existing conditions of compulsion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion and my reason for doing so is that I believe it is high time the Minister gave very serious consideration to the circumstances under which the people endeavoured to comply with the <Col N="1733" /> tillage regulations.  As Deputy Bennett pointed out&mdash;and I may say that I do not agree entirely with his theories&mdash; there are parts of the country in which the farmers go in for dairy farming and other parts in which they go in for tillage.  Could the Minister not arrange, in the areas in which dairy farming is carried on, to give certain facilities to the farmers, because, without the dairy farmer, the tillage farmer is no use as it is the dairy farmer who produces the milk, butter and cheese, who rears the pigs, and so on?</P>
      <P>There are very special considerations in these areas and I hold that the percentage which farmers in dairying districts are compelled to till should not be as high as in, say, my constituency, where the farmers always tilled without any compulsion.  I represent a constituency that is as good a tillage area as there is in Ireland, an area in which the farmers do not require to be compelled to comply with any tillage regulations.  They grew wheat, oats, barely and beet before any emergency arose and they are growing them to-day.  If there were never any compulsion, the farmers of that area would still produce as much food as they are producing.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a very special consideration as a result of the five or six years of the emergency.  Farmers say that the continuous growing of wheat over four, five and six years results in the land becoming run out.  These men had to dispose of their live stock to comply with the tillage regulation, with a consequent shortage of manure, and, unless the land is properly manured, they will not get a very successful grain crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, last year the farmers got a guaranteed price of 55/- a barrel for wheat and they believed that, as long as they grew wheat and the ground produced it, they would get that 55/-, yet we had Deputy O'Leary producing a certificate here from a miller, which he received from a constituent in Wexford, showing only 45/- having been paid.  My interpretation of the guarantee is that he would get the 55/- as long as he grew wheat.  No encouragement is given <Col N="1734" /> to the farmers to continue in the very good tillage drive they have carried on in the past four or five years.  I can speak for the small farmers of whom I have intimate knowledge and can safely say that in Laoighis&mdash;where they do the best they possibly can to comply with the regulations&mdash;the crop this year has been lost completely. They have no feeding-stuffs for live stock and if they take them to the market or fair they will not be asked how much they want for them.  There is no market, no feeding-stuffs, no hay. It is time that very special consideration was given to the deplorable circumstances under which some farmers labour at present.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to have a great deal of sympathy for the type of farmer for whom Deputy Bennett speaks, but I have a great deal of sympathy for the small farmer who is put to the pin of his collar to exist at present and comply with all sorts of regulations. From conversations with farmers during the past four or five years, one would learn that it is not agricultural labourers the farmer should employ but a staff of clerks in an office to keep all the inspectors supplied with statistics. The farmers have reached the stage when they are completely fed up, tired and sick of compulsion and orders. They are not accepting any more guaranteed prices, in view of what has happened.  I know farmers in my own area who got only 46/- and 47/-, instead of 55/-.  That is no encouragement to them and it is less encouragement for their sons to remain on the farms.  If I were a farmer's son, I would very quickly make myself scarce from the land, as there is no encouragement to any young fellow to remain on a farm. That is a disgraceful state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that the old bog land and mountainous districts are not fit to grow wheat, but if a civil servant comes down he will tell the farmer he must put wheat in there.  Who knows what crops should be grown better than the farmer himself?  There is too much compulsion, red tape and regulations where tillage is concerned.</P>
    <P>I was reading not long ago about a Government&mdash;I think it was the British Government, but I had not time to <Col N="1735" /> check up before I came in&mdash;which gave a bounty to the farmers during the emergency, for every extra acre put under tillage.  If the Minister wants to encourage tillage and encourage the carrying out of the existing regulations, it is a wonder he did not introduce legislation whereby he could compare their tillage prior to the emergency with their present tillage and give them so much per acre in bounty, to assist them in the tillage drive and to comply with the regulations laid down by the Department.  If the British Government gave such a bounty to the British farmers, what was to stop the Irish Government giving as good a bounty?</P>
    <P>This question has been handled badly by the Department.  It is absolutely impossible to apply the same restrictions to every farmer and the Minister would be wise to give special consideration to the request made in this motion.  He should see what can be done to relax the restrictions in some way.  He may say that cannot be done, that what is done in one part of the country must apply all over. Would he not be wise to consult the county committees of agriculture and get their views as to the percentage it would be wise to enforce in those areas?  I was present with the Minister on two or three occasions, when he came to my constituency during the tillage drive, and I joined with him in appealing to the farmers to do everything possible to produce food for man and beast in those critical days.  However, if he came down now, I would be very slow in making an appeal with him for any further increase in tillage, as I am convinced that the farming community has been treated too badly in the past.</P>
    <P>For example, not far from my own home, the tillage regulations were enforced in every small farm in the district. The land of the late Mr. Davy Frame at Lamberton Park and Brockley Park I could swear a tillage inspector never saw; there was no such thing as having the tillage regulations carried out as far as that man was concerned.  Yet the officials did not forget to call on every 40- or 50-acre <Col N="1736" /> farmer&mdash;or, as Deputy Corry would call them, the &ldquo;hen-roosters&rdquo;.  It is the hen-roosters who built up the country we have to-day and but for them half the nation would be hungry. The Minister knows that the hen-roosters never required compulsion to produce food.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that something can be done for the areas where there is not good quality tillage land but bog land and mountainous land.  You cannot expect farmers to produce wheat there to any great extent and there should be no regulations in regard to that land.  The Minister may say that exceptions cannot be granted.  I say exceptions will have to be granted.  I have seen crops in my constituency where it was a waste to put the seed into the ground.  As Deputy Bennett pointed out, it would be far better to have less acreage and greater yield and have the soil put into a proper arable condition.  That would give far better results than making the farmer waste time, energy, seed and labour in trying to till bog land.  The Minister will have to give some consideration in those cases.</P>
    <P>I understand that the voucher system attached to wheat will not be in operation after this year.  That means that the farmer will get 2/6 less than at present.  There is not much encouragement in that.  I strongly recommend the House to accept this motion; I have read it and studied it and cannot see anything objectionable in it.  If the Minister cannot see his way to meet it, I ask him to be good enough to meet the request made by the mover, or even to meet that request halfway and relax the regulations in some way. We have reached the stage when the farmers are so fed up trying to comply with regulations, under such awful and horrid conditions, that it would not be surprising if they sat down and tilled none.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear at the outset that this motion is specifically designed to assist and promote the greatest possible yield of wheat and essential cereals.  While we realise the gravity of the wheat situation, and in particular the responsibility which devolves on farmers for <Col N="1737" /> producing a sufficiency of wheat, we equally realise that unless the farmers are in a position to get the maximum yield from their land the compulsory tillage Order will negative its purpose. While realising it is essential that we should have in this country, if not sufficient to meet our own requirements, at any rate as large a supply of wheat as we can possibly provide, we are at the same time aware that during the six years of the emergency the effect on vast areas of land has been to reduce considerably the output and the yield. In addition, as has been clearly and fully stated, many of our farmers, particularly those in areas other than areas which could normally be regarded as tillage areas, have not had a tradition of wheat-growing or, indeed, a tillage tradition at all.  Now, some Deputies imagine&mdash;and I think people other than Deputies are under the impression&mdash;that whether they have a tillage tradition or not, it is our duty to compel farmers in the national emergency to grow our essential requirements in food.  It is certainly true and desirable that farmers should grow the maximum quantity of food, but it is equally true that, in those areas in which a tillage tradition does not exist, it is not merely the tradition but the fact that through that tradition and through not growing wheat or cereals, they have not the machinery or the resources which are essential for wheat-growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers were placed in a serious difficulty at the beginning of the emergency. Many of them, anxious to comply in the most efficient manner possible with the Government's request and with the compulsory tillage Order, endeavoured to make inadequate machinery and improper forms of husbandry work during the emergency period.  It has now lasted for a considerable time, and so far as the wheat supply position is concerned it is quite apparent that the situation after the coming year and possibly the year after, may be even worse than it was during the years which have passed.  If that be so, and if the situation, so far as wheat supplies are concerned, is likely to be worse in the coming year and, possibly, in 1948, then I would suggest to the Minister <Col N="1738" /> that, even at this late stage, an effort should be made to provide a better system under which the tillage Order, and the cultivation of land for tillage, is to be operated.</P>
    <P>We can look for a moment at the agricultural war committees which operated in England.  It is true to say that they operated under the stress of serious danger and that, consequently, the maximum effort was made to achieve the fullest possible co-operation with maximum results.  We in this country, not being menaced at the earlier stages of the emergency with the possibility of a shortage of essential supplies for bread and for live stock did not make the same effort.  We did not adopt the same all-out ideas which permeated the policies operated in other countries.  We had the position that the Department relied on the compulsory tillage Order and on whatever voluntary effort could be organised through appeals by Ministers and by public representatives.  Now, while all that had a very gratifying result, it did not achieve in my opinion the results that could have been achieved had the Minister organised, under the county committees of agriculture, in conjunction with the inspectors, a system whereby allowances would be made in particular areas, according to the requirements of individual farmers, or according to the actual state of the fertility of the land.  The Minister adopted in the initial Order&mdash;he continued it in the various amending Orders&mdash;a system whereby he took certain areas in the country which he regarded as being suitable for producing the maximum quantity of wheat.  Accordingly, he decided that these areas should cultivate one-tenth of the arable land in wheat, and then there was a grading down as regards those areas which it was considered were less well able to produce wheat until the area was reached when only a small quantity of it was produced. Taking that in a general way, it may seem to be a suitable and fairly efficient system, but we have had evidence this evening that a county like Wicklow, which has quite a considerable area of land over the 500 contour line, is quite unsuited to have one-tenth of its area under wheat.  I suggest to the Minister that there should <Col N="1739" /> be a relaxation as regards all land above the 500 contour line and that under the tillage Order it should be reduced to one-sixteenth in agreement with the areas which are at present regarded as being in the second categories.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would suggest to the Minister that, in view of the shortage of time at his disposal, with no adequate machinery available for altering the compulsory tillage Order, a discretion should be given to the tillage inspectors.  I realise&mdash;in fact any farmer who has been in contact with the inspectors realises&mdash;that most of them had not the training or experience in the early years, and possibly not even yet, to decide what type of land, or what particular farms, were best suited to produce wheat or other cereal crops.  As a result of the experience that has been gained, I would suggest to the Minister that, in conjunction with the county agricultural instructors, a discretion should be given to inspectors in certain counties, particularly in the case of land above the 500 contour line.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that this motion is designed primarily to facilitate large farmers.  I think that anyone who examines for a moment the fact that most of the farmers above the 500 contour line, or who might be regarded as being in the third area for wheat growing are the smaller farmers. They are practically all people with 50 acres or under.  Therefore, it is clear that this motion is designed in the most equitable way possible to assist the small farmer who is handicapped by the lack of capital and the opportunity to get machinery and the other necessary facilities&mdash;the man who has been cropping continuously for six years, if not in the same field, at any rate cropping twice on the same land with wheat.  I suggest that if the modification which we are proposing is adopted and properly operated it will achieve a greater output than we have had during the current year in wheat production.  The latest figures available from the September issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i> show that the acreage under wheat this year is 641,300 acres as <Col N="1740" /> against 662,500 acres last year, a drop of 3.2 per cent.  That drop is practically negligible and would not interfere with the wheat supply here had it not been for the bad harvest.  I should like to know if the Minister is yet in a position, since the recent harvest, to estimate the reduction in the wheat production at home.  If we had even a fairly good estimate of the position as regards wheat, we would be better able to decide what modifications might be possible or desirable next year.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that the wheat crop this year in America and Canada has been the best, certainly since 1940, and possibly for many years before that but, unfortunately, because of the maritime strikes and transport decontrol in America, much of the wheat is still on the farms and the prospect of importing supplies is considerably reduced.  I suppose it is hardly necessary to urge on the Government the need of importing the largest possible quantity of wheat during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Minister should endeavour to import, if shipping is available, some portion of the maize crop which, according to an article written by Sydney Campbell, Reuter's financial editor, is abundant.  He says the present maize crop in America is the biggest in its history.  Assuming that that article is correct, it is likely a considerable quantity of maize will be available for export.  The Minister, I am sure, realises that the reduction here in the stall-feeding of cattle during the emergency&mdash;and it is a reduction which shows a progressive decline &mdash;has seriously hindered farmers in the cultivation of their land.  There is a shortage of artificial manures and only in the coming year can farmers expect anything like an adequate supply of artificial manures.  There is a reduction in the number of stall-fed cattle on every farm.  In order to facilitate the farmers in the coming spring to feed cattle, and thereby produce farmyard manure, the Minister should endeavour to import some of that maize.  Nothing has operated more against stall-feeding than the lack of maize for cattle fodder.</P>
    <P>As a result of the emergency utilisation of oats and oaten meal, there <Col N="1741" /> has been a reduction in the quantity of oats available for stall-feeding.  There was also a reduction in the offals from millable wheat because of the maximum extraction in operation throughout the emergency.  All these things combined to reduce the amount of stall-feeding which would normally take place here.  If it were in operation to the same extent as in pre-war days, we would have had an adequate supply, and possibly a very considerable increase, of farmyard manure. The position is that many farmers, through continuous cropping during the emergency, have reduced the fertility of their land.  There has not been much artificial manure available and there has been a reduction in the quantity of farmyard manure.</P>
    <P>With that situation in existence, and with the trouble which they have experienced because of a shortage of machinery&mdash;and that situation has not materially improved in the last year&mdash; the farming community are faced with great difficulties.  Added to all these difficulties we had this year a very bad harvest.  Then again, there were reductions in the price of cattle in the past 12 months.  I submit that all these things have made the burden on the farmers heavier than they might normally expect, and for that reason I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision with regard to this tillage Order.  I do not suggest that we should reduce the acreage under wheat.  I would still continue wheat growing in all areas which have a good soil fertility; in all areas, other than land above the 500 contour, compulsion in relation to wheat should be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am against compulsory tillage, but, in the present critical times, when supplies of wheat from abroad may be affected by transport difficulties, I realise that we must continue to grow at home as much wheat as possible. We should endeavour to produce sufficient to meet our requirements.  In that connection I believe that better results would be achieved by modifying this compulsory tillage Order in areas where the soil fertility is not so high. In that way I believe we would get increased supplies of other crops.  That would lead to increased foodstuffs for cattle and an increase in the quantity <Col N="1742" /> of farmyard manure.  The farmers would then be in a position where they could make their land more productive, make their seed beds more productive, make farming generally better and have the land cultivated in a more scientific fashion.</P>
    <P>I think everyone appreciates the work which the volunteer harvesters from the cities and towns accomplished in the recent harvest.  Many of them undertook the work at no small inconvenience to themselves.  If the position that exists in regard to labour in this country continues, a grave situation will arise.  Every effort should be made to ensure that in the coming spring and summer there will be an adequate supply of labour for agricultural work.  Every effort should be made to induce agricultural labourers, who, in their own way, are expert workers, to remain in this country. The country cannot do without them and every inducement should be offered to them to stay on the land.  Every effort should be made to enable the farmers to pay an adequate wage to their workers in order that food may be produced for the nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should face the situation in a more realistic manner than in the past.  He should realise the position of the farmers after six years of hard cropping of their land under the most difficult circumstances.  He should realise that we must produce the maximum amount of wheat&mdash;that the land should give its maximum output.  I believe it is possible to get a better production with a modification of the tillage Order.  The Minister should consider favourably the suggestions we have made and modify the Order, in certain areas at any rate.  He should review the decision to put the Order into force in areas where tillage was not formerly undertaken on the same widespread scale as at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to impress on the Minister that we on this side of the House are not against tillage.  We quite realise that the Government want to produce all the food possible during the emergency.  But the carrying out of the tillage Order as it stands at present is impossible.  In my opinion, it <Col N="1743" /> means a waste of time and of seed which could be used for food.  It is a waste to have farmers putting seed into land when they know it will not produce a crop equal to the amount of seed put in.  The difficulty is that a little bit too much is being asked from the farmers.  The Counties Meath and Westmeath are non-tillage counties and people do not realise the difficulties under which numbers of farmers labour in these counties.  The returns from a number of farms show that only two or three barrels of wheat per acre were produced this year.  The letter which I gave to Deputy Hughes and which he read showed that the return from that man's wheat crop was very bad.  I know of even worse cases, cases where there were only two or three barrels per acre produced.  The Minister cannot say that the people in Meath and Westmeath did not tackle the tillage scheme in a whole-hearted way. Officials can tell you that 98 per cent. of the farmers in these counties did the tillage required of them because they realised there was an emergency.  But we have gone through six years of that now.</P>
      <P>The present Order is a bigger hardship on the small farmer than it is on the bigger farmer.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Flanagan saying that.  He represents a tillage area and the majority of the farmers in his constituency are small tillage farmers.  They have come to the point after six years' continuous tillage that their land is worn out.  I know of a case in my county of a man having 28 acres of land, of which 25 acres are arable.  His tillage quota amounts to nine or ten acres and he has complied with the tillage requirements during the last five or six years.  He has gone round his farm as best he could.  Last year he got into such a position that he had to reduce the number of his cows owing to the amount of tillage he had to do. He has also two working horses to keep.  Last year he took six acres of meadow on conacre, but he did not draw home a load of hay.  The result was that he had to sell his cows.  Of course, that was due to the weather conditions, but it shows that the small farmer is harder hit than the big one</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> I maintain that the carrying out of the present tillage Order is impossible. Take the case of a man who has to grow 40 acres of grain.  In the spring time he starts to sow and gets in 30 acres of it.  To do it properly, he should do more to that 30 acres before sowing the other ten.  But he has to go on with the other ten acres.  Then probably the weather breaks.  The result is that the first part of the sowing is not properly done, because he has to rush the sowing.  We are not asking that tillage should be done away with. All we ask is that there should be a slight reduction made, say one-eighth, which would relieve the farmers very much.  When the man with 40 acres to whom I have referred has to cut his crop in the harvest time, after cutting 30 acres he should proceed to stack it. Instead of that he has to carry on with the other ten acres.  That is due to the fact that he has to do a little too much. I think any Fianna Fáil farmer-Deputy can bear me out when I say that the tillage Order asks for a bit too much. As I say, we do not want the tillage Order done away with until the emergency is over.  Farmers, of course, do not want to be dictated to by inspectors. I agree, however, with mixed farming.  I have carried out mixed farming all my life.  I would say that any farmer in my county who does not do mixed farming is not farming properly. But, as I say, farmers under the Order are being asked to do a bit too much.  I can show any inspector that there is not a farm in Westmeath, big or small, on which there has not been four acres, two acres, one acre, a half an acre left uncut.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry said that if we did not grow enough grain we would not have feeding for our hens.  In my opinion, hens never laid better than they did this year.  The farmers had nothing to do except turn them out in the fields. The fact is that every farmer, big or small, drew in nine or ten, or four or five loads, or a half load of grain and threw it in his haggard.  It was impossible to save it.  Deputy Hilliard, who comes from Meath, can verify what I say, that it is just the little bit too much that is asked for which is doing the harm.  I maintain that if the tillage quota was reduced slightly there <Col N="1745" /> would be a better return.  If a man had 20 acres sown last year, with an average return of eight barrels to the acre, he produced 160 barrels for the mills.  I maintain that if that acreage was reduced by one-eighth, by doing a little more to the land in the spring time and a little extra in the harvest time and having more artificial manure, he could increase the return by two barrels per acre and be able to send 175 barrels to the mills out of the 17½ acres tilled.  As well as that, I maintain that under the present tillage Order there is too much of a headland left.  If the acreage required was reduced, there would be less headland.  At present some farmers make a headland in the middle of a field.  I myself sow the grain into the very ditch.  Some farmers have not the wherewithal to do that. The farmers are doing their best, but too much is being required of them.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest arguments, in my opinion, in favour of reducing the tillage quota this year is the abnormal wet season we have had.  Take my own case.  I am trying to get my mangolds and my beet out now, but the carts are going down to the axles in the land so that I am only able to carry quarter loads.  It will take me until January to get my mangolds and beet out.  Then I have to tackle the turnips, and it will take me until February to get them out.  That is a point that a lot of people do not appreciate&mdash;the state of the land after the abnormally wet year. Many people do not understand the conditions in Meath and Westmeath. Numbers of farmers could not get in their binders because they sunk in the land.  Many farmers in my county have not finished their work on last year's crops.  We have no ploughing done in that county.  I do not believe there is an acre of winter wheat sown in that county.</P>
    <P>I will not be in a position to start ploughing until the month of February but one farmer I know had to start ploughing and he would have been better off if he had spent the time digging potatoes.  He has not got them dug yet.  Then there is straw lying there and the farmers have not time to head the ricks.  There is one wet day after the other.  No one knows the position <Col N="1746" /> the farmer is in at present as a result of the awful year we had last year. That is one of the greatest arguments for the motion.  The farmers understand the position and will try to carry out the Order if they get some little relief.  I am not advocating that they should not do that&mdash;that should not be advocated during the emergency &mdash;but the Minister should meet them. Westmeath is not a tillage county.  The Minister and his officials should know what are the results on any farm that they had to take over.  The Minister for Agriculture should ask Deputy Ruttledge what is the result of the tillage operations on the Mountmurray estate.  That estate was owned by an old lady.  It was one of the best farms in Westmeath.  When the tillage Order was enforced one of the best fields in that farm was tilled.  It was put up for auction.  The small farmers crowded in to give £6 and £7 an acre. As a result of the tillage, there was nothing but heaps of dirt.  The crops did not grow there.  The following year they thought it might be better in the second sod and they went in again but with the same result.  The old lady died and the property passed to some person who is a ward of court.  Deputy Ruttledge is acting in the case.  Deputy Ruttledge said the tillage must be done and he sent out all the machinery necessary to till it and did everything possible with it. The wheat there is worth nothing and the oats will not pay for the threshing. That shows the conditions that exist.  On some land in the county where you would expect a great crop, the crop is a failure.  Then we are cursed with a bad climate.  We heard about all the help that went out from Dublin during the harvest but it was raining all the time in my constituency.</P>
    <P>In County Meath and Westmeath we are not against wheat.  We love to grow wheat, if we can, because that is the only crop we can manage.  It will stand up and, no matter how low a percentage we get out of it, it pays us better than oats.  Whatever has been wrong with oats for the last two or three years, it stands until it is just about to ripen and then it falls down. If I have to do the full quota of tillage I would prefer to sow wheat and I <Col N="1747" /> think every farmer would grow wheat, even if there is only a small return.  I would not ask for a reduction in the wheat quota because it is easily harvested but we cannot harvest oats.</P>
    <P>This year the Department of Agriculture, from Radio Eireann, advised the farmers to put their wheat and oats in hand stacks and not to draw it in.  The result is that the hand stacks are there still and cannot be brought in because we have not sufficient threshers.  The threshers will thresh the big farmers' oats, and the poor small farmer who took the Government's advice&mdash;which might have been good advice because the oats were damp&mdash;cannot bring it in.  In many cases, these hand stacks are rotten to the ground.  That is all due to the lack of threshing mills.  There are numbers of people with no hope of getting a threshing mill until next March. Owing to the bad weather, the threshers are held up from day to day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry in his speech here tonight made a great case for reducing the tillage quota.  He mentioned some seed he got himself which produced oats and wheat which were no good. Deputy Corry does not realise now, but he will realise next year, that it is not the seed that is at fault but that it is the land that is impoverished after six years of cultivation.  It is the wee bit too much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt to say that perhaps the House is not aware that we must finish by 10 o'clock, and the Minister has not yet intervened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been argued that wheat and oats should not be grown successively year after year in the one field, that there should be a system of rotational farming.  The farmers of Westmeath and Meath are not encouraged to go in for rotational farming.  We are not encouraged to grow beet.  Deputy Allen is all right; he can get his beet delivered free and he can get a subsidy.  Deputy Corry is beside the factory.  It will cost me 17/- to 18/- a ton to deliver beet and it costs numbers of farmers in my constituency 24/- to 25/- a ton to deliver it and we get back 2/- subsidy.  What <Col N="1748" /> encouragement is that?  We are made to do everything.  There was an increase in the price of barley but what good is that to us when we cannot grow barley?  We cannot rick it.</P>
      <P>Then there is the matter of the flooding. I think the Government treated the people who suffered from flooding scandalously.  They sent relief to Europe and everywhere but the farmers were flooded out and have lost everything and the Government were very inhuman towards them.  They did not come to their aid.  They left them in the lurch.  People in France and everywhere else could get sugar but the farmers got nothing in respect of the flooding.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister why the cow parks are being tilled.  There are seven or eight cow parks in County Westmeath and no one is allowed to put a cow on them except the poor cottier who has no land.  The Minister for Agriculture says they must be tilled and the poor man has no place to put his cow.  In my opinion, land adjoining towns should be exempt from the tillage Order.  The town of Mullingar will be without milk this year, because the farmers have to till their land.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister feels he must have this compulsory tillage Order and I know the position he is in but he should give some small reduction.  A little reduction is all we want.  Give us that reduction and we will try to comply with the Order.  When the farmer has tilled the 30 acres, he is not able to do the other ten acres.  I defy any farmer on the Fianna Fáil benches to deny that.  As Deputy Flanagan has pointed out, the small farmer is more heavily hit than the large farmer by this Order.  I know the feelings of the people amongst whom I live and I would therefore appeal to the Minister to accede to the request which has been made in the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am fully aware of the difficulties of farmers in carrying out the tillage regulations, I should like at the same time to point out to Deputies the other side of the picture with regard to our great need of foodstuffs at the present time, especially of cereals, <Col N="1749" /> because we are dependent to a great extent on home production.  I do not want to trouble Deputies with too many figures but before the war we imported, roughly, 700,000 tons of cereals every year, about half of which was wheat.  We had at this time about 200,000 acres of wheat but from 1941 onwards we were driven to exist practically entirely on our own resources.  Our import went down to something like 25 per cent. of what it was pre-war.  We were driven therefore to depend practically entirely on ourselves.  We did actually grow two-thirds of our wheat requirements and we imported very little other cereals except wheat during the war years.  We all looked forward when the war was over to getting out of these difficulties with regard to imported grain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what the figure of production for this year in relation to our requirements is likely to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  It is very difficult to estimate it this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not even a rough estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see, wheat is coming in about four weeks later than last year.  It may be 85 or 90 per cent of last year's figure.  I could not give a better guess than that.  While conditions might have been expected to be better, the war being over, we find really that the possibility of maintaining our cereals supply is more precarious than ever it was during the war.  That is very significant, a very important fact we must keep in mind&mdash; that really we were never in such a precarious position before, when we take home produced wheat and imported wheat and put them together and consider our prospects with regard to the home produced wheat that is likely to come in between this and the end of the threshing season, and the imported wheat that is likely to come in between now and next harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies did say to me that we should try to import what wheat we can.  Deputies need not have the slightest fear that we are not doing everything possible in that regard but they <Col N="1750" /> must realise again that we are not by any means highest on the priority list of those in authority in Washington who are regulating the cereal supplies of other countries.  After all there are, as we know, countries on the Continent where starvation is actual and other countries where it is at least potential.  The combined food board in Washington have laid it down as a principle that the greatest need must be relieved first.  We can make up our minds, therefore, that we are not high on the priority list for imported wheat. Indeed, if it were not for the great effort of our farmers with their own help and the help of their agricultural labourers and the volunteer help that came from the towns and villages to save this harvest so successfully in the end, we might have felt the pinch of hunger or the want of bread even by now.  The necessity, therefore, remains for producing the maximum quantity of wheat during the coming year.  None of us knows what the conditions are likely to be after the 1947 harvest. Deputies have said that we can take it for granted that things will be better. If it was a matter, say, of having a bet, I might be prepared to bet that it would be better but we cannot take a chance in a case like this where the food of the people is concerned and, even though we have a very strong belief that things will be better after the 1947 harvest, we cannot allow matters to proceed on the assumption that they are sure to be better.  I am afraid we must go on the assumption that they may not be better after the 1947 harvest.</P>
    <P>There is, of course the necessity at the same time of producing other foodstuffs that are necessary, like barley and potatoes, which are used for human food as well as for animal feeding-stuffs, oats and other tillage crops and, of course, beet.  This year for the first time since early after the war we did succeed in getting in some maize.  I think we got something like 88,000 tons altogether and we may get more; at least we have some more ordered and paid for.  We shall probably get it but again we do not know how we shall stand, as soon as this present order is put through.  We shall only at the best get in about one-third of the <Col N="1751" /> amount of maize we used pre-war.  As I said, we do not know how we may stand for next year.  Our barley area was down 27,000 acres and I am afraid the yield is not as good as it was in 1945.  Then to add to our difficulties&mdash; and many Deputies have referred to the point&mdash;there was a great loss of oats during the harvest time.  Oats proved to be the most difficult of all the crops to harvest and a bigger proportion of oats than any other crop was lost owing to the bad weather.</P>
    <P>Our chances of importing grain, especially wheat, are not by any means bright.  In fact it looks at the moment as if they were worse than at any time during the war.  As well as that, we have been taking part in international conferences where the common urge was to give all the relief that could be given to the peoples who were starving and those of us who are not in want had to give an undertaking that we would do everything possible to produce for ourselves what is necessary and to draw the minimum amount from the common pool.  We gave that undertaking at a meeting in London in April, at the Emergency Economic Conference on Cereals which was representative of most European countries and the cereal producing countries outside Europe.  The same undertaking was given, though perhaps not exactly in those words, at the meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organisation Conference in Copenhagen in September so that we are bound in honour to do everything that we can to produce the greatest possible quantity of our own food ourselves. We are bound, in honour, not to draw on the world pool of human food more than is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, we are bound even to produce human food at the expense of animal feeding stuffs wherever that can be done economically and as a matter of good husbandry.  Any relaxation, therefore, of our efforts would militate against our constant endeavours to import our deficit of wheat from the world pool.  In other words, we must not in any way relax in doing the best for ourselves.  If we do, our omission may be used as an argument against us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> Deputies have argued that a reduction in the tillage area might not necessarily mean less food production. Some Deputies sought to prove that a slight reduction in the tillage quota might give us even more food.  I cannot agree with that.  Deputy Cogan argued that good pasture would be better than bad tillage.  I admit that, but I think that that is not a fair argument to use.  You will find that the type of farmer who has good pasture will also have good tillage, and the type of farmer who has good tillage will also have good pasture.  If any Deputy cares to look at the figures, he will find that, during the past three years, when we were on a higher level of tillage than previously, we got more wheat into the mills than before and that, at the same time, we increased our egg and bacon production.  We had actually more feeding stuff for pigs and poultry on account of the increased tillage, as well as getting in more wheat, and the number of cattle did not go down.  That is a very convincing fact&mdash;that, with the increased tillage, we got more human food and animal feeding stuffs, because our imports of feeding stuffs did not increase. We had no imports of feeding stuffs until this year, and our imports of wheat up to this year were designed to meet whatever deficiency there was. There was less deficiency to be met during those years than previously.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that any relaxation of the tillage quota would mean less wheat. Wheat is really the important matter because human food comes first.  We cannot relax in the case of wheat because we pledged ourselves to procure all the human food possible.  If we did not fulfil that pledge, it would be used against us and we might be left with much less wheat than we need. Another suggestion made would also, I fear, lead to less wheat.  Even people who have high contour land grow a little bit of wheat.  If we let them off, there will be less wheat.  The small farmer on a bog farm grows a little wheat.  If we let him off, there will be less.</P>

      <P>I admit that but I am coming to the question of these very extreme cases.  Any suggestion made which would apply to a fair number of people would have serious results.  A bigger class was suggested by Deputy Fagan&mdash;those supplying milk to towns. They would constitute a fairly big class and, if we were to let them off, it might make a considerable difference to the pool of wheat in the country. Even if we were convinced that we would get more milk, I am afraid that we could not let them off wheat because we all know how serious the position would be if there were not a sufficiency of bread.  We cannot let any class off wheat-growing because we cannot afford to do so.  It was argued that we should try to reduce the tillage quota in general.  Again, I am afraid we cannot do that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not but some Deputies urged that we should reduce the tillage quota, generally. The prospects of bringing in foodstuffs are poor.  We want potatoes, at least, up to the present level.  We want beet, if the factories are to work again. Barley and oats are necessary to keep up our animal production and in order that we may have production of bacon, eggs and other things in which we are interested.  I know that farmers may suffer great hardship this year. Deputy Fagan painted a picture of the farmers' position.  It was not over-painted in the case of many farmers but I know farmers who have their potatoes in and are fairly well off for the coming year. A great many farmers are, probably, late, as Deputy Fagan said, but this was an abnormal year.  I suppose that none of us has ever seen so bad a year and I hope that we shall never see so bad a year again.  We must go on the assumption that it was an abnormally bad year and that we are not likely to have so bad a harvest again.</P>

We have to keep that in mind.  A number of Deputies made the point that the Government did not appear to be serious about wheat when they withdrew the voucher for manure in the coming year.  I must say that, since the voucher was introduced four years ago, I was not aware that Deputies thought so much about it.  I defy any Deputy to turn up the Official Reports of the past four years and show where he mentioned that the voucher was of advantage to the farmer.  I did that a few times myself but nobody agreed with me.  It was not admitted that the 2/6 deferred payment was any advantage to the farmer.</P>

      <P>It was not thought much of until now.  During the coming year, the 1943 voucher will be cashed.  The cash will be more tangible to the farmer.  In the coming year, he will get some cash for his wheat but he will also get cash towards his manures to the extent of the vouchers he received in 1943.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Remember that, in the beginning, when this voucher was issued, it was stated that we recognised that farmers could not get artificial manures in the quantities in which they would like to get them and that there was something to be said for the argument the farmers were putting up that they were reducing the fertility of their soil by continued cropping without enough artificial manures and that we were putting something aside for them for the time when artificial manures would be more plentiful and when they could put back the fertility of the soil.  These manures will come in in bigger quantities in 1947 and will help to restore fertility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big point is: What can we do in <Col N="1755" /> this matter?  I am afraid the position is so serious that we cannot bring down the tillage quota and neither can we bring down the wheat quota.  I am asked whether we could not do something by way of giving the farmer an appeal to somebody.  That is not so easy, but I do not think the position is as bad as some Deputies think&mdash;that the small farmer on the bog or the small farmer high up on the mountain is made to grow a lot of wheat.  The tillage inspector assesses a man's arability, having in mind&mdash;he cannot escape having it in mind&mdash;that that arability will carry with it a certain proportion of wheat.  He must have in mind what wheat that man will be compelled to grow and is therefore not too hard on the man on the bog farm or the man on the mountain farm.  As a matter of fact, we have never had any great difficulty in the Department &mdash;maybe we did not go after these bog or mountain farmers so much&mdash;with these men in getting them to grow wheat.  I do not think any Deputy will be able to turn up any case in which we brought one of these people into court.</P>

      <P>There was no necessity to do so because they did what they were asked to do.  The people who were brought into court were the comparatively big farmers with the comparatively good land and I am afraid we cannot ease off with regard to these people.  I want to say, in passing, that I do not think Deputy MacEoin is right in saying that there were unseemly scenes between inspectors and farmers. I think they got on fairly well together. I also want to point out to Deputy MacEoin that if I said to Deputy Halliden two days ago that the tillage Order must stand, we can always listen to argument and we are always ready to be convinced by arguments, if it is possible to make any change.  Deputy Corry told Deputies a story which they should take to heart.  Last year, out of pique with the Department, he grew oats instead of wheat and he lost a lot of money on it.  Let that be a lesson to every ill-tempered farmer for the future.</P>

      <P>With regard to the price of wheat, some Deputies gave the impression that it was scarcely high enough.  I believe it is the highest in the world.  I do not think any country is paying as good a price.  I do not say that that holds for other agricultural produce, but it certainly holds for wheat.  With regard to Deputy Heskin's point, I do not want in any way to give the impression that I believe the sponsors of this motion are other than sincere.  I am quite sure they are, and I quite accept the statement they made that they are anxious to get tillage done and to get food produced in a most intelligent way.  I quite agree with that, but I am afraid we cannot make very much change in the present regulations.  I agree also with Deputy Bennett that Deputies from all sides at these meetings we had through the country during the emergency helped very much to get the tillage programme put through and food produced.  I should like to ask Deputy Flanagan where are all the inspectors who are annoying the farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we put all the inspectors in the Department together and made them work hard, they could afford to pay a visit to each farmer only every four years.  We hear a lot of talk about inspectors annoying the farmers, but it is the usual claptrap we get from Deputy Flanagan and people like him.  He went on to talk about the late Mr. David Frame and his land. Every piece of land he had was inspected and he carried out his obligations, but it suits Deputy Flanagan to attack Mr. David Frame and <i>moryah</i> to stand up for the small farmers because their votes are more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did give advice to farmers, as Deputy Fagan said, to put their corn in hand-stacks, but we certainly did not tell them to leave it there.  The reason we gave that advice was the scarcity of threshers and we did not want them to rush it in immediately and run the risk of its heating in the haggard.  I cannot see how we can <Col N="1757" /> make any change because the position is far too serious.  The only thing I can suggest is&mdash;although I do not think it is necessary&mdash;that the notice of inspectors might be drawn to the point that, when inspecting the bog farms and the mountain farms and assessing arability, they should keep in mind the fact that a certain wheat quota will be a natural consequence of that arability assessment.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  The Minister was down in County Tipperary at a food production meeting and he will remember that a deputation waited on him after the meeting to discuss butter production.  It was pointed out to him then that the number of cows would go down and that butter production would be reduced as a result.  That has happened. I suggest that the agricultural committee was called together very late this year.  It was called only about 10 or 12 days ago, and I suggest it should have been called a little earlier.  I want to thank the Minister, or whatever Minister was responsible for it, for introducing the migratory labour scheme, which did great work.  I also thank the town and city workers.  My <Col N="1758" /> county contributed as much as any other to the production of food. Deputy Bennett has described how much we have suffered and how the land was burnt in earlier days.  The Minister was asked by Deputy Corry whether he was going to take any action regarding the raw materials produced under compulsion in many cases and now left on the roadside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not five minutes to ten or before 10 o'clock?  I had no intention of pressing a division, as I expected the Minister to meet this in the spirit in which it was put down, in moderation.  We asked for a modification only and left it as vague as we could, so that the Minister might meet us.  We are not asking for very much and the Minister has accepted what has been said.  There has been great hardship, particularly this season and especially in districts where the farmers had not the equipment or the technical knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a problem that may or may not arise after the 1947 harvest.  I am not going into the question of our position of priority regarding the issue of wheat from the wheat pool and the control of that pool.  In my arguments for the motion, I read a few extracts from statements that appeared in the Press, which were made by Sir John Orr on this matter.  We are thinking in terms of 11 months ahead from to-day and the Minister seems to forget that, in Europe and in occupied Germany especially, we may anticipate a very substantial improvement in the attempt to meet their own requirements.  In the British and American zones, equipment will be put in for the coming sowing season and there will be a substantial food output from those areas.  That means that the very great draught on the world's supply of wheat for the bad areas in Europe will be to some extent relieved. I do not want to build a case on that and do not want the Government to act in a dishonourable way at all towards <Col N="1759" /> those people controlling the wheat pool and those conferences attended earlier in the spring and later in Copenhagen by the Minister himself. We entered into obligations to do the best we could and we are bound in honour to do so.  We want to grow all the human food we can at all times, apart from this abnormal time, and we want to produce even animal food, as that means eventually producing human food of the most precious kind, the protective food essential to life, that is, proteins and vitamins.  We cannot relax in our efforts to do the best we can.  However, we suggest merely a modification and the Minister has accepted that there are definite hardships on the high mountainside, on acid soils, where the farmers cannot hope for a decent return.</P>
    <P>It may be a small matter for the Minister and the country, but it is a very serious matter for the individuals concerned, who have to maintain large families on small holdings.  These are the people we&mdash;and Deputies generally &mdash;are thinking of and worried about. I give the Minister credit for being anxious to meet the House on this and I would prefer to settle it without a division.  I suggest he should set up an appeal board, by appointing a few senior officers with technical knowledge, to review cases where an appeal is made.  The Minister must remember that there are ordinary junior men acting as tillage inspectors, some of them with no technical knowledge whatever for the job.  Half a dozen senior officers might cover the whole country, with one officer for each four or five counties, and it may apply only to a limited number of counties.</P>
    <P>No matter what the Minister thinks about the case made by Deputy Fagan, I have a good deal of sympathy for the <Col N="1760" /> people living in his constituency, as there is a predisposition there all the time for the soil to give grass and vegetation.  Very often you find the undergrowth is as high as the crop itself, giving rise to a lot of difficulties. If the Minister is prepared to give way now, I submit that, even in the modification we envisage, he will not be doing anything dishonourable in regard to the obligations he has entered into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order Paper to day there appeared a question in the name of Deputy Thomas F. O'Higgins. The question was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state his reason for appointing, to the post office in Moneygall, a person who had no service in the Defence Forces, when an ex-sergeant of the Defence Forces, with an exemplary record, was rejected for the position.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The person who directed my attention and that of Deputy O'Higgins to this transaction was not the aggrieved party at all, but a man who felt that those who had done their part were entitled, not necessarily to reward, but at least to a redemption of the undertakings given to them when they were asked to undertake heavy duties in the service of this State.  Deputy O'Higgins put down that question in consultation with myself, and I trust he will feel free to participate in the discussion which is now initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago a friend and supporter of mine wrote to me from a town in Monaghan remonstrating with me because he, having been a temporary postman in his area for a long time, now found that, when the permanent appointment fell to be made, he had not been chosen, and an ex-service man recently demobilised had been given the position.  He asked me to take up that matter with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to remonstrate with the Minister, and to press his claim.  I do not deny I found myself in a somewhat awkward position.  The complainant was an old friend and supporter of mine.  The man who got the job was neither one nor the other.  I wrote back to him and said&mdash;there was <Col N="1763" /> no use putting a tooth in it&mdash;&ldquo;I am not going to make any remonstrance to the Minister for, if I had been the Minister, I would have done exactly what he did.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those men who joined the Army during the emergency were assured, if they found themselves unemployed when they came out, if there was employment going in public offices they would get the preference, and that all of us would combine to bring what pressure we could on private employers to give a preference to the men who had served during the emergency.</P>
    <P>The general atmosphere of corruption and fraud that is spreading through this country in connection with public appointments is common knowledge, and it is right and proper to denounce it and expose it on every possible occasion.  But this particular case imports, in addition to fraud and corruption, a third evil quality, and that is repudiation of a solemn promise given. It is none of my concern to vindicate the reputation of the members of the Government benches.  I do not think it comes as any surprise to the people that undertakings given by them should be repudiated when it suits them to do so.  But when people sitting on this side of the House give promises, they do not like to see them betrayed&mdash;and that goes for those on the Independent, Fine Gael and other benches as well.</P>
    <P>I went around this country with the Taoiseach in the days when the people were being asked to join the Army, the L.D.F. and the L.S.F., and from common platforms with him pledged my name that, if they would fill the gap when they were badly wanted, even at considerable loss to themselves, when they came out under the handicap of having missed those vital years in civilian employment we would stand by them and, in so far as within us lay, make up to them what they had lost by joining the Army.  Deputy O'Higgins went around the country with Fianna Fáil and Labour members of the Defence Conference giving the same pledge and undertaking.  I am concerned to see that the promise that was given in my name and in that of my colleagues is not betrayed.</P>
    <P>That is my interest in the Moneygall <Col N="1764" /> Post Office and I am convinced that 90 per cent. of Deputies here, when they hear the facts, will agree with me that this is a dirty transaction and is one of which this House has every reason to be ashamed.  The sub-postmistress in Moneygall died and, in due course, it became necessary to fill the vacancy created by her death.  In the interval, between the vacation of her office and the publication of an advertisement asking for applications, a lady in the Moneygall area bought the deceased postmistress's house.</P>
    <P>Now, any Deputy raising a matter of this kind finds himself in a delicate position when he has to draw into a discussion of this character the name of a lady.  Let me say at once that, so far as the lady in this case is concerned, her personal reputation would stand as high as that of any lady in the land. There is no reflection upon her personal honour or integrity in any way.  That much being said, let me add that she is a prominent, stalwart and loquacious member of the Fianna Fáil Cumann in Moneygall and, of course, the wink was tipped that sooner or later this post office vacancy would be filled and it would not be a bad thing at all if an applicant for it had the house of the lady who used to operate the post office, because that would be a grand ground for giving it to a good, seasoned member of the Fianna Fáil Cumann.  The lady in question bought the house and now we have the situation in which this lady, who is a school-master's wife&mdash;a lady whose husband is in receipt of an income of £400 or £500 a year&mdash;is residing in the deceased postmistress's house.</P>
    <P>Between 30 and 40 yards down the road there is living a man by the name of Gleeson.  He has a nice little house, he has a nice little shop, too, and he has the shop in the most convenient premises that he could find, because he wants to do the best business he can. What is his record?  He joined the Volunteers in 1917.  He served in a flying column for 12 months prior to the Truce.  He joined the National Army as a lieutenant and served therein from 1922 to 1927.  He was awarded a military service pension of £70 per annum. When the emergency developed he joined the Defence Forces in 1940 and <Col N="1765" /> served as a sergeant until 1945.  He is a widower and is living in that house with his daughter, doing the best he can by conducting a little business to supplement the pension of £70 which he inherited from his service in the National Army.</P>
    <P>I know well&mdash;we all know&mdash;that two or three members of the Oireachtas got after the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to give this post office to the lady whom I have described, but the Department of Defence, not actuated by any political considerations, got after the Minister also and officially represented to him that a division of that Department had been established by the Government to ensure that ex-service men would get fair treatment and, in certain circumstances, a degree of preference.</P>
    <P>They stated without putting cap or cloak on it: &ldquo;We maintain that ex-Sergeant Gleeson, with his long and honourable record in the national service is at least as deserving&mdash;we will say no more than that&mdash;than the other candidates and, on that account, we claim that ex-Sergeant Gleeson should be given the post office.&rdquo;  I say that a man with that record in the national service, who has £70 a year pension, and who is running a decent respectable business in order to supplement that pension, has a great deal better claim to the sub-post office in Moneygall than has the wife of a national teacher drawing £400 or £500 a year, whose only recommendation is that she and her husband are prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Cumann and that a few members of the Oireachtas had salt put on their tails by the particular clique to which they belonged and were warned that if she did not get the post office they would feel it the next time there was a general election.</P>
    <P>I want to know here and now does this House intend to redeem the promises that were made to these men when we asked them to join the Defence Forces or does it not?  Are you going to betray them, to repudiate them and let them down whenever you think you can do so under the cloak of secrecy?  If you are, it is the most dastardly and disreputable performance <Col N="1766" /> of the many dastardly and disreputable performances to which we have been witness in this country.  I venture to prophesy that if that is to be the despicable performance of a Fianna Fáil Minister and a Fianna Fáil Government there will be those on this side of the House to pledge their word to these men that they will strip the cloak of hypocrisy off every member of the Fianna Fáil Party who dabbles in that kind of transaction in the future.  We will keep our eye on them and their activities and, where they engage in dirt of this kind, we will apply the only effective and the only suitable instrument for their correction&mdash;the light of day.</P>
    <P>I venture to swear that, after they have stood naked in that light before our people who, no matter what Party they belong to or support, at least have a sense of justice and decency and do not like double-crossers, do not like people who go begging favours when they are in a tight corner but are ashamed to see their friends when the danger is past&mdash;our people seeing such, will deal with them in time.  It may be a slow process, it may be a tedious process, but I dare to repeat words I used recently in this House: &ldquo;We shall not weary of calling to mind the promises and their betrayals&rdquo; and we will depend upon the people to put a sting in the words we now employ.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for having given permission to Deputy Dillon to have this matter raised on the adjournment.  I am particularly grateful to Deputy Dillon, in my absence at Question Time, for having asked permission to raise it on the adjournment.  I think that it is a matter that concerns every single one of us who has any regard for the safety of the State, for gratitude for service rendered to the people, and respect for our pledged word of honour.  In dealing with this matter, I have no desire whatever to say any word hurtful or offensive to the lady who secured the particular position.  She is apparently very highly qualified, but, at the same time, I submit you are making very little of your Army if you say that a non-commissioned officer in Ireland's National Army, a man who is thought <Col N="1767" /> worthy as a sergeant to command a section in the hour of real danger, is unfit to administer a rural post office in the village of Moneygall.  If that is the Minister's contention, I shall leave him to fight it out with the Minister for Defence.  If a person is so thoroughly incompetent that he cannot administer a sub-post office in Moneygall he was entirely unworthy to hold the responsibility of a non-commissioned officer in the Army of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, like Deputy Dillon and myself, when things were dark and times were dangerous, paraded on public platforms from Waterford to Donegal, and pledged his word and the word of an Irish Government and the word of an Irish Parliament that any men who gave up their civilian occupation to serve their country in the time of peril would not be forgotten by him, by an Irish Government, or by an Irish Parliament, when the time of crisis had gone by and when they returned to civilian life.  This case would be an outstanding case if this was merely a young man who had gone into the National Army seven years ago in response to a common call.  It would be as strong even in that set of circumstances. But this was a man who, in the time of his youth, when he could have been gaining a profession or consolidating himself in business, threw up everything, left his home and went to join a flying column in North Tipperary when columns were active there, when participation in such work was dangerous, and when they saved thousands of homes in Offaly and North Tipperary.  That was the part he played as a young Irish patriot 27 or 28 years ago.  Some years later, when another call went out, he joined the National Army and was so competent, so highly qualified and such a true patriot that he was honoured by receiving non-commissioned rank in that Army, having served his country in fighting for and securing the right to have an Irish Minister to reject him for a paltry job in his middle age. Having gone out with his colleagues and established that Parliament, he went back into the Army to defend it. Six years later, in his middle age, when the call for men to come forward to defend <Col N="1768" /> the country went out again, he did not lean back selfishly.  He responded again to the call, having got every honourable assurance from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, from the Deputies sitting behind him, from the Senators in the same Party, as to what they would do for such men when they returned to civilian life.</P>
    <P>Then there is a vacancy for a sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress in Moneygall and a highly qualified lady, 30 yards down the street, seeks political influence, and he, relying on his capacity, on his qualifications, on his service, and on the pledged word of the Taoiseach and every member of the Government, does not go to anybody, either myself or any other Deputy, to pull political strings, to bring political pressure to bear.  He stands on his qualifications, on his merits, on his service and relies on the Minister for justice and asks only for justice.  The Minister stands up to tell us, in answer to a public question, that a man who is worthy of carrying a commission in our Army is not sufficiently qualified to run a rural country sub-post office, that the premises of the other applicant are more suitable.  I know the village of Moneygall, and I doubt if the Minister does.</P>

I am prepared to do as much for people with a national record as anybody else but there must be discretion exercised even in these matters if it is not to bring it into ridicule and contempt with other people throughout the country.  We have seen abuses on previous occasions where persons leaving the Army were appointed to positions and actually created public opinion against them.  We are bound to exercise our discretion in these matters and to act on the expert advice, and that is what I did in this case.</P>
