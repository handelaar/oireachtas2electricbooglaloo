      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the urgent need for the provision of additional housing, he will include contractors engaged in the building industry in the categories qualifying for supplementary petrol allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Contractors engaged in the building industry are eligible for supplementary allowances of petrol for commercial goods vehicles operated by them for the transport of materials and for the operation of plant and machinery used by them in connection with building operations.</P>
      <P>As announced by public advertisement on the 5th June, 1946, supplementary allowances of petrol are now available for certain classes of owners of private motor vehicles.  The concession is available to eligible members of firms of contractors on the same basis as to persons in other types of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that if a contractor applies for a supplementary allowance for his private cars, which are to be used in connection with his work, he will get a supplementary allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably.  If the managing director of a firm or persons whose business involves travelling apply their applications will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it unfair that certain categories of people should be given the supplementary allowance without having to make special representations, while contractors, who need it very badly for their business, in the public interest, may be turned down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The managing directors of firms or commercial travellers are entitled to a supplementary allowance. That applies to contracting firms as well as to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the question really with reference to people in the contracting business who would be supervising the jobs, and who are not necessarily commercial travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only to that class of person a supplementary allowance is now being granted, not to supervising members of staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider the case of a small contractor who operates in a rural locality and who may have to travel a considerable distance on two or three jobs?  Would he be entitled to a supplementary allowance?  I am thinking of the small man who probably does part of the work himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In such cases the transportation would probably be done on goods vehicles for which a supplementary allowance is given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not expect the head of a distributing firm to go around selling goods, but prefers to give the extra petrol to commercial travellers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, why would he not consider the analogy between a clerk of works for a contracting firm and commercial travellers working for a distributing firm?  Will he consider the claims of persons occupying such analogous positions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a clearly defined category of persons.  When I referred to managing directors I meant not the head but the person actually responsible.  That person is entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister realises that a large firm will have 40 contracts on hands, and a person whose position is analogous to that of a clerk of works is in charge of ten jobs.  It is necessary for him to be circulating to keep control.  Would the Minister consider in regard to such building contractors that such persons would be recognised in the category of persons entitled to the allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the hardships being caused to certain classes of fishermen, using power boats, by the practice of allocating kerosene on a standard horse-power basis without regard to the class of fishing carried on; that boats engaged as drifters, which have to use their engines only when going to or returning from the fishing grounds, get the same allocation of kerosene as trawlers which have to use their engines dragging their trawls all the time they are working at sea; and whether he will in future make an increased allowance of kerosene available to boats occupied in trawling, as distinct from drifting or line fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the present system of allocating supplies of kerosene for fishing boats on the basis of the horse-power of the engine involves hardship to certain classes of fishermen.  I am satisfied that the system is equitable as between the various types of fishing boats and it is not proposed to change it in the early future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate the necessity of fixing such prices.  He will understand that it is only fair to consumers, who have to pay high prices for home-grown tomatoes, due to the fact that they must be purchased owing to the embargo on imports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) the quantities of home-grown tomatoes reaching the Dublin market during each of the last four weeks; (b) the prices realised in the Dublin market for such supplies; and (c) the price per lb. at which home-grown tomatoes were sold retail during the periods mentioned; further, whether he will state the quantities of foreign-grown <Col N="2099" /> tomatoes imported into Dublin during each of the past four weeks, the prices at which they were sold to the trade, and the prices at which they were sold retail; and whether he will make a statement in regard to the policy of his Department covering the importation of this commodity during the period that the home-grown varieties are in short supply, and are sold at prices which make it impossible for people of small means to buy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The quantity of foreign grown tomatoes imported into Dublin for distribution throughout the country during the weeks ended 1-6-46 was approximately 490 tons and during the week ended 15-6-46 195 tons.  There were no imports during the weeks ended 25-5-46 and 8-6-46.</P>
      <P>These tomatoes were sold by the importers to the wholesale trade at a price of 21/- per basket of about 26 lbs. and were retailed at the maximum controlled price of 1/4 per lb.</P>
      <P>I have no official information in regard to the other matters referred to in the question, but I understand that limited quantities of home grown tomatoes reached the Dublin market during the past four weeks at prices varying from 3/3 to 4/6 per lb.  The retail price varied from 4/6 to 6/6 per lb.</P>
      <P>The question of policy in relation to the importation of tomatoes is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that until such time as home growers are in a position to supply the market at reasonable prices it is only commonsense that tomatoes should be available to the overwhelming section of the community at prices prevailing during the last few weeks?  I may say that tomatoes, generally speaking, have taken the place of eggs owing to their food value, and are much appreciated in the home.  The ban on the importation of tomatoes is considered a great grievance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a large number of migratory agricultural workers, some of whom possess migratory agricultural permits, and others who are sons of migratory agricultural workers, who have a guarantee of regular seasonal employment with farmers in Britain, are being held up as a result of Government policy relating <Col N="2102" /> to migration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  I have received no representations that the emigration of large numbers of migratory agricultural workers is being held up.  Such workers would not ordinarily be refused facilities to take seasonal agricultural employment in Great Britain unless they are employed on agricultural or turf production work for which their continued service is essential, or have refused such work in their own districts, or have left it voluntarily; or if the workers concerned are members of the special register of agricultural and turf workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at present migratory workers, in East Mayo particularly, are suffering great hardship, due to the inconvenience caused by Government policy governing migration?  Is he further aware that the Gárda Síochána find it extremely difficult to draw a distinction between a migratory worker and what is termed a labourer, that they are afraid to give a definition in accordance with their own views, because the county surveyor and assistant surveyor come down on them, with the result that they are reported and their positions thereby endangered?  I called on the superintendent in Claremorris last Saturday and he had ten permits in respect of people described as migratory workers, but he was afraid to send them away.  He was about to send them to the local branch of Industry and Commerce, where they should not go at all.  The persons concerned have been held up for three or four weeks, with the result they have lost their employment in Britain.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to accede to the Deputy's suggestion.  In view of the considerable misunderstanding that seems to have grown up around this matter, I think it well to say that the existing Order is similar to one that has been made for 11 years past. The Order does not absolutely ban the importation of tomatoes but prohibits their importation except under licence. Since the Order came into operation on the 12th June, a quantity of tomatoes has been imported under licence.  There are no applications for import licences before my Department at present.  The object of the Order is, of course, to prevent the prices of home-grown tomatoes being unduly depressed when the crop becomes available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to make these Orders so that there will not be stocking up against the home crop.  If there is an application for an import licence, it will be considered.  There are certain countries in respect of which we will not grant licences, because of the danger of certain diseases being brought in.</P>

      <P>The manuscript of the reverend chairman's speech for the Davitt commemoration ceremony at Straid was received by post in the Broadcasting Station on 31st May.

      <P>The function of the Director of Broadcasting is confined to dealing with matters of grave public importance. It is really not part of his duty to alter details in the text.  The speaker is responsible for his own text and the widest latitude should be allowed.  Obviously the phrase head of the State was a slip for head of the Government.

      <P>The vacancy for a sub-postmaster at Swinford was advertised during the period 30-4-1945 to 15-5-1945, inclusive, by exhibiting an official notice in the window of the sub-office concerned.  This is the normal procedure. It is not a fact that the appointment was made on the 1st April last. The newly-appointed sub-postmaster was installed on 13-6-1946, and there was no abnormal delay in his taking up duty.  His premises are central and suitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state what progress has been made in the allocation of the lands in the hands of the Land Commission in County Mayo; what steps <Col N="2112" /> have been taken for the acquisition of various holdings in the county, following upon representations made by Deputies of the Clann na Talmhan Party representing County Mayo, and further, whether there are any concrete plans for the resumption of migration from congested districts in Mayo to the Midlands, particularly from districts where the rundale system exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is that the allocation of such land as has come into the possession of the Land Commission in Co. Mayo, as elsewhere, is proceeding as fast as possible.  D e s p i t e shortages of materials and inspectorial staff, some 1,750 acres of untenanted land in County Mayo were allotted in the last financial year.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, a comprehensive reply would entail much investigation and labour. It is not feasible to divert staff for such a purpose but the Deputy can readily ascertain the position of individual cases in which he is interested by inquiry to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>To the last part of the question the answer is that further migration from congested areas in the West must depend upon the acquisition of land and the provision of buildings in the Midlands. It is the policy of the Land Commission to arrange for such transfers whenever and wherever possible.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, does the Minister realise that there is a land hunger in County Mayo at the moment and that there is a considerable acreage in the hands of the Land Commission and a considerable number of holdings unoccupied and underworked because of the tenants being ill, or dead, or outside of the country?  Will he now take immediate steps and devote all his attention to the allocation of the lands taken over, particularly the Irwin estate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission is aware that there is a dire congestion in Mayo.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been carrying on for a number of years knowing it.</P>
      <P>The supplies made available last year consisted of specified quantities of some 13 different categories of goods. They included 20,000 head of cattle, 1,500 horses, 10,000,000 lb. of canned meat, 20,000 cwt. of butter, 16,000 cwt. of bacon, 10,000 tons of sugar, and 100,000 blankets.  There were smaller quantities of cheese, infant foods and condensed and dried milk, as well as a variety of woollen textiles&mdash;200,000 knitted undergarments for children, 50,000 lb. of knitting wool, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made a public offer of these supplies, making it clear that they were available as a gift from the Irish people to the peoples of the Continent who had suffered from the war.  As I told the Dáil when I was moving last year's Vote, the offer was accepted by the Governments of Holland, Belgium, France and Italy.  Each of these countries had recently been the scene of active hostilities; their peoples had suffered the loss and destruction which invasion and war bring in their train, <Col N="2117" /> and, being, on the whole, conveniently situated in regard to this country, the problem of transport&mdash;which at that time appeared the major obstacle in any effective aid from this country to the Continent&mdash;was not without hope of solution in their case.  Accordingly, one-fifth of the total supplies available was allotted to each of the four countries named&mdash;Holland, Belgium, France and Italy.  The remaining one-fifth was allotted later in the year to the Joint Relief Commission of the International Red Cross for distribution according to need in other parts of Europe.</P>
    <P>As I said, it was made clear that these supplies to Europe were being offered as a gift.  Holland, Italy and the International Red Cross accepted their allocations on that basis.  The Belgium Government intimated its desire to pay for the supplies sent to Belgium, and the French Government, while accepting as a gift the supplies sent to and distributed by private charitable organisations in France, expressed its desire to pay for the goods received and distributed by French Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that, although the supplies included in last year's Vote were allocated and accepted in the manner I have described, the present Estimate includes a Re-Vote of an unexpended balance of last year's provision amounting to £1,552,000.  This unspent balance is almost entirely attributable to two main factors.  In the first place, for transport and other reasons, Italy and the International Red Cross were unable to take advantage of their allocation of live stock, and, although 14,664 cattle and 2,026 horses were shipped to the three countries, Holland, Belgium and France, some of these were purchased direct and paid for by the Governments concerned. These together resulted in a reduction of £650,000 in the estimated expenditure. Secondly, in spite of every effort it proved impossible to obtain the tins and other packing materials necessary for the dispatch of the 10,000,000 lb. of canned meat included in last year's gift.  It is a great pity that this difficulty should have been met <Col N="2118" /> because, as we have been told from many quarters, and as is indeed obvious, this canned meat would have been a very useful and valuable form of relief supply.  The non-dispatch of the canned meat, however, resulted in a further reduction of £750,000 in the expenditure originally proposed.</P>
    <P>With these exceptions, however, practically all the supplies made available last year were successfully shipped and distributed.  Of the total provision of 20,000 cattle and 1,500 horses, there were shipped, as I have said, 14,664 cattle and 2,026 horses.  The provision of 20,000 cwt. of butter, 10,000 tons of sugar, 100,000 blankets and 5,000 dozen pairs of woollen gloves was shipped in full.  Some of the quotas were actually exceeded.  Eight hundred and five tons of cheese were shipped as against the quota of 800 tons, 60 tons of dried milk against the quota of 50 tons, and 700 tons of condensed milk against the quota of 250 tons.  Shipments fell short of the quotas in the case of woollen socks, knitted undergarments, baby foods and stoves and cookers.  Seventeen thousand two hundred dozen pairs of socks were shipped against the quota of 20,000 dozen pairs; 14,760 dozen knitted undergarments against a quota of 16,000 dozen; 40 tons of infant foods against a quota of 50 tons; and 340 stoves and cookers out of the 500 which had been earmarked.  The French shares of the quotas of 250 tons of cheese and 50,000 lb. of knitting wool had yet to be shipped at the end of the financial year.  Otherwise, those quotas were shipped in full.  In order to complete this picture of what was sent out last year under the Vote, I might say that, in addition to the supplies I have mentioned, foodstuffs and medical and other supplies to the value of £36,000 were provided for the Irish hospital at St. Lo in France.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Dáil need have any doubt that these supplies have been sincerely appreciated by the people who received them and that they have been of real and substantial value in relieving distress and suffering. If proof of that were required, it would be found in the many <Col N="2119" /> thousands of letters which have been received from people in the areas in which the supplies were distributed. Great progress towards national recovery has been made in the countries of Western Europe during the past 12 months.  Conditions in these countries are already very different from what they were a year ago when our offer was made and the first supplies shipped.  It is satisfactory to think, however, that the food and other supplies sent from this country arrived at a time when they were really needed and that, in their way, they helped to relieve the distress of the transition period.</P>
    <P>I said just now that one-fifth of the relief supplies made available last year was allocated to the Joint Relief Commission of the International Red Cross. These supplies were sent to the French port of Bayonne in Irish vessels; from Bayonne they went by rail to Switzerland, and from Switzerland they were distributed through the machinery of the Joint Relief Commission, to nine different European countries&mdash;Austria, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Germany, Hungary, Northern Italy, Poland, Rumania and Yugoslavia.  The allocation of the supplies as between these different areas was made on the principle of relative need, due account being taken of transport possibilities and other material factors; and, in each case, the supplies were distributed in accordance with a definite scheme of distribution worked out by the Joint Relief Commission in agreement with the local authorities.  Young children, nursing and expectant mothers, maternity hospitals and sanatoria for tubercular patients received particular attention, and the supplies of sugar, dried and condensed milk and butter were found of particular value, especially in the case of children.</P>
    <P>I shall not take up the time of the Dáil now by trying to give an account of the difficulties which the Joint Relief Commission had to surmount to arrange the transport and distribution of the supplies in these areas of war-torn Europe and of the effect of the arrival of these consignments of food on the local populations.  The reports I have <Col N="2120" /> received from the International Red Cross on these matters leave a deep and lasting impression on anyone who reads them, and I am considering whether the whole subject might not properly be made the subject of a White Paper.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity, however, of paying a tribute to the work which the Joint Relief Commission of the International Red Cross has done on our behalf.  When they accepted responsibility for the distribution of Irish relief supplies in the parts of Europe I have mentioned, the commission undertook a formidable task.  There was not only the problem of arranging transport from Switzerland to the areas concerned.  The relative needs of different areas had to be examined and assessed; the permission of local occupying authorities had to be obtained; schemes of distribution had to be worked out with the authorities of the countries concerned and measures for supervising the actual distribution arrangements had to be made.</P>
    <P>All this work the commission has performed with the greatest efficiency and despatch.  We ourselves could have done very little without their aid.  We are very much cut off from many of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and have no means of obtaining that accurate and up-to-date information regarding local needs, means of transport, local organisation, and so on, upon which any efficient scheme of relief work must be based.  The co-operation which the Joint Relief Commission extended to us in connection with the distribution of last year's supplies in Central and Eastern Europe will continue to be available in connection with any supplies we may have to send to those areas in the present year. As I shall explain in a moment, we hope to take extensive advantage of this co-operation in connection with this year's programme.</P>
    <P>The further sum of £3,000,000 which the Dáil is now being asked to provide is required to cover the cost of sending the following relief supplies to Europe-during the current financial year:&mdash; 20,000 cattle; 5,000 draught horses; 10,000 tons of sugar; 2,400 tons of <Col N="2121" /> bacon; 9,000,000 lb. of canned meat; 300 tons of dried and condensed milk; 250 tons of cheese; 25,000 lb. of wool; 185,000 blankets, as well as a large quantity of supplies made available by the Army&mdash;clothing textiles, bedding material and kitchenware to a total value of about £163,000.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the question of the allocation of these supplies, I might say something about the need for relief of this kind on the Continent at the present time.  There have been many reports in the Press in recent months about the threat of starvation in Europe.  From the information at my disposal, I am satisfied that these reports do not exaggerate the general picture.  Although things in Western Europe have greatly improved, there are still many people in those countries living below what is regarded as the necessary nutritional level.  But it is between the Rhine and the Russian frontier that the real problem exists. There, as Mr. Hoover put it in his speech at the recent Food Conference in London, &ldquo;hunger sits at the table thrice daily in millions of homes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible for us living in this country to realise the extent of the misery and suffering to which whole populations in that part of Europe are reduced.  Infantile mortality rates in many European cities have reached hitherto unheard of proportions.  The particulars given with regard to the prevalence of tuberculosis, rickets, anæmia and other deficiency diseases make a truly appalling picture&mdash;more appalling for its reminder that, in circumstances of this kind, it is the mothers and the young and growing children who are the worst and the earliest sufferers.  The extreme destitution in some areas reflects itself in acute shortages of clothing and the most ordinary necessaries of life.  I have had reliable reports stating that, in some rural areas, people are forced to work in the fields at night for lack of clothing to cover them during the day, and I recently received an appeal on behalf of over 3,000 school and university students in a famous capital city in Central Europe who are unable to attend their classes for lack of <Col N="2122" /> clothing.  Much of this is already a matter of common knowledge, so it is hardly necessary for me to go into further detail.  I will only say that, in Central and Eastern Europe particularly, there is a problem of human subsistence and of human suffering so vast that even the utmost which we, with our limited resources, can do, can be no more than a very small help towards its solution, but that, even so, every single article of food and clothing which we can send will be of real and immediate value in relieving suffering, if not indeed in saving human life itself.</P>
    <P>Coming, therefore, to the allocation of the supplies to be made available this year, it is proposed, as before, to proceed on the principle of greatest need, due account being taken of practical factors such as the availability of means of transport.  Leaving aside the live stock and the surplus Army clothing, bedding-material and household ware, which I will refer to in a moment, it is proposed to allocate 75 per cent. of the available supplies for distribution in Central and Eastern Europe through the intermediary of the Joint Relief Commission of the International Red Cross.  Of the remainder, it is proposed to allocate 15 per cent. to Italy and 10 per cent. to the Entr Aide Francaise, the French charitable organisation through which a considerable part of the supplies sent to France last year was distributed.  Bearing in mind the extreme destitution and the shortage of clothing in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, a thorough review has been made of existing Army and Post Office stocks, and, as a result, it has been found possible to get together a substantial quantity of surplus or obsolete stores of a kind likely to be found useful.  This includes some 30,000 greatcoats; 20,000 men's suits; some 60,000 yards of serge, shirting and other materials; 25,000 waterproof capes; 20,000 mattresses; 17,000 towels; over 100,000 other articles of wearing apparel, and a large collection of delph, cutlery and other household ware.  It is proposed to allocate these supplies to the Joint Relief Commission, who have already worked out a scheme of distribution for these supplies and the 75 per cent. share of the <Col N="2123" /> other supplies which is to be placed at their disposal.  Distribution will be effected, according to need, in Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Rumania and Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>As regards live stock, a somewhat different method must be followed because, as I said earlier, the International Red Cross are not in a position to handle the transport and distribution of cattle.  Still proceeding on the principle of greatest need and bearing in mind the deficiency of proteins and fats in the countries concerned, it is proposed to offer 2,000 head of cattle for slaughter as a gift to each of the countries, Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovakia and the British and American zones in Germany. Transport is apt to be a great difficulty in the case of some of these countries, but we can only make these offer and hope that means of overcoming the transport difficulties involved will be found.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, a serious threat to Europe's bread supplies has developed within recent months.  We must do our share in helping to avert that threat.  We were represented at the conference called to consider this matter in London early in April, and, since then, steps have been taken here to give effect to the conference recommendations. We took the initiative in raising our extraction rate to 90 per cent.  The war-time restriction on the serving of bread with restaurant meals has been reintroduced.  We agreed to carry on with the minimum of carryover stocks until the new harvest is available.  By virtue of these measures, we were able to agree to do without imports of foreign wheat until the end of July, provided we could be assured that the 30,000 tons required to carry us over into the new harvest would be made available in August.</P>
    <P>If our contribution in the present situation is to be the maximum of which we are capable&mdash;and I think we all feel it should be&mdash;the co-operation of every individual man, woman and child in the country is required.  In the first place, we must scrupulously avoid all waste of food, and try, if we can, <Col N="2124" /> to eat less bread.  It has been calculated that a reduction of 5,000 sacks of flour in our present weekly consumption of over 60,000 sacks would provide a bread ration for 325,000 people on the Continent.  I suppose at least one heel of a loaf is wasted in every household each day.  This means about 400,000 lb. of bread a week, enough to provide a bread ration for 70,000 people in Europe.  If each of us ate a slice of bread less each day, it would give us 1,700,000 lb. of bread a week, or a bread ration for 300,000 people in Europe. The immediate task is to bring the purpose and urgency of this appeal home to everyone in the country. Everyone can help in this work.  The appeal is being advertised in the Press and broadcast at frequent intervals from Radio Eireann.  Private organisations can help by enlisting the support of their members, and business concerns by publicising the appeal in their advertising space.  If everyone lends a hand in this way to help this anti-waste crusade, we can make a further and effective contribution to the relief provided for in this Vote.  I think I have given a fair picture of the situation and I hope to be able to answer any questions on which Deputies may require information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is reasonable to assume that every Deputy in this House cordially approves the most energetic measures of which our Government is capable in co-operation with the rest of the world, to relieve the distress of our fellow-men throughout the Continent of Europe, but I think the time has come to speak plainly on what those measures should be if they are to be the most effective that our country with its limited resources can employ.  As the Taoiseach has said, 12 months ago the situation in Europe was even worse than it is to-day.  It is a source, I have no doubt, of satisfaction and relief to everyone in this country to know that the people of Holland, the people of Belgium and the people of Denmark have made such splendid progress towards the restoration of some degree of modest efficiency for the nutrition of their own people.  In regard to some other parts of the Continent <Col N="2125" /> of Europe, I have heard from various sources disquieting reports that while there continues an acute food shortage in large municipal centres, there is comparative abundance in the rural areas and that, in fact, the situation is that the agricultural communities of certain countries in Europe have made up their minds that they are not going to feed their own cities at the fixed prices which the municipalities are prepared to pay for the produce which these agricultural communities have to dispose of.  I remember one friend of mine whom I recently met in London on return from his post in a rural area on the Continent telling me that while in the neighbouring city an acute shortage existed, a regular traffic obtained amongst racketeers who left that city every morning by bicycle, who purchased, in this particular case, chickens at approximately 10 times the price which the municipality had fixed for that variety of produce, who cycled back into the city, sold them on the black market at a profit and returned the following morning to the countryside to repeat the operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude generally in that rural area was: Why should farmers carry their produce to the city and sell it at inadequately controlled prices when, by sitting at home, they could get people to come out of their houses, and purchase it at ten times the price they would get if they conveyed it themselves?  If that picture is true I begin to wonder are we helping in the most effective way we can by sending food into these cities when people in the neighbourhood of these cities will not send in food?  I have heard from a friend who recently visited the Continent that in certain Continental cities they were able to eat in fashionable restaurants more luxuriously than, or, as luxuriously as, they were ever able to eat, if they were prepared to pay for it.  I recognise how great the problem may be to administer supplies in these countries.  I recognise that on occasions it may be extremely difficult to bring the black market under effective control, but I cannot see that our most effective method for helping hungry people is by sending such exiguous <Col N="2126" /> supplies as we can dispose of into the vortex of that black market, directly or indirectly to be sold at black market prices to wealthy tourists who can afford to pay for them.</P>
    <P>I recognise that what I am saying now is open to misconstruction in certain quarters.  Nevertheless, that type of information has reached me from so many people concerned, that we cannot but believe that where there is so much smoke there must be some fire. I, therefore, suggest to the Government that we are not adopting the most effective method of relieving the suffering people of Europe by the methods we are at present employing.  It may get us some nice publicity as being a very Christian people.  It may win us pious resolutions from certain Continental countries of gratitude for our magnificent gesture, but I take it we are not engaged in this business for gratitude.  I take it that in sending these supplies we are not looking for vacuous praise.</P>
    <P>We are trying on the very small scale of which we are capable, to help fellow-men as we would wish them to help us if we were in a similar case, and as we remember they did help us in the days of long ago.  With that then in view, I want to suggest to the Government that we should send no more stuff to Europe in the way of foodstuffs.  Let me emphasise again how small is the volume of stuff that we can send to Europe, as compared to the need that exists, particularly in that part of Europe referred to by the Taoiseach, from the Rhine to the Russian border, but that we should say to Europe that we would take their children, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or any other religion that they may be, and that we make no apology for naming their categories in terms of religion, because, being a Catholic nation, we take them in the full realisation that our duty to them will not end with feeding them, clothing them, but that we will take precautions, in so far as we can, to ensure that our Jewish fellow countrymen will look after the spiritual needs of such Jewish children, that our Protestant countrymen will concern themselves with the spiritual needs of Protestants and that our Catholic majority will look after the <Col N="2127" /> welfare of such Catholic children as are entrusted to our care.</P>
    <P>We spend £3,000,000 a year sending food and requisites to Europe.  I reckon that we could maintain a child in this country for £100 per annum, and I would like to think that we could find housing and shelter for that.  If that were so, £3,000,000 would provide for at least 20,000 children, and if we could take off the hands of those struggling with adversity at the present time, the piteous burden of undernourished children, and leave parents thus relieved free to struggle for the maintenance of their own existence, comforted by the knowledge that their children are, at least, safe, that, I think, would be a material contribution to the relief of suffering Europe.</P>
    <P>I detest these associations that have grown up in this country for the relief of German children, for the relief of French children, for the relief of Greek children, and for the relief of YugoSlav children.  I do not care whence they come, whether they be German, French, Polish, Russian, Greek or YugoSlav children.  If they are suffering and in need, I think our people would be ready to receive them, and to send them back when their parents are prepared to keep them, as well tended as lay within our power, and as closely analogous to the standard of their parents as possible.</P>
    <P>That would be a much more difficult contribution to the relief of Europe than we are at present making.  It would mean inconvenience, personal inconvenience for those who in this country undertook to share the burden. But I think an ounce of personal effort of that kind is of more value than all the money we could send.  Three million pounds may sound a lot of money, but when all is said and done, it does not cost us very much to send £10,000 to Europe.  It means that we have got to do with 1 oz, or 2 ozs. of tea in the week, but apart from that no citizen feels the pinch in any way. It would be a real effort if we had to take the children in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2128" /> I remember, in the days when the Nazi terror first started to oppress the Jewish people of Austria and Germany, I was vicariously interested in attending to certain refugees who managed to escape from that detestable tyranny. I do not want the house to imagine that I made any material contribution, for I did not, but others close to me did.  It meant effort; it meant work; it meant discouragement very often; but it was worth doing, and, because it was done on a voluntary scale, it had, of course, to be on a very small scale.  When that work was done, however, at least one had the feeling that every effort put into it had been well spent and that those for whom the work was done had derived, or could have derived, some benefit from it, if they chose to collaborate, as the vast majority did.  I feel that we could do a useful work if, at the end of our exertions, we returned 30,000, 20,000 or even 10,000 children to Europe who were not crippled in body or twisted in mind.</P>
    <P>I think we would have given a superb example to the world of what Catholic government means in religious tolerance by the reception into this country of Jewish children, Protestant children and Catholic children and of showing that we understood what religious toleration means, that is, that those in good faith confined to our care shall not have their untutored minds trespassed upon by Catholics who recognise the right of parents to answer to God not only for the material but for the spiritual welfare of the children entrusted by Him to their care.  There are other countries which would do as much but there are certain countries, and were such children entrusted to their care, they would leave that care vastly changed from the condition in which they were handed over by their parents for temporary custody.  We, I think, could honestly boast that those for whom we became responsible would go back as they came to us, untouched in anything but the restoration of their strength and vigour and health, safe and in the same condition as that in which they were entrusted to us by the parents who trusted us with the most precious thing they had.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2129" /> If that case be valid, I want to say something which Deputies are inclined to forget.  We talk a lot here in Ireland about starvation in Europe and the burden of trial and tribulation which Europe is carrying at present, but I have never heard anybody in this House yet talk of the hunger in England.  Our best customers for the last hundred years have been the British people.  I do not know how many Deputies have recently been in England&mdash;a good many of us have&mdash;but I think that calm observation of the situation in England must bring home to the mind of any unprejudiced observer the fact that, though the British may have a certain bulk of food, the quality which they have consented to put up with, in order that they may better contribute to the relief of those worse off on the Continent of Europe, is appalling, and while it is true to say that nobody in England appears to be hungry or emaciated, it is also true to say that the want of certain types of food has induced in the British people a degree of exhaustion and tiredness that must stir the sympathy of anybody who admires the efforts of a valiant people in face of great peril.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that they have borne the heat and the burden of the day for six long years, for a great part of it alone, they are our closest neighbours and have been our best customers. Is it not nearly time, when we are protesting our solicitude for the Yugo-Slavs, for the Hungarians, for the Austrians, for the Greeks, for the Germans and for the French, that we should make some gesture to indicate that we appreciate the measure of suffering with which the British people have had to contend and should give some indication of our readiness to exert ourselves for the relief of that suffering, in so far as within us lies?</P>
    <P>What the British lack at present, above everything else, are the protective foods which we are peculiarly qualified to produce.  They require eggs, and butter and milk products, and they require them urgently and acutely.  What we can do perhaps in the sphere of butter and milk products for the vast population of that island is too small to bother about, but it <Col N="2130" /> would be a worth-while gesture if we could make a real effort to send them eggs in greater quantity than we have done heretofore, if we could select some section of that people who most need it and offer to our ancient enemies a gift in the same spirit as that in which we offered it to the nations of Europe during the year which has passed by.  There may be those amongst us who think that what we have to offer would be so small as to excite ridicule.  I would prefer to remember the spirit of that immortal story <i>Les Jongleurs de Notre Dame</i> and rest content that, providing we were doing our best, he would be a poor recipient indeed who would despise it as inadequate.  In any case, so long as we were doing our best and giving of what we have to give, it would not matter what they thought, so long as we knew the reasons for which we offered it and so long as we knew that it was the best we had to offer.</P>
    <P>During my short sojourn in England recently, I could find no evidence of any large-scale disappearance of the restricted foods into the black market, and I was much struck one night, on being brought to dinner at one of the most fashionable restaurants in London by a wealthy friend&mdash;a restaurant to which I could not have afforded to go &mdash;by the fact that not a single item in that extremely expensive restaurant, where fantastic prices were charged, was a controlled item.  It did not seem that, whatever price you paid or bid, you could get in that restaurant a black-market product.  The luxury of its fare was built up on the provision of such things as fowl and game, which are fantastically expensive, but which, note well, are bought at great prices, but not stolen, from neighbours who are left short of what they ought to have when black-marketeers misappropriate rations and sell them at black-market prices.  There is that infinitely important distinction between the provision of luxury foodstuffs, which would not in any case become available to the markets of the people, on the one hand, and the diminution of the people's supply of such foodstuffs as butter and milk and so forth in order <Col N="2131" /> to divert it on to the tables of those who are rich enough to pay illegal and prohibitive prices for such comestibles.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters, which do not come strictly within the meaning of the class of relief which the Government has in mind, but which are worthy of consideration&mdash;one, from the point of view of helping people who are in distress, and the other from the point of view of economising in foodstuffs here at home.  I think it is common experience in this country at the present time that it is practically impossible to find girls who desire to enter domestic service.  That is no reflection on the girls.  If they do not want to enter domestic service that is their own business; they prefer other types of employment.  But I imagine that there are in Bavaria, in Austria, and in other parts of the Continent of Europe considerable numbers of young women who would very gladly avail of the opportunity of taking positions as domestic servants here&mdash;firstly, to secure a livelihood for themselves and, secondly, to earn the wherewithal to send help to those who depend upon them at home.  I should be interested to learn from the Minister for External Affairs whether he has considered the propriety and the desirability of examining with other Governments the question as to whether, if we were prepared to offer employment to a certain limited number of young women of that class, a scheme could be worked out which would be satisfactory to our Government and, at the same time, provide the Governments of these other countries with the assurances that they would naturally require to ensure that their nationals would be justly and equitably treated in the event of their seeking employment in our homes.</P>
    <P>The last detail to which I wish to refer and to which I recommend the very special attention of the Taoiseach, in order to press home the campaign to save wheat&mdash;and I speak now as a practical baker of 20 years' experience &mdash;is that the most effective way to save wheat and bread in this country at the present time would be to reduce the standard size of the 2 lb. loaf by one-sixth and its price by one penny.  At present every housewife goes into a <Col N="2132" /> baker's shop and she buys a 2 lb. loaf. If they bought a loaf which weighed in fact a pound and three-quarters the exterior difference would be very slight, but a family that ordinarily consumes two loaves of 2 lb. each and throws away the heel would find two loaves weighing 1¾ lb. each would not go round if they threw away the heel; and, according to how the family was run, in some instances the husband would have to eat the heel and in others the wife&mdash;but somebody would eat the heel.  As a baker of 20 years' experience, I can assure the Taoiseach &mdash;I do not know what his experience has been in the past with regard to the heel&mdash;that the heel is as nutritious and as excellent a part of the loaf as any other part.  In view of the circumstances that obtain throughout the Continent of Europe it would be a choosy citizen, indeed, who would go on hunger strike in Ireland rather than eat the heel.  It would be an utterly unreasonable citizen, I can assure you, who would go on hunger strike rather than eat the heel of the loaf that I bake.  As regards the loaf that other people bake, if their heels are not, satisfactory the remedy is to reform the baker rather than waste the bread. That is a practical contribution which, I think, would surprise those unfamiliar with the trade by the resultant measure of economy in the consumption of bread and wheat.  It is one of these simple expedients that &ldquo;larned&rdquo; men rarely think of because their minds turn rather to rationing and other measures like that.</P>
    <P>One final observation&mdash;I note that in some of our neighbouring countries rationing of bread is to be the order of the day.  I have not the slightest doubt that if an operation of the character I envisage were carried to sufficiently drastic lengths, where the necessity existed, the rationing of bread would become unnecessary. When I hear talk of the rationing of bread my mind goes back to the very trenchant observations of a gentleman called Braunstein, who died alias &ldquo;Trotsky&rdquo;, at the hands of his own comrade, who shall be nameless in view of the fact that Trotsky died from a wallop on the head with a hammer. But Braunstein, before he died, wrote <Col N="2133" /> this: &ldquo;Bread tickets are the natural order of dictatorship because, if you can once persuade a free people to accept the principle that only those who work will get bread it is a very short step to the acceptance of the doctrine that only those who obey will eat.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we can make a contribution to the wheat of the world by reducing our own consumption.  In our efforts to reduce it I ask the Deputies of this House never to suffer themselves to be reconciled to a proposal to ration bread, but rather to resort to the device which I adumbrate. It is a safe, a prudent, and an effective device to reduce the consumption of bread or wheat in any community.  The other may be a gateway to a detestable tyranny.  I would be happy to think that, as a result of this, instead of declaring tonnages and millions of money, it would be given to Ireland to issue an invitation to the depressed peoples of Europe: &ldquo;Send us your children and we will look after them as you would wish to have them cared for.&rdquo; It may not earn so many encomiums for us; but I think, when history came to tell the story, it would have it to tell that Ireland made the best contribution, and that most carefully designed to do what most urgently requires to be done in the circumstances of our day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say anything which would in any way appear to cast a reflection on the very commendable efforts which are being made by this small country to help the starving peoples of Europe.  Therefore I speak with some difficulty on a matter of this kind.  The observations <Col N="2134" /> that I make are designed, not to impede the Government in its efforts but to suggest that there is need for a certain awareness in this matter and that we ought to make sure that our contribution, small though it be in relation to the needs of Europe, is not utilised in a manner contrary to the intentions of the nation which is donating these supplies for the relief of stricken humanity in Europe.</P>
      <P>I have had an opportunity during the past 12 months of meeting many continental people.  I have taken particular interest in ascertaining from them the situation in their particular countries and in neighbouring countries with which they had personal contacts. In that way I have been able to secure a fairly reliable picture of the conditions because the accounts I got were given in the secrecy of a conference room, without any attempt to propagandise the position from any standpoint whatsoever.  The outstanding impression one gets about the food situation, generally, in these countries is that side by side with poverty there is a black market in which those who have the necessary money can get anything they want, that the supplies are available but that the difficulty experienced by the masses of the people in some of these countries is that they have not the financial coupons to purchase the commodities they require. It may be the case that even if all the available supplies were distributed on an equitable basis amongst the entire population, there would not be sufficient for all, but there is something radically wrong and inherently vicious in the situation that in countries to which this and other countries export food; a black market abounds on a scale that dwarfs anything of the kind that exists here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had occasion to meet people from countries in Europe, in particular from one neutral country which has made a magnificent contribution of foodstuffs and household requisites to the needy peoples of Europe.  This person, who had been closely identified with the problem for many years, who had made many visits to other countries, supervising the distribution of foodstuffs and other articles from his own country, told me that the necessity <Col N="2135" /> for care and caution in the distribution of these foodstuffs was such that his Government insisted on sending their representatives to prospect, to survey the requirements of the countries to which goods were being sent and to supervise their distribution.  That was carried to such an extent that this particular official of a European Government went with a convoy of hundreds of lorries into other countries for the purpose of supervising distribution. He said that his experience was that otherwise you could not be sure that what was being given for the relief of starvation would not find its way into a profitable black market.</P>
    <P>I have been told by people who have close contact with the situation that in some of the countries relief supplies have been used as currency and are being exchanged and traded for other commodities.  I think that allegation has been made by many people who have close experience of these countries and have been privileged to make visits to them recently.  Bearing in mind that our object is to make the maximum contribution possible within the limit of our resources, we should make sure that such supplies as we send will reach the homes of the neediest people and are not utilised for the purpose of facilitating the existence of black markets by providing the stock-in-trade for such black markets.</P>
    <P>I had occasion recently to visit a continental country to which we made a substantial contribution in goods last year.  I was perfectly amazed at the position which I found there. There was what might be described as a high-class black market, not just a rough-and-ready trading, but a well-recognised black market where you could get anything you wanted so long as you were able to pay for it.  You might go into a London restaurant to-morrow and order chicken and ham but it would be a long time before you would get it, but you can go into the capital of the country to which I refer and get all the chicken and ham you require provided you were able to pay for it.  You could walk from one end of London to the other and you would not see a chicken in a shop, while in <Col N="2136" /> the city to which I refer there are poultry shops stocked with chickens which you would not see in a shop in the City of Dublin.  We were giving food to that country.  You could go into a restaurant in that city and get more sugar in your tea than I have ever got in the restaurant of this House or any other restaurant in town.  If you wanted butter, there was not the slightest difficulty in getting it.  All you had to do was to pay, and once you pay everything is all right.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Taoiseach said to-day that we offered a certain quantity of goods to about five countries.  As a matter of fact, I made it my business to tell the Department about this when I came back.  I am not saying this in any critical way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the countries that got one-fifth of our stuff and one that, I understand, subsequently offered to purchase the commodities, but if we had them to spare I should prefer to see them allotted to Eastern Europe, where there is greater need, than that they should go to a country which, as far as I could see, ought to be able to give something to Eastern Europe.  I do not want to see a situation of that kind continued and I say to the Taoiseach that the mere fact that it exists is evidence of the need for care and caution.  With Deputy Dillon, I feel that the food position in Britain to-day is worse than it is in any country in Western Europe.  I have had experience of it on a number of occasions recently. While you have a very fair chance of getting meat in some Western European countries, anyone who has had experience of the microscopic portion of meat that is served at a lunch or dinner in Britain will realise that Britain is very much worse off from the point of view of supplies than <Col N="2137" /> any country in Western Europe to-day. We cannot relieve the problem there. We could make a contribution, perhaps, which would be no more than a gesture, but we could make a gesture to that fairly good customer as easily as we have made it to other countries where it seems to me the need is not so great.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach has intimated that this £3,000,000 worth of foodstuffs will be diverted to Eastern Europe.  There is a number of countries in Eastern Europe where apparently the position is very bad notwithstanding the fact that elaborate black markets exist in those countries.  That is my information on the matter and I think it is very reliable.  We know that, as a result of the devastation that has been wrought in these countries, there must be acute suffering.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach knows well the sphere of influence under which these countries come.  Many people with access to more information than we have, have said that there is an iron curtain in portions of Europe and whatever you send there you know little of its destination because it is extremely difficult to get information about what is happening east of a certain line in central Europe.  That makes the need for care and inquiry all the greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the goodwill of other countries, I suggest, some effort might be made by our people, either by means of a Parliamentary delegation or a delegation of officials from our Red Cross Organisation or from the Departments that are dealing with the situation, to ascertain the precise needs, as they will see them through a visit to some of these countries.  Then the foodstuffs and other commodities can be delivered wherever it appears the need is greatest.  I frequently think that when we hear things valued at a certain level in Europe we do not look on these things through the same eyes as the Europeans.  I do not think we are trained to realise the standards of value that Europeans have.  Certainly in the portion of Europe I visited recently I could not find any hungry Europeans.  Some people who saw <Col N="2138" /> continental teams in sports fields in this country recently said: &ldquo;If these are the products of starving Europe, then starving Europe cannot be such a bad place.&rdquo;  The visiting teams left our people standing, so to speak.</P>
    <P>In this matter there is need for caution and prudence.  At the same time, you cannot look at the matter in the microscopic way in which the Civil Service machinery is used to dealing with problems of this kind.  The British people have been sending delegations to every country in Europe. The British Government have been granting facilities, to members of Parliament to visit these countries. They have been granting facilities on a large scale to commercial people in Britain where there is any possibility of opening up business.  The fact that it can be done, apparently with ease, by the British Government might induce us to inquire into the possibility of some kind of delegation visiting the stricken countries so that we will get a first-hand picture of the situation and so that the report of a delegation, concerned only with safeguarding Irish supplies and ensuring the best utilisation of these supplies in the interests of stricken humanity, will be the guide on which to base the allocation of these foodstuffs. It ought to be possible to do it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make the slightest reflection on the commendable efforts already made but, like the fisherman, one can fish all night and catch nothing, and so also one can distribute a lot of food and yet not reach the kernel of the European problem.  One can see the best efforts thwarted by manipulators who have a special type of cunning for turning the intentions of well-meaning people to their own advantage.  I suggest some consideration might be given to the question of seeing whether the position in these countries to which we propose to send these goods could not be examined on the spot by a delegation from this country and reliable reports obtained as to the best means of distributing whatever relief we have to give to stricken Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House will be unanimous in supporting this grant <Col N="2139" /> of £3,000,000 for the relief of Europe. The speakers who have addressed the House have shown themselves to be well-informed in regard to matters on the European Continent.  I cannot claim to be well-informed on such matters.  I think the speeches to which we have listened should bring home to the Government the need for the utmost care in the distribution of food supplies and also the need for ensuring that whatever organisation undertakes to distribute those gifts, it will be efficient and effective.  I think there is a justification for our Government, in view of the fact that this is a national contribution, taking whatever steps as are necessary to follow those supplies right to the tables and, I might almost say, to the months of those who urgently need them.</P>
      <P>The only direct information which has come to me from the Continent has been sufficient to indicate that all the supplies which were sent to the Continent last year did not go astray.  I had a letter a few months ago from a member of a religious community who is in charge of an institution for the aged and infirm and she mentioned that an allocation of sugar from this country reached her institution, although it is located in one of the most remote villages in France.  The institution which derived that benefit is one which richly deserved it.  It is an institution which takes care of the aged poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be considered by some people that supplies of sugar sent to the Continent should go to children or young people, but I think the aged also are deserving of consideration. This lady informed me that no words could express the gratitude of those people to our country for that gift. Small though it was, they appreciated it.  There were many in that institution, she informed me, who were not aware of the existence of this country until they received this gift. I am not saying that to emphasise in any way that we should seek to make capital for our nation out of this Vote. That should not be the intention.  It should be our intention to see that the food and clothing which we provide go to those in extreme need.  For that <Col N="2140" /> reason we should make sure that there is an organisation behind the distribution of those supplies which will be effective in delivering the goods to those who require them.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on the suggestion which was made by Deputy Dillon, that instead of sending the food to Europe, we should bring European children here.</P>
    <P>I think there is a good deal to be said in support of the suggestion that, as far as possible, needy children should be brought to this country, but in this matter as in the distribution of food it is not always the most needy who benefit.  I am told that some of the European children who reached this country recently were not members of the poorest families in Europe.  It may be that some of them had suffered severely from actual contact with the military operations, but certainly they were not members of the poorest families.  I do not think that we should definitely confine ourselves to either one or other of the two courses suggested, that is sending food to Europe or, secondly, bringing European children here.  I think there is a good deal to be said in favour of adopting both courses as far as it is humanly possible.  It is desirable I think to send food to the Continent wherever we can ensure that it will reach the persons who need it.  It is equally desirable to bring to this country European children when we can be sure that these are children who are in real need and who cannot be provided for in their own homes. By adopting both courses as far as is open to us, I think we shall be doing the maximum that it is within our power to do.</P>
    <P>I should be glad also if the Taoiseach in replying would inform us as to the nature of the organisation which purchases those supplies for export.  I should like to know what particular procedure is adopted in regard to the purchase of those supplies.  As the Taoiseach did make a reference to the export of wool to the Continent, I should like to suggest to him that in purchasing wool from our producers here he will see that it will be purchased at a fair price.  It is a good thing to be generous to others, but we <Col N="2141" /> must remember that the people who rear sheep to produce wool in this country are mostly people living on the poorest land.  The price they are receiving for that product this year is a very inadequate one and in many cases will not be sufficient to enable them to purchase for themselves all the necessaries which they require for themselves and their families.  I should like, therefore, if the Taoiseach would tell us how prices are arranged and what are the organisations set up for the purchase of those supplies.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what has been said in regard to the urgent necessity for doing everything that is possible to increase supplies of protective foods exported to Great Britain.  I believe that in many of the homes of this country too much of these foods are consumed.  Certainly, I believe that in many of the well-to-do homes of this city, and perhaps throughout the country, far too many eggs are consumed, and it would be a great thing if something could be done to ensure that a large proportion of these valuable foodstuffs was made available for export to Great Britain. There is no doubt that that country has set a headline in regard to the distribution of food and the avoidance of black marketing.</P>
    <P>Another matter which bears very much on the distress in Europe is the necessity of ensuring that as far as possible, not only for the next few months but for the next 12 months at least, we shall cut down to the lowest minimum our consumption of flour, bread and other wheat products.  I feel that not enough is being done in this country to encourage the consumption of products other than bread.</P>
    <P>If it is undesirable and perhaps impossible to restrict the consumption further than has been done, there should be more propaganda on the matter and more publicity directed towards ensuring that the consumption of bread will be reduced and that alternative foodstuffs such as vegetables will be substituted.  If we are able to secure a reduction in our consumption of bread, I think we shall be making a very valuable contribution towards the relief of the food situation which exists on the Continent.  Everything <Col N="2142" /> that is possible should be done in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively to the Taoiseach's speech.  So far as I could gather, I think he told us some time ago that, broadly speaking, half of the food that was allocated in the last financial year could not be utilised because we had made it part of the bargain&mdash;and I think quite properly so&mdash;that transport would have to be provided.  Apparently, as transport was not available about half the quantity of food provided last year had to be carried forward to this year.  The Taoiseach did not specifically mention transport with regard to the provision for the next 12 months, but the difficulty seems now to be in regard to packages for the canned beef.  I am wondering how he is going to get over that difficulty this year and if he can give us in a very rough and ready way an idea of the amount that has been already supplied and whether he hopes to be able to deliver the total quantity during the present year.  The Government naturally are in possession of the greatest amount of information.  I take it, that, of course, they have made a calculation, first of all, as to what these people need and then what we can offer.  I think we have all read the very commendable advertisement at present appearing in the papers urging people not to waste food but it is wonderful how conservative people are.  I do not care how much you urge people through the medium of the newspapers, I am quite sure that waste is still proceeding to an extent that, if we could avoid it, would make a very considerable difference to our food supplies.</P>
      <P>I take it that side by side with the waste occasioned by throwing out food that could be eaten, there is waste going on when seasonal food is not preserved properly, is allowed to go bad, or is accumulated in one district while there is a shortage in another district. I do not suggest that the Government could do away with that situation by a wave of the hand, but I take it that by publicity they are trying to help in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an aspect of this relief question <Col N="2143" /> that I should like to bring to the Taoiseach's attention.  While I suppose that everything said about the black market in European countries is true, and that some people in them are well fed, there is dire want in practically all European countries, and in other places where, owing to distance, the Government considers they could not help.  In the mind of the ordinary citizens there is a desire to do something by making a personal sacrifice. If we sent a great deal more than this Vote represents, it would not satisfy the desire of some citizens to assist in a personal way.  I remember the scheme by which everybody who sowed potatoes was asked to sow an additional drill for a particular organisation. I think the difficulty of collecting the potatoes broke down that proposal.  I am quite sure that an effort along such lines would probably result in potatoes costing the Government far more than they could get them for in the markets.  I should like to suggest to the Taoiseach that if there is any way by which the ordinary citizen, who is desirous of making some sacrifice could assist, he should be able to do his bit in that way.  That would be apart from the Government's contribution towards the relief which this Vote covers.</P>
    <P>I noticed a proposal to save bread by reducing the size of the loaf.  In my opinion that is only cheating the devil in the dark.  I do not know if the Taoiseach would agree with that scheme.  Reducing the size of the loaf would not produce anything like the results expected, or be as useful as an arrangement by which people who wished to do so, could make some personal sacrifice.  When they have made up their minds in that direction they could be able to do so.</P>
    <P>It was said that if the size of the loaf was reduced no &ldquo;heels&rdquo; would be left.  Deputy Dillon was wondering what section of the family should be asked to consume the &ldquo;heels.&rdquo;  I do not know whether I could be termed a tyrant, but in my family it was decided that members who were left in possession of teeth provided by the celestial dentist were the people best suited to consume the &ldquo;heels.&rdquo;  I do <Col N="2144" /> not think the Taoiseach would agree with that conclusion.</P>

      <P>Those who had teeth provided by the celestial dentist were the people to get the &ldquo;heels.&rdquo; Dentists do good work, but they never provide anything equal to the natural teeth.  I approve of this Estimate.  I think everybody does.  Some people are only sorry that the amount is not more.  We want to see that we get the utmost value for the money that is being provided.  The desire on all sides of the House is that the money should be distributed with the least trouble to the community, and that as many as possible should share under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is to provide money to send a variety of commodities, including foodstuffs, abroad.  I imagine that every Deputy is satisfied that before the Government originally decided to embark on this scheme they satisfied themselves from information received from their officers abroad, as well as from institutions, that there was immediate need for relief of this kind.  Having satisfied themselves to that extent they examined the matter to see how best the relief that could be given out of the very limited resources available, would go furthest in this charitable act on behalf of the people of this country.  In the course of the discussion, instead of examining the situation as far as it has gone, and the idea behind its conception, we have been listening to suggestions as to how something better could have been done, and as to how other methods might have given greater results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to understand what the situation in the different countries of Europe is.  We had Deputy Dillon to-day saying that, in his view, we would do far more good if we brought to this country 20,000 assorted children and maintained them here for a period.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon <Col N="2145" /> knows what the picture of distress is. He coupled his remarks with references to black market activities and it is quite obvious that the greater the distress, the greater the black market activities.  The few who have resources will naturally utilise them to keep themselves from suffering the privation endured by those who have not the means to buy even rationed commodities.</P>
    <P>One has to approach this problem with knowledge and a certain amount of realism.  Some of us may not have certain facts.  I am in constant communication and constant touch, not only with people coming here from different European countries but with people who have been abroad and with organisations and societies abroad, and I shall read for the House now particulars in respect of one of the millions of cases which exist.  It is the case of a family consisting of a father, mother, three boys and a girl living in Rumania. The parents are highly respectable and hard-working.  The father was in a working camp for years and the mother worked extremely hard to keep her children, and she occasionally managed to send parcels and money to her husband in camp.  During her husband's absence, the mother lived through terribly difficult times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy refers to a &ldquo;working camp&rdquo;.  Was it a concentration camp?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  It was a camp and all kinds of people were put in camps.  Despite the hopeless situation, the mother brought up her children excellently and kept them admirably. This family has lost everything and are in dire need of help, in the shape of clothes, shoes, etc.  Is it suggested that we should take from these parents one or a number of their children and bring them over here for a short period, leaving the rest to remain as no concern of ours?  Surely it is far better to have the knowledge that, in the hands of the organisations such as the International Red Cross and the Church organisations of all denominations, whatever we send is going to families of that type who have nothing and who cannot buy even the rationed goods, not to speak of taking <Col N="2146" /> part in the racketeering which is going on in the big cities of Europe.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear also that nations as well as people have a certain amount of pride.  This has been exemplified for us by the fact that the two nations to whom we offered goods free are now prepared to take from us commodities of which they are short on a basis of paying for them.  Obviously other nations, if they had the means, would not permit the acceptance of charity of that kind.  It is due to absolute need and destitution, particularly in the areas which were overrun during the war.  It is also quite clear that a serious effort is being made by peoples on the Continent to rehabilitate themselves as happy beings and this has been proved by the rapid recovery in some of the countries in Europe&mdash;a recovery which is not altogether complete, but one which nevertheless is such that these people are now able to trade as nations without the necessity to get commodities free from us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon introduced into his references a lecture as to how we should behave ourselves here and how we should make savings.  I agree with Deputy Dockrell that it is all nonsense to suggest that, by cutting the 2 lb. loaf by a quarter pound, we will fool the people into believing that they have eaten a 2 lb. loaf.  Is it not obvious that it is not on the basis of what the eye sees on the scales that we satisfy our hunger but on the basis of what satisfies our stomachs?  I agree with Deputy Dockrell that if there are members of a family who have not got their original teeth to enable them to eat the &ldquo;heels&rdquo; of bread, there are other ways of consuming these &ldquo;heels.&rdquo;  In my household, the &ldquo;heels&rdquo; are used to make bread puddings, and it does not matter whether we have our original teeth or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have acted quickly in response to this call from Europe, and I believe from what I have heard that everything we have sent has gone to the people to whom it should have gone.  I do not believe that one single item from this country has found its way into wrong channels, because I am satisfied that the organisations such as the International Red Cross will make sure that the confidence placed in them <Col N="2147" /> will not be abused to the extent of allowing that to happen.</P>
    <P>I have a number of details similar to those which I have given to the House and they come not from any anonymous source or some person whom I happened to meet while travelling. The information I have, I have got from a lady of great repute who is well known in this country, Miss Dorothy Macardle, who is at present travelling Europe and sending reports on the situation there and on the work being done by the organisations which are disposing of the goods provided by the assistance given by this Government. This nation has gone far in relation to its resources and we ought to feel happy that we have been able to render some service.  Let us hope that the situation in Europe will continue to improve rapidly, so that it will not be necessary for us to consider the spending of money for this purpose.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Dillon's suggestion&mdash;a suggestion made lightly and without any consideration at all&mdash; that we should bring 20,000 children here, does anybody believe, apart from the consideration of the family circumstances which I have related, that we could accommodate such a number of children here?  Our situation with regard to housing accommodation for our own people is so horrible and so bad that we could not possibly consider accommodating such large numbers of people here.  I want to say that I have some knowledge not only of these organisations abroad but of charitable organisations at home, and one might as well say that we should be careful before we give charity through such a society as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, because that charity might find its way into the black market.  Is not that stupid and nonsensical?  Is it not obvious that every organisation which is attending to the distribution of this food is doing it from a humanitarian point of view?  It is up to us to lend our unanimous support to the continuance of this operation, so long as it is necessary, and not to find fault with it, or make suggestions which would imply that all is not well, or that there is something wrong with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2148" /> I welcome this Vote, as I welcomed it when it was first introduced in this House.  I hope that the time will come when it will no longer be necessary for us to send relief to Europe.  I would regret very much if anything which has been said in this House to-day would give the impression abroad that we were not quite satisfied&mdash;because we are&mdash;that every ounce of food we send and every commodity we send is finding its way to the most deserving of the destitute poor of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unnatural that Deputies, knowing that black markets exist, should be very anxious that the food which goes from this country and which is intended for the relief of those in desperate need, should not find its way into such a market.  Those dangers were clearly before the mind of the Government from the beginning and also before the mind of those who were entrusted by the Government with the details of this work.  The organisations through which this food is distributed are mainly Governments and the International Red Cross, with the exception of one or two others.  By giving it to the Government we got the only guarantee we could get that this food was going to be distributed in accordance with the needs of the people.  If the Government did not do it I do not see how anybody else could do it.  In regard to the International Red Cross, we have had reports which go to show the extreme care taken to see that the supplies which we send go to those places and those peoples to whom it has been arranged they should go.  We have got receipts from the actual people who received these goods. Everything that is humanly possible is being done to ensure that these food supplies go to those people for whom they are intended.  I think that we can be reasonably satisfied that the relief supplied is definitely used for the purpose for which it is intended.  You have, of course, black marketeers in these countries.  I was absent for a few minutes from the House while Deputy Briscoe was speaking.  I think the idea he had in mind when talking about these black markets was this&mdash; that they arise, of course, from the <Col N="2149" /> fact that the amount of purchasing power in the hands of the people is not uniform.  Some people have a good deal of money and they are prepared to be extravagant.</P>
      <P>Life is more precious than money to them and they therefore use their money for the purpose of purchasing the necessaries of life.  Where you have no Government to control, or where Governments are not in a position to control and see that the necessaries of life are equitably distributed, then, of course, a black market will operate; and those with money will be able to purchase food while those who have no money will have to go without.  There is no extensive black market in England, just as there is no extensive black market here.  But in those countries where governmental organisation has broken down or where you have only a makeshift governmental organisation, or control, then black markets are almost bound to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody has given any indication that the relief supplies which we are sending are finding their way into these markets.  It would be hardly fair, I think, to say that, because around some of the larger cities you have a rural population who have supplies of foodstuffs to sell, we should not send supplies into those cities or come to the aid of the people in those cities.  You may say to yourself: &ldquo;These people ought to look after themselves and they ought to have some governmental organisation in control.&rdquo;  I am sure that they are doing their utmost in this regard; I am sure they are fully alive to the needs of the situation and that they are trying to do their best to meet it. But conditions are altogether against them.  Around every large city you have a rural population; that rural population has certain foodstuffs to sell and some people make it their business to go out from the cities and buy up these supplies.  You cannot prevent that.  They go out and purchase the supplies. Sometimes organised transport is not available, and if these supplies were not purchased by these people they would never be made available to the people in the city. <Col N="2150" /> These people go out on bicycles and bring in chickens, and so on.  They sell them at high prices inside, but they are at any rate getting over, to a certain extent, the transport problem.  The fact that a black market exists ought not to prevent us from trying to come to the aid of those who are in dire need.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but we have had no indication of any kind that any of the supplies which we are sending out have not gone exactly where they were intended to go.  We have had the receipts of the International Red Cross, and so on, to prove that.  Many thousands of letters have been received.  As a matter of fact, I should say that hundreds of thousands of letters have been received; they are now so numerous that it is no longer possible to count them. We have had letters from individuals. I think Deputy Cogan stated that he had got letters from institutions.  I can give any Deputy who wants to see these letters every opportunity of doing so.  I have a few specimens here; I do not know whether the Deputies would be interested in my reading them now.</P>
      <P>As far as ordinary human care can go, every care has been exercised.  I think there is no substantial reason to doubt that the supplies that are being sent by us to the Continent are going exactly where it is intended that they shall go.  That is the value of the International Red Cross.  They asked us to send out people to investigate how these goods were being distributed. One lady reported back to me after visiting the Continent.  I do not know whether she belongs to a group or not. She told me exactly what the result of her experience was.  I think it is being arranged for a groups of two or three others to go to the Continent and see for themselves.</P>

The organisations which receive this food are most anxious that we should be satisfied under this head.  I cannot imagine anything more harmful to efforts at relief than a suggestion that the relief was not going exactly where it was intended to go.  It would be disastrous.</P>
      <P>I do not think that anybody here doubts that the need for relief is very great.  Last year, as I said, 75 per cent. went to Governments and 1/5th to the International Red Cross.  This time 75 per cent. is going to the International Red Cross.  Here, again, I am absolutely convinced that every possible step is taken to ensure that this food shall go where it is intended to go.  I think we can assure Deputies under this head that the efforts of our people will not be abused in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards better methods of doing this work in relation to the children, the Deputy who suggested those knows very well that sometimes the best is the enemy of the good; and that by attempting to get the best you very often achieve nothing.  I think the method we have adopted is as good a method as you will find.  I should say that we have tried to get very many more children than the Deputy suggested. We have been trying to get some hundreds and have failed.  Something has been done in regard to the French children, but so far we have not been able to do anything for the children in other parts of Europe.  We are trying to get 500 Polish children, but there are difficulties in the way. In answer to a question some days ago, I said that we were making arrangements to take a certain number of German children here.  If that can be extended so much the better.  There is a good deal to be said for it.  You have a direct contact and you can be satisfied that you are doing a very good work and doing it directly.  But there are other aspects of the problem. People do not like to part with their children if they can help it, and many other things intervene there, so that it is not so easy to get children as one might think at first sight.  I was asked, I think by Deputy Cogan, how <Col N="2152" /> the goods that are sent abroad are purchased here.  They are purchased in the open market in the ordinary way, at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>The position of England has been mentioned.  It is a matter which everybody must regard as wonderful the way in which the British are denying themselves so that more supplies will be available for Europe.  As far as we are concerned here we are very anxious to help in any way that we can, but no way appears to us.  There seems to be no way.  As everybody knows, the market is here and it is not a question of shortage of money or anything like that; it is a question of getting supplies.  Anything that was being sent out from here was rather by way of limitation of our own supplies than encroaching on anything that they were purchasing.  The market is open too, so that, as far as our supplies are concerned, they are available for Britain in the first instance and, as far as the supplies to the Continent are concerned, there is a certain amount of competition in the buying because we buy in the open market and they would be buying too.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to see what we can do in the way of helping.  We would be very glad to get any suggestions as to how it can be done.  I have not seen any so far.  But, we must remember that most of the British difficulties and the hardships they are enduring are deliberately endured in order to make available for the Continent more than would otherwise be possible.  They are doing that in the case of bread and, I am sure, in regard to other matters as well.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking to quite a number of people from Britain and I have heard the same sort of comment that has been made by the Deputy here about the position of the people in Britain as a result of the short rations, and so on.  There is no doubt about it that they are working the system well and there seems to be very little complaint about a black market or anything like that and there does not seem to be the situation that Deputy Norton spoke about as obtaining in other places where the well-to-do can go into hotels and get very well <Col N="2153" /> fed indeed while the poor people outside have to go on very short rations. I think it is equitably distributed.  It is difficult to see exactly how we can help other than that there is an open field for them here.  It is not a matter of money.  Therefore, once the market is open for them, I think we are doing everything that they would expect us to do.  If there is any particular way in which we could help, I would be only too glad to do it.</P>
    <P>The main question is to ensure that the supplies which we are sending will go exactly to the people that need them.  As far as we can help that, it is being done and every care is being exercised.  There has been no suggestion that we should not continue to make this effort.  I do not want to keep the House but I have here a list of some of the places that helped us 100 years ago as well as some letters which I have received.  It would probably only waste the time of the House if I were to read them.  Deputies know exactly the type of letter one gets&mdash;that children have seen butter for the first time, that they could hardly believe it when they saw butter on bread as in peace time; letters from people who had been short of food when they got bread and butter; a letter from another family telling you what it meant when they got some Irish bacon, and so on.  These are things that Deputies can easily understand from their own imagination without confirmation by my reading the actual letters.</P>
    <P>I know that this Vote will be passed. I am sure nobody wishes to oppose it or to detract from the amount.  I think it is as much as we can reasonably manage at the moment.  I was asked a question about this.  A Deputy asked me whether we would be able to get the tins.  Unfortunately, the position with regard to tins is almost as bad as it has been up to the present.  It is only a question of hope.  It is quite obvious that if we could get tins, tinned meat would be one of the most satisfactory ways in which we could make supplies ready for distribution and just in the form in which it could be easily handled.</P>

      <P>Yes, unless we are able to get the tins.  Last year we provided for 10,000,000 lb. and we were not able to send it.  So, it is a question of getting tins.  We cannot provide them ourselves but if we could it would be a way in which we would be able to make a very substantial contribution. Nobody wants to vote against this Vote.  Everybody wants to be assured, as Deputy Dillon and Deputy Norton want to be assured, that the supplies go to the people for whom they are intended and, in so far as it is humanly possible to give that assurance, I am giving it.  I have seen evidence of the care that has been exercised and I would only say that the existence of the black market should not be regarded by us as a reason for not doing what we are doing.  I think there is no evidence whatever that any of this is going on the black market.</P>
      <P>I do not know about Deputy Dillon's suggestion to make the loaf smaller. It seems it would only give us more &ldquo;heels&rdquo; to a unit of weight of bread but sometimes a device like that does succeed.  Nobody could tell in advance whether it would or would not.  I think you can only do that by experiment.</P>

      <P>My own suggestion about saving bread has always been this: in the country parts&mdash;and I <Col N="2155" /> know that they eat a good deal of bread&mdash;there are always available potatoes.  That is a very fine substitute. It can be done more in the country than in the cities, but if any of us wants personally to make a contribution in that way to diminishing the consumption of bread, we have only to eat less bread and turn on to more potatoes.  If that were done on a wide scale, there would be a very substantial contribution.  I was amazed when I got the figures that I read out about what could be done by the saving of a slice of bread, so much so that I urged them to make sure that the calculations were right, and I wanted to know what was the basis of the calculation.  I did not check them myself but I had them checked.  It is astonishing what, apparently, a small saving like a slice of bread will do over a considerable period of time when you have over 1,000,000 people involved.  It shows what can be done if we do try to restrict our own consumption of bread. I think in this country, where other types of food are available, we could reduce considerably the amount of bread we consume and so require less bread supplies, with the result that there would be more for those in greater need on the Continent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not forgotten that the Deputy mentioned that.  The Deputy knows what a very big question would be involved.  I would not like offhand to give any opinion on it. It would be a very serious matter and all sorts of considerations would have to be taken into account.  I would not like to say that I would favour that suggestion.  It is true there is a great shortage of domestic labour here. What would be the reactions of trying to meet that situation by getting a large number of people from the Continent is another matter.  I think that is what ultimately would be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to commit myself to any opinion upon the matter at the moment.  It would require much more consideration than I have been able to <Col N="2156" /> give it since the suggestion was made. I am assuming now that we have not had a war situation and that we had a different situation in which there was a need for workers.  There is always the question as to whether, if these people are needed, you should not get them from outside as well.  But you have to get the premises right, and that is, that you have work for which you have not workers.  At the moment I do not think we have reached that situation and I do not know whether it is likely to be reached at all under the conditions in which we are likely to live for a number of years to come.  I would not like to hazard any opinion on that matter at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What legations does the Deputy think of?  We have reports from the International Red Cross; I can get them for the House.  I shall look into this matter to see whether I could not get something from other Governments and other organisations which would convince Deputies with regard to the goods already distributed. The greater part of the supplies that are now going will be handled by the International Red Cross and I will be able to get from them an account of what will be done in such detail as it is reasonable to expect.  The International Red Cross will deal with the countries I spoke of, including Germany and Austria and other countries east of the Rhine.  We have no legations there at the moment.  We have a legation in Switzerland, but anything our representative in Switzerland can get can be got by ourselves.  He would have to rely very largely on the information given by the International Red Cross.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not so that there is very much less ground for anxiety about black market transactions in regard to our supplies, where they are being handled by the International Red Cross?  In fact, the International Red Cross has a very good and well tested organisation for passing supplies almost directly into the hands of the afflicted consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say so. That is the point I am making, that the supplies as a result of this Vote will be delivered by the organisation which dealt with our past supplies and I think we can be equally well satisfied as to deliveries.  I have received no complaint of any kind that would seem to suggest that the supplies we sent did, in fact, get into the black market. I know of the existence of the black market and I heard people from these countries complaining of its existence. Apparently, it is the recognised way of supplementing the ordinary rations everyone gets.  It is available for those with money.</P>
      <P>If one did not make due allowance for the conditions in these countries, and the fact that transport has broken down there, one would regard it as a very severe reflection on the Governments concerned.  I have no doubt they are as anxious in these matters as we would be.  They have practical difficulties to overcome.  It is not an easy thing to overcome anything like that when it grows up under these conditions.  The existence of the black market does not warrant the suggestion or the suspicion that the supplies we gave did not go to the people who really needed them.  I have seen no evidence that would suggest even a suspicion.  Although I was aware of it, and my Department was aware of it, I did not think the matter would be raised here at all, or that we should have to look out for it.  There was nothing to indicate that there was any immediate fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the spirit in which these remarks have been made here.  I do <Col N="2158" /> not think they should justify any people saying we should not send these goods&mdash;I do not think they would justify that.  I hope none of these remarks will have the effect of making our people less anxious to help the desperate situation which exists in Europe.  I can assure the people that every effort is being made to see that the goods they send go to meet a real need.  Our action is fully appreciated. It would certainly make our people feel that they have done good work if they could only see a section of the many thousands of letters which have come to our Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My only concern in raising this matter was to make sure that the goods we were sending reached the most needy people in the most needy countries.

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £74,960 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1947, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister <Col N="2159" /> for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
    <P>There are two Votes for this Estimate, a Supplementary Vote and the principal Vote.  I propose to take them together for the purpose of explanation. I shall deal with the Supplementary Vote first.  The Supplementary Estimate, amounting to £9,750, makes provision for three new developments in our representation abroad&mdash;the raising of our mission at the Holy See to the status of an Embassy, the sending of a representative to Australia and the sending of a representative to Sweden.  There is also an additional provision of £500 for official entertainment. The new Embassy at the Holy See is the first Irish Embassy ever to be established abroad.  It is a notable step in the development of our foreign representation and is, I am sure, welcomed by our people.</P>
    <P>It is a step which must have a deep significance for those of us who look back over the past and remember the tenacity with which, throughout so many centuries, our nation has preserved its attachment to the Holy See. It has particular significance in the circumstances of to-day.  It serves, moreover, to emphasise the places held by the people of this island and the people of our race on the continents of America and Australia in the Catholic Church throughout the world.  We had a striking illustration of how wide flung our race is during the year when we welcomed to our shores no less than seven Cardinals who were either born here or derived their descent from this country.  I should like to take this opportunity of repeating that their visits gave us the greatest pleasure and that we regretted very deeply the death during his visit of His Eminence, the late Cardinal Glennon, Archbishop of St. Louis.</P>
    <P>I have, as the Dáil knows, long looked forward to the time when it would be possible to arrange an exchange of representatives with Australia. Australia is a great country with a very bright future in store for it.  Its productive efforts during the war show what it is capable of.  There <Col N="2160" /> are many people of Irish birth and descent in Australia and, I think, we are all proud of the part they have played in the foundation and development of the Australian Commonwealth. Australia is, of course, one of the countries with which our association with the British Commonwealth brings us into special relationship.  We hope and believe that the exchange of representatives will serve to extend and strengthen that relationship in the commercial, economic and other fields. The Government in Canberra have nominated a very distinguished Australian to represent them here and we are looking forward to welcoming him in the near future.  Our representative will leave here for Australia in the next three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also provides for the establishment of a Legation at Stockholm.  The new Legation will be in charge of a representative of the rank of <i>chargé d'affaires.</i>  The Swedish Government have notified us of their intention to establish a diplomatic mission in Dublin with a representative of similar rank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why have you elected to send a <i>chargé d'affaires</i> instead of a Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the arrangement come to.  I suppose small countries are anxious to limit their expenditure if they can.  This is also a development which I am sure will be generally welcomed.  We have important trade and other relations with Sweden which we are anxious to foster.  Sweden is an important source of supply of various raw materials which we require, principally timber. Irish vessels are now trading to Swedish ports and following the air agreement which was signed recently in Dublin an air service between Dublin and Stockholm is expected to start operations within the next two months.  Apart from these practical considerations, we are particularly happy to have closer relations with Sweden because, in the international sphere, Sweden has always stood for just those things which are important to us as a small State.  Those of us <Col N="2161" /> who have been at Geneva will remember the work of successive Swedish delegations in upholding the ideal of international organisation founded on international law and justice.  I am as sure now as I was then that any international order must be, if it is to last and be successful, founded on those principles and I am convinced that countries like Sweden which have stood unselfishly for those principles in the past have an important role to play in the world of to-day and tomorrow. I expect that our representative in Stockholm will be able to take up duty there within the next fornight or so.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I propose to take the principal Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate together.  The necessity for introducing the Supplementary Vote at this time arises from the fact that the arrangements with other countries which were necessary were not completed when the Estimates were being sent to the printer.  As Deputies will see, in the principal Vote there is no substantial change now as compared with last year.  The increase of £3,317 is almost entirely accounted for by automatic, routine factors&mdash;normal increments of salary and bonus and an increased provision for travelling due to the deferment of home leave by officers who were unable to get home during the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need say much as regards the work of the Department itself now that things are gradually returning to normal.  Travel restrictions being relaxed and transport becoming easier, much of the special activities which grew up during the war are slowing down or disappearing.  Irish people who were stranded on the Continent or in the Far East are in most cases now able to return home, and repatriation and travel facilities have been arranged in a number of such cases during the year.  All matters of this kind present much less difficulty now than they did a year ago.  Where the lack of financial means constitutes a barrier, assistance may be afforded out of sub-head B (5) of the Vote, and perhaps I might mention here, because I answered a Parliamentary question on the subject within recent months, <Col N="2162" /> that, in view of representations I have received since my reply to that question was given, it has been decided to make provision under that sub-head to enable Mrs. William O'Brien, who had to leave her home in Northern France in 1940 and has been living since in the southern part of the country, to return to her former home in accordance with her own wishes and to reestablish herself there.</P>
    <P>While some of the special functions which the Department undertook during the war are gradually coming to an end, there has been a considerable revival, during the last 12 months, of a type of work which normally claimed a good deal of attention before the war, namely, preparing for and attending international conferences and discussions of various kinds.  There have been many international conferences and meetings during the year, covering a wide range of different problems, and, although many of them were of a technical character and, therefore, of primary interest to other Departments, for various reasons they all concern the Department of External Affairs in greater or less degree.</P>
    <P>We had a full delegation at the General Session of the International Labour Conference at Paris last October, and we have at present a delegation at the special conference on the working conditions of seamen now taking place at Seattle.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of international air development, there have been conferences at Paris, Montreal and elsewhere, and I think our delegations, consisting of officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce, were able to play an active and useful part at them. We had the pleasure of being hosts to the Transatlantic Route Service Conference here in Dublin some months ago, and Deputies will have seen that this country was recently elected, by a very flattering majority, to the vacant seat on the Council of P.I.C.A.O.</P>
    <P>As regards international food problems, we had a delegation, headed by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture, at the European Cereals Conference in London early in April.  We were represented by an observer at the Conference on Urgent Food Problems <Col N="2163" /> convened at Washington by the F.A.O. last month, and we recently accepted an invitation to become associated with the Food and Agriculture Sub-Committee of the Emergency Economic Council for Europe.  Still in the field of food and agriculture, we have arranged to be represented at the Review Conference of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux to be held at London in a week or two; we were represented at two sessions of the Permanent Committee of the International Institute of Agriculture at Rome last March, and we will be represented next month at the meeting of the General Assembly of this body which is expected to discuss the winding-up of the institute and the transfer of its functions to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The International Institute of Agriculture at Rome is not the only international body whose position is at present being reviewed in the light of the new circumstances created as a result of the war.  The future position of the International Committee on Refugees was discussed at a conference at Paris in November at which we were represented by our Minister to France.  An official of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs attended the conference held at Brussels in March to discuss the future of the International Broadcasting Union, and a delegation will leave in the course of the next few days to attend the meetings at Brussels and Geneva at which the proposals drawn up at the conference in March are to be considered.  Then, of course, there was the final meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva in April at which the scheme which had been worked out for winding-up the League and transferring its assets to the United Nations Organisation were approved.</P>
    <P>There are other conferences of a more or less technical character which might be mentioned&mdash;a Commonwealth Scientific Conference and a Commonwealth Conference on Standards which are now meeting in London and at both of which this country is represented. Moreover, we recently accepted an invitation to send an observer <Col N="2164" /> to the first meeting of the International Health Committee of the United Nations Organisation.</P>
    <P>In addition to multilateral conferences, there are, of course&mdash;as there must be in every Foreign Office&mdash; bilateral discussions of one kind or another continually taking place on all sorts of matters.  As Deputies know, we had a trade mission to Sweden in February.  There have been informal conversations on trade matters with other countries.  I might, perhaps, mention here that we expect to have negotiations with the British authorities very shortly on the subject of the unemployment insurance of Irish men and women who served in the British forces or worked in Britain during the war.</P>
    <P>A factor which is likely to have an influence on the future organisation of our diplomatic and consular representation abroad is the development of our mercantile marine and air services. Irish ships are now trading to a considerable number of ports on the European Continent as well as to ports in America and Africa.  As Deputies know, too, a number of air agreements with Continental countries have been signed during the year, and it is likely that direct air connections between Ireland and several places on the Continent will come into operation before very long.  The development of passenger traffic on these services must not be hampered by the lack of proper facilities for obtaining visas, or by difficulty in securing the other consular services which travellers normally require.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we must make proper provision for affording the normal consular services in the case of our ships.  In order to meet these needs as regards places in which we have at present no representatives of our own, I have at the moment under examination a scheme for the appointment of honorary consular representatives abroad, not only in the places on the Continent likely to be served by our shipping and air lines, but also at places on the North American and other Continents where the presence of a direct consular representative would be a convenience either to our <Col N="2165" /> own people resident there or to merchants, travellers and others interested in this country.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the matters that would arise normally from consideration of the figures of the Estimate, but if there are any other points which any Deputy wants to raise I hope I shall be able to deal with them when replying.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach considers that he has touched upon all the points.  I do not think anybody ever covered with so light a touch so many spots scattered in many different directions.  I do not know if I remember the opening lines of a poem which mentions dawn on the hills of Ireland.  The Taoiseach's introductory statement struck me as something like the dawn of something.  He told us that Australia is a country that our association with the British Commonwealth brings into special relationship with.</P>
      <P>What is the relationship, political, social, economic, or financial to the British Commonwealth in respect to Britain, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada?  I ask the question at this point so that the Taoiseach may be thinking it over.  Now that there is a dawn of some kind, let us begin to look into the dawn to see exactly what we would like to discover there. Therefore, I ask in the political, social, economic and financial sphere what are the special relationships we have with any of the countries of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the establishment of an Embassy in the Vatican as a step of deep significance.  There is no use in using words and pretending that they mean something.  Now that we have an Embassy at the Vatican, we ought to have it made a little <Col N="2166" /> clear as to what is the deep significance of that act of ours.  The Taoiseach mentioned how wide flung as a race we are.  There is no way in which we can see that so well as when we say that our people have built up the Church in nearly every country in the world.  But there is no place, particularly in some of the places mostly associated with English speaking countries. where our people have built up the Church where they have not brothers and sisters building up their administration, their industries or commerce.</P>
    <P>It is particularly in relation to the significance of the establishment of our relationship with the Vatican, and its reaction on our public work here, that I would like to ask for some explanation if not now, in the months immediately in front of us, because comparatively recently, at the beginning of this year, recent Vatican policy was commented on in the publication of the Royal Institute of International Affairs called <i>The World To-day.</i>  In a small paragraph, the writer says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The whole attitude&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, of what he describes as recent Vatican policy</P>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;may be summed up in words spoken on the Pope's Coronation Day: `More than ever must the Church assume a social character in proclaiming and realising the Gospel'; and the wide range of subjects and persons embraced in Papal speeches, from science to journalism, from mathematicians and doctors to congressmen, teachers and trade unionists, is proof enough that the Vatican is not content with a religion confined to a part of life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to ask whether in our conduct of public affairs and in our social organisation and the development of both social and political machinery, we are likely, as a result of the establishment of this new Embassy, to be more guided in our work than we seem to have been in recent years by the various suggestions, representations, teachings and warnings enshrined in so many of the Encyclicals.  Referring to Christmas Eve Allocution of the Pope, the article in this publication says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2167" />&ldquo;An important place in the second part&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, the second part of that Christmas Eve Allocution</P>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;was given to the problem of securing a properly informed public opinion&mdash;&lsquo;one fed on truth, not poisoned by propaganda&rsquo;.  Statesmen, therefore, have &lsquo;a democratic duty&rsquo;, as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of England, Wales and of Scotland said in the Pastoral broadcast by the Vatican a year ago, &lsquo;to educate and inform the people they serve&rsquo;.  The great majority of men, continued the Allocution, are peaceful if told the truth and not stirred up by lies....  From the question of an informed public opinion it is a small step to the question of civic responsibility.  The Pope's Message on Christmas Eve, 1944, with its distinction between the inert &lsquo;mass&rsquo; and the self-conscious &lsquo;people&rsquo; seems to mark an evolution from the earlier conception of the citizen as the innocent victim of his country's Government, to what might truly be called an Anglo-Saxon view of responsibility. Take, for example, what the Pope said in an audience he granted last year to British Ministry of Labour officials who had been lecturing to the troops in Italy: &lsquo;The people cannot shirk responsibility for the conditions under which they live, if they fail to exercise their right and duty to help to shape them&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we might even see in the statement that the Taoiseach has made to-day how little the Government here care for an informed public opinion and for giving the facts of the situation to our people, for feeding them on truth instead of propaganda which can be distorted in one way or another.</P>
    <P>It will come as a surprise to many people, and as a welcome surprise to a lot of people, to read the Taoiseach's remarks to-day about our association with the British Commonwealth, bringing us into special relationship with, at any rate, one of the members of the Commonwealth.  They will all be asking themselves what these relationships are and why we do not do anything about them.  The Taoiseach <Col N="2168" /> has indicated that, in a very short time, representatives of this country will sit down with representatives of the other members of the British Commonwealth to discuss various scientific problems, various questions of standards and, I think, questions related to food matters.  What kind of consultation has gone on between the Government and Irish scientists preliminary to these conferences which will enable the representatives of the Irish Government to speak the mind of our Irish scientists?</P>
    <P>In the same way, what consultation has there been with any of the trades or organisations in any way affected by the fixing of standards as a preliminary to Irish representatives sitting down with representatives of the other members of the Commonwealth to discuss standards?  What kind of preparation has been made for these conferences?  There has been no preparation at all&mdash;at least no preparation in public&mdash;and I do not think that the Irish mind can be expressed at any conference without public discussion from which both the public as a whole and the various organised bodies concerned can have an opportunity of knowing what are the subjects for discussion.  To say that the Taoiseach touched on these matters is almost to exaggerate what has happened. We have had no indication as to the scientific purposes for which these conferences have been called, what is on the agenda of any of these conferences, who are the people sent as the representatives of Ireland or what preparation has been made for them.</P>
    <P>Now that a move is being made to send Irish representatives to some Commonwealth conference, the question will vitally and very emphatically arise: why were we not at the conference held comparatively recently at which the Prime Ministers of all the Commonwealth countries sat down in serious consultation to decide the commercial and financial principles upon which they were going to try to base their discussions with other countries in the world, with a view to establishing, as it seemed to them, the best possible system and the best possible principles of international trading, so <Col N="2169" /> that, by mutual co-operation in world trading, every country might have an opportunity of increasing employment and raising its standard of living to the highest possible level?  Why were we not at that conference and what information have we got as to the principles of commercial and financial procedure decided on by these countries? Because we are vitally interested in the decisions taken there; and we are vitally interested in the outcome of the various conferences that will be held in the future, and for which that conference was merely a preparation.  I have already asked the Taoiseach on a prior occasion for some information as to whether we were invited, or represented, at that conference, or notified as to what was discussed there.  He had no information to give.  He has not given us any information now.  He has told us that any necessary consultations would take place in good time. What is involved?  The United States Government invited a world-wide conference to be held next year to deal with trade and employment.  As a preliminary to that, the President of the United States invited a certain number of countries to a preliminary conference&mdash;that is, the United States Government invited the Governments of the United Kingdom, of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Belgium, Luxembourg, Brazil, China, Czecho-Slovakia, France, the Netherlands and the Soviet Union, to a preliminary conference this year.</P>
    <P>As a preliminary to that, there was a conference held representing the members of the British Commonwealth and Empire.  In relation to that conference, the Lord President of the Council, Mr. Morrison, explained that it was vital for the success of the negotiations in which the United Kingdom delegation would be engaged, that it should enter any such negotiations with a full understanding of the considered views of trade, of industry, and of labour.  Not content with calling a Commonwealth preliminary conference to the preliminary conference called by the United States, they exhaustively canvassed the trade unions and the industrial and commercial interests in Great Britain with a view to seeing what matters of importance were then <Col N="2170" /> under consideration by any branch or section in Great Britain of which note should be taken when the representatives of the United Kingdom sat down in conference with the other Dominion Premiers, or with the preliminary group of countries, or in the subsequent international conference later on.</P>
    <P>To some extent we are more vitally interested in the outcome of these conferences than other countries, because we are dependent to an enormous extent for our export trade, and particularly for our export trade in agriculture, on Great Britain.  For what are we keeping representatives in London and in the United States of America, and elsewhere, if we are not keeping them there in order to increase our markets at home, and thereby increase our employment at home and raise the standard of living in the country.  In what other way can we achieve that except by co-operation with other countries?  The Estimate shows that in personnel we are going to spend £15,813 in London, and we are going to spend £24,395 in the United States. There is, perhaps, a certain want of proportion in the amounts of money shown there, but I do not want to go into that now.  It may be important. What I particularly want to concentrate upon is what is going to be done by mutual conferences and mutual discussions to see whether we cannot get something out of our relations with Great Britain, which will react favourably on the employment, and wealth, and the prosperity of this country.</P>
    <P>In the year 1929 Great Britain was taking £45,000,000 of our domestic produce&mdash;agricultural and industrial. In 1930 she was taking £43,000,000.  In the heights of the economic depression Great Britain was taking £37,000,000 of our national produce.  Our market with Great Britain was bringing into this country more than one-quarter of our total national income.  By 1938 Great Britain was only taking from us £20,000,000 worth of our domestic produce. We had reduced ourselves to a position where only one-eight of our national income was coming from the sales of our production to Great Britain.  I mention that in order to demonstrate to the House what sound relations and the proper handling of <Col N="2171" /> our affairs between ourselves and Great Britain could mean to this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach whether he has got from those countries where we have representatives &mdash; such as Canada and Australia&mdash;any information as to how these various countries are pursuing their international relations in trade and commerce and how they are trying to bring about a position of full employment and a higher standard of living in their countries as a result of that.  I refer particularly to Canada. Anybody who has any knowledge of world affairs to-day and anybody who is interested in the work and struggle that is going on in these various countries to build up industry and provide employment, must have their eyes on Canada.  They must have seen that, not content with the enormous developments that are taking place there both in agriculture and in industry, Canada is making tremendous efforts through her representatives, particularly in Great Britain, to build up and develop markets for her goods, and thereby provide employment for her people and a better standard of living because of the vigorous development of international trade.</P>
    <P>In the beginning of this year the Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce visited London.  Speaking in London of the activities of the Canadian Government in her search for full employment and a rising standard of living through trade with Great Britain, he said that the Government of Canada had fixed, as the target for post-war exports, the figure of 1,750,000,000 dollars&mdash;this was an increase of about 50 per cent. above the pre-war level in dollar value, but was only about 15 per cent. higher in the amount of goods exported.  That is, they were fixing that as the target for that part of the national income which they intended to achieve through their export trade.  He went on to say: &ldquo;Some people had suggested that this transformation in Canadian economy meant that Canada would be able to practise a greater degree of <Col N="2172" /> self-sufficiency in the future than had been possible in the past, that they would be less dependent on world markets for the sale of their surplus goods and that their imports could contract in volume.&rdquo;  He wanted to repudiate that suggestion as emphatically as he could.  For years to come it would be impossible for Canada to get a high level of employment and national income unless they continued to be a very extensive export nation.  About one-third of their total national income normally came from export trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no ray of suggestion given on the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we were going to take our place as a normal member of the British Commonwealth of Nations in sitting down to discuss in international conference with representatives of the other members any aspect of our economy or trade.  The Taoiseach has lifted the veil this evening. We are going to sit down and we are going to discuss scientific matters and the deciding of standards and we have a general idea&mdash;at least I think we have a general idea&mdash;of what that may mean, but we have not been told that we are going to sit down and discuss in international conference what we are going to do for our trade.  We have been told by the Taoiseach, in relation to Australia, that our association with the British Commonwealth brings us into very special relationship with Australia.  I have asked the Taoiseach if he will tell us what relationship, <Col N="2173" /> social, economical or financial, or in a trading way we have with Australia, because I feel that it would shed light on the relationship that he has in mind between ourselves and the other members of the Commonwealth. I consider that our trading relationship with Great Britain is the real, vital thing both in our economy here and in our foreign relations.  I think that we could for a time scrap all our foreign relations abroad if by doing so and by concentrating on our foreign relations with Great Britain, particularly the trading side of it, we could get the benefits out of that relationship that I believe we could, because we have no standing, no prestige, no strength any place in the world unless we have sound economic strength, unless we have greater employment at home and a higher standard of living.  We have no strength either for defence or any other thing that people want to have in the world.  So that, apart altogether from the particular note that the Taoiseach struck in his opening statement, there is no aspect of external affairs at the present day worth discussing commensurate with the trading aspect of it.  What I am seeking to find out is, when are we going to sit down with the members of the British Commonwealth to discuss our general trading relations with them as freely, at any rate, as we seem to be going to sit down and discuss scientific matters and standards and such other things as the Taoiseach mentioned when he touched so lightly upon such a number of matters that it was not easy to take such a note as would help us to discuss them here.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I submit to you, Sir, that when I ask the Taoiseach to bear in mind what we are keeping this £15,000 staff in London for, and when I emphasise that we have no business at all in keeping them there if they are not attending in the most effective way possible to our commercial and trading interests, that I am entirely in order.  I do not think anything else would be worth discussing on the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that any international discussions of any kind come under External Affairs and it seems to me that the staff in London are being used in a general kind of way to carry <Col N="2174" /> on discussions, almost back-room discussions, that should be carried on more openly by more qualified and more equipped persons.  That does not reflect in any way on the capacity, particularly of the High Commissioner in London, who I am sure has had an extraordinary job, particularly over the last six or seven years, but I conpletely repudiate that he is in any way adequate to deal with the matters that require to be discussed and that should be not only discussed but actively worked at if we are to take advantage of the new dawn in the world and, maybe, the new dawn in the political outlook of the Government suggested by the Taoiseach to-day.</P>
    <P>The Report on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy laid special emphasis, in paragraph 94, on the urgency of certain things.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are also convinced that, if we make no particular effort to develop export capacity now, the United Kingdom market will become adjusted to doing without our contribution, and we shall find it more difficult to open export outlets for our produce at a later date when the more acute post-war scarcities have come to an end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You might say that that was the most urgent keynote of the whole of that report because it pointed out how important agriculture was to the country, including the industries of the country, and how important the export trade was to agriculture, and that the only export trade was the export trade that we knew by experience that we had.  I have shown that before the economic war hit the country, the British market provided us with more than a quarter of our production, that we got by sales in the British market of our agricultural and industrial production more national income than in the total production of our agricultural industry at that time.  So that, that is the importance of it and, as far as we can know, we have had no consultation of any kind through our Government or through our representatives in London or a systematic way of dealing with our trade with Great Britain. On the other hand, we see that even <Col N="2175" /> the greatest countries in the world are leaving nothing undone to secure that they shall have, in the most effective way, contacts with any country in the world that can be of any use to them. We have seen in various ways that long-term contracts have already been negotiated with Great Britain for their produce in Sweden, Denmark, Australia and New Zealand.  On the other hand, we are in the position that we do not know in what way the Government has done or will do anything to open up markets for our manufacturers and particularly for our agriculturists.</P>
    <P>I again want to emphasise that unless the Government take vigorous action and are prepared to step as willingly into the discussion on trade matters as they appear to be to step into discussions on aviation and scientific matters, we will be left an impoverished country.  In the problems distracting the world, various countries have little thought for people who remain in the background and when we realise how much our agricultural industry depends on the British market and how much our general economy depends on that market, there is no excuse for leaving our Parliament and our farmers in the obscure position in which they are.  The dairying and bacon industries of Denmark were built up entirely on the requirements of the British market.  They are being re-established to-day on the requirements of the British market.  We have no bacon or butter to send there, and very few eggs.  Will we get back into the production of these things and secure that, by building up these industries again on the requirements of the British market, we will be able to have eggs, butter and bacon for our own people?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement to-day gives us hope that he has some answers to give us on some of these points before the debate concludes.  I urge him to go back to the text that he presented me with when he said that in our membership of the British Commonwealth we have special relations with Australia.  Will he discuss these special relations and apply what he thinks our special relations with Australia <Col N="2176" /> are, to Great Britain?  Will be tell us if he has taken new steps in relation to Australia and will he tell us what new and active steps he has taken with Great Britain, so that we may see some chance of getting back the increase in national income that we would get back if we secured our old place in the British market?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two minor matters connected with this Vote with which I would like to deal before discussing the broader questions that were raised by the Minister for External Affairs.  One is the item for official entertainment.  I am in a position to speak freely about this because I have no official position whatever and, on official occasions, I am entitled to no preferment or no recognised place in the protocol.  I should like to direct the Minister's attention to this fact, that going to public functions is becoming an intolerable embarrassment because there is a growing tendency to turn every public occasion, which ought to be a joint participation amongst us all as representing the State and every section in it, into a kind of de Valera rally.  That is most unbecoming.</P>
      <P>The President has his position defined in the Constitution and everybody recognises that if he attends an official function of any kind he should have a place of unique preferment as the representative of all Parties.  But in my submission, if the Taoiseach attends a public function at which the President is the principal guest, the position in the protocol of the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition should be identical because their positions in Parliament are complementary. They are both recognised as having an unique position in Parliament; one is the Leader of the Government, the other is the Leader of the alternative to the Government, and that is recognised in statutes and in a variety of matters.  Therefore, it creates no new precedent by giving it official recognition on State occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for External Affairs is the host at a dinner given to a distinguished foreigner, I suggest it is his duty to lean backwards in extending <Col N="2177" /> special consideration and courtesy and preferment to the Leader of the Opposition.  I have given up going to official entertainments for the simple reason that I will not partake in functions as a representative of this House when I feel that the Leader of the Opposition and those who are entitled to full recognition of their position, not as individual men but as respected members of this House, are deliberately slighted and put upon.  I have no intention of going to any more public functions to participate in such gross improprieties as I have been witness of.</P>
    <P>I think this business of giving banquets in Dublin Castle at which Ministers and their ladies are present and there is no representative of any other section of this House, is grossly unbecoming.  I think if the Minister for External Affairs gives a State banquet he ought to invite to that banquet representatives of all sides of the House &mdash;of all Parties in the House.  Nobody pretends that these State banquets are a barrel of fun, because they are not; they are rather stiff, awkward ceremonies in Dublin, London, Paris, New York, Washington or wherever you have to attend them.  It is not right, if we are entertaining State guests, that the guest himself should feel, by sitting down at the State banquet, he is, by implication, expressing a preference for one side or the other in the internal politics of the country.  It would be more desirable if, for the occasion of his visit, all sides assembled around the festive board to do him honour and to demonstrate that whatever our views on internal politics may be, we are glad to collaborate for his entertainment and to do him honour.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Taoiseach has on occasions felt that the presence of persons with whom he might not be on quite familiar ground has made the occasion rather more stiff and awkward than it otherwise would be.  He ought to know that these occasions are never very joyful.  I have been at them in many countries, as has the Taoiseach, and they are mostly a bit of a bore.  If you are to conduct them at all, things ought to be done decently and with due propriety and recognition <Col N="2178" /> of the fact that they are State banquets and not banquets given for the edification of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>If there are banquets to be given by the Government, I suggest they should be carried out on a decent scale.  I shall never forget the day we served canned asparagus to the American Ambassador.  I was ashamed of myself. What was worse, we made a separate course of it.  I do not blame the Taoiseach for that.  He has more to do than checking over the menu of a State banquet.</P>
    <P>What you have to do is to make clear to the officers responsible for the organisation of a <i>fiesta</i> of that kind that no considerations as to allegations of extravagance should be permitted to minimise the tribute to the guest whom we are entertaining.  When we serve quails in aspic at such a function it may be true to say, of most of us sitting round the table, that far from it we were born&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but that is a matter about which we need not trouble, as whatever luxuries we permit ourselves are provided merely in honour of the guest whom we are entertaining.</P>
      <P>Lastly, in official entertainment, I think the time has come when there should be established in the Department of External Affairs or some other Department an officer of protocol. Most people are ashamed to admit that they do not know what to do at these official functions.  I do not know whether I am expected to go in a silk hat or a tail coat, and the ridiculous part of it is that most people in this country seem to think that that is something to be ashamed of.  It is a problem with which every man finds himself confronted, and if he could ring up the officer of protocol and ask what he was supposed to do, he would be told that straightway and he could go home and rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another detail to which I wish to refer is that a great many of our people in poorer circumstances are required under existing conditions to get visas at the United Kingdom offices.  If the British had an edge on <Col N="2179" /> us, I would not blame them, but I find it hard to believe that the British Government desires to work off their grudge against us on poor people who have to go and get visas.  When I compare the atmosphere that obtains in the United Kingdom Visa Office with the atmosphere that obtains in the United Kingdom Liaison Office, it is a standing source of astonishment to me, because in the one you receive courtesy and consideration, whilst in the other the contrary is the experience.  When you ring up the United Kingdom Liaison Office, if the officer cannot do all you want, he will go to the ends of the earth to explain the reason, but if you ring up the United Kingdom Visa Office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He has the responsibility to make any representations he may think fit to the British Government that if the British Government have any grudge against this country, they ought to vent it on him and not on the unfortunate labourers seeking visas.  If the Minister will direct the attention of the responsible authority in Great Britain to this matter, something might be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of people find a certain difficulty in following the devious course of our Minister for External Affairs in foreign politics and in everything else.  That is largely due to the fact that they do not keep in mind that the Minister for External Affairs is one of the most brilliant and conscientious exponents of the Machiavellian method of politics at present living.  If you want to understand or to anticipate what our Minister for External Affairs is going to do in any given set of circumstances, the first thing you have got to do is to turn to page 142 of Nicolo Machiavelli's <i>The Prince.</i>  It is an essential prerequisite to know this paragraph before you can intelligently discuss the activities of the Minister for External Affairs.  &ldquo;A Taoiseach or a Prime Minister,&rdquo; says Machiavelli, &ldquo;therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to <Col N="2180" /> choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves.  Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about. Therefore a wise Taoiseach cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer.  If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them.  Nor will there ever be wanting to a Prime Minister legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance.  Of this, endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of prime ministers; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I shall come to it.  The Minister for External Affairs led off to-day with the statement that our special Commonwealth position established a peculiar relationship between ourselves and Australia.  President O'Kelly recently announced, on the occasion of his receiving the freedom of Wexford, that he accepted it, not as Seán T. O'Kelly but as President of the Irish Republic.  Captain Macheath in the <i>Beggar's Opera</i> used to boast &ldquo;how happy he could be with either, were t'other dear charmer away&rdquo;, but our Minister for External Affairs can dance as merrily with the Republic on one arm and the Commonwealth on the other as if he were a dancing Apache. Let me read for the edification of the House the letters of credence supplied by our Minister for External Affairs to the foreign representatives of the Irish Republic over which President O'Kelly presides when they are going to represent us in Belgium or Sweden.  This is addressed to the King of Sweden:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My Brother,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of Ireland being desirous of maintaining the relations of friendship which exist between Ireland and Sweden, have advised me that they have judged it expedient that XY be accredited to Your <Col N="2182" /> Majesty in the character of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark the words, &ldquo;have advised me.&rdquo; Who is &ldquo;me&rdquo;?  While I am finishing this there are seven Fianna Fáil Deputies here who might start writing on a piece of paper their forecast of who is &ldquo;me&rdquo;.  It proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Government feel assured that the choice of XY would be perfectly agreeable to Your Majesty and that he will prove himself worthy of this mark of confidence.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, request on behalf of the Government of Ireland that Your Majesty will give entire credence to all that ... shall communicate to Your Majesty in their name, and I take this opportunity of renewing to Your Majesty the assurance of my sincere friendship, and of the unfeigned respect and esteem which I entertain for Your Majesty's person and character.</P>
    <P>Given at my Court at Buckingham Palace, 20th day of June, 1946.</P>

    <P>There is not a whisper of suspicion about poor President O Ceallaigh who got the freedom of Wexford because he is President of the Irish Republic. Is it irrelevant to say to the head of a Government, who had a republic in Wexford, who had those letters of credence in Buckingham Palace, and was suspended, like Mohammed's coffin, between two positions in the Dáil that he is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive, will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>For the rest, I refer Deputies to <i>The Prince</i>, in which they will discover the greatest character sketch of the Taoiseach, and I hope they will read it.  Has the time not come when we ought to make up our minds whether this country is going to be in the commonwealth or a republic? I want to ask the House if it does not agree that this is a disgusting, fraudulent, dishonest attempt to blind our people as to what is the true status of this country, and corrupting our whole national character.  Is there not something contemptible and rotten about pretending to be one thing when we are, in fact, something else?  Is there not something horrible in bawling about a republic down the country and flirting with the Commonwealth from the Front Benches of Dáil Éireann? Does nobody feel humiliated that the President should be declaring in Wexford that he got them freedom there because he is President of the Irish Republic, at the very moment that the High Commissioner for Ireland is proceeding to Buckingham Palace in a silk hat and frock coat to get that document I read out signed by the King of England, in order to persuade the country to which we were sending an envoy extraordinary to accept him as the representative of this country? Have we reached such a stage of mental dishonesty that that does not sound obnoxious to the simplest Deputy?  Why should we go on degrading ourselves by that ambiguous rôle?  There is nothing to fear.  If it is the right thing to do to declare a republic why not declare it?  If Fianna Fáil believes that an Irish Republic is the desire what is to stop them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no suggestion that Great Britain is going to invade us or to attack us.  In India we have seen <Col N="2184" /> Great Britain telling the Indian people that if they want to come into the Commonwealth they will be welcome, but if they want to go outside it they will extend the hand of friendship to them.  Such words were uttered by the Prime Minister of Great Britain a few days ago.  So far as Egypt is concerned the moment the Egyptian Government expressed a desire that British troops should leave the country the British said: &ldquo;Very well, we will go.&rdquo;  They entered into negotiations at once to arrange the matter.  There is no question of anybody invoking any sanctions if we want to declare a republic.  Why do we choose to masquerade before our own people as a republic, but to move about the world by virtue of the document I have read, signed at Buckingham Palace by the King of England for the time being?</P>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy sitting on those benches will find any difficulty about the answer in <i>The Prince</i> by Machiavelli.  They will find there &ldquo;that it has come to very few people to know what they truly are, but to all to know what they appear to be.&rdquo; Therefore, what is important is that to those who desire to mislead and deceive to maintain appearances, it does not matter what you do.  History is true; Machiavellianism, through it succeeds for a time corrupts men who use it and corrupts people who submit to it.  If we cannot be true to ourselves then we can be true to nobody.  There is no Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches at the moment who is not prepared to go down the country and defraud his own supporters into the belief that he is a republican while, at the same time, he applauds the devious, dishonest and tricky expedients of these letters of credence, wherewith to introduce our diplomatic representatives to the foreign courts where we desire to be represented.  It is that kind of dirty, fraudulent dishonesty which is distintegrating the public life of this country.  It is that kind of horrible, amorphous, intangible fraud which makes it impossible to maintain normal political relations in this country.</P>
    <P>I can understand a man who is a republican and who wants to establish a republic cut off from Great Britain, <Col N="2185" /> and take the consequences.  I differ profoundly from him, but at least I know what he is talking about.  I can combat his arguments and understand his position, but is there any living creature who could decipher what Deputy Allen believes this country to be?  The only answer he could make would be &ldquo;If you want to know the answer to that question, you had better ask the Chief.&rdquo;  The distressing thing is that, at one time, Deputy Allen would have been ashamed to make that answer, but to-day he thinks it is clever.  He thinks he is as cute as the bees.  Does Deputy Allen ever look back on his own record, to the time when he knew he wanted a republic, when he knew he wanted this country to sever the last connection with England, when there were no qualifications or reservations in his own mind?</P>

      <P>The only blessing is that he just does not think about it, or he would meet the same fate as the man who was asked whether he wore his beard inside the blanket or outside it when asleep and who died of insomnia trying to find out the answer.  What I hate about this is its fraud, the corrupting, rotten dishonesty which enshrouds it and the triumphant satisfaction of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party that they have at last worked out a position on which they can stand, a position of so ambiguous a character that no one can successfully challenge it and which the people can be corrupted into accepting as something worthy of this country.  But they had to be corrupted to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time when our fathers would have scorned, would have despised anybody who spun that yarn <Col N="2186" /> in answer to the question: how does Ireland stand?  But the queer thing is that, in our country now, dishonesty and prevarication are being elevated into virtues cognate with fortitude and counsel.  It is no longer noble in this country to be wise; the virtue is to be cute.  It is no longer noble in this country to face the consequences of the things you do and to take them, whatever they may be; the virtue of to-day is to have your cake and eat it, if you can get away with it.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that, despite all that we on this side do, the principles of Machiavelli are, for the time being, prevailing in our generation, with the deplorable results we see in the standards of decency and rectitude which are manifested in the public life of this country and its private life as well.</P>
    <P>I will not sit down without saying frankly what I think, and I dare the Taoiseach to do as much.  On its merits, is this country to be a republic or is this country to elect on its merits to be a member of the Commonwealth? For two reasons, on its merits, I want Ireland to be a member of the Commonwealth. The first reason is this: I believe the Commonwealth to be a dynamic political institution in the world.  I believe the world to be threatened at present with as great a menace as that with which it was threatened in 1939.  In 1939, the house of Beelzebub became divided against itself, and, in the course of the war, the Communist half of the house of Beelzebub fell upon the Nazi half, and the Nazi half perished&mdash;perished by the mercy of God's Providence.</P>
    <P>I believe there at present exists in the world a menace from the Communist half of the house of Beelzebub which has survived, and I believe that menace will be manifested in war within the next ten years, unless the United States of America and the British Commonwealth of Nations manifestly are resolved to stand together and to resist any aggression against one, in combination with the other.  I believe that if Communist materialism believes it possible to strike at Great Britain alone, or at the United States of America alone, and were assured or encouraged to <Col N="2187" /> believe, that on such a stroke being made, one of these nations would stand idly by while the other was destroyed, in our lifetime we would see Communist Russia undertake the destruction of Great Britain and the Commonwealth of Nations for the purpose of dominating all Europe.</P>
    <P>I believe that were she able to undertake that task and to tackle Great Britain standing alone, she would destroy her and would dominate Europe, and that we would see in our time such a persecution of the Church as was envisaged by Pope Pius XI when he wrote <i>Mit Brennender Sorge</i> against the Nazis of Germany.  In the course of that persecution, no people in Europe would suffer more deeply than our own people here in Ireland, and I believe that, in the process of effectively dominating the Continent of Europe, one of the outposts of that domination would be the island which belongs to us, and which Russia would require effectively to control the western approaches to the Continent of Europe and ensure that the United States of America would not find a foothold upon it from which to undo a conquest of that kind.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I believe that if it is made manifest that the United States of America and Great Britain are going to stand together the Russians, who are realists, will perceive that they have no chance if they challenge a conflict with an Anglo-American alliance; and, seeing that, they will never make that challenge.  If we have an Anglo-American peace and Russia is dissuaded by realism from challenging it, then that is the greatest guarantee of peace that the world can have; that is the greatest guarantee of an enduring peace.  And we have something more&mdash;and anyone who knows America and knows the Commonwealth of Nations, as most of us in this House know it, must realise this&mdash;we have a guarantee that in that peace there will be established the world over the one fundamental principle without which 95 per cent. of our people cannot live; that is, a fourth freedom&mdash;but, perhaps, a paradoxical fourth&mdash;namely, freedom for Bishops. <Col N="2188" /> If Deputies will reflect on that, and on all that it implies, they will understand that, though we may be democrats and love many things and prefer to have them, there is only one thing without which we cannot live and only one thing without which it would be better that we should cease to exist altogether, and that is, freedom for Bishops to discharge their pastoral duties; so far as that is guaranteed, Christian men and women can continue to inhabit the world.  Without that, they might as well lay down their lives for their souls.  Does anyone believe that in a world in which an Anglo-American alliance was the prevailing power that freedom would not be guaranteed?  How, then, does that react on us?  Here is my submission.</P>
    <P>I want to see Ireland a member of the Commonwealth of Nations because the evidence of my eyes to-day, and of my experience of yesterday, leads me to believe that that organisation is a dynamic organisation, adaptable and capable of changing to meet the changing circumstances of the world.  We went into it in 1923 when it was an empire.  Irish statesmen conceived the concept of a commonwealth in place of an empire.  They led the other nations of that empire to accept the commonwealth concept and created in the world what has been recognised inside and outside the Commonwealth as a unique constitutional concept, which has been the envy of those who have not been admitted within its circle.  For the 20 years that that constitutional concept has functioned it has served a great purpose in the preservation of human liberty and the providing of a citadel in which freedom could survive.</P>
    <P>I think that to-morrow's morrow calls for a further change because we can see with our own eyes that all over the world to-day, and particularly in Europe at the present time, every problem that besets mankind is rendered a thousand times more complex by the multiplicity of national barriers with which the surface of Europe is chequered&mdash;customs barriers, immigration barriers, monetary barriers, every sort of institution to divide neighbours from neighbours.</P>
    <P>Has it ever occurred to the Deputies <Col N="2189" /> of this House that but for the fact that the United States of America constituted itself a Federal Union 150 years ago, that continent would be flooded in even greater degree with the problems which are at present baffling Europe? The 49 States of that Union to-day, but for this federal concept, would have 49 armies, 49 customs barriers, 49 immigration laws, just as in Europe to-day there are innumerable armies, customs laws and immigration barriers. I believe that the Commonwealth of Nations has an important lesson to teach in the future, and I believe that it is one which our people should be prepared to learn&mdash;that is, to constitute itself through its existing members into a new federal union in which there will be no frontiers recognised between its members, but each State member retaining, as the Federal States of the United States do, full sovereign jurisdiction over its internal affairs but conceding to the Union Federal Government the right and duties of peace and war, of foreign policy, of tariffs and of customs; thus giving to all men within its bounds free passage for man, money and goods over the entire surface controlled by the federal union and, at the same time, so designing its constitution that there might ultimately be within its bounds room for other sovereign States who desire to join and who accept the fundamental principles in which we believe, but not necessarily accept the governmental principles.  I can see a day when such a federal union might comprise, not only the existing States of the present Commonwealth of Nations, but such States as Sweden, Norway, Holland, Belgium, and even some day France and Italy and Spain and Portugal as well.</P>
    <P>I can see the day when such a federal union will exist here in Europe and throughout the Commonwealth, bound, not by any legalistic tie, not by any attempt at fusion, but bound by treaties of friendship and understanding and co-operation with the Federal Union of the United States of America.  Is there any force in the world that could dare then to break the peace?  Is there doubt in the mind of any man that in any part of either of those vast segments of the <Col N="2190" /> world the freedom of bishops would ever be challenged; and if we in this country&mdash;Ireland&mdash;to-day have a hand in bringing that about will we not have shown ourselves equal to a very lofty destiny?  It will have this additional value that at this time when the whole social outlook of Ulster finds itself veering away from the social outlook that dominates, and looks like dominating England for some years to come, there may be found a more open mind in Belfast to-day than there has been for many a year on the subject of their return to the nation where they truly belong.  But, if they are to be induced &mdash;and inducement is the only tolerable method of bringing them home; coercion will not do, the Taoiseach's futile pipe dreams notwithstanding &mdash;if they are to be induced, while not ceding them any fundamental in which we believe, it is an essential prerequisite that we recognise the things to which they attach fundamental importance as we must insist that they recognise the things on which we lay peculiar emphasis as well.  As I understand the present position, there is one fundamental upon which all Parties in this country can find common ground and that is that we want to see Ireland united, sovereign and independent.  I believe most of us would agree that we want her as a nation not only to prosper but to fulfil a destiny worthy of her in the world.  The purpose I have outlined here to-night is no pipe dream.  There are those in other countries in the Commonwealth who think as I think now.  I have heard Dutchmen to say that they longed for the realisation of such a federation as I have outlined, in which their sovereignty could make its contribution.</P>
    <P>I believe there are many other sovereign States in the world at this hour who realise that their freedom and independence depend ultimately on the strength of such a federal union as I envisage and must ultimately perish unless that haven of refuge can be found.  If then we can thus build a citadel for independence, for sovereignty, for peace, and above all for the undying freedom of Bishops to discharge the duties of <Col N="2191" /> their pastoral office, would we not be doing something that was truly worth while and does such a destiny for our country compare unfavourably with the Wexford Republic that accredits its ambassadors from Buckingham Palace?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate the most important issues that arise and that must receive first consideration from this House are: first, what are we doing to secure national unity within the State, the restoration of the Six Counties to the rest of Ireland, the abolition of the hateful Border which is a source of torment to everybody who loves this nation; secondly, what is to be for the future our relationship with the British Commonwealth of Nations?  It is absolutely essential that there should be a clearly defined and clearly stated policy in regard to both these matters, which are the most important issues before the nation to-day.</P>
      <P>I am not deeply concerned as to what is our exact constitutional position at the present moment.  I believe it is true that this nation is at the present time a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations and that it is equally true that this nation is at the present time a republic of some sort.  It may be argued that it is absolutely impossible to combine those two positions, that there cannot be a republic within the British Commonwealth of Nations but, is it seriously suggested that we should alter the existing position in any way? I do not think there is any Deputy who wants seriously to alter the Constitution under which we live.  I have never heard a definite specific proposal for the amendment of the Constitution in such a way that would make it less republican in outline than it is at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would go further and say that this country has enjoyed republican status since 1921 and that it was unfortunate that that position was not recognised sooner.  We, therefore, accept the position that we have, in broad outline, a republican type of Constitution. It may be a unique republic, if you like, but there is an extraordinary number of different kinds of republics <Col N="2192" /> in the world.  There are republics in Eastern Europe the citizens of which enjoy no liberty.  There are democratic republics such as the United States of America, and others.  The word &ldquo;republic&rdquo; is very wide and covers a great number of States and a great variety of conditions.</P>
    <P>The question is not so much whether we are in the British Commonwealth at the present time or not&mdash;because I think it will be accepted that we are in the British Commonwealth&mdash;the question is, what is our future policy to be with regard to the British Commonwealth? Is it the policy of the Government to adhere to membership of that Commonwealth for the future or have they definitely made up their minds that when opportunity offers they will secure exemption, release or escape&mdash; whatever you like to call it&mdash;from that group?</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Taoiseach a clear-cut, definite statement on that question, because it is a most important question which concerns not only this nation but the other members of the Commonwealth.  The other members of the Commonwealth are entitled to know what our future relationship with that organisation is to be.  Are we going to retain our membership or are we going to abandon it at the earliest possible opportunity? I do not think that it is right or proper for any Party or any Deputy in this House to adopt an insincere or dishonest attitude in regard to our future relations with the Commonwealth. In relation to external affairs, all Deputies should speak honestly and sincerely and, particularly, it is the bounden duty of the Taoiseach, as Head of the Government, to speak with absolute honesty and sincerity, not only to the people of Ireland but to the people of other nations, and explain fully what his intentions are for the future in regard to external affairs and what he believes is the best policy for this nation.  Having said that, I am not prepared to depart from the principle which I have laid down.  I am prepared to state, definitely and clearly, that I believe it is in the best interests of this nation that we should retain our membership of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> I do not believe in playing up to any irresponsible and ignorant section of the community who believe that a completely independent republic will confer benefit upon this nation.  I do not believe in those people who held some sort of a better republic than we have as a carrot to dangle before them.  That is an unworthy policy.  I will not say that it is dishonest, because there may be people who believe that separation from the British Commonwealth of Nations may confer benefits.  But it is a foolish policy and one which cannot in any way advance the best interests of our nation.  Six or seven years ago there might have been people in this State who believed that partnership in the British Commonwealth would involve our country in England's wars. Six years of neutrality, during the greatest emergency in which Great Britain has ever been involved, ought to convince everyone that the British are prepared to honour their promises and their obligations to other members of the Commonwealth and that there is not demanded from members of the Commonwealth any sacrifice of blood or money which that member will not be willing to make.</P>
    <P>I think this nation has learned a lot in the last seven years and I think the majority of our people have taken in and digested the lesson of experience. Whatever case might be made for striving to end our connection with the British Commonwealth six or seven years ago, there is no case whatever to-day.  The British Commonwealth of Nations is a unique organisation.  It does not demand any membership fees; it does not impose upon its members any definite responsibility; it does not impose on its members any particular type of constitution.  It leaves its members absolutely free to work out their own destinies in their own way and to withdraw from membership at any time they think fit. That is sovereign independence; it is a great measure of sovereign independence, perhaps a greater measure than Portugal, Spain, Holland or Belgium or any other small nation enjoys.</P>
    <P>Recognising that, we ought to be quite honest and sincere in proclaiming to our own people and the nations <Col N="2194" /> of the world, particularly the other members of the British Commonwealth, that we intend to retain our membership, if permitted to do so.  A clear statement by the Government on that question is urgently necessary.</P>
    <P>It may be that during the emergency the Government felt it was not desirable to emphasise too strongly our intention of remaining a member of the Commonwealth lest that statement might be taken by belligerent States as a suggestion that we were not inclined to hold strongly to our neutrality and that we were inclined to join on one side of the conflict.  But there can be no such excuse at the present time.  The war has ended and we are facing a period of peace, which may be long or short&mdash;that depends on the goodwill and good sense of all nations, including our own.</P>
    <P>It is desirable, on the threshold of a period of peace, to define our attitude towards other nations.  If the Government have made up their minds to remain within the British Commonwealth, it is clearly desirable that they should convey, in the clearest possible language to the other members of the Commonwealth, that that is their intention. By so doing they will help to promote better relations between this country and Great Britain and the other members of the Commonwealth. If, on the other hand, the Taoiseach has an idea that at some time in the future it will be desirable that we should sever our connections with the Commonwealth, it is only right and honest to let the other members know that such is our intention.  That is what I consider to be the foundation of an honest, straightforward external policy.</P>

      <P>There is, possibly, in that statement a kind of threat to Great Britain and the other members of the Commonwealth that if we do not get the Six Counties we will take the Twenty-Six Counties out of the Commonwealth.  I do not think that is a wise or sensible kind of threat to hold out. In the first place, I do not think that anybody could conceive it as desirable that our Twenty-Six Counties should separate themselves from the Commonwealth and that we should set up an isolated republic in the Twenty-Six County area with a boundary over 200 miles long facing six of our counties.  I have simply pleaded for more plain speaking to Great Britain and the other nations of the Commonwealth.  There is everything to be gained by cultivating better relations with those nations. There is everything to be gained at the present time by cultivating a better understanding and a better relationship between this country and Great Britain.  There is also a great deal to be gained by creating closer and better relations between this country and such great young nations as Canada and Australia.</P>
      <P>Personally I do not claim to be a well informed person, but I am sure that prior to the last world war, I had not as high an opinion of the nations of the British Commonwealth, of their economic strength and even of their military strength, as I have at present. I think that those nations have astonished, not only their allies but their enemies in the recent world war by the strength and vigour which they have shown.  That strength and that vigour are going to be demonstrated in future in the progress they will make in solving their economic problems and perhaps in helping the older nations of Europe in solving their economic difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if there was a clear-cut statement that we intend to preserve our association with them, we could do much to better our international position and to raise our prestige in the eyes of the world, and as a result <Col N="2196" /> perhaps raise the standard of prosperity of our people within the State.</P>
    <P>On the question of Partition, I think there is also need for a clearer definition of policy than we have got up to the present.  What are our demands on Great Britain in regard to Partition? Do we want them to clear out of the Six Counties regardless of what the wishes of the majority of the people of the Six Counties are or are our demands something more moderate, something which might be more acceptable to Great Britain than these? There are two ways of ending Partition&mdash;one by force of arms or force in some way, compelling the majority in the Six Counties to submit to the rule of the majority of this nation.  We could ask the British to clear out and leave us to deal with the Six Counties as we thought fit.  That is one policy &mdash;a policy which is perhaps suggested by some people in this State but it is not a policy which I think any sensible person would recommend.  What is the alternative policy?  There is only one alternative, that is the policy of inducing the majority of the people in the Six Counties to accept our from of government and to come into this State, on a federal basis with local self-government, or in some other way. If we accept the view that the Six Counties must be brought in on a voluntary basis by inducement, that there is no solution of the Partition question except by a voluntary reunion of this nation, then we have got to make up our minds what demands we are going to make on Britain.</P>
    <P>What is our policy towards Great Britain in regard to Partition?  What is our grievance against Britain in regard to Partition?  I think in a matter of this kind, our grievance should be clearly defined and clearly stated.  Here again on this question, I want to be quite honest and open in regard to what I think is the sound policy.  I think that the sound policy in regard to Great Britain is simply to say that we accept the view that the majority of the people of the Six Counties cannot be coerced but we request and demand from Britain that she shall not offer any bribe or any inducement to the people of the Six <Col N="2197" /> Counties to remain outside this nation. If the British are prepared to accept that demand and to meet us in a reasonable way, then I think we have no reasonable ground for quarrelling with the British nation.  Whatever wrongs the British may have perpetrated in this country so far as the Twenty-Six Counties are concerned, we are prepared to forget and forgive.  Whatever wrongs they may have inflicted in regard to Partition, we are also prepared to forget and forgive, provided they do not continue to induce the people of the Six Counties to remain separated from us.</P>
    <P>There might perhaps be another reasonable demand that we should make to Great Britain on this question of the Six Counties.  That is, that as long as the Six Counties are under the control of the United Kingdom, Britain should see that the people of the Six Counties are allowed a free choice as to what from of government they require or whether they wish to be reunited with the Irish nation.  It would be the duty of the British Government to see that the people of the Six Counties will always have a fair system of election, a fair system of voting and an absolutely free choice as to whether they wish to rejoin this nation or not.  These are the demands which, I think, our nation ought to make on Great Britain in regard to this question, and if these demands were made in a reasonable manner, I think that the way would be paved for a much better relationship between this nation and Great Britain than at present exists.  I think also that the way would definitely be paved for the ultimate reunion, perhaps within a reasonable time, of this nation.  I think that if the British are prepared to withdraw all inducements and incentives to the Six Counties to separate from the Irish nation, the reunion of this nation can be looked forward to within a very reasonable space of time.</P>
    <P>I think if the British withdrew all the inducements and incentives that were given to the Six Counties to separate from the Irish nation, reunion could be looked forward to within a <Col N="2198" /> reasonable time.  I feel that this is an occasion for honest, sincere and open discussion of the question with the British Government.  We know that there has been a very great change in the Government of Great Britain.  We know that a new Party has come into power there, which has not been to any great extent associated with the British foreign policy of the past, and it is possible that this new Party, which looks like remaining the dominant Party for a long time, might be prepared to meet our demands in a reasonable way.  There, I think, is the best means of a reasonable external policy, one calculated to improve our position in the world and our position internally.</P>
    <P>While it is interesting, and sometimes amusing, to listen to Deputy Dillon when he is attacking Government policy, whether foreign policy or economic policy, he is always at his best when he is destroying.  But when he puts up a constructive suggestion, in which he sincerely believes, he usually leaves himself open to very serious criticism.  When he spoke of moulding the British Commonwealth into a federation similar to that of the United States, I think he was going much farther than any person in this House would advocate.  I do not think this House would desire that we should accept a lesser status of sovereignty or control of our affairs than we now enjoy, knowing that the States in America have very limited powers in regard to many fundamental matters upon which this nation would like to exercise complete control.  It is travelling too far to seek to remould the policy of the British Commonwealth. We have to accept it, more or less, as it is.  We may be able to make changes as time goes on, but we are not going to alter the Commonwealth out of shape, and I doubt if it would be desirable to do so on the lines advocated by Deputy Dillon.  If we are going to part with any of our sovereign powers in regard to foreign affairs, we should only part with such rights to a well-constituted world organisation, and such an organisation is apparently a long way off.  Until such an organisation arises, it is our duty as a nation <Col N="2199" /> to maintain the strong and adequate control over our foreign affairs in matters of defence that is enjoyed by other nations.  I do not think that the proposal suggested by Deputy Dillon could be seriously considered.  We would be spending money which is voted for External Affairs foolishly if we did not immediately, now that peace has arrived in the world, define our future position in regard to the Commonwealth, and define clearly what our demands on Great Britain are in regard to Partition.</P>
    <P>As far as the Six Counties are concerned, and the people there, we can only seek to win their support and allegiance to our nation by just, equitable and good government in the Twenty-Six Counties.  The Protestant minority in the Twenty-Six Counties can be of great help to us in winning the support and confidence of the people in the North.  I think the more fully the minority here enter into their full share of the national life, and their full share in the public affairs of this State, the better it will be, and the sooner we can look forward to confidence being established amongst the people in the North and to a willingness on their part to accept our nation and to be united with us.</P>

      <P>This is a very important debate.  After the lapse of six years, in which there could be practically no straight talking on foreign affairs, it now behoves us without equivocation to decide where we have got.  Rightly or wrongly, the people of this country believe that we are wobbling between membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations and some sort of a republic. During the past six years, we have had some experience of what our position would be as a free and independent republic, with no outside associations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has decided that he will answer when concluding the debate.  I doubt very much if I shall be any wiser when he has concluded the debate.  I should like to proceed along the road the Taoiseach apparently was following and to assume that the Taoiseach paid a visit to London and said to one of <Col N="2201" /> the Ministers of the British Government: &ldquo;I wish to end Partition,&rdquo; to which the British Minister replied: &ldquo;I will end Partition for you.  I will compel the North to go in with the South.&rdquo;  That is the logical conclusion to be drawn from any suggestion I have heard for bringing about the end of Partition.  If that is the Government's method, I want to say that I would not like to see it come about on that basis.  I should not like to see the North brought in with us by compulsion.</P>
      <P>If the North is not to be brought in by compulsion from outside&mdash;and I am speaking only for myself&mdash;I suggest that the only other course open to us is to bring the North in by negotiation. During the 14 years of Fianna Fáil Government, I have never heard of a single approach to the North to find out, either officially or unofficially, on what terms Partition could be ended.  I do not know if the Taoiseach or the Government regards that course as one which should not be pursued, as being an impossible line of country; but if it is an impossible line of country, I think it would serve to clarify the situation if we could be told it was an impossible line of country, and that the only possible method of ending Partition was a request to Westminster or Downing Street to bring compulsion on the North.</P>
      <P>I have said that I would not like to see that course adopted, even if it brought about the ending of Partition, because, expressed in the simplest terms, it would be applying the medicine to other people which we objected to having applied to ourselves. In other words, doing unto others what you would not they should do unto you.  I should like the Taoiseach, when replying, to enable me to tidy up my mind for the succeeding years as to whether the approach to ending Partition is to be via a ticket to London or a ticket to Belfast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the high politics which have just been discussed, but if Deputy Dockrell had read the papers carefully recently, he would have found the answer to the awkward question he has put to the Taoiseach in the speech made by the President in Wexford on a recent <Col N="2202" /> occasion.  I take it that that speech must have been submitted to the Minister for External Affairs and members of the Government before it was delivered.</P>
      <P>During the past six or seven years, a very high percentage of the population of this State were forced, by economic circumstances, to emigrate to a neighbouring country.  During recent times, and particularly since the end of the recent world war, several questions have been addressed to the Minister for External Affairs for the purpose of ascertaining the exact number of citizens of this State who went to a neighbouring country, and I would like to know now if the Taoiseach has the figures at his disposal. I know his Department must have them available, and I ask now for particulars as to the total number of citizens who left this State for civilian work in Great Britain since the outbreak of the war in 1939; and, if he has these figures in detail, I would be interested to know the number of citizens who were given permits to go to Great Britain for work in the building trade, for instance, the number of females who were given permits to go for domestic service, and the number particularly&mdash;and there can be no danger now in giving this figure&mdash;who were given permits for the purpose of joining the fighting forces. Those figures would be very interesting and the Minister concerned cannot now say, as he could have said during the period of the war, that it would not be in the public interest to publish these figures.  It is in the public interest to have them published now, because there has been a great deal of confusion created in the minds of the people from time to time by the different answers given to questions in this House by the Minister for External Affairs since the end of the war. Give us the total number of citizens of this State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do you not ask for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who were given permits for the purpose of joining the fighting forces in Great Britain.  I dare say permits were not given for that particular purpose; but it is <Col N="2203" /> known at any rate that a very large number and a very high percentage of the citizens of this State joined the fighting forces.  Anybody who comes in contact with people from the other side, and particularly with politicians from the other side, must be impressed by the hostility shown to the people of this country.  It was circulated in Great Britain by a particular type of propagandist during the war that we were pro-German.  If figures can now be furnished to show the number of citizens of this State who freely and voluntarily joined the British fighting forces I think that will disprove the attempts made in the direction to which I have already referred and disprove the statements of those who still express themselves in hostile terms both to the Government and to the people of this country.  I was recently handed a document circulated by a responsible citizen of this city who holds strong nationalist views.  I have that document in my posession at the moment.  It was printed by Cahill &amp; Co.  In that document it was stated that 12 of the senior officers of the British fighting forces&mdash;Army and Navy&mdash;were born in Dublin, Mallow, Galway, and the Twenty-Six Counties generally; and ten citizens of this State received the honour of the Victoria Cross as against one from the Six Counties.  I would be interested personally to get these figures for the purpose of disproving the statement made that we adopted a pro-German attitude during the recent war, and for the purpose of disproving that there is any ground for the hostility shown by responsible British citizens to the Government of this country and the people of this State in connection with our attitude in relation to neutrality, which, to the British people, meant a pro-German attitude on our part.  I hope the Minister will understand the reason why I ask for these figures.  In our point of view it will be helpful in removing a wrong impression from the minds of people who have adopted a hostile attitude to the Government of the country at a critical period in our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to raise another <Col N="2204" /> matter&mdash;it is, perhaps, a minor one&mdash; as to whether the Department of External Affairs would use its good offices with some British organisation for the purpose of enabling citizens of this State to send parcels to relatives who are in the Army of Occupation in Germany. I was recently handed a document issued by the Department of External Affairs giving permission to a citizen of this State to send a parcel to a family friend in a town in Germany. When the parcel was taken to the post office here the Parcels Department of the General Post Office refused to handle it because there was no organisation in existence for the purpose of getting the parcel sent direct to one of the principal cities in Germany, although a permit was actually issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce for this purpose.  Is it possible, without too much trouble and without any compliment, for the Department of External Affairs to use its good offices with the British Government, or the British Red Cross, in this connection?  I understand the Irish Red Cross have no contacts of a widespread continental nature for this purpose. Is it possible to make contact with the British Government in order to arrange for these parcels to be sent direct, in the same way as they are sent by relations of British citizens serving or living in that part of Germany occupied by British forces?  If it is sound policy&mdash;and I am sure it is&mdash;for the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture to issue permits to send out of this country parcels of butter, or eggs, or other essential foodstuffs to relatives living in Great Britain, surely it would be good policy to use some organisation, or some section of the British Government, to get parcels sent to relatives of Irishmen living in Germany in the occupied areas.  I put that now to the Minister concerned and, perhaps, at some future date something may be done by the Department of External Affairs in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, in common with the other Deputies, we should look forward with anticipatory amusement to the spectacle of the Prime Minister <Col N="2205" /> and Minister for External Affairs tidying up Deputy Dockrell's mind. Possibly Deputy Dockrell has some hope that some of the questions which the Minister for External Affairs declined to answer during the course of his remarks may be answered at the conclusion of the Minister's speech. I propose to ask only one question in the course of the few remarks that I have to make; and I am not at all sure that I will either get a definite answer or that, if I get an answer, I will be able to understand it.  I do not see that there is the smallest use in this debate at any time in asking the Taoiseach to give, as Deputy Cogan asked him, a clear statement of his view of what our position is constitutionally vis-a-vis the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Nor do I think that there is the smallest use in asking the Taoiseach to declare what his policy is as regards Partition.  He will tell us that he has told us all that over and over again and we ought to know it; and he will tell us that he stands where he always stood, just as to-night, in an interruption, he threw out the interesting suggestion that he is quite satisfied with the present position if it includes the Six Counties.  I venture to state that nobody but the Taoiseach knows what the present position is.  While we might take from a constitutional, or even an international law, point of view some interest in speculating upon what our position is internationally &mdash; perhaps nationally&mdash;I do not think that any such discussion will lead to anything but addled and quite useless talk.  You can only judge a nation by its actions; and you can only judge and test a Government by its actions.  We know precisely where the Government stands so far as its actions are concerned in connection with our relations with Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We know that, so far as Northern Ireland is concerned and so far as the ending of Partition is concerned, the attitude of the Government and its actions based upon that attitude amount to this, and to this only: &ldquo;Here we are and here we stand; you can read our Constitution and from that draw your own inferences; if you want to come in, come in; we will do <Col N="2206" /> nothing more, nor will we go beyond the length of the advances that we have made at the present moment.&rdquo; The Taoiseach is satisfied with the present position provided it includes the Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I again accept the Taoiseach's amendment of my words. We have in the Constitution a President with purely internal functions, but no functions under the Constitution or the law in reference to international affairs.  We have in the Constitution authority to use an external organ, to wit, a King, who is being used at the moment for our purposes in international affairs.  The Taoiseach may say that that does not amount to saying we have a King.  I think it does amount to that, but the <Col N="2207" /> Taoiseach thinks differently.  That is the position that we offer to Northern Ireland and, so far as I interpret the statement of policy of the Taoiseach and his Government, that is the position that we will not retreat from.  We will make no sacrifice to end Partition. That is the utmost limit of our sacrifice.  I do think that that does not appear to give any immediate hope, to put it at its lowest, of seeing the end of Partition in our time.</P>
      <P>There is no use, therefore, in asking for any clearer statement of policy from the Taoiseach and his Government than what we can apprehend ourselves or interpret from the actions of the Government and from their statements. Similarly, as regards our relations with Great Britain and the other nations of the Commonwealth, I judge our results, not by what the Taoiseach or his Ministers say, not by mere words or verbiage, I judge them by our actions.</P>
      <P>The position of this Party in reference to that matter has been made abundantly clear.  The international status that we enjoy at the present moment, the prestige that we have in the family of nations, has it roots in the work that was done from 1926 until 1930.  I state that, not as a matter of pride in the personalities of the colleagues, both living and dead, with whom I was associated in that work, but I state it merely that the people of the country may realise, particularly those people who are now coming of age, 21 and 22, who were not born in those times.  Our position has never varied in that matter.  But, even taking the position as we have it at the moment in the Constitution, I still say that there is a vast field to be explored by the Government, still keeping whatever association they have, or say they have, for the benefit of this country nationally and internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a conference of the Prime Ministers of nations, like Canada and South Africa, in England. Why were we not there?  It may be that there was a good reason for our Prime Minister not being present at that conference.  If so, I think this House ought to be told it in this discussion. <Col N="2208" /> The very fact that our Prime Minister was not there is rather an indication, in the absence of any clear explanation, that we do not intend, at least, that the Government of this country under the present Leadership does not intend, to give any practical or open effect&mdash;and I emphasise the word &ldquo;open&rdquo;&mdash;to that association which I gather that the Taoiseach in some obscure way still says exists. Whether I use the word &ldquo;association&rdquo; accurately in the sense of that he used it or not, I do not think at the moment matters a whole lot.  I firmly believe that we can achieve very useful results, both nationally and internationally, in that association and that our national and international status will be enhanced by developing that in a proper way, with full appreciation of the fact that we are a sovereign and independent nation in free association with these nations.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite waste of time on an Estimate of this kind to be asking for Government policy on this matter of Partition and our association with the Commonwealth of Nations.  I think it is quite clear how we stand as regards that.  So far as I am concerned I have fully made up my mind on the interpretation to be put upon this statement of the Taoiseach and his colleagues and their actions in particular. We are not present at any of these international conferences.  I am told that the Taoiseach to-night gave a list of the conferences at which representatives of this nation attended during the last 12 months.  It is all to the good if something can be achieved for this country in a practical way or in the international sphere from attendance at these conferences, but, at best, they are only technical conferences.  There is not a single political conference in the entire of the list that was given to me at which our representatives attended.  No representative of this country attended at a single political conference that has been held in the last 12 months. Certainly, so far as I know, there has been no approach between Ministers of this country and Ministers of Great Britain in reference to the national or international affairs of this country in the last 12 months.  There was an <Col N="2209" /> opportunity to which I have referred in connection with the meeting of the Prime Ministers of Canada, South Africa and Australia, in England recently and I think the House is entitled to have some explanation as to why our Prime Minister or a representative nominated by him was not present.</P>
    <P>What I would like to know is this: We have something in the nature of an association, whether that is the word the Taoiseach will use himself or not, I do not care.  It is something in the nature of association even according to whatever interpretation the Taoiseach may from time to time put upon any form of words that we or he uses. We have some association.  So far as we know, that has given no practical result but I do think that there is something surreptitiously being done in connection with that, and it is all to the good even if it is done surreptitiously. I think there is some contact between this country and England. I do not know what contact there is between this country and South Africa and Canada with a view to rendering closer the ties that bind this country to those great nations.</P>
    <P>The debate on this question of foreign affairs&mdash;external affairs as it is called here and foreign affairs as it is usually called&mdash;in most Parliaments of the world attracts the greatest interest in the Parliament, but it is perhaps significant that, certainly since I became a member of this House, the one debate that attracts the least attention of Deputies is the debate on our foreign affairs.  I would have thought that the Minister for External Affairs on an occasion of this kind, in particular, the first occasion when he introduces the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs at the conclusion of the world conflict, would have given the benefit to the House, and through the House to the country, of whatever his Department has learned of international affairs in the last 12 months and the prospects of world peace and how the fluid forces which are operating rather in an undirected way at present in world affairs may possibly impinge upon and affect this country's vital interests. We have no such statement from the <Col N="2210" /> Minister for External Affairs.  We have merely an uninteresting account of the international conferences, of a technical character, that were attended by our representatives.  We have a statement that because we have some close relationship with Australia, we are going to send our representative there, presumably by &ldquo;representative&rdquo; he means a High Commissioner, but I would like to know if his Department through our very able, conscientious and hardworking representatives abroad, or otherwise, is keeping in touch with world forces which many people and all people who have the interests of peace and the interests of their own country at heart are so closely watching to-day.  Have we been told by the Prime Minister, the Minister for External Affairs, anything at all about the international position in the last 12 months or for the future or how that is going to affect this country?  I think it may be safely assumed that in the conditions which will subsist in future, with the development of air transport and the scientific achievements that emerged during the course of the last world conflict, this country, as the small island that it is on the shores of the Atlantic, will never again be allowed to be an isolated country.  What will he do about that, and how are our interests being watched?</P>
    <P>Last autumn the Prime Minister, in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, summoned home to the Department all those representatives of this country who were abroad.  A photograph appears in the paper of these gentlemen surrounding the Minister for External Affairs.  That is all the information the House got as to what transpired at that conference of our representatives with the Minister for External Affairs.  I put down a question when Parliament reopened after the Recess, and in it I asked the Minister if he had any announcements to make following upon that conference with our representatives abroad. In effect, I was told he had not. Surely some information was given to the Minister about world conditions, about our interests and how they were being affected by world forces?  If any <Col N="2211" /> such information was given, the House and the country have not been vouchsafed any portion of it.  I suggest we are entitled to it.  We did not get any information then and we did not get much to-day.</P>
    <P>This country has little interest in world politics because of its isolation and, largely, because of the fact that most people have had their interests occupied, in the last six or eight years particularly, in looking after their own purely selfish and economic interests.  I do not use the word selfish in any derogatory sense.  There are people in this country who would like to be educated in international affairs. I have always regarded the Department of External Affairs as one of our most important Departments.  In my view, it is the function and the duty of the Department to see that this country is educated in international matters.  If we had facilities available to our people for the acquisition of knowledge on international matters, I believe there would be a far greater interest, and a greater appreciation of our position, in international affairs and this country would have a far greater influence in world affairs. It is that aspect of this Estimate that I am interested in.  I have long since ceased to expect anything of a definite character in relation to Partition. We hear speeches at election times on Partition, but we never have had a contribution of a practical character on the solution of that problem, or any indication of any practical steps being taken in reference to that matter.  I have also long since ceased to have any interest in eliciting from the Prime Minister, or any member of the Government, what is his view of our relation with the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>I have my own views on that and I have expressed them in appropriate places.  I see little use in having a President with no international functions. I see little use in our representatives attending purely technical conferences where, at best, only inter-Governmental agreements can emerge. I would look forward with great interest to some conference of an international character where heads of <Col N="2212" /> States would be represented, to see who would represent us at such a conference and, if we had a representative at such a conference, where would his credentials come from but from Buckingham Palace?  Our head of State, in our existing circumstances, does not reside in the Phoenix Park.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to become entangled in a discussion of this kind with the Taoiseach on this Estimate but, as he has put it to me, I will make this asseveration.  A country is represented internationally by the head of the State.  Countries that enter into international treaties act through their heads of State.  Countries act internationally through treaties entered into by the heads of their States.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, not necessarily; there are inter-Governmental treaties; but if there were to be a treaty between this country and a foreign country, leaving aside Canada, South Africa or any other member of the Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;if there was, for instance, to be an agreement between this country and America, it would be the King of England and the President of the Republic of the United States of America who would make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. Let there be no mistake.  If there were a heads of State treaty to be entered into between the United States and Ireland&mdash;the type of treaty that in international affairs is recognised as the ordinary form of a heads of State treaty&mdash;it would be between the President of the United States of America and the King of Great Britain.  I have no interest in <Col N="2213" /> that except that the people will not have any illusions about it.  So far as I am concerned, whether it is a Commonwealth, a Kingdom or a Republic I have no interest in the form of Government.  What I have an interest in is our international prestige, our international influence and the extent to which the form of Government that we enjoy will affect the happiness and welfare of our people.  To that extent I have an interest in the form of Government, but to no other extent.  The form of Government makes no difference, provided we have freedom, that we are an independent State, and a fully fledged member of the family of nations.  I do not care whether the head of State resides in Buckingham Palace or Phoenix Park, provided we are a sovereign State and that we are nationally and internationally free. Forms of Government mean nothing. I suppose it is impossible to avoid slipping into old clichés, and perhaps I will be forgiven if I recall a couplet of Pope's:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For forms of government let fools contest;</P>
      <P>Whate'er is best administer'd, is best.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should apologise for that old tag, but it comes to that in the end.</P>
      <P>I should like to be told what is happening in the world internationally. We have not been told a single thing by our Minister to-night. World affairs are an absorbing hobby, not merely to the student of international relations; they are of vital interest to the poorest person in this country, or may become so.  We want to know what forces are acting internationally and how they are being directed and, if they are not being directed, are they coming towards this island and, if so, what will the impact upon our country be.  If that impact cannot be diverted, will it do this country much damage?  I want to know if our Minister for External Affairs is acting as the watch-dog of our national interests.  We are not being told that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated that we have, and I believe that we have, in our representatives abroad men of integrity and <Col N="2214" /> ability.  I believe they must have told something to the Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, about world affairs, about the effect of the war on this country, about how we stood with other countries and what were the matters we should be considering in our relations internationally. These are the matters that I think should be the subject of discussion here.  Our relations with Great Britain are important, the problem of Partition is of vital importance but we are not going to get anywhere in a discussion on the Department of External Affairs along those lines.  Have we any contact with the Northern European countries?  What are our relations with the United States of America?  Surely that is a matter of vital import to this country.  Surely, the matter of our relations between this country and the United States is one that should be watched and safeguarded. Surely, it should be the duty of the Minister for External Affairs to tell this House, and through this House the country, whether there are still any lingering doubts in the minds of the people of that great Republic in reference to our attitude during the war.</P>
    <P>If there are doubts, what steps are being taken to explain our attitude and our difficulties?  So far as I know in the statement made by the Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs in opening the debate he made no reference to that.  Again and again, since I became a member of this House, I have protested at the procedure adopted by the Minister in giving us bald, uninteresting statements of the activities of his Department and as to the cost of it in any one year and the previous year.  We never were supplied with any material upon which to base a proper discussion on foreign affairs or world policy.  We never had any material upon which public opinion could be informed and educated.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset of my remarks that I would ask one question.  I do not know whether or not I shall get an answer.  I put down a question some time ago about the widow of the late William O'Brien.  I should like to know if the Minister has made any provision for that in the Estimate and, if <Col N="2215" /> so&mdash;I am informed by my colleagues, I was not here myself, that the Minister made some reference to the matter in his opening statement&mdash;if that provision can be rendered effective at once.  There is no use in allowing the matter to lie dormant for some further time as it is one of extreme urgency.</P>

      <P>We might have been in doubt as to whether that status would be recognised throughout the world.  We might have still remained in doubt for many years but for the fact that within a very short time after the Constitution was enacted, it was put to a very crucial test, one of the most severe tests, and that test was the terrible war which has raged all around us.  Throughout that war, by reason of this Constitution, our country maintained its neutrality.  It was not dragged into the war as an appanage of any group of nations or as the vassal of any other State.</P>

      <P>Its flag was carried <Col N="2216" /> over the seas and was respected by all the belligerents.  Even as far away as Japan I understand our distinct nationality and our neutrality in the war were recognised.  For these reasons I am surprised that the debate on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs has occupied such a long time.  I am satisfied the vast majority of our people are quite happy about our external relations and about our national status.  The vast majority of our people are proud of the status which we have attained and they are naturally happy that matters have turned out so successfully inasmuch as we were saved from the terrors of the war which has just ended.  Our people are not therefore very much worried about external relations at the present. They would like to see the problem of Partition dealt with as soon as possible, but they are not much concerned to have our attitude towards the British Commonwealth of Nations defined.  They are not much concerned as to the words that are used to describe our State.  They have got the facts, the facts have been proved for them and I suggest the majority of our people are quite happy about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, when this debate is published in the newspapers to-morrow very few people will bother to read it.  Any who do, will probably consider that it is a great waste of time that this House should be debating matters which at the moment are of so little concern.  Many people will consider that the time of the House would be much better occupied in considering urgent problems which confront us at home, such as the high cost of living, the scarcity of commodities and the scarcity of houses. These are the problems which are uppermost in the minds of the people. They will not be interested in reading this debate because they are satisfied that our external relations are in safe hands and that they have been in safe hands for a great many years.  They are satisfied that this country has been extremely fortunate and that our relations have been in safe hands.  They <Col N="2217" /> believe that they might not have been so successful if they were in other hands.  They are not a bit worried about our external relations for the future.  They are satisfied to leave these relations in the hands of the men who have conducted them so successfully in the past and who have won for us the status enshrined in our Constitution.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the assertion made by the last speaker, and also at the challenge issued by the Taoiseach to Deputy Costello.  Apparently the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936 (No. 58 of 1936), must have escaped both Deputy O'Connor's and the Taoiseach's attention, because Section 3, sub-section (2) of that Act states that the appointment of diplomatic representatives and consular representatives and the conclusion of international agreements is a matter reserved for His Majesty, King George, on the advice of the Irish Government.</P>

      <P>Letters of credence which are given to our ambassadors going abroad were read by Deputy Dillon.  In face of that, how can you say that the King is not the head of this State for purposes of external relations?  It baffles me.  I leave it to anybody else to say, in face of the letters of credence given to our ambassadors, based on law which is an Article of the Constitution, if the King is not the head of this State in regard to external relations.

I hold that if we are a republic, and that there is a change from whatever we were by virtue of the whisper of the President at Wexford, it affects our international status, and by virtue of that fact, I am entitled to comment on it.  The President stated there that he received the freedom of Wexford as President of the Republic of Ireland. These were the words he used, though he is designated in the Constitution as the President of Ireland.  I want to know if he had the authority of the Executive and of the Taoiseach for that declaration.  We have had in this year of grace, 1946, two declarations for the republic, one by the Taoiseach, a whisper out of the Oxford dictionary and forthwith the republic flew out like a moth, and also the declaration in Wexford.  We also had two or three extraordinary statements from the Taoiseach in the course of this debate in reply to Deputy Cogan who wanted an answer to certain questions.  These were as to our relations with the Commonwealth. The Taoiseach interjected to ask what he had ever done to sever the connection with the Commonwealth. He asked the Deputy to point to one occasion in which he had severed connection with the Commonwealth.  In justification for the appointment of an ambassador to Australia, he told us that that was being done by virtue of our association with the Commonwealth. Let us be clear about these things.  The mind of the public outside is confused.  Deputy Cogan is confused.  I am confused.  Deputy O'Connor, I am sure, is confused.</P>

I say it is not.  I say this is the bedrock.  I say that we are either going to co-operate with our neighbours in a friendly way, or we will go along the road of isolation, where we will live like a dog on his own tail.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the history of our constitutional development. There have been so many claims made for the republic and against the republic that it is essential that we should try to see light sometime and to put ourselves in the position in which other people see us.  Are we a monarchical republic or are we a republican monarchy?  What are we?</P>

      <P>When King Edward VIII of England abdicated, we had an opportunity of proclaiming a republic. We were severed definitely from the Commonwealth for a number of hours or days, and, in a great hurry, this Act was passed.  Under Section 3 (2), the abdication of the former King was recognised in these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Immediately upon the passing of this Act, the instrument of abdication executed by His Majesty King Edward the Eighth on the 10th day of December, 1936 (a copy whereof is set out in the Schedule to this Act), shall have effect according to the tenor thereof and His said Majesty shall, for the purposes of the foregoing sub-section of this section and all other (if any) purposes, cease to be king.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There, the abdication is recognised, but mark what follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... and the king for those purposes shall henceforth be the person who, if His said Majesty had died on the 10th day of December, 1936, unmarried, would for the time being be his successor under the law of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That means that George VI succeeded Edward VIII, and we recognised him as King by virtue of an Irish Act of Parliament.  In 1155, Adrian III&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to deal with external affairs until the House makes up its mind on what we are.  We are given nothing about external relations, and, for want of something to speak about, we have to define ourselves. We have got nothing from the Taoiseach, as Deputy Costello has said, about what is happening in the outside world, about what relations are being developed in the outside world and about what we are going to do in relation to other nations, and, in particular, to our neighbours.  I am not advocating any particular form of government any more than Deputy Costello did.  I do not care a hoot if it is a monarchy, a republic or a soviet, so long as the decent people, the common people of the country, get good government; but I cannot see good government here so <Col N="2225" /> long as we have this chicanery and quibbling, this evasion and confusion. I say emphatically that all this evasion and all this confusion is being deliberately caused to cloud the people's minds and take them away from the realities of conditions here.</P>
      <P>Partition has been mentioned.  In the name of all that is good and sensible, does the Taoiseach believe that by the President going to Wexford and declaring an Irish Republic, he will undo Partition?  Is not an act of that kind calculated to make more firm that boundary between us?  Is it calculated to induce the Orangemen to come in here when we find ourselves disputing whether we are in the Commonwealth or out of the Commonwealth?  There is a fable&mdash;I think it is one of Aesop's fables&mdash;about the mountain and the mouse.  The inhabitants around a mountain heard the mountain groan and grumble and rumble for days.  The thunder within was terrifying and the people fled to a distance.  From a distance, they saw the mountain quake, and, when it quaked, out walked a small mouse, a republican mouse.  That republican mouse played the republic up and down until the cat came along, and, the moment the cat came along, in the mouse ran.  That seems to be our position here&mdash;in and out.  When the cat is out, the republic is in, but when the cat is in or about the place, the republic goes out.  Let us get rid of all this.  Let us get down to Michael Collins's slogan&mdash;let us get on with the work of building up this nation and let us not bother about the formulae or about the forms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not bothering about them.  I am not in the least concerned with them.  I want the Taoiseach to face up to this position once and for all, and to say definitely whether we are going into the Commonwealth, whether we are staying in it or whether we are going out of it. That was the question put to him, not by me, but by Deputy Cogan, Deputy Dillon and others.  I want that answered straightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2226" /> General Smuts, in an interview with an <i>Irish Press</i> correspondent this evening, regretted the fact that we were not present at the conference of Prime Ministers which was called for the purpose of discussing a number of very important Commonwealth matters&mdash; defence, finance, trade and all that flows from Commonwealth relations. So far as I know, we were not represented at that conference.  The Taoiseach was not there nor was any of his Ministers.  Our absence from the conference was commented upon, but no ill-feelings were shown.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us the number of conferences that were attended by representatives &mdash; civil servants, subordinate Ministers and others. These attended at conferences but the most important conferences of all&mdash; T.A.O. and the Dominions Conference &mdash;were not attended by any representative. We had, I believe, an observer at T.A.O. in Washington.  We had nobody to meet General Smuts, or any of these people.  Now, General Smuts and these other people are no more concerned than I am as to our future constitutional development.  We are free to go our own road.  So are General Smuts and these other people.</P>
    <P>The association of the Commonwealth of Nations is dynamic and progressive. It is not static.  You can be a republic overnight and still be a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.  Let us cut out the twaddle of pretending we are not in the Commonwealth. If we are a republic within the Commonwealth let us say so and face up to that.  Let us say to the people who are concerned: &ldquo;This is the stand that we are taking; we will go in with you whole-hog otherwise.&rdquo; I think it is essential for the future of this country that we must take that stand, and we must co-operate with these people, particularly in defence matters.  We are not able to manufacture our own weapons of defence and we must get them from somewhere else; we must keep in line with the other nations in the matter of progress in relation to new lethal weapons of all kinds and in relation to air progress of all kinds.  Why not let us be honest with ourselves?  Why <Col N="2227" /> not let us go in with our heads up instead of by these back-door methods?</P>
    <P>Already there are indications that the Taoiseach, who is a very wily politician, is preparing you people on those benches for that rôle.  He has already taken the necessary steps and he is preparing you for that, ably assisted by the Tánaiste.  They are very wily fellows who do not take their hurdles all together; they take them in little easy strides but they always get the little horse safely over on the few occasions when they make him jump.</P>

We are glad to see them taking our advice at last and we want them to go on taking our advice in the future.  We are very glad of that and we welcome it.  I think it is about time that the people of this country appreciated that for the past 25 years the people on these benches at this side of the House have been educating the people on the opposite benches.  Despite all the thunder and the shouting and the muddling nevertheless we have eventually got them to take the bit and go the straight road.  That is the road I see them going within the next two years.  Mark my words.  That is the road I see them going; and to-day the Taoiseach has let a few little words drop which would suggest that he is contemplating a political somersault right into the Commonwealth.  Mark my words&mdash;republic or no republic, he is going there.</P>

It takes a little time to get the proper atmosphere for these things but that atmosphere is being prepared and the smoke-screens are being laid.  The <Col N="2228" /> Tánaiste is going to see Irish industrialists and British industrialists will compete on whatever terms are laid down under the new trade agreement now in contemplation.</P>
      <P>I did not intend to speak at such length.  I do want to say, however, that if we wish to see the end of Partition we must cut out this farce of republicanism and all these little pin-pricking policies which we have had in the past.  Let us not be quite so joyful when we remove some little archaic formalism from an old Constitution but let us rather, on the contrary, try to see the other fellow's point of view.  There are a million of these people in the country.  They form the one-fourth part of our population and they have their historical roots deeply embedded in the soil of this country, just the same as we have. Whatever their racial origins may have been they are Irishmen.  I appeal to all sides of the House to try to understand the fundamental loyalties and the political outlook of these people. Let us not offend them by any act of ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have offended them in the past and I hold that the Fianna Fáil policy in the past has been calculated deliberately to offend the sentiments of these people rather than coax them in with us.  You will not get them by offending them.  You will only get them by goodwill and co-operation.  Is it not better that we should try to understand their sentiments and their loyalties and, understanding, try to have some rapprochement with them?  That is the road we have been trying to go for the last 25 years.  Because we tried that road 25 years ago and because we were in advance of the political outlook of the people who occupy the benches opposite we were dubbed imperialists and traitors&mdash;aye, and worse.  I am no traitor and I do not think there is any traitor behind me on these benches.  I hold that I and the men with me on these benches are as good Irishmen as the men opposite. I hold that we are as good disciples of Thomas Davis as the men on the opposite benches of this House and I hold that our policy was and is calculated on the lines of Davis to unite Irishmen <Col N="2229" /> of every creed and class under the name of Irishmen.  That is why I stand here now on these benches and that is why I advocate that rôle.  I ask you now on this 25th anniversary of the Irish Treaty to abandon all this idea of republicanism and to get down to business and get on with the work.</P>

      <P>I am afraid my colleague, Deputy Coogan, is destined to lead a rather dissatisfied life.  He said he would not be satisfied until he got a straight answer from the Taoiseach.  The Deputy will never be satisfied.  Recently, the Italian nation was torn asunder on the question as to whether they were going to have a monarchy or a republic.  Some terrible scenes took place in Italy and a good many lives were lost.  There was a referendum to the people.  It was a great pity that the Italian people did not know about the Taoiseach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because if they had, he would have shown them how to have both at the same time&mdash;both a monarchy and a republic.  He would thereby have solved all their troubles without a referendum, without any loss of life, or without any injury to any person.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Coogan that the Taoiseach is about to take another line.  He deliberately, in the course of a very short and scrappy speech, mentioned the word &ldquo;Commonwealth&rdquo; three times.  The Taoiseach does not do things like that by accident.  For the first time for a long number of years he deliberately and specifically mentioned our association with the Commonwealth of Nations. I understand that he has gone so far as to say that he never left it, or rather he challenged Deputy Coogan to point out when he did leave it. Will he say now whether he is inside it or outside it, or whether he has one leg inside it and the other leg outside? I do not propose to waste the time of the House any further on that matter. All this blatherskite has one purpose and one purpose only&mdash;whether it is by the Taoiseach here in the House or by the President down in Wexford &mdash;and that purpose is simply to throw <Col N="2230" /> dust in the eyes of the people of this country.  There is no man, either inside or outside this country, who knows better or thinks more clearly in his mind as to what our status is than the Taoiseach himself; and there is no person in this country to-day who is clearer in his mind that we are not a republic than the Taoiseach is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Taoiseach took very good care in the drawing up of the Constitution, amending the first Constitution, that that was one word which did not find its way into any Article in that Constitution.  That is one word which will not be found in the Constitution from beginning to end of it.  The Taoiseach told the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, after the passing of the Constitution, that he had no intention of declaring a republic for the TwentySix Counties.  The Taoiseach likes to pretend that he has changed completely the status of this country, that he has given it a measure of freedom that it had not when he came into power.  That is the pretence.  The fact is that if the Taoiseach has made any change at all, he has merely changed the label on the bottle, the contents of which are still the same.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connor spoke about the Constitution of 1937 having enabled us to keep out of the war.  Deputy O'Connor knows quite well that before the Constitution of 1937 was ever enacted or thought about, there was no authority except Dáil Éireann that could have brought this country into any war.  That was the position then; that is the position to-day.  Deputy O'Connor knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach does he think that it is treating this House fairly, as the National Parliament, when he introduces his Estimate as Minister for External Affairs, an Estimate that covers the first complete year of peace, in a speech which gives absolutely no information worth talking about or of any value of what has transpired during the past 12 months, no information to the House as to what is to be our line in relation <Col N="2231" /> to any other country for the coming 12 months, or no indication as to what reports, if any, we have received from our representatives abroad, either from the political or economic point of view? No indication has been given as to whether the reports coming from our representatives abroad hold out any hope that in the coming 12 months we will be able to get increased supplies from the various countries in which we have representatives.  No indication has been given as to whether, through or from our foreign representatives, we have got any information as to what are the probabilities regarding building supplies, fertilisers and the hundred-and-one other things which this country so urgently requires.  We have got no line from the Taoiseach as to what our relations are with any other country on the face of the earth. None whatever.  Surely we are entitled to be told in the National Parliament, when we are asked to vote money, what is being done.  We ought to be told whether the money which we are asked to vote is well spent and whether we are getting value for it.  I know quite well that there are reports sent to the Minister for External Affairs that perhaps it would not be in the national interest to make public here but I know that the Minister for External Affairs could give us considerably more information than he did give us without endangering the national interest.  However, I am satisfied that when the Taoiseach is replying to this debate, we will hear nothing about the matters which Deputy O'Connor says are those which should be our principal and main consideration. The Taoiseach will be again word-spinning around the Constitution and talking about the word &ldquo;organ&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;king.&rdquo; That, of course, is the sort of debate at which he excels.  He would require to do a lot of word-spinning to explain away the actual facts of the situation. There is very little use in the Taoiseach telling this House or the country that the King is not there when he is there.</P>

When we last discussed the question of the constitutional status of this country, I expressed the opinion that, so far as our internal institutions were concerned and so far as many of the attributes of our external relations were concerned, we had all the appearance of being a republic but I then said, and I want to say again now, that I have never been able to understand why, being a republic, we deliberately decide to elect a President of the Republic who in any normally-governed country would be the organ of our relations with foreign powers, and at the same time elect a British King to be the organ of our relations <Col N="2234" /> with foreign powers, and put the President of the Republic in the second place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, of course, can always see in the dark&mdash;I cannot&mdash;and the darker it is, the more the Taoiseach will say to you: &ldquo;Why cannot you see, when I can see clearly?&rdquo; I think our constitutional position is particularly muddy; it is getting muddier every day, and the oftener the President goes out to receive the freedom of boroughs or attend Feiseanna throughout the country, the muddier the constitutional position will get.  We had a statement by the President the other day.  He said that he is the President of the Republic of Ireland.  Is that really the position?  When the President said that, he might have been feeling a little exalted at that particular moment and he might have thought he was the President of the Republic. Maybe he is, but I do not want to see the President declaring himself as the President of the Republic if the <Col N="2235" /> Taoiseach and the Government do not think he is.  If the Taoiseach believes the President is the President of the Republic, I want to stake this claim for the President, that he should be allowed to do what the President in every other normally governed country does, and that is to be the organ of our relations with other Powers.  In our circumstances, we deliberately exclude the President from being the organ of our relations with foreign Powers.</P>
      <P>The President is the President of the Republic when he is at a fair around the country, or receiving the freedom of some small borough, but when it comes to accrediting our representatives to any foreign Power, the poor President has no more functions than any funny man at a fancy fair.  He is deliberately put in the background and the functions normally exercisable by a president are exercised by a gentleman known as George the Sixth, King of Britain and the other countries in the British Commonwealth. The Taoiseach says it is not necessary to declare a republic in the Constitution.  The only case he can quote in favour of that&mdash;and I do not know whether this influenced his reticence on the matter&mdash;is that the United States has not declared itself a republic in its Constitution.  Of course, there is a vast difference.  Nobody doubts that the United States is a republic, but here almost half the people are doubting that we are a republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get back to the evolution of the republic.  Deputy Dillon raised a question as to whether it is a republic or whether we are in the Commonwealth.  Instead of being able to say: &ldquo;There it is in black and white in the Constitution,&rdquo; the Taoiseach refers to dictionaries. Instead of being able to say: &ldquo;Our President has been elected by the people.  He does everything that Presidents in other countries do.  He accredits our Ministers and looks after our relations with other Powers,&rdquo; we are told that we must not judge by that standard and we shall have to see what the dictionaries say about republics.  Having looked up the dictionaries, the Taoiseach comes to the conclusion that a republic is a kind of State in which certain things happen and, begob, we must be a republic because these things happen here.</P>
      <P>That is not the way in which republics are declared.  We had an opportunity and we still have it of asking the people: &ldquo;Do you want to declare a republic or do you not&rdquo; and the obvious thing to do is to give the people the choice of voting on that issue.  If they say: &ldquo;We want a republic&rdquo; clap the phrase into the Constitution and say: &ldquo;This is the Republic of Ireland&rdquo; and let the President be the organ of our external relations with others Powers instead of having him declared a President at some country function.</P>

      <P>Now you see the position we are in.  It is all perfectly clear to the Taoiseach, but no matter how we may struggle trying to see where the Republic is and where it got its origin, we cannot succeed.  But there is one consolation.  The Taoiseach sees it with an amazing brilliance and we are all inferior people because we cannot see it in the same sparkling light as the Taoiseach.  I want the Taoiseach to remove every possible doubt about it&mdash;and he can do that.  I shall try to show him how.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>He sees it right in the heart of the Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the country to decide whether it wishes to be a republic, a monarchy or a hybrid State. If we want to retain republican status, or assert that we have it already, the normal way is to put into the Constitution &ldquo;This is the Republic of Ireland&rdquo; and then let our President exercise, in respect of that republic, the same rights as the president of every other republic exercises as regards the relations of this nation with other nations.  But we are not satisfied with that.  The Taoiseach has found another way of regulating our relations with other Powers.  He says that we will have a republic for internal, ornamental and decorative purposes and the President will do all the flummery stuff within the State.  We will let the President do all kinds of embroidery work with respect to State activities, but when we come to accrediting a representative to a foreign State, we will ask George the Sixth to do the accrediting and George the Sixth does the accrediting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to tell the Taoiseach that he is in a very dangerous position with this gentleman who does the accrediting of our representatives to other countries.  He did not ask the man <Col N="2239" /> whether he would do the job at all.  We simply passed an Act and we passed over to that poor man the job of accrediting our representatives to other countries.  I do not think he was ever asked by us to do it or that the Taoiseach had ever an interview with him to ascertain whether he would do this job.  During the war George VI would not do the job because George VI was at war with Germany and Italy as King of Great Britain and the other countries in the Commonwealth. Of course George VI being Dr. Jekyll in relation to the war would not be Mr. Hyde for the purposes of the Republic of Ireland, and he would not, therefore, accredit our representatives to these countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do you say: &ldquo;he would not, therefore&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is a very wily politician and if the Taoiseach did not consult George VI to ask him to accredit our representatives to these countries, I suspect the reason was that he was afraid that George VI would get angry and would say that he would no longer act for us in accrediting representatives in these other countries.  The Taoiseach would then probably wake up when he found that George VI would no longer consent to accredit our representatives to any foreign Power.  Then we would have nobody to accredit our representatives to foreign countries.  Suppose the King goes on strike and says: &ldquo;Look here, I am not going to do this job any longer; it is an anachronism; it puts me in a wrong position with my subjects in other countries.  I am not going to do the job any longer.&rdquo; The Taoiseach will complain probably then that he is being put out of the Commonwealth, that that is unfair, that he intended to remain in it as he wanted the King for the purpose of accrediting representatives in foreign countries.  If that happens&mdash;and it may happen&mdash;the Taoiseach will have a pretty bad headache.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the reluctance to getting rid of this anachronism of having the King accrediting Irish representatives to independent States in Europe? Mind you, it is bad enough to have him accrediting representatives to <Col N="2240" /> Canada and Australia, but it is doubly humiliating to have to ask him to accredit our representatives to independent foreign States.  Will somebody tell me why this man was picked to do that particular job?  Might we not as well have found some other monarch in Europe or could we not get the President of the United States, for instance, to do the job?  Could we not get the President of some South American Republic and say to him: &ldquo;Look here, you will do this job just as well; we do not want to declare a republic in a whole-hearted way but we should like in order that we might be able to do things in a republican way to get somebody other than the King of England to accredit our representatives&rdquo;? But the Taoiseach goes out of his way and he selects the King of Britain to do the accrediting of our representatives.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach is not fair to the President in this matter because the President is merely getting the secondhand headship of the State and he is not allowed to do the things that are done by Presidents in other countries.  I want to know what is the hesitancy or unwillingness in allowing the President of the Republic to accredit our representatives to other Powers in the same way as Presidents in other countries accredit their representatives to foreign independent States?  The Taoiseach has an excellent opportunity of clearing up this whole position now.  The Taoiseach has taken the attitude that the position of the republic is to be clarified by reference to dictionaries or by reference to the action taken by film actresses when they want to change their nationality.  I think our constitutional position should be clarified apart from what film actresses may do or what dictionaries may say.  There is an excellent opportunity for getting that clarification now.  The British Government has sent a delegation consisting of three important Ministers to India for the purpose of discussing the Indian problem and the measure of freedom that can be given to the Indians.  The British Prime Minister has said publicly to the Indian people: &ldquo;Look here, you are perfectly <Col N="2241" /> free to declare complete independence and to go completely outside the Commonwealth if you want to do that, but for old time's sake, please, if you can see your way, stay within the Commonwealth.&rdquo; He said furthermore that the Indians are not to be under any compulsion to stay in the Commonwealth, that they can do what they like and exercise the fullest measure of independence in deciding what form of political institutions and what form of external relations they will have in future.  There is the offer by the British Government to the Indian people.</P>
    <P>Do you imagine if the British are going to tell the Indians they can go out of the Commonwealth, that they can be as independent as Britain herself or as independent as any foreign country, that they are likely to worry in the slightest if we decide in future that we are going to ask the President of the Republic to be the organ of our external relations instead of thrusting the job on the King of England?  The British are going to give the Indians the fullest measure of political liberty, with no coercion whatever to remain in the Commonwealth.  Are they likely to bother their heads if we decide to dispense with the King as the organ of our external relations?  They would stand condemned before the world if they attempted to interfere with us in that way.  If they are offering new treaties to the Egyptians and the fullest measure of political liberty to the Indians, why should anybody fear that they would dream of interfering in our affairs here simply because we dispense with the anachronism of having the King of Britain as the organ of our external relations with independent countries?  I do not think the British would worry in the slightest were we to get the position clarified.</P>
    <P>If the President declares he is President of the Republic of Ireland, that whole position should be regularisued by having our status clarified in the Constitution and the people consulted by means of a referendum as to whether they want that clarification, whether we ought to crystallise the establishment of the Republic or whether, alternatively, they want a form of words in the Constitution that <Col N="2242" /> we are still in the Commonwealth if some folk want to remain in the Commonwealth. I say to the Taoiseach that he is perfectly free to take a decision on that matter to-morrow, freer than the Indians are.  He can make the choice with an absolute guarantee that there is no likelihood of any force being used to impede the free choice of the people.  If he wants to exercise our right to be free and to clarify our whole constitutional position, the obvious course is to give the people an opportunity of declaring what they want to do in an issue of this kind.</P>
    <P>It might have been difficult in the circumstances of 1937 to have done what it is easy to do now.  It might have been difficult to have broken with the Commonwealth in a direct and precipitate way.  That day has long since passed, and the difficulties then extant have ceased to be difficulties. It seems, having regard to the declaration of the President, that he is President of the Republic of Ireland and the Taoiseach's rather subtle insinuation that this is a republic, the rather obvious thing to do is to give the people a choice to declare where they want to stand constitutionally vis-a-vis our neighbour or vis-a-vis the other States.  It is easy to determine that.  It can be determined by referendum.  We should certainly get away from the nationally demeaning position, in which every year on the Estimate for External Affairs, we have to discuss what we really are.  No Frenchman wants to know what France is, no American wants to know what America is, no Belgian wants to know what Belgium is, and no one in Holland wants to know what Holland is.  Their constitutional position has long since been clarified and has ceased to be an object of discussion amongst the citizens.</P>
    <P>Here, because of the labyrinthine way in which we went about it, no one knows whether we are now a republic or what we are.  How long more will we have to ask that question?  There was perfect freedom to decide the matter without any fear of physical <Col N="2243" /> opposition from anybody.  The Taoiseach should ask the people where they want to be, and let us finish this whole muddy constitutional position in which nobody knows whether he is a citizen of a republic, whether he is in the Commonwealth, whether he is half in or half out, or whether there is internal and external association with it.  That position should not continue any longer.  There is no necessity in present circumstances to continue it.  We have abundant opportunities to clarify the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that there are no people so blind as those who will not see&mdash;none.  I am not such a fool as to think that I can convince people who deliberately want to have it the other way.  There are two sections in this country who want not to see the light or to see the truth.  One is a section that wants, as I said last year, to deny that we are a republic, because, if we were a republic; they would have no slogan to work on. There is the other section that does not want to see it because the fact that it has been achieved would be contrary to all the things they have said and done for a number of years. I did not raise this question as to what was the character of this State, what was its particular type or how it could be classified amongst States.  I was quite content that the people should have passed a Constitution which gave us all we wanted.  That was the position until last year when Deputy Dillon put the specific question: &ldquo;Were we a republic or not?&rdquo; I said we were a republic.  Then the Deputy said: &ldquo;My God, where are we?  We are out of the Commonwealth.  Everything has gone wrong, if we are a republic.&rdquo; Seeing the people I have to deal with, I tried to demonstrate that we were a republic in such a way that it would not rest on my saying so.  When I did this, I was told that it was not a word in the dictionary, but what I said, was the thing that mattered.  I had said that we were a republic.  I demonstrated it by every test of what a republic should be and what a republican State was. It was said that the word was not in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It had to begin some time.  If somebody like Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Norton, a year or two after the American Constitution was adopted, said: &ldquo;Oh, we cannot be a republic because it is not written in the Constitution.&rdquo; How then?  Last year, I stated that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are an independent republic associated, as a matter of our external policy, with the States of the British Commonwealth.  To mark this association, we avail ourselves of the procedure of the External Relations Act&mdash;which I quoted at the time&mdash;by which the King recognised by the States of the British Commonwealth therein named acts for us, under advice, in certain specified matters in the field of our external relations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Because of the fact that we have Partition and on account of the people of our race in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and so on, we have a special relationship to these countries, apart from a political relationship.  The reason we kept this policy of association was that it suited our purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not to-day or yesterday that we enunciated that as our policy.  Back in 1921, when negotiations were taking place with Britain the Republican Cabinet of that day indicated its willingness to have an association of that sort, provided that the State which then existed was not destroyed or disestablished.  We were willing to have co-operation, provided it was consistent with certain ideals we ourselves had.  When we passed this Constitution, we enshrined in it our ideals as far as our people were concerned, and, consistently with these ideals being satisfied, as they were by this Constitution, and the freedom which that gives us being accepted, we were prepared for our part to continue <Col N="2245" /> association with the State of the British Commonwealth.  That was clearly a matter which we ourselves alone could not determine.</P>
    <P>I read for the House last year the declaration made by the British Government accepting the situation after that Republican Constitution, in which the King does not figure in any particular way, was passed, and after the passing of an enabling Act which, as a mark of that association, enables us to use the British King&mdash;not our King, but the King of Canada, Australia, and so on&mdash;in the accrediting of our representatives abroad.  In the centre of the Constitution, you will find that the real executive authority in this country is the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In most Constitutions where there is a head of State like a king, executive power is supposed to be vested in the head, even through, in practice, there is a ministry.  You do not find that here.  It is on a different basis.  External policy and internal policy are exercised by and on the authority of the Government.  The authority lies with the Government.</P>
      <P>If the President carries out any functions except the particular limited functions which are given to him to be exercised at his discretion, he carries them out on the advice and in the form decided by the Government.  So, too, when the King of Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand&mdash;whether the Kingship is regarded from the collective or singular point of view&mdash;accredits any representative of ours he does so in the form and on the advice given by the real executive authority, that is, the Government.</P>

Deputy Morrissey referred to a statement of mine made to a meeting of Fianna Fáil shortly after the Constitution. I said that I did not put in the words&mdash;and I considered it very carefully&mdash;Poblacht na hÉireann or Republic of Ireland, simply because those words had a historical association with the country as a whole, when the Republic was declared here in 1919.  When some of the people who are attacking us now for not declaring a Republic on a later occasion, had a chance of maintaining the Republic which was in existence, they did not stand up for it.</P>

      <P>I do not mind what they say about me.  I stood up for it and held for it, so long as it was possible to do so.  That is the position, so far as our State is concerned.  Nobody need have any doubt, except those&mdash; and I do not believe I have any chance of converting them to the truth&mdash;who <Col N="2249" /> do not want to see.  There are such people and there will be such people, and I do not want to waste my breath on them.</P>
      <P>The question was asked why it was I did not give a long disquisition on world affairs.  Deputy Dillon started by giving his views and his dreams of the world he would like to have.  I suppose some Deputies wanted me to do the same.  Everybody who is at all interested in world affairs at present knows what the position is.  They know perfectly well that the four great Powers which were allied during the war are not able to come to an agreement on the terms of peace, that the peace treaties have not yet been signed and that agreements have not yet been reached.  There would be no point in my speculating as to when agreements will be reached, as to what are the chances of securing agreement, as to what will be their effect on us and so on.  I can give no worth-while information on that point and I doubt if the people most interested in it, the four principal Ministers, could either.</P>
      <P>Do not ask me then to try to give you an essay on what world affairs will be like, or what the consequences of various happenings will be on Ireland. We could speculate from now until this time 12 months on what effect these happenings will have.  I do not think anybody will be the better for doing so. Everybody knows that the situation is far from satisfactory.  They know that a world organisation has been set up and that it does not yet include a large number of States, that, in fact, the people who are meeting and carrying on discussions at present are, with very few exceptions, the people who were on the side which waged war against Germany, Italy and so on, and that they are now trying to get agreement amongst themselves.  The suggestion was made that we should have been at the conference of Prime Ministers recently held in London.  The fact was that, as I knew, they were discussing matters immediately relating to the war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy in general terms.  I am not at liberty to tell him everything.  I am giving him the matter so far as I know it and in so far as I can do so.  I know that in general they were discussing matters in which we were not concerned because we did not take part in the war; and these were discussions at which we could not properly be present or, if we were invited, in which we could not properly take part.  When things settle down somewhat more and when the peace treaties have been signed and an attempt made to build up a world organisation, then there will be some point perhaps in our having representation. The fact is that the war situation has not entirely ended yet in the sense that peace has not really been restored. No peace treaties have yet been signed. There is not agreement, apparently, amongst the principal States.  From that point of view we must, to some extent, still regard ourselves as being in the war situation or in the same situation in which we have been for some years past.  The time has not yet come in which we can look forward to purely constructive work in which we would naturally be anxious to engage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, in this House you have one set of Deputies suggesting that we have no contact with the British, that we cold shoulder them completely, and keep them at a great distance from us; on the other hand, you have other Deputies accusing us of having subterranean and other hidden methods of approach.  The fact is that there has always been contact of various kinds. Britain is taking goods from us, as she always did; she is not yet in a position to give us the goods we want or <Col N="2251" /> expect to get in return.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture, the Minister for Supplies and the Department of Supplies, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Department of Industry and Commerce, all have been constantly in touch with British Ministers and Departments about matters of importance in relation to agriculture, trade and so on.  It is quite wrong to suggest that these contacts are not in existence.  You can do a great deal of work without having any conference. A great deal of the ordinary day-to-day business all over the world is done without any conference.  Conferences very often denote that there is a crisis, or something of that sort. Conferences very often denote that big changes are taking place.</P>
    <P>At the present moment there is no possibility of any big constructive changes taking place because all the nations of the world to-day are interested in only one big issue&mdash;that is, they want to get the nations at peace; they want to get the treaties signed and thereby lay the foundations of security in the future.  They want them to form some kind of world organisation.  Until these things are done there is no use in talking about being ready to take part in other types of constructive effort; there is nothing we can do to help at the moment and we are losing nothing by not being represented at these conferences.</P>
    <P>Some minor matters were raised in the course of the debate.  Deputy Davin asked about the number of people who went to Britain.  All information available on any question of that sort can be obtained by means of an ordinary Parliamentary Question. I do not think it would be possible for us to supply the exact information sought.  I do not think the details he asked for could possibly be given.  First of all, people went abroad and there is the possibility that the same people returned, or others returned in their stead.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget speech gave what he regarded as the net result of movements out and movements in.  As far <Col N="2252" /> as I am concerned I must say that it looked to me a very small figure; I think it was 78,000.  I myself was anxious that it should be checked and counter-checked.  It did not seem to me at first sight that the balance could have been so small; but neither the checking, nor the counter-checking, revealed any error.  I do not think it would be possible to give the details for which Deputy Davin asked.  Neither do I think that we ought to make any point, as he did, of the fact that a number of our people, who went abroad, volunteered.  What they did they did as private individuals.  As far as this State is concerned, this State was neutral.  It was so deliberately, and it stands by that now just as it stood then; and we are not now going to pretend that we were other than neutral.  I do not think there are any other matters to which I need refer.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach intimated that he had certain information with regard to the Conference of Prime Ministers held recently.  It was stated by that conference that certain principles of commercial and financial policy were decided which, to their mutual advantage, would guide the Governments of the various Commonwealth countries in the International Conference which is scheduled to take place soon in relation to trade and employment.  Has the Taoiseach information as to what these principles were; has he taken any action in respect of that matter; or has he made any observations upon it?</P>
