      <P>Enquiries which have been made by the Army appear to establish that the mine which exploded near the coast at Dalkey, County Dublin, on the 12th March was of British origin.</P>
      <P>The matter will be taken up with the British Government in the ordinary course with a view to obtaining the recoupment of the amount of any compensation which falls to be made out of State funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that holders of merchandise licences under the Road Traffic Act, 1932, are limited to carrying a maximum load of two and a quarter tons; if he is further aware that all new lorries put <Col N="3" /> on the road by Córas Iompair Éireann have a capacity of five tons, and that, owing to the larger capacity of their lorries, Córas Iompair Eireann are in a position to quote cheaper rates than merchandise licence holders in areas served by both, to the prejudice of the latter; and whether he will, in the circumstances, introduce legislation to enable the merchandise licence holders to carry increased tonnage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The first provisions for the issue of merchandise licences are contained in the Road Transport Act, 1933.  This Act provided for the issue of licences to existing carriers and limited the unladen weight of vehicles but imposed no conditions on carrying capacity.  The maximum unladen weight fixed for each licence was based on the unladen weight of vehicles used by hauliers prior to the introduction of the licensing scheme.  Increases were allowed in the unladen weight of vehicles operated by licensed hauliers in accordance with the terms of the Road Transport Acts, 1934 and 1935, and the Transport Act, 1944.</P>
      <P>I am informed that most of the lorries recently purchased by Córas Iompair Eireann have an unladen weight of about two and a half tons. It is not proposed to introduce legislation for the purpose suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the present rates of interest charged by building societies for house purchase loans range from 5 to 6 per cent.; and whether, in view of the excessive rates of interest charged, he will introduce appropriate legislation to deal with the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I decided some time ago to authorise the operation by Córas Iompair Éireann of special services by omnibus for private turf producers, but special tests undertaken by the company have disclosed that such a service to the Dublin Mountains is impracticable. These tests, which were carried out with the best type of bus available, revealed that the vehicle could not <Col N="5" /> develop the necessary climbing power and that abnormal risks would be involved in providing a public service. I am prepared, however, to consider proposals for alternative transport facilities by lorry for organised groups of turf workers.</P>

      <P>The total quantity of superphosphate manufactured to the end of February, 1946, from materials supplied and shipped by the British authorities is approximately 25,000 tons.  Licences have been granted for the export of 16,500 tons of this fertiliser to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The balance of the production, 8,500 tons, is retained for use here.  The quantity of superphosphate manufactured during the same period from materials other than those supplied by the British authorities amounted to approximately 31,000 tons.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (a) how many pig carcases have been condemned as unfit for human food during the 12 months ending December 31st, 1945; (b) whether any use was made of this condemned meat; (c) whether it is a fact that the blood from such pigs had been mixed with the blood from other animals for manufacture into foodstuffs for human beings before it was seen that the animals were diseased; and (d) whether it would be advisable to make regulations to prevent such occurrences in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is concerned only with the veterinary examination of pigs presented for examination under the Pigs and Bacon Acts, 1935 to 1940 and the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, 1930 to 1938.  During the 12 months ended the 31st December, 1945, the number of pig carcases rejected under the provisions of those Acts as unfit for human food was 691, equivalent to approximately 2 pigs per 1,000 examined.  The carcases so rejected were disposed of for industrial purposes or denatured and used as fertilisers.  There is no likelihood that the blood used for manufacture into human foodstuffs is a source of danger but the matter is being kept under observation.</P>

      <P>Following on the passing by the Dáil last year of a Supplementary Estimate to provide for the expenses incurred in connection with a scheme for the recognition by the State of acts of bravery a committee was set up to consider such cases as might arise and to advise as to the cases in which awards should be made. At the first formal meeting of the committee held on 15th January, 1946, it was recommended that legislation should be introduced to make the committee a statutory one and to authorise it to make awards.  It was pointed out that, in the absence of legislation, the awards would have no particular standing and that there would be no definite guarantee that the whole scheme might not be altered from time to time or even dropped altogether.</P>

      <P>The Emergency Powers (No. 169) Order, 1942, as amended, prohibits, except in certain specified circumstances, the cutting down or uprooting of, or the removal of branches from, any tree standing not more than 30 feet from the centre of any road.  The Order permits, however, the removal of branches in any case in which an owner or occupier of land is requested by a local authority, under sub-section <Col N="39" /> 34 (2) of the Local Government Act, 1925, to trim a roadside tree, on the ground that it is prejudical to the road. It also enables permission to be granted for the cutting down of a tree which, because of its age or condition, constitutes a danger to road traffic. No cases have come to my notice in which persons have been prosecuted by local authorities for failure to cut down trees, permission to fell which had been refused under the order.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any recent delays in postal deliveries in the Churchtown area.  On the contrary a revision of the delivery arrangements recently carried out whereby the office of delivery was changed from Dundrum to Rathmines has resulted in the morning delivery in the area being made approximately one-and-a-half hours earlier than formerly while the evening delivery is made nearly four hours earlier.  The collection arrangements have also been very much improved.</P>
      <P>The change of office of delivery has necessitated a change of postal address from Churchtown, Dundrum, County Dublin, to simply Churchtown, Dublin. All the residents of the area were advised of the change of address before the altered arrangements were brought into operation.  Some delay may be arising through the continued use of the old form of address and I take this further opportunity of drawing the attention of the residents to the need for using the correct postal address.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Costello I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 24 to delete the word &ldquo;whether&rdquo;, and in line 25 to delete the words &ldquo;before, on or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister understands our point of view, that the law can be made retrospective.  We all stand for making the people who have allotments under the Land Commission work their land properly.  We are all anxious to ensure that the people will work their land properly.  But we feel that we ought not to introduce any new provision and make it retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention of the Bill having retrospective action in so far as it will mean any punishment for what has been done in the past.  But, if I did accept this and the following amendment to the section, the Bill would be quite useless.  I am dealing with a number of tenants who are already in possession.  I have no intention of punishing them because of what they have done in the past. It is because I want to deal with them <Col N="42" /> in the future in case they transgress again that I must insist on including these particular words which these amendments propose to delete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be possible for the Minister to limit the period of time beyond which he will not go back to get after these delinquent tenants.  Under the Bill as it is framed, it would be possible for the Minister to go back indefinitely to any period.  He can appreciate that, because the Bill says any period before the passing of the Act.  The Minister says that he has to get after a certain class of tenants.  They probably came in within the past 20 years. Perhaps it would be possible to curtail the effect of the section if he would fix a date beyond which he would not go back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is right in saying that there is no intention of going back.  But we are putting in a new condition for people who have held land for a considerable time.  We are introducing a new condition into their agreement that was not there when the agreement was entered into.  Once that new condition is provided for in this Bill, the Minister is asking for power to dispossess them if they do not carry out the condition. That is the trouble.  We are imposing a new condition on the people which was not in the agreement at the time it was entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I read for the Deputy a few evenings ago the actual contract form made between the tenant and the Land Commission which shows that they did enter into this agreement under a section of the 1923 Act.  I said before that this is a limited evil. We have to deal with a certain limited section.  It is an evil, but it is limited.  I have no desire to pursue all the allottees of the Land Commission, even if it were advisable or possible.  There is, however, a certain limited number of tenants who are recent allottees.  They may go back as far as 15 years ago.  A great number of people got land in the past 15 years.  The majority of these have proved to be satisfactory allottees.  We <Col N="43" /> have, however, a limited number who have not carried out the terms of the contract entered into by them, which is logically derived from the 1923 Act. I do not wish to go back into anything they have done in the past.  What I want them to do is to act up to the terms of their contract in future.  If they do not do that, this Bill, when it becomes law, gives me power to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admitted on the last day when we were discussing this matter that he was putting in a new condition.  I think the records of the House will show that he admitted there is a new condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Perhaps I am not always quite clear on matters. But, again, I point out to Deputy Hughes, without making any debating point, that there is a section of the 1923 Act which sets out the conditions under which these allottees get their land.  I read for the Deputy the contract form which they entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to have two interpretations factually.  The difficulty about this is that legally there may be several interpretations.  It is to get at the actual facts of the matter rather than the legal interpretation that portions of the Bill are put in.  I want again to impress on Deputies that there is no intention of punishing these people for any action in the past.  Our whole purpose is to try to get them to fulfil their contract in future, a contract which is implicit in the 1923 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that once land is vested in the tenant the Land Commission have nothing more to do with him.  That is quite clear from all the operations of the Acts.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Costello I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 30, after the word &ldquo;parcel&rdquo;, to insert the words &ldquo;and stating briefly the grounds or facts on which such certificate is based&rdquo;, and in line 30 to delete the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; and insert the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; and to delete the words &ldquo;for all purposes&rdquo; in lines 30 and 31.</P>
      <P>This amendment is the same as the following amendment in my name and that of Deputy McMenamin, except that Deputy Costello seeks to have set out clearly on the certificate the facts on which the certificate is based.  I do not think the Minister could object to that.  If you propose to certify that a man is not using his land according to a proper system of husbandry, it is only right and proper that the grounds upon which the certificate is issued should be stated, that he is subletting or setting the land in conacre, as the case may be, so that the man may defend himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1923 Act, it is to the satisfaction of the Land Commission that the allottee must carry out his work.  If the Land Commission are not satisfied with the way in which an allottee has worked his lands, and so notifies the allottee, and if he makes no amendment of his ways, surely there should be no necessity to go into a long description as to the whys or wherefores.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated his acceptance of the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo;.  A man has to face a certain charge in court, and I submit that it is only fair that the allegations with regard to his failure to carry out his agreement should be clearly set out.  The Land Commission have to prove in court that he has failed to fulfil the terms of his contract if the certificate is to be accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence, and we suggest that the certificate should show where the man has failed.  If a man is setting his land in conacre, or making grass lettings, or doing anything other than carrying on a system of good husbandry, it should be set out on the certificate.  I cannot see what objection there could be to that.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will see the justice of it.  Any person who brings a charge against another has to specify the charge.  Can it not be easily specified in this case &mdash;whether he has refused to cultivate his land or to till the proper acreage assigned to him?  The Minister is aware that in a huge establishment like the Land Commission, with 300 estates vested in one office in a central place like Dublin, which has to operate exclusively through its officers, there are bound to be officers who are, perhaps, cranks, and who will differ in their opinions of what is and what is not proper husbandry.  Surely it is a simple matter, if one of the Land Commission officers makes a charge against A. B. that he is not working his farm on the basis of good husbandry, <Col N="46" /> to specify how and why he is not doing so.  It could be done in two or three lines, and we suggest that, when a man is being dispossessed, the charge against him should be specified. The Land Commission, as I say, must work through officers scattered all over the country, whose opinions on these matters will differ almost as much as day differs from night, and it would be very wise to get a detailed report from these men and to embody it in the charge.  Is that not a just arrangement?  We have no object other than to make this as workable as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The items in the contract are not so many that there need be any difficulty in understanding the charge.  An inspector makes an examination of a particular piece of land and reports on it.  Whether or not he is a crank does not arise, because it is not one inspector who makes the examination, but several inspectors, and all their examinations and reports have to be checked and rechecked by the senior inspectors before finally coming to the Land Commission, and it is only on the initiative of the Land Commission that any action is taken. We go into court and we offer our certificate as <i>prima facie</i> evidence on the question of a breach of the contract into which a man has entered.  He knows what his contract is.  It does not contain many clauses.  It is his job to prove that the evidence we offer to the court is untrue.  That seems to me to be the obligation of the allottee and not of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared at the moment to say that a certificate by the Minister merely thrown into court brings the matter into court at all.  My opinion would be that it does not.  If the offence is in the form of a statutory offence, in order to comply with the statute the charge will have to set forth the facts in respect of which the statute has been contravened. I am afraid the Minister will find that that is so, and that a district <Col N="47" /> justice would say: &ldquo;You have not brought yourself into court because a charge in relation to a statutory offence has to set forth the facts on which it is alleged there was a violation of the statute.&rdquo;  I feel that it should be quite unnecessary to plead this case, but I warn the Minister that, in my opinion, he will have to set forth the facts before he brings himself into court at all.  Would it not be wise to take that precaution here, by showing on the certificate how and why an allottee has failed to work his land according to a system of good husbandry? Why quarrel about a simple thing like that?</P>

He wanted to have set out in the certificate the grounds on which a charge is made. The Land Commission has to make a charge, and specify it, and prove in court where a man failed to carry out his agreement.  That has to be done, now that the Minister has accepted the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo;.  I do not see why the Minister should object to having the reason set out briefly on the certificate.</P>

      <P>The certificate as produced in court will be in general terms, that the holder has failed to work his farm in accordance with good husbandry. That is all the certificate will contain, according to Section 4.  But what Deputy Costello had in mind was that there will be at least five or six specific grounds upon which such a certificate may be made.  It may be a breach of the condition to reside on the farm, or of the condition prohibiting subletting in conacre, or so on. All he is asking is that, in addition to the general certificate, the specific breach of condition will be mentioned. <Col N="48" /> Then the aggrieved party would know straightway the case he has to meet, without having to consider any one of the number of cases he might have to meet in court.  I think it would help to shorten the proceedings if the Minister would agree to set out, in addition to the general terms, the specific breach complained of.  I do not see that there should be any objection to that course, which would make it clearer for both parties and help to shorten the proceedings.</P>

There is no intention of tricking these people in any way, no intention of keeping secret from them any piece of information which might be helpful to them.  The terms of their contract are not wide: they are clear and specific and there is no great difficulty in understanding them.  After long discussion with the leaders of the Opposition in conference, this question of the acceptance of the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; was urged on me and, after much misgiving, I accepted those words.  I have gone a long way from my original intention to seek very drastic powers to deal with this particular evil in the interests of individual liberty and democracy and I ought not be asked to go any further.  We are being quite fair to these people, giving them every opportunity, bringing them even into court as a last resort, and accepting even then the amendment of the Opposition moved on their behalf.

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the point I raised before.  In both the proceding sections there is a clause which ensures that the sections do not apply to vested land, but there is no such clause in this section.  There is no reference here to whether the land is vested or not.  I think that any court would assume that this section would apply to vested land, unless there is such a clause or phrase introduced.  In section 3 (b) you have the words &ldquo;the purchaser makes, on or after the operative date and before the holding or parcel is vested in him...&rdquo;, but there is no such phrase used in Section 4.

      <P>None of the provisions contained in this Act shall apply to a purchaser or allottee where the Land Commission has after a period of seven years failed to vest the holding or allotment in the purchaser.</P>
      <P>As far as I know, the Land Commission have promised to invest a holding in an allottee after a period of seven years.  It is generally understood that the probationary period is seven years.  The reason which prompted me to put down this amendment is that the Land Commission have failed to carry out their undertaking&mdash;a verbal one, I admit&mdash;to do so.  Because of the shocking condition of the Land Commission as far as vesting is concerned, I say that, if they are going to pillory an individual for failure to carry out an agreement, there is no reason why this House should allow the Land Commission to go scot free where they have failed to carry out their promise to vest.  In the case even of a verbal promise of that sort which has not been fulfilled, the allottees who have held land over seven years should not come under the provisions of this Bill.</P>

There is a belief among these people who do not wish to carry out their duties on the land that if they can hold the land for seven years they will be automatically vested and then they will have an opportunity of cashing-in on the land.  It is that particular thing that the section is meant to deal with.  Many of the people with whom we wish to deal under the Bill are people who have been more than seven years on the land and they have remained unvested, and they must remain unvested, because they are not carrying out the terms of their contract. I must oppose this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that vesting is a very slow process. What should be slow about it in the case of land given to allottees?  All the inspections and all the engineering works have been done already by the Land Commission before they take over possession from the person from whom they acquired the land.  It is only a question of giving a certain number of acres to an allottee.  All the engineering problems already have been disposed of.  Is that not the practice?  The Land Commission have had a good deal of experience in the administration of these matters and I think that where a good allottee is selected and where he carries on satisfactorily for a period of five or six or seven years&mdash;the period should be fairly short&mdash;then at the earliest moment the holding should be vested in him in order to give him that confidence that a person who occupies land should have.  Once the holding is vested in him, he and his family will be in a position to buckle into it, make a good job of it, drain it and improve it in various ways.  By the force of his work and ability, and with plenty of farmyard manure, he will be laying the foundation of a good, prosperous home. Where that can be done, it ought to be done at the earliest moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> This practice of holding on to land for a number of years is bad in principle.  It is a wrong procedure, in my opinion.  I would rather see a provision inserted so that where allottees are found to be bad tenants, even after the holdings are vested in them, they should be put out, than that they should be allowed to block the progress of good tenants, good men and women, with their sons and daughters, who are glad to get land and glad to have an opportunity of improving it.  Those people who prove they are worthy of getting a holding and who make a good job of it and make a decent livelihood out of it, should be encouraged.  The sooner these people are firmly planted on the land the better for themselves and the better for the State.</P>
    <P>We should like to have the Minister's views on this matter.  Is he going to hold up all the good people who want to be firmly established on the land, simply because there are numbers of people, limited numbers, who are only anxious to get land with the intention, the moment they get it, that they will sell it and make money?  I would prefer if we prepared some machinery adequate to deal with such people at any period sooner than that we should keep in mid-air, as it were, for a long number of years, the good people, the people who are good from the point of view of being deserving allottees.  I think it would be unfortunate to vest the land in those who have no intention of making a good job of it.  Such a practice would not, in my opinion, tend to achieve the end that we all have in view when we are imposing taxation in order to provide land for these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment raises a very important point.  There was a general assumption, if there was not a definite agreement, that land would be vested in an allottee after seven years.  The allottee who took land from the Land Commission on the assumption that it would be vested in him after seven years must have a very definite grievance if that is not done. In addition to that, the position in regard to the future will require to be cleared up because if, as the Minister <Col N="53" /> says, it is now the policy of the Land Commission not to vest land and to hold that refusal to vest land as a kind of threat over the heads of allottees, I think a very irregular position will arise.  It may happen that some people will secure the vesting of their land after seven years, as they did in the past, and others may be victimised. There must be one law for everybody. We cannot have one allottee coming in on a holding and, because he is able to pull strings, getting that holding vested inside seven years, while another allottee may be kept hanging on for 20 or 25 years.</P>

      <P>That is a very important point.

There is a very big principle involved there, because you are defeating the whole object achieved by the acceptance of Deputy Hughes' amendment.  You are giving an additional power to the Land Commission which, heretofore, it was generally assumed they did not possess; that is, the power to hold up the vesting of land indefinitely, or until they were satisfied with the allottee, and, on the other hand, they could at any time, as they did in the past, vest land in people who had no intention of working it, but merely got it in order to sell it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I came into this House I have protested on every occasion against this rule of vesting land after a period of seven years.  Since the Land Commission started operations&mdash;I dealt with this on the Second Reading&mdash;all over the Midlands there were farms given to people who never put a goat on them and never tilled an acre.  These people let their lands all the time.  Unfortunately, in Meath, Westmeath and Longford, these farms were vested in these people, and in many instances the moment they were vested they were sold again, and new ranches were created.  In my opinion, <Col N="54" /> there should not be vesting for at least 20 years, or until such time as the incoming tenant has proved himself a good farmer, a man capable of carrying on good husbandry.  I am against this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>When I submitted this amendment I merely wanted to get the Minister's views.  I do not agree with Deputy Kennedy's viewpoint.  I think a period of seven years ought to be quite sufficient.  If a man is put on trial, the Land Commission ought to be capable of determining in a period of seven years if he is a fit and proper person to own that parcel of land. This Party does not stand for putting people into holdings if they are not capable of working them properly.  We do not approve of putting in people who will abuse the land.  We are all for efficiency on the land and for justice and fair play in the matter of selecting tenants.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of this matter that Deputy Kennedy overlooks.  As the Minister says, they are not all bad tenants.  The men who have proved worthy of getting a holding, the men who have proved themselves entitled to become the owners of their parcels of land, who are quite prepared to borrow, if necessary, in order to improve their holdings, should receive every encouragement.  I do not propose to press the amendment.  I merely put it down for the purpose of drawing the Minister, as it were, so that he may give the House his views on the subject of vesting.  It is a very big problem, and it wants to be handled carefully.  Whatever vesting has been done in the country, it has been well done, but surely there is no excuse for expediting vesting in the case of failures?  There is a big number of people, apart from allottees, who are not vested, and that problem has been hanging over for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think the Minister was going to deny that verbal understanding to which reference was made.  I will not say there was a promise or an undertaking, but anyway there was an understanding generally given when an estate was divided that allottees might expect to have their parcels vested at the end of seven years.  Instead of denying that, I thought the Minister <Col N="55" /> might tell us what the problem was, so far as vesting is concerned; that he might give some undertaking to the House to have the whole question of the vesting of a very big number of people expedited, and that he intended to provide the necessary machinery to do that within a reasonable period.</P>

      <P>I cannot account for the sense of humour of the Deputy. The Land Commission is quite alive to the necessity of swift vesting, and there was a special section set up in recent years for the purpose of dealing with vesting.  It must be remembered that during the past six years it was impossible to do anything, because most of our inspectors were with other Departments during the war.  Even though Deputy McMenamin thinks it a very simple matter, it is far from being simple.  There has to be a complete examination of every piece of land before it can be vested.  As Deputies know, nothing is so litigious as the question of tenure.  The Land Commission has set up a special section which is working solely on the question of vesting.  Deputies can be sure about this, that vesting is taken in order.  No particular allottee is taken out of the line of order, except to some extent.</P>

      <P>Vesting will be carried out definitely and in due order.  Cases will not be taken out of their due order for anybody.  Deputies from every Party have approached me and asked me to take particular cases out of order.  Recently Deputies from a number of Parties came to me about the vesting of one particular allottee on an estate, and I told them that it could not be done.  They came back a week later and told me that two neighbouring allottees had in the meantime been vested, without having asked.  It seems to me that the Land Commission knew a great deal more about vesting on that estate than the Deputies who came to ask about having the other man vested. A man may be in a holding seven years under present conditions without being vested.  Because of our difficulty with the law in getting the question of fact decided we have been unable to get rid of men, even though they let the land, did not live in the houses and did not do a stroke of work.  That type is hopeful that after seven years the Land Commission will vest the holding and then, as Deputy Cogan knows, the Land Commission will have no further control and they may sell the land.  Deputy McMenamin, while, on the one hand, he is completely at one with us in desiring to deal with intransigent tenants, on the other hand, is trying to prove that these are worthy people who are adversely affected by an act of the Land Commission.  This Bill is intended to deal with people who have broken their contract.  It is not intended as a punishment.  All it asks is that they should go along the right road in future.  We want power from the Dáil to deal with that position.  The question of vesting is a slow process, but it has been very much speeded up in the last 12 months and will, I believe, be speeded up more in future, particularly for people who will not be bringing in Deputies to ask the Land Commission, for ulterior motives, to have them vested.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to be shifting between two grounds.  He is claiming first that he will refuse to vest any land where the tenant has not done his work satisfactorily, and he is defending himself also on the ground that vesting is a tedious process.  I think the Minister should come down on one side of the fence or the other. If he takes his stand on the ground that vesting is so tedious and that there are probably greater delays on some estates than on others, there may be a great deal of justice in that, as between one allottee and another.  An allottee who is, probably, unsatisfactory may succeed in getting his land vested, and thus escape completely from the control of the Land Commission, but another allottee, because of legal difficulties, may fail to have his land vested, and he is, therefore, penalised while his neighbour escapes simply through a fluke, so to speak, in legislation. The whole matter should be cleared up and there should be a definite form of vesting.  If the Minister desires a probationary period there ought to be a probationary period for allottees.  Let us not have one law for one allottee and another law for another allottee.  I know estates on which some holdings have been vested while others have not.  There does not seem to be any reason for such a distinction. I think it is three years since some of these holdings were vested but the remainder have not yet been vested.  It seems peculiar that the legal difficulties cannot be got over.</P>

      <P>I never knew of an allottee in the Midlands who went to live in the house that was built for him and who had live stock on the holding, who refused to work the land.  It is a wrong contention to suggest that there are any penalties imposed.  I do not see where any wrong has been done to these tenants.</P>

      <P>I intend to support the amendment.  I am one of the few materially concerned with vesting.  I am on a farm on an estate in County Meath and after 20 years there is no sign of its being vested.  The Minister stated that these cases were taken in <Col N="58" /> rotation.  I should like to be clear if that means that it will take 20 years to vest land.  The allottees on the estate I refer to are good allottees, men who are doing well.  I know that if allottees go to a bank, the fact that they are not vested tells against them, as they will not get an advance to work their holdings.</P>
      <P>Many small farmers, including myself, are anxious to acquire land when four or five or ten acres are put up for sale, adjacent to our holdings.  We find that we cannot go to the bank and get the money.  We have to let these small farms go for want of credit.  I do agree that there should be a fixed period and I think seven or eight years is long enough.  The Minister will know whether a man is bad or good after seven years.  Deputy Kennedy said he would not vest within a period of 20 years.  If he were in the same position as I am, he would be glad to seek the ear of the Minister and try to have the land vested.  I think it should be done because, if land is not vested for 20 years, it means that very little improvement will be made in it. From the moment the land is vested, the owner is a free man with title to his holding and can go to the bank and get credit.  A man on a small holding requires credit and he must have a title to his holding in order to secure credit.  It is the ambition of every ordinary man to make reasonable progress and to extend his holding, if at all possible.  In my case I cannot do that.  I have been waiting 20 years for vesting and I work my land at all times in perfect husbandry.  Every inspector of the Land Commission who has called on me has said it is one of the best worked holdings, not only in Meath, but in Ireland.  That is not just boasting.  I am in the happy position that I like work and I work hard and have a good holding.  The Minister said they are being taken in rotation. There must be something wrong, if any vesting has been done for the last 20 years, that we are being left in the lurch.  Deputy Kennedy said that bad tenants should not be vested.  My opinion is that tenants, bad or good, should be vested after seven years. If the land is not taken from them it should be vested and let them sell it.</P>

If a man has had the holding for ten years, whether he is good or bad, it should be vested in him and let him sell it and get out and let a good man into it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gile's statements have induced me to speak on this matter.  If the Minister takes the advice that people who get land from the State, whether they make a success of it or not, should have the land vested in them and should be given power to sell that land, which means giving them a present of £300 or £400, or sometimes £700, at the cost of the State, he will be doing the worst thing he ever did in his life.  I come from the West of Ireland where, naturally, land division is a very important subject. It is a matter of regret to see some of the people who get a holding or an addition to their holding and who do not make good use of it when you consider that, because of the scarcity of land, people who would work it cannot get it.  It would be disgraceful to allow the vesting of land in these people who will not work it and to allow them to do what they like with the land, perhaps to sell it and then to look for land again.  I have known cases like that.  They have the cheek to come along and approach the Land Commission again.  I know a case where it was successful, where they got land again.  That case, of course, was the exception.  It is my view that people who got land got it at the expense of this State.  They got a present of it.  They got it on condition that they would work it well for their own benefit and for the benefit of the State and, after a certain number of years, if they do not prove successful, the <Col N="60" /> land should be taken from them and given to people who would work it for the benefit of themselves and of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already explained, I put down this amendment for the purpose of getting the Minister's views on this question of vesting.  I am surprised at Deputy Kennedy.  In this country we set a very high value on the right of ownership.  Our land system is different from that of most other countries.  We appreciate that the British system and the Scottish system are completely different from ours.  The fight that was fought by the people who went before us for the right of ownership in this country has enhanced the value of land.  I do not know whether it has been advantageous in the long run or not.  There may be differences of opinion on that.  The Irish farmer feels, however, that he has a right to own his land and I think that is a fair claim.  I am in entire agreement with the Minister and with those Deputies who have expressed the view that it is not in the national interest to settle on land people who are unsuitable and who will not work the land efficiently and according to methods of good husbandry.  We cannot afford that sort of thing.  I submit that the man who has proved efficient and who has made good is entitled to his own land and, until he owns his land, he is not sure whether he is justified in spending money on it and improving it generally.  Once he can claim ownership, it is an inducement to him to spend money and, because it is his own property, he can raise capital on it, if necessary, wherewith to improve the holding.  That is an important matter.  The Minister has admitted it.  I think the Minister appreciates the necessity of pressing forward the whole question of vesting. The Ceann Comhairle has very <Col N="61" /> generously permitted us to wander a little outside the amendment.</P>

Whatever we do, the Minister has denied up to this that he had any intention to make this measure retrospective in effect.  In regard to this particular section he cannot deny that he is trying to make it retrospective. I appeal to his sense of fair play. This sub-section can only affect very few cases and is it worth while, I put it to him, in the case of the very few that may be affected, to make the section retrospective?</P>

      <P>There is more than that in it.  Take the principle of devolution. Sub-section (2) refers back to agreements and undertakings to purchase parcels of untenanted land <Col N="62" /> made and deaths which occurred before the passing of this Act.  I have in mind disposition of land that may have been made, say, by a widow, under the Intestate Estates Act, or an heir-in-law and I am not clear at all in my mind as to what the effect of this retrospective provision in sub-section (2) will be in relation to such dispositions.  There may not be a great number of cases but it is quite on the cards that certain Acts now may be reviewed in the light of this sub-section and that dispositions which were lawful when made may become unlawful as a result of this provision. I should like to hear more from the Minister as to what particular cases they had in mind because you are equating now the position of these people to that of tenant purchasers under Part IV of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, and the descent will be to the personal representative, as if the land were a chattel real.  I am afraid that sub-section (2) may create a certain amount of confusion because of its retrospective effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the devolution of parcels on the death of allottees.  It is intended to remove a doubt which the lawyers believe to exist in connection with the devolution of certain parcels of land allotted by the Land Commission.  The doubt exists only in regard to parcels which at the date of allotment were not registered in the Land Registry and, therefore, not subject to the provisions of Part IV of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, regarding devolution.  The position is that, after vesting, all parcels, and, before vesting, those parcels which at the time of allotment are subject to the provisions of Part IV of the 1891 Act, devolve, as it is technically termed, as chattels real, that is they pass on the allottee's death to his personal representative for, broadly speaking, the benefit of the next of kin if the allottee died intestate, or for the benefit of the devisee if the allottee died testate.  Section 5 is designed to ensure that the remaining parcels (i.e., those not subject to Part IV at <Col N="63" /> the time of allotment) shall devolve in the same way.  The Land Commission have in fact so far regarded these parcels as so devolving.  Section 32 (4) of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1896, was enacted to rectify an anomaly of an analogous nature in relation to purchasing tenants.</P>
      <P>The clause will ensure that the Land Commission are satisfied as to their powers to appoint limited administrators in respect of all classes of deceased purchasers and to deal with such administrators as entitled to the interest of the deceased purchasers and to vest the parcels in such administrators. As very many parcels have been vested in personal representatives sub-section (2) makes this section retrospective for the validation of such of those vestings as would come within the doubtful category mentioned.  Deputy Hughes has, however, suggested the deletion of sub-section (2) altogether and Deputy Costello advocates the deletion in sub-section (2), line 42, of all words after the word &ldquo;occurred&rdquo; down to and including the word &ldquo;occurring&rdquo; in line 45.  Both of these amendments have the same aim&mdash;to render inoperative the retrospective effect of the section.  Their belief apparently is that the sub-section may upset past titles.  So far as the Land Commission are aware the devolution of parcels of unregistered land on the personal representatives of deceased allottees has never up to recently been questioned by anyone and the commission have acted on the assumption that these parcels of unregistered land did so descend; so far from unsettling past titles, the section would settle and confirm them.  The point at issue is purely a legal one and the Land Commission are acting on legal advice and are satisfied that no person will be damnified by the provisions of the section.  It is a legal matter which I cannot explain any better, but it really is for the protection of the occupier, his heirs and successors.</P>

      <P>There is on the paper an amendment by Deputy Dillon with which perhaps I had better deal now.  It is not in order and I want to explain in case it might be of some importance on other occasions. There is no provision in the procedure of the Dáil for an amendment of this <Col N="66" /> kind to a motion for a Money Resolution. Standing Orders provide specifically for this form of reasoned or procrastinating amendment in regard to proposed legislation only on the Second Reading of Bills.  The Chair holds, and must hold, that the specific provision referred to exhausts the opportunities for such a proposal.  The Chair furthermore in regard to the drafting of motions for Money Resolutions must have advertence to their sole function, namely, the authorisation of expenditure. Such motions should be drawn in stereotyped form and should not contain, either as originally moved or by way of amendment, arguments or other considerations.</P>
      <P>There are a few other points to which it might not be amiss to draw attention.  The habit has grown up of treating a Money Resolution as an opportunity of repeating the Second Stage debate.  The purpose of a Money Resolution in the Dáil's legislative procedure is to enable the Exchequer expenses involved in a Bill's proposals to be considered, apart from the proposals themselves, under financial procedure conditions.  The debate on a Money Resolution, therefore, should not be a repeat of the debate on the main principles which are decided on the Second Stage, nor an anticipation of the details which come out in Committee. It is difficult to define what exactly is in order on a Money Resolution, but I think the House would agree that a repeat of the Second Stage debate or an anticipation of the Committee Stage is scarcely in order.</P>

      <P>A position has gradually grown up in which a very substantial part of the cost of Government is, through legislation passed here, being shifted over from the taxpayer as such to the ratepayer as such, who is largely the same person, but there is a tendency to forget the ratepayer while arguing here about the <Col N="68" /> interests of the taxpayer.  I should like to give three or four figures to indicate the position which has grown up in relation to the ratepayer.  In the year ended March, 1927, before the Government Party came into the Oireachtas, the total amount of money raised by rates in rural districts was £3,286,000. That has fallen, by March, 1932, to £2,445,000 and had risen by March, 1943, to £4,302,000.  The total amount of rates collected from the ratepayers of both rural and urban areas in the year ended March, 1927, was £5,223,000.  That was the amount collected in the year before the Government Party came into the Oireachtas.  In the year ended March, 1932&mdash;the year before they came into Government&mdash;that amount had fallen to £4,677,000 and for the year ended March, 1943&mdash;the last year for which figures are available in the Report of the Department of Local Government &mdash;the rates collected went up to £7,814,000.  It is because that amount was collected in the year ended March, 1943, that we are so concerned to know now, before we enter on the discussion of this measure, what effect the passing of it into law will have on the rural and urban ratepayer.</P>

      <P>It is ridiculous that the House should enter on the Committee discussion of this measure and that we should pass something called a Money Resolution, without knowing in round figures what the Bill will cost the ratepayer and the taxpayer, as well as what it will cost in respect of additions to the Minister's Department to assist in administering it.  I suggest that the cost of these additions may be very small compared with the total cost, and, in the light of the figures I have quoted, showing that increases of rates arise from the fact that we are passing legislation here and shoving over the cost of it on to the people as rates, we ought, in relation to this measure which is an outstanding example of how this House is passing burdens over to the ratepayers, to have an answer to the question I put.  In addition, we should get some idea from the Parliamentary Secretary as to how it is going to affect the taxpayer, both in putting the Bill into operation and in administering it.</P>

Such an approximate estimate would help us in considering whether we should accept or reject certain sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to say how much of the proposed charges would be devoted to the nursing service, and if he could estimate how many nurses he intends to employ under this Bill.  Last year, on the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Bill, the question arose concerning deficits of the voluntary hospitals. On that occasion, the Parliamentary Secretary said that when the voluntary hospitals treated patients from the country, the local authorities concerned paid the cost of upkeep and maintenance of those patients.  As I understand the position in Dublin, the <Col N="70" /> amount paid by the local authorities does not meet the full cost of the patients, and the balance has to be met either from Hospitals Trust funds or from any voluntary subscriptions that may be available.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary can say, in view of the imposition he is requesting the Dublin Corporation to put on the rates, 1/- in the £ to deal with public health matters, what the future imposition is likely to be under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Also, perhaps he could say whether that will increase substantially, and, if so, whether in the case of patients sent to Dublin by local authorities throughout the country for specified treatment or for particular operations, the full cost of those patients will be discharged by the local authorities; or whether portion of that cost will be borne by the ratepayers of Dublin.  As far as I can see, Dublin is at the moment a haven of rest, not alone for many people from rural Ireland, but for a number of aliens also.  The increased burden on the ratepayers of Dublin, due to the maintenance of some of those people in hospitals, is bound to be very considerable.  They will have already an advance instalment of 1/- in the £, which it is proposed to put on the rates for the coming year.  If many sections of this Bill are enacted, that burden will be increased considerably.  It is desirable that the Parliamentary Secretary should say, approximately, at any rate, what the future cost of public health is likely to be, if the provisions of this Bill are enacted as they stand at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises here, as, if the voluntary services are to be taken over, it will impose an increased charge on local rates.  Throughout this Bill we have powers being handed to the Minister to order such institutions and <Col N="71" /> services to be imposed on local authorities, and that, undoubtedly, will lead to a charge on the rates. There is some anxiety in various parts of the country where voluntary nursing has been established as to the future of these services.  They are at present conducted on a voluntary basis, as the organisation finds about three-quarters of the expenditure and public funds find a quarter.  If these services are to be taken over, that 75 per cent. will fall on the local rates.  It might help to allay a certain amount of anxiety throughout the country if the Parliamentary Secretary would clear the public mind, in relation to this public service, as to the Ministerial intention. Is it proposed to absorb them, now or in the near or distant future, into local government services proper, or is it intended to let them function, as at present, as voluntary services?</P>
      <P>Another matter which indirectly arises here is the extra duties which will be imposed on dispensary medical officers who will become, by virtue of this Bill, district public health officers. These officers will, as far as I can see, have a multitude of new duties to perform and I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is intended that these duties would be performed within the salary and emoluments they are at present receiving, or whether it is intended to give them extra remuneration for the purpose of any extra duties which may be imposed on them under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I want to support the plea put forward by Deputy Mulcahy and previous speakers, that we should have some indication from the Parliamentary Secretary of the total cost to the community of these new services.  We would like to know the cost to central taxation and some indication of the likely increase in local taxation.  There are indications that the Ministerial policy henceforth will be to divert as much as possible from central taxation on to local authorities.  Indications of that development are already there this year in many counties.  It is particularly noticeable in the case of the Dublin Corporation.  Is it intended that that tendency will develop and that rates will be allowed to grow to <Col N="72" /> any extent, just because the Department or the Government may see fit to impose that charge on the local community?</P>
    <P>Quite recently, on the 6th of this month, we had an article in the Government organ, more or less pooh-poohing the idea that there should be any increase in rates and saying that the only persons who complained of increases were what the leader described as substantial ratepayers. It is not the substantial ratepayers who will have to find the money for this Bill, but the local middleman, who finds himself ground between the upper and nether millstones, the man of fixed income, who finds it hard to carry on if he has to pay an extra £5 or £10 every year.  An extra jump of £10 may seem nothing to the Minister, but to the middleman it is a big thing when it has to be paid.  There is every reason to believe that the Minister intends to throw all the cost of the extra public health services on to local rates, without any idea being given to this House as to the ultimate limit.  In the case of our own local authority in Dún Laoghaire, we will eventually have to find a rate of not less than 30/- in the £, and I would say we will have to find that sum within the next five years, if not sooner.  Our rates are up by 2/- in the £ this year, without taking into consideration the charges that this Bill may impose upon us.  In our case, I have no doubt if a charge such as has been imposed on Dublin is made on us, it will ultimately mean another 1/- to 2/- in the £.  We are entitled to know what is the ultimate limit of expenditure likely to be imposed on the local rates and the ultimate limit likely to be found from central taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, with the last speaker, to know if we could get even an estimate of the cost of the legislation which we are now being asked to pass in connection with public health.  I think the House ought to keep in mind that we have been told that this is merely the first of a series of Bills that will be introduced, dealing with public health.  I think the least the House is entitled to be told, and <Col N="73" /> the country to know, is what this is going to cost.  Surely, this legislation has not been embarked upon by the Department of Local Government without some effort being made to arrive even at an approximate estimate of the cost?  There is a general sort of&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;looseness in connection with this whole question of public health, and the statements made by various Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are so conflicting that, far from giving us any enlightenment, they merely serve to confuse not only members of the House, but people through the country.</P>
      <P>I should like to know to what extent the costs arising under this Bill are tied up in the £24,000,000 for public health and public assistance institutions, about which the Parliamentary Secretary has already told us.  I understood it was £14,000,000 for public health and £10,000,000 for public assistance hospitals or institutions, or whatever they are called.  In any case, is the cost of this measure, both to the central authority and the local authorities, covered in the £24,000,000?  If it is, then we ought to be told what proportion of the £24,000,000 will go towards putting into operation what is set out in this Bill.  I may say that £24,000,000 is, for this State, an immense sum; it is equivalent to £8 per head of the population.  When we are informed that the measure which we are now about to discuss in Committee is only an instalment of the measures which are to be introduced at a later stage, or at later stages, to deal with public health, then it is essential &mdash;I think it is absolutely an obligation on the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;that he should be able to tell the House how much money he requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before us merely asks the House to give a completely blank cheque to the Department of Local Government.  I do not know whether it has been referred to by previous speakers on this motion, but, if it has not, I should like to remind Deputies that the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan's scheme was condemned immediately, and the only real objection to his scheme was that he had given no indication <Col N="74" /> of the cost, that he had not gone to the trouble to ascertain the cost and, therefore, in the words of the Minister, it was an ill-considered scheme.  Can we apply the same test to this Bill?  I want to be satisfied, first, about the amount of money we are being asked to vote and, second, that we will get value for the amount we are asked to vote.  Frankly, I do not believe we are going to get value for it, because I believe we are beginning at the wrong end.  There is no money being spent to prevent disease, to prevent sickness, to sustain and maintain public health.  This money which we are being asked to vote is to cure a situation, or to cure the result of a situation, that we are not facing up to or trying to deal with.  Unless we face up to what is causing disease, causing sickness in this country, all the money&mdash;even the £24,000,000 &mdash;that we may spend on the curing of it, will not give us the results that we should get.</P>
    <P>However, I do not want to develop that angle.  We are embarking on a completely new code of legislation to deal with public health.  We are going to great extremes if this Bill becomes law in its present form.  We have been asked to vote money to enable the central and local authorities, and the officials of the central and local authorities, to do things which it is very doubtful they should be allowed to do. I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary a statement as to the amount he wants voted by the House under this motion.  I do not think the House will be satisfied if he refuses or says he is unwilling or unable to give that information.  We must assume that the figure already given by the Parliamentary Secretary, namely, £24,000,000, was given publicity only after it had been carefully and fully considered.  I take it that is the total sum to meet all the activities contemplated under the public health system or in relation to any legislation which may be passed, and that total was arrived at, I presume, after totting up the cost of the various branches of that public health activity.  Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary must have at his disposal what it will cost to put the machinery of this Bill into operation. <Col N="75" /> At any time that is an essential requirement.</P>
    <P>I think the fact is that a very substantial portion of what we must only guess at as being a very large sum will be put on top of the local authorities, and the local authorities will have no say as to whether the obligation put on them is going to result in an increase of one penny, one shilling, or one pound in the rates. That is a matter which will be determined without any reference whatever to the local authority, or without the local authority having any power to say whether the sum is reasonable or extravagant. I do not think in putting these points, and in asking for this information, this House is asking for too much. It is merely asking for what it is in duty bound to ask, so that it may know what this particular legislation is going to cost the community.  I do not think the House would be justified in giving a blank cheque to the Parliamentary Secretary or to any Minister or Department.  I do not think any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary would be doing his duty if he came before this House, asking for legislation, and asking for money to implement that legislation, if he was unable or unwilling to give the House the information it required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made to this code of public health but, as far as I am concerned, I am very much in the dark as to what it is going to do.  Although figures have been mentioned, it seems that what we have to do is to relate the motion we are discussing to the Bill, when it is passed.  We have to regard any expenditure of money that we are called upon to make in connection with the administration of the Bill, in relation to what it is proposed to achieve under the Public Health Bill. I do not want to trespass on the proposals in the Public Health Bill which, I think, is going to have a very limited scope as far as it affects public health, but, in fairness to those who may anticipate such a discussion, the Parliamentary Secretary should, in the first place, give some indication, say, <Col N="76" /> in round figures, of what it is proposed the Central Fund shall contribute on administration.  In view of the powers taken by the Minister, these administrative powers will largely determine the extent to which the Bill will be given effect.  Secondly, he might say the amount which the Exchequer will contribute toward carrying out the provisions of the Bill; and, thirdly, he might give some general indication of the additional burden that is going to be placed on local authorities.  Unless we have some general financial knowledge in these respects, it would be very difficult for Deputies to treat impartially the provisions of the Bill that will have to be discussed on the Committee Stage.  We have to relate what we are going to ensure for the public, in the way of improving health, to the amount of money we have to spend on administration, as well as to the amount we are prepared to contribute and what we will require local authorities to contribute when deciding the future of this public health code. While I generally support the principle of the Bill, although I recognise its limitations, I feel that, to a large extent, its success will be measured by what the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us concerning the amount of money that will be spent on its administration and the amount that will have to be contributed by local authorities to give it effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scarcely possible to comply with the wishes of Deputies who have spoken on this motion and, at the same time, to obey the ruling of the Chair.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled that it would not be in order to discuss on this motion items of expenditure that may arise under various sections of the Bill, other than the administrative expenses contemplated within the terms of the motion.  In so far as I have any information or figures at my disposal, I have no reluctance at all to tell the House what the indications are, subject to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle being more lenient than the Ceann Comhairle while he was in the Chair. Deputies will appreciate that any figures that we can discuss, arising out of the services contemplated in this <Col N="77" /> Bill, when it becomes an Act, must be mere estimates.  The biggest item of expenditure under this Bill when it becomes law&mdash;if it will ever become law&mdash;will, of course, arise under the section that will provide the necessary machinery to establish the mother and child service to which I referred on Second Reading.  It is scarcely necessary at this stage to deal with that service in any great detail.  Speaking in general terms, it is proposed that a full medical service will be provided for expectant and nursing mothers and for children up to 16 years of age.  As to the extent to which that service will be availed of, and as to the increased financial burden that will arise under the heading of medicines, appliances, institutional accommodation, dental treatment and ophthalmic treatment it is just impossible to put a firm figure before the House.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned already, it is proposed to provide a domiciliary nursing service, to appoint in each dispensary district a general trained nurse, who will devote the whole of her time to assisting in school medical inspection work, and domiciliary service, arising out of the mother and child scheme.  There will be, approximately, 750 districts.  It is proposed to have a whole-time maternity nurse in each district.  We have, for all practical purposes, the necessary personnel of the maternity service, but they are part-time. If, as is proposed when this Bill becomes law, we provide a full mother and child service, it is clear that we will require the whole-time services of a maternity nurse.  From the examination I have given the matter, with the assistance of my technical staff, I think it would be safe to assume that the mother and child service will cost in the neighbourhood of from £500,000 to £600,000 per annum.  While I mention that figure, as I already explained to the House, circumstances that obtain and operate make it utterly impossible to put a firm figure before the House, but I think it will be in the order of the figure I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Coogan who mentioned the question of salaries of dispensary medical officers arising out of the increased duties that will be imposed upon them.  There is not any <Col N="78" /> doubt that very serious additions to the duties of dispensary medical officers will arise under this Bill, at least, under the policy behind it, and it must be assumed that a reasonable increase in the remuneration of dispensary medical officers will have to be given.  On that matter discussions will naturally take place between representatives of the dispensary medical officers and representatives of the Ministry.  I have no doubt that the medical profession will be found reasonable in this matter and I hope that the medical profession will find the Ministry adopting a reasonable attitude also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, call it a promise or a gesture&mdash;an indication, anyhow, of an appreciation of the fact that some considerable increase in the salaries of dispensary doctors may be anticipated.  While I am engaged in the purely financial aspect of this discussion I might direct the attention of the House to the important fact&mdash;I mentioned it in the concluding statement on the Second Reading, if Deputies have not forgotten everything I said on that occasion&mdash;that the State will bear 50 per cent. of the cost of the mother-and-child scheme.  Therefore, it may be assumed that, if the all-in cost of the mother-and-child scheme is £500,000, £250,000 of that amount will come out of the Exchequer. Deputy Cosgrave talked about patients from the provinces not paying the full cost of their maintenance in the Dublin hospitals.  I do not know how he can relate the Money Resolution to the Dublin hospitals. At any rate, I am not very particular on that point.  It would be <Col N="79" /> true to say that patients sent by local authorities for specialised treatment in the Dublin hospitals do not pay the full cost of maintenance or, it would be more accurate to say, the full cost of maintenance is not paid in respect of them.  At the same time, I fail to understand how the patients from the provinces come to be a burden on the ratepayers of Dublin.  I just have not been able to follow that line of reasoning, because the sum of £2 12s. 6d. per week is paid in respect of each patient from the provinces and in respect of the vast bulk of the patients from the City of Dublin there is nothing at all paid up to the present.  However, that position will be remedied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  We are getting into deep water now, and I think it is very far from the motion before the House.  At the present time the local authorities pay £2 12s. 6d. per week towards the maintenance of their patients in the voluntary hospitals in Dublin.  The shilling in the £ will not raise a sum equivalent to £2 12s. 6d. in respect of each patient from the City of Dublin who is maintained in a city hospital.  So long as the ratepayers of Dublin pay less towards the voluntary hospitals for the maintenance of their patients than the people from the provinces pay, I cannot see how it can be argued that the ratepayers of Dublin are paying anything towards the cost of maintenance of the patients from the provinces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as patients are being maintained at less than the cost of maintenance, in respect of every patient for whom the full cost is not being obtained, a certain element of deficit will arise but clearly a much bigger deficit will arise in respect of patients regarding whom nothing is paid than will arise in respect of patients regarding whom £2 12s. 6d. <Col N="80" /> per week is paid.  In fact, if £2 12s. 6d. per week were paid in respect of every patient maintained by the voluntary hospital, the deficit would be reduced to very small dimensions and would almost disappear.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan mentioned the question of the voluntary nursing services, and asked would they be taken over. The voluntary nursing services that operate at the present time only touch on the fringe of our nursing problem. Deputies will appreciate that it will be many years before the necessary nursing personnel will be available to man the local authorities' services.  If we require 700 general nurses for this mother-and-child service, clearly it will take quite a considerable time&mdash;a number of years, I am sure&mdash;to recruit the necessary staff.  In that way it can, at any rate with absolute safety, be assumed that the present nursing services will all be required.  Again expressing a personal opinion as to the ultimate position, it is this, that I believe that in many districts one nurse will not be sufficient.  I believe that we will require the services of these voluntary organisations in addition to the local authorities' services.  Experience alone will put us right on that.  It is one of those things in regard to which one opinion may be very much as good as another until we get actual experience of the work.  Clearly, the degree of poverty existing in an area will have a bearing upon it because in a very poor district, where not many people in the area will be economically in a position to pay for their own nursing services, the services of the public nurse will be very much in demand.  On the other hand, in a district where the people are substantially better off and a considerable proportion of them are able to engage their own nursing services, there will be less demand for the public nurse.  It is mainly, though not entirely, in the poorer areas and the congested districts that a voluntary organisation is required.  So far as personnel is concerned, there can be no doubt that we will require all the nurses that will be available in this country for quite a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey complained that no <Col N="81" /> money has been spent on the prevention of disease.  I can only say in reply to that that the main purpose of the development of the mother-and-child services, beginning at the pre-natal service and following the child through infancy and right through the school-going period, is to prevent disease, to try to anticipate disease, to try, if disease does make its appearance, to get abreast of it in the earlier stages before it has done irreparable damage and before you are presented with a position in which medical science is not able to effect a cure afterwards. Deputy Morrissey probably has in mind something wider than that in the line of prevention.  I am not going to be drawn into a discussion of that.  Probably he has in mind the economic conditions and the other ancillary matters closely related to health.  In this particular measure we have to confine ourselves as closely as possible to problems of health.  I do not think I can give the House much further assistance in the matter of finances.  These are the indications as clearly as I can put them before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary confined his attention to the mother-and-child service in so far as it involves an increase in the nursing service and dispensary medical officers. Throughout the Bill there are other points implying a very considerable increase in expenditure, capital and otherwise.  There is to be an increase in the number of institutions of various kinds throughout the country.  The Minister is taking sweeping powers to see that additional institutions are set up.  The Minister makes provision for the maintenance of families where infectious disease takes place.  In neither of these respects has the Parliamentary Secretary given us any idea as to the burden which will fall either on the taxpayer or on the rates.  I suggest that a comprehensive review of the expenditure likely to be incurred under this Bill is necessary.</P>

But, in accordance with the spirit of the Bill, which is to <Col N="82" /> prevent the spread of disease and to try to secure that disease shall be reduced to as low a point as possible, I put down an amendment to Section II.  Section II gives a kind of directive to the Minister, but says that all the pious directions given there shall only be exercised in so far as laws are passed to enable him to deal with these.  In order to round out the picture, I put down amendment No. 25 to that section, which says that it shall be the duty of the Minister to take such steps as he considers necessary to do certain things conducive to the health of the people, that there will be added to what is in the section an additional paragraph that it will be the duty of the Minister to secure the preparation and effective carrying out of measures affecting housing, feeding and employment in such a way that diseases arising out of economic conditions will be avoided.  There is no doubt that even in some official reports which we have had very serious circumstances have been disclosed in which a lack of employment and a lack of suitable housing are likely to be very great sources of disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be allowed to raise it on the section. Therefore, I think it is important that we should at least glance at the additional ground that has to be covered by the expenditure of money by local authorities and the Government if the health of the people is to be properly secured.  So much has to be done from the point of view of providing employment on the one hand and housing on the other which will fall as a burden on the rates and taxes, we should have a full picture, <Col N="83" /> including some kind of picture of the amount likely to be spent from a capital point of view on providing additional institutions and the normal annual expenditure in maintaining these institutions subsequently and in providing for the maintenance of families who, under Section 34, will have to be maintained by the local authority if infectious disease eats into their homes.</P>
      <P>In Appendix 9 of the Report of the Inquiry into the Housing of the Working Classes in the City of Dublin figures are given with regard to a survey which the corporation carried out in 1938 in respect of 11,000 houses, housing 33,000 families, with a population of 130,000 persons.  Taking at random 9,000 of these 33,000 families, they give particulars of the income of these families and what would be left for the payment of rent after mere subsistence had been provided for out of their wages.  Appendix 23 shows that, having examined these 9,000 families taken at random, in 30 per cent. of them, after making allowance for 20/- for the subsistence of the first two members and certain allowances for the others, there was nothing left to pay rent or for any other thing that a person would add to the expenditure after subsistence.  It shows that in the case of 7.4 per cent. they would only have 5/- per family left and, in the case of 8.6 per cent., they would only have 10/- left over the mere subsistence line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that there is a problem in relation to housing, in relation to the incidence of disease, and, perhaps, the incidence of infectious disease that implies both capital costs for housing falling on the local authority and maintenance costs falling on them under Section 34.  Therefore, I say that there are big problems involving the expenditure of money, both from rates and taxes, facing our people around the foundation of a public health policy in connection with homes and wages.  We cannot shut our eyes to these when considering this measure.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary has given us a very inadequate review of the headings under which the moneys are to be <Col N="84" /> spent, if the measure is passed, and the total amount of money likely to be spent.</P>

      <P>It is apparently worse than I thought.  I can assure you, Sir, that I have no intention at all of being out of order.  I want to say that I can only express the keenest disappointment with the Parliamentary Secretary's statement.  In effect, he gave us an approximate figure for one service with which it is proposed to deal in the Bill&mdash;a figure of £500,000, half of which will be met out of central funds and the other half placed on the local authorities.  But there are other provisions in the Bill which may call for enormous expenditure of money, and enormous expenditure of money by local authorities.  Let me take just one. I refer Deputies to sub-section (2) of Section 13.</P>

      <P>May I with all respect put this point?  A Money Resolution is required to give effect to the sections and without the Money Resolution the sections would be of <Col N="85" /> no use.  That is why, before we can proceed to discuss this Bill in Committee, the Parliamentary Secretary has to get authority to spend the money to make the sections workable. All I am asking is that the Parliamentary Secretary will indicate to the House how much money he wants us to vote.  I object to giving the Minister a blank cheque and I think the House has no right to give the Minister a blank cheque.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me quote sub-section (2) of Section 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A health authority shall provide and maintain any institution which the Minister, by Order, directs them to provide and maintain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies, and particularly those who are members of local authorities, to look, before they vote for this Money Resolution, at the potential dangers of that sub-section.  I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether any estimate has been made by his Department as to the institutions which will have to be erected or enlarged when this Bill becomes law, and what the cost of these new buildings or enlargements of present buildings will be.  That, I submit, with all respect, is perfectly relevant to the motion.  The only person who is out of order in this whole matter is the Parliamentary Secretary, because he refuses to give the House the information which I think the House must get before it can pass this Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that, if this Bill becomes law in its present form and is put into operation, we shall require to double or treble our present institutions.  It is a notorious fact that at the moment, without any of these coercive measures in operation, people who are not only willing but desperately anxious to go into institutions for treatment cannot get a bed.  It is notorious that people suffering from tuberculosis are left in their own homes because there are no institutions into which they can go for treatment, and that, if they do succeed in getting into one of the existing <Col N="86" /> institutions, the demand is so great that they can stay there for only a comparatively short time and are shifted out before there is time for any cure to become effective.</P>
    <P>What estimate has been made by the Department&mdash;and this is the information which the Parliamentary Secretary ought to be able to give the House, if this Bill has been properly and fully considered and if it is based on proper and accurate information&mdash;of the number of additional institutions and beds which will have to be provided to meet the requirements of the Bill if it is put into operation and what they will cost?  When we pass this Resolution, when this Bill becomes law and the oil for its machinery is provided by the passing of this Resolution, the Parliamentary Secretary may direct any local authority to provide as many institutions as he thinks are necessary and they must provide them forthwith, no matter what the cost and no matter what their own views may be.</P>
    <P>This is a measure of far-reaching importance. I do not know&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary may know&mdash;whether it will cost £2,000,000, £3,000,000, £4,000,000, £5,000,000 or £10,000,000 to implement it.  Neither, I venture to suggest, does any other member, and I think we are entitled to know, when voting for this motion, whether we are voting for an expenditure of £1,000,000, £10,000,000 or £20,000,000.  I am trying to argue&mdash;and I think I am arguing within the rules of order&mdash;that the House ought to get that information before agreeing to give the Parliamentary Secretary this Money Resolution. If we do not get that information, we can only conclude either that the Parliamentary Secretary is unwilling to give it or that this measure has been drafted and brought before the House without the Department, the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary having the slightest idea of what it will cost the community.</P>
    <P>This is a very important matter. Not only do we propose to impose financial obligations over which we shall have some control here so far as money from the Central Fund is concerned, but we propose to impose <Col N="87" /> enormous financial obligations on local authorities who will have no voice whatever in the matter.  It is we who are imposing these financial obligations on local authorities when we pass this Resolution, and this is the only place in which and the only time at which the matter can be questioned. I again appeal to members to insist on getting this information now, because now is the only time at which they can insist on getting it and now is the only time they will get the opportunity. If the Resolution is passed in its present form and without the giving of the information which we seek, we will oblige not only this Oireachtas but every local authority to put up whatever sum of money, without limit, the Department may decide is necessary to implement the legislation now before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

Does the Parliamentary Secretary refuse to give any further information on the matter, beyond what he has given in relation to one particular service?  I should like to be clear on that.  Are we to take it that the Parliamentary Secretary refuses to give the information as to what this Bill will cost?  Now we know where we are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a protest against the Parliamentary Secretary treating the House in this way.  Apparently, he proceeded in a reasonable kind of way to give a figure, as far as he could go, and no matter how we may be dissatisfied with his lack of information on the matter, we could understand his saying he knew very little about it.  We could accept the limitations of the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department in respect of a matter he was putting before the House.  However, in the <Col N="88" /> light of the terms of Section 13, where health authorities &ldquo;shall provide and maintain any institution which the Minister by Order directs them to provide and maintain&rdquo;, and particularly in the light of the statements he made to the Dublin Corporation recently, about the expenditure of £24,000,000 on additional hospitals and institutions and of £10,000,000 on public assistance and the subsequent information he gave us here that some of that would be put on the rates, some would be paid by the Government and some would come from the Hospitals Trust Funds, we would expect him to confirm some figure in relation to Section 13.</P>
      <P>When we consider the information we have had regarding the incidence of infectious disease, some kind of an estimate might have been made as to the cost of Section 34.  I quite agree that there is money needed to meet the type of payment contemplated under that section, that the number of cases of infectious disease which might have to be dealt with in hospitals may be very much greater in the future and that there may be a greater incidence of infectious disease, from the point of view of public knowledge, than there has been in the past.  It is absolutely unreasonable for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that he has no information to give in respect of Sections 13 or 34, that he is not going to tell the House, even if he has that information. I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that, in view of what is involved in this Bill, if he is going to meet the House in that spirit and is not going to give information, he is not serving the interests he suggests he is serving by the introduction of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Before the question is put, may I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the annual cost likely to fall on the Central Fund as a result of the passing of this Resolution is approximately a sum of £250,000, being 50 per cent.  of the estimated cost of £500,000 or £600,000 on the mother and child service, and if that is the annual cost which the taxpayers, as distinct from the ratepayers, will have to meet, if this Bill is enacted in its present form?</P>

I ask the members of the Government Party now present if they are going to assist us in discussing what is at issue in this Bill, both in regard to public health on the one hand and to central finance on the other hand.  I think it is a <Col N="90" /> matter which should be discussed in a reasonable way, with such facts as are available put in front of us, with such information as we, as representatives of the people, can obtain in relation to public health and public finance. Our discussions should take place with as full an exchange of information between us, as representatives of the people conscientiously trying to discharge our duties here.  I appeal, therefore, to representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party present, other than the Parliamentary Secretary, and I ask them in what spirit we are to discuss this measure.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 5, lines 43 and 44, to delete the definition of &ldquo;infectious disease&rdquo; and substitute the following definition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;infectious disease&rsquo; means primarily a disease declared by Order under Section 18 of this Act to be infectious, but in any section of this Act as respects which an Order under Section 19 of this Act applies, the expression includes only the disease or diseases specified in that Order,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;infectious disease&rdquo;<Col N="94" /> is widely used in paragraph 12 of the Second Schedule, and power is conferred on the Minister in Section 18 (1) to declare by Order that a disease is infectious.  He is also empowered by Section 18 to define disease to include any such disease as advanced tuberculosis as contrasted with early tuberculosis or primary tuberculosis.  There is an official amendment provided under a new Section 19 enabling the Minister to make an Order declaring an infectious disease.</P>

      <P>Yes, I think it well to discuss it at this stage. Infectious disease is defined as primarily a disease so declared by an Order made under Section 18.  The position the Minister takes up is that he may by Order declare a disease to be an infectious disease and the House has no machinery by which the Order may be reviewed.  He may distinguish between an infectious disease in its various stages, for the purpose of effecting his approach, such as treating people or imposing obligations or penalties upon them.</P>

      <P>May I point out at this stage that the House should be told what infectious disease is from the Minister's point of view, and why some infectious diseases will bring penalties on persons because they go on to the public road if they have them, while others may bring penalties on a tram driver or a bus driver for allowing a person with an infectious disease to enter trams or buses?  We are discussing <Col N="95" /> an amendment which relates the idea of infectious disease to a group of sections, and this ought to be the point at which the Minister would indicate his attitude to the various types of infectious diseases, by letting us know what they are.</P>

      <P>I fail to see how and in what way at this particular stage we could with any satisfaction to either side of the House define and set down what diseases we regard as being infectious.  Are we going to define them in general medical terms or are we going to regard diseases as infectious at certain stages and if changes take place in the virulence of these diseases does it mean that, having tied ourselves to a particular definition at a particular stage of a disease, we are then debarred for the future from bringing that particular disease within whatever provisions we may set down in the Bill?  I am personally satisfied that in approaching the Bill as a whole, the most we can <Col N="97" /> expect to do at the moment is to get some definition as set down in the proposed amendment.  Where I do support Deputy Mulcahy is in having a provision whereby at any later stage any Order made by the Minister would be subject to review by the House.  If it were possible for the House to meet him in regard to the definition that he now proposes for &ldquo;infectious&rdquo; and, on his side, to meet us by giving us an opportunity in the future to consider the particular cases that may arise from time to time, it would be helpful not only to this side of the House in dealing with the provisions of the Bill but also to the Parliamentary Secretary in getting an approach to the Bill based on co-operation from both sides and of having an opportunity of gaining the support of the House in any future Order he may have to make in dealing with a particular infectious disease or a particular stage of a disease that might require attention at any time in the future.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 3, page 6, to delete the words &ldquo;or any similar institution&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that, while he meant a little laboratory it might be possible to have a big laboratory.  In view of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary is taking power to force local authorities to put up any institution he may require, the <Col N="101" /> House ought to be as clear as possible as to the type of institution in relation to which the Parliamentary Secretary is to have power to do that.  The Parliamentary Secretary has only found it possible to add the word &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo;. I think we should have a clear statement as to the type of institution in reference to which the Parliamentary Secretary is to be given power to dictate to the local authority.  I think the type of institution should be explicitly named there.  I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary means by &ldquo;any similar institution&rdquo;, except that it gives him extraordinarily wide powers which I do not think he should have.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would not press this amendment.  I would prefer that he would not.  There is no sinister intention behind this. But Deputies will appreciate that the names and descriptions of these institutions change from time to time, while the type of institution itself does not necessarily change.  For example, the term &ldquo;health centre&rdquo; is inserted there.  It is only in recent years that the term &ldquo;health centre&rdquo; came to be used by our medical people here. We talked about dispensaries.  Similarly, it might be desirable to have a joint institution, a combined preventorium and convalescent home.  It is only just to provide for the possible contingency that desirable institutions of the type set out here might come to be known by other names and that we would not have to come to the House again looking for legislation if we wanted to set up an institution.  There is nothing more than that in it.</P>

      <P>Neither can I give a very firm reply on that.  The Deputy knows <Col N="102" /> that the policy in the past has been that two-thirds of the cost of local authority institutions has been borne out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  So far as the sanatoria that are being provided are concerned, the whole of the cost is being borne out of the Hospitals Trust Fund, with the provision that not more than one-third may be recovered. If the financial position of the Hospitals Trust Fund would permit it, even that one-third would not be recovered from the local authority.  So that there is no likelihood that the whole of the cost or, indeed, the greater portion of the cost, of these institutions will be placed on the local authority.  The highest possible proportion of the capital cost for the provision and equipment of these institutions will be borne out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  There are only £8,000,000 there now.  We are hoping that funds will continue to accumulate.  We can of course, argue that the sweepstakes may not recover and that when the £8,000,000 are gone we will have to go to the local authorities.  If there is not any Hospitals Trust Fund to come to the assistance of the local authorities, we will be faced with a new position. I do not think that we need anticipate that position.  I think it will be quite a long time before it would happen. Even with the most intensive driving, it would take a considerable time to provide the institutions that can be provided out of the £8,000,000.  I think there is a number of years' work in that.  In the meantime the money will be accumulating.  However, if Deputies want to be unreasonable about this and make debating points and if they cannot talk sense, they are welcome to their debating points.</P>

      <P>With all possible respect, I submit that I am not making debating points, that it is the Parliamentary Secretary who is doing that. We are not dealing with anticipations. We are dealing with legislation.  We are passing a law here to put the obligation on the local authority to erect any type of institution which the Minister may direct and to maintain it.  There is nothing in this Bill, there is nothing in any legislation that I know of, which states that the local <Col N="103" /> authority shall not be responsible for the complete cost of the whole thing. The Parliamentary Secretary told us what has been the practice.  It will depend on whether the sweepstakes continue and whether they are a success. It will depend on the amount the local authority can get by way of grant out of the £8,000,000.  The Government may change their minds to-morrow about the disposal of the £8,000,000.  So far as future sweepstakes are concerned, they may decide that it would be good policy to increase the stamp duty on the sweepstakes and thereby reduce the amount going towards the hospitals in order to increase the amount going into the revenue.  I am not making debating points.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to be amused at that.  He has a fairly good memory.  The present Government have been responsible for things far more far-fetched than anything I am now saying.  The Parliamentary Secretary is merely giving us assurances for what they are worth. I am not questioning his sincerity.  I am not questioning that that is his intention.  What I am saying is that he cannot give any guarantee to this House or the local authorities that that will be the position.</P>
      <P>With regard to the practice of paying two-thirds of the cost of the institutions out of the Sweepstakes Fund and one-third by the local authority, again that is dependent on the number and the cost of the new institutions which will have to be erected.  The whole thing is contingent upon many matters that are likely to be changed, either by circumstances within the control of the Government or by circumstances outside the control of the Government. Surely the definition already set down is fairly wide.  It seems to me to cover every conceivable kind of institution that could be called for in this country.  It certainly covers far more institutions than I think the local authorities should be responsible for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as has already been explained by other speakers, is really simple.  Its purpose is to remove a very unnecessary and irksome discrimination against what is held to be one of the most essential sections of our community, a section which has frequently been lauded to the skies for the very useful work they do, particularly during periods of crisis, of economic stress&mdash;the agricultural workers.  In season and out of season we hear them being lauded to the skies, but when we come to translate that praise into action, I fear that very little in the way of practical support is given to these eulogies which are so often poured out.</P>
      <P>In the social code there is discrimination shown against them, in so far as they are the only people who are denied an annual holiday.  If they were domestic workers, industrial workers, or commercial workers, they would be entitled, under statutes passed by the Oireachtas, to get an annual break, and while it may reasonably and fairly be argued that there was a stronger case for granting an annual holiday to people engaged in certain forms of industrial work than to those engaged in agriculture&mdash;that may, to an extent, be true&mdash;it could reasonably be argued that, when it was applied to industrial workers, it was not applied to particular sections but was spread over all sections.  The building trade worker, who works in the open air, has much more varied work to do than the agricultural worker, who also works in the open air.  The surroundings of the latter are rather dreary, working as he does from dawn to dark, whether in the cow byre or the milking pen.  He has a very dreary round of drudgery from one year's end to another, and it is felt that such workers have a reasonable right to grouse against having been specially selected by existing legislation for deprivation of what is regarded as necessary for every other type of worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> We hear about the flight from the land, and there can be no question that the agricultural worker is wakening up, is looking at the conditions enjoyed by those who go in amongst the lights of the cities and towns and asking himself why he is regarded as a pariah when this House comes to pass legislation. The discrimination is not confined to this particular social legislation.  On previous occasions, when particular measures were passing through the House and when we asked for a little practical sympathy for rural workers, a very deaf ear was turned to our suggestions.  When it came to a question of the purchase of their homes, there was a very dull response from the Government Benches, and when we recently sought a reduction in the rents of these workers, who previously had been lauded as being great fellows for. having fought on behalf of the farming community in previous campaigns, our proposals were turned down, not once but twice.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the social side of the matter, and when they find that the domestic servant and the industrial and commercial worker, in whatever sphere, are entitled to this annual holiday, they rightly ask why they should be specially selected for a 52-week year.  I think the granting of this annual holiday would be good for the community generally and for the health of the agricultural worker and would not delimit his output in any way&mdash;in fact, it would increase it, because if you have a more contented agricultural working class, you will get a better output at the end of the year. If they could look forward, as can their fellows in the cities, towns and villages to an annual break, if it were possible for them to commingle with their fellows in the towns and cities in respect of what are called holiday savings clubs, organised under the auspices of the tourist association and which are having a very good effect, not alone from the point of view of the actual holiday but from the point of view of the encouragement of the thrift habit amongst these workers, it would mean a very big uplift in the output of the agricultural worker and his wife <Col N="106" /> and family if he could look forward to a week's or two weeks'&mdash;one week would perhaps meet the case&mdash;annual holiday.</P>
    <P>Let him come up and see Dublin.  His only hope of seeing Dublin now is when his county wins the hurling semi-final and goes on to the final in Dublin.  He is then packed into a crowded train, if he is lucky enough to get a train, or, if he is enthusiastic enough, he will come in a lorry and risk prosecution. He wants to come up and see the bright lights.  Would he not like to see his Deputies and legislation being discussed in this House? It would be a great attraction, and he ought to be entitled to come to Dublin, or to go to the seaside, and to get away from his dreary surroundings once a year.  He is entitled to it by the nature of his work and by every canon of right and justice, and the House should agree that he should not be debarred any more than other workers who are catered for.</P>
    <P>There is another anomaly which I think is even more glaring than the differentiation between country and town workers.  It is that the domestic worker even in the country gets the holiday.  If, for instance, a person is engaged on the farm in some domestic work such as washing dishes, sweeping up, bed-making or any other activities incidental to home-keeping that person is entitled to the holiday.  If, however, a person is engaged in milking cows or looking after poultry&mdash;very essential work&mdash;the law prescribes that that person is debarred from getting the holiday.  The anomaly in that case has gone to great extremes.</P>
    <P>There is one stamp for one and two for the other, and it is the cause of endless friction and confusion, I have been told by people engaged in farming. That seems to indicate that those engaged in agricultural work are looked on as a kind of untouchables. We praise them, on the one hand, and, on the other, we definitely set them on one side as a class in themselves who must remain outside the pale of social legislation and who are to get no amelioration of the dreary conditions of their work.  I commend this Bill to the House.  It seeks merely to repeal <Col N="107" /> the penal section in the existing Act which debars these people from getting what has been given to others, and I appeal to Deputies to give it favourable consideration and to see that the agricultural worker is brought into line in this respect with the other sections of workers already catered for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not yet seem inclined to intervene in this debate.  I shall give my views briefly as a farmer-Deputy.  The Minister, in accordance with his usual form, is probably adopting a cautious attitude. I am not inclined to be equally cautious.  When I see a bull in a field, I am inclined to take him by the horns and rub his nose in the grass to see what his reactions would be.  I admit right away that this measure is a rather delicate one so far as the farming community is concerned.  In so far as it seeks to raise the status and standard of living of our agricultural workers, I think it will meet with general approval in this House.  It seeks to ensure that workers have an annual holiday and, in so doing, it imposes an additional charge on the agricultural employer.  I acknowledge right away that it is a very small charge, being an increase of about 2 per cent. in the total annual charge to the employer per man, as Deputy Norton pointed out.</P>
      <P>We on the farming Benches have been persistently and consistently demanding for those engaged in agriculture, whether as farmers or workers, the same standard of living as people in industrial and commercial occupations. I cannot see any grounds on which farmers can oppose this measure. If we seek better conditions for the agricultural community generally, if we seek to ensure that the agricultural producer shall be on a par with other producers, we must agree that the differentiation between agricultural workers and industrial workers should be removed, that the agricultural worker should not be placed in an inferior position to other workers.  This Bill will put him in a somewhat equal position, since the principle of an annual holiday is accepted in most occupations at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> We have to ask what the proposers of this Bill recommend to ensure that the agricultural employer shall be in a position always to meet this additional charge.  One point made by Deputy Norton in introducing the Bill&mdash;a point which I consider was a weak one&mdash;was his comparison of the agricultural income at the present day and prewar. He said that it has increased, because a number of statements by Ministers declared that the farming community was very well off.  I do not think he should be encouraged to quote such unreliable statements.  If he is basing his case for this Bill, which ought to be a permanent measure if it is passed at all, on a temporary improvement in agricultural conditions, he is basing it on very weak ground. I think such a temporary improvement is not the basis on which a measure of this kind should be introduced. This is a measure which, if enacted, will remain in force long after the recent war and the present emergency are forgotten.  Therefore, if this House is enacting legislation to impose statutory obligations upon the agricultural community, it must, at the same time or immediately afterwards, introduce legislation to ensure that the employers concerned shall be in a position to fulfil those liabilities.</P>
    <P>We had a post-war agricultural committee dealing with agriculture recently and the majority decided that the standard of income in agriculture should be based on the law of supply and demand, that there should be a complete return to free trade and that the standard of living of the agricultural community should be based on the standard of living amongst the lowest-paid workers engaged in exporting to the British market in any part of the world.  If we accept that view, we should reject this Bill definitely. If we accept this Bill, we have to reject the decision of the majority of that committee and take the view that, having set our hands to fixing an improved standard of living for our agricultural workers, we must make provision for such prices for agricultural produce as will enable that standard to be maintained.  The farmer cannot give more to his employees than he is <Col N="109" /> able to obtain in the market for his produce.</P>
    <P>We all know that it is desirable, not only in the interests of the agricultural industry but in the interests of the nation, that both the farmer and the worker should co-operate in mutual harmony and agreement.  We know that, in the crisis that followed the first world war, when agricultural prices collapsed, there was an immediate conflict between the agricultural workers and the farmers, a long and bitter conflict, in which the farmers gained what appeared at that time to be a victory.  We do not want a similar conflict to arise in the future. We want the agricultural worker to feel that be is being as well paid as that industry is capable of paying him and we must ensure that that industry is put in a position to treat him fairly and equitably.  In one respect, the Minister might argue that this Bill would not alter the position very much, as the relations between agricultural workers and their employers are fixed at present by an Agricultural Wages Board.  It is quite apparent that that board, as at present constituted, will take into consideration the concession being made to the agricultural worker in this Bill and will apportion wages in future accordingly.  I think, however, that that would be a rather narrow view to take of the position.</P>
    <P>This Bill does provide a fundamental change in the position of the agricultural worker.  It affords him what he never was afforded before, an annual holiday.  I think if it were in the power of the Wages Board to give such a concession, they would probably have considered it before now; but it was probably not in their power and hence this Bill is necessary.  It is a fundamental change and, that being so, if the Bill is passed it carries with it an obligation on this House so to implement its provisions as to ensure that no matter what depression may occur in agriculture, the farmer will be guaranteed such an income as will enable him to give to his workers what is envisaged in this Bill.  We know that during the depressed period in agriculture, the period before the present Minister came into office&mdash;and, <Col N="110" /> indeed, for a considerable time after he came into office there was a depression aggravated to a considerable extent by the Minister himself&mdash;there were very few holidays for agriculturists. The conditions were so bad that very little in the way of holidays was possible.</P>
    <P>We know that at the present time there is very little opportunity for holidays for farmers and the members of their families and, so far as we can look into the future, there will be very little opportunity from that point of view.  It is true that the well-to-do farmers, those who live in very good farming areas, can afford to take an annual holiday, but the small farmers, struggling on inferior land, find that they have to work not alone a very long day or a very long week, but they have to work the full 52 weeks of the year.  If the effect of this Bill in providing for an annual holiday for an agricultural worker will be so to improve agricultural prices as to ensure that the farmer and the members of his family will be able to avail of an annual holiday, then it must be regarded as a very far-reaching and desirable reform.</P>
    <P>I am rather at a disadvantage in discussing this Bill because I did not carefully read the Principal Act, but I understand that the effect of the Bill will be to make it an obligation on the employer to provide a full week's holiday with pay.  I am not sure whether those holidays are to be provided in the one week or whether there are to be two or three broken periods of two or three days each.  It may be that is a matter which can be settled by mutual agreement between the employer and the workers.  I know there are quite a number of workers who would prefer to take two days in the early part of the year and perhaps two or three days later on, to have the week divided, so to speak.  This course would fit in with local sporting events, such as point-to-point races and so on, and it might be found very agreeable by the employees.  Whatever arrangement is made in that respect, I think it is essential that the holidays should be fixed between the employer and the worker by mutual consent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> As I understand it, the Bill will provide that every worker who gives 12 months' constant work is legally entitled to a holiday.  If the employer meets the worker in a reasonable way, it should be possible by agreement to ensure that these holidays will not be taken at a time when it would give the employer the maximum amount of inconvenience.  I want to stress the point that in dealing with holidays for agricultural workers we are dealing with a type of employer who has only one or two workers, and the effect of giving a week's holidays where there are only one or two workers would mean that the farmer has his staff reduced by 50 per cent. or possibly 100 per cent. for that period.  It is a very different proposition where the larger employer is concerned.  He has a large number of workers and he can stagger the holidays for a long period, so that he hardly notices the fact that one or two of his men are on leave at a particular time.</P>
    <P>I think it is a problem which can be solved easily if there is give and take between the employer and the worker. There are slack periods on a farm at all seasons of the year.  I do not think it could be seriously suggested that a farmer would insist upon his men taking their holidays in the dead of winter, when work is slack.  There are also slack periods in early June and at various other times between the busier periods and it is by agreement between the worker and the employer that those holidays can be taken without causing any serious inconvenience.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House. I strongly urge that if it is passed it should be accompanied by other legislation ensuring that the farmers' income will be guaranteed in the event of a serious depression in the near future.  We cannot have a minimum standard of living or minimum conditions of work for the agricultural worker and have the employer and the agricultural community generally exposed to what I would describe as the jungle law of supply and demand.</P>
    <P>We must remember that we have in this country, in the agricultural industry, not only employers and <Col N="112" /> employees, but also a very big section who are neither employers nor employees.  We have small farmers who work their holdings by their own labour and the labour of the members of their families and it would be disastrous if the standard of living of these people on small farms was, by the operation of the law of supply and demand and prices of agricultural produce, brought below that of the agricultural worker.  It would not make for happiness or contentment among the young people who are members of the small farmers' families if they found that the agricultural worker could enjoy a holiday and that they were unable to afford it because of agricultural conditions.  That state of affairs would tend to drive more and more of the farming community, particularly the young people, off the land to seek employment elsewhere.  If this Bill is accepted in the spirit in which I have supported it and if the principle that the farmer is to be secured against acute agricultural depression is accepted, I think the House should have no hesitation in accepting the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan accused me of being cautious.  I want to say that on a motion like this, if it is a <i>bona fide</i> motion&mdash;which I take it to be as far as Deputy Norton is concerned&mdash;speeches are made so as to convince Deputies, and, as the Minister may control the largest Party, it is up to speakers to try to convince him that their arguments are right.  Therefore, the Minister has to hear the arguments before coming to a decision.  If, as Deputy Cogan thinks, this is a propaganda motion, the sooner the Minister speaks the better so that every Party can hear what he has to say.  If I have been cautious, I have been waiting to hear the arguments.  I am not edified by the arguments of Deputy Cogan.  He stated that he agreed that the agricultural labourers must get more, but that farmers must also get more to recoup them.  That is a very cautious argument. I do not find fault with it.</P>

      <P>Very logical and very cautious.  Deputy Cogan can say to the agricultural labourer in Wicklow that he voted for the Bill, and if a farmer asks him why he voted for it, he can say that he made it a condition that as a result farmers would also get more.  That could not be beaten for caution.  I am not going to try to beat it.  I am going to give my views and to be attacked by both sides, if necessary.  Deputy Cogan has guarded himself against that.  Deputy Norton and the Labour Party had, at least, the courage to say that the farmers could afford this at present. Therefore; if the Bill is passed into law by this House Deputy Norton and his Party will not have to give any explanation.  Deputy Cogan is not going to take that risk.  If the Bill is passed, as far as he is concerned, he does not run any risk from anybody, because the labourers will be delighted naturally to get a week's paid holidays, and farmers will be put in the position by the Government of having to pay them.  Therefore, Deputy Cogan will stand right with everybody.  He is every man's man.  I am afraid there will be a division on the Bill, and I advise Deputy Cogan, when he is going into the Division Lobby, to vote on this question assuming that farmers' conditions should remain as they are.  If he thinks the farmers can afford to give the holiday, then he should vote for the Bill.  That is what the Labour Party is going to do.</P>

Let us argue about the Bill on that basis.  That is as far as Deputy Cogan goes.  I want to give my views now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> In the first place, I think it was only by a-discriminatory provision in the original Act that agricultural labourers were left out.  Some members on the Labour Benches made that point. Other classes were exempted as well as agricultural labourers.  There is a long list of exemptions.  For instance, it includes railway refreshment attendants. I do not know why they were exempted, but it was probably owing to the nature of their work, and that they had to be left out of the continuous holiday.  There was no offence meant in leaving out railway refreshment attendants.  Then miners, other than coal miners, and various other types are left out.  There must be a reason why agricultural labourers were left out.  There was a reason.  Strange to say, clergymen in Holy Orders are left out.  I never heard of a clergyman objecting, or saying that he was insulted by being left out.  I suppose the idea was that it would not do to give a clergyman seven days' holidays, because his duties would not permit. He would have to break the holidays. There were good reasons for exempting various classes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that the only reason for exempting clergymen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I have not heard the reason.  Probably there was some reason, and that clergymen could not be spared on seven successive days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of compulsion did not come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why that was put into the Bill.  Anyway, one of the exceptions concerns clergymen.  If there was a good reason why clergymen should be exempted, then we must come to the conclusion that it was discriminatory, and because discrimination was shown, they were put into the exempted list.  I should like to point out that it is not practicable to apply this Bill to agricultural labourers.  As Deputy Larkin pointed out, the original Act was drawn up for industrial workers.  The Minister and the Department in drawing up the Act had it clearly in view that it was possible <Col N="115" /> to give six bank holidays and seven clear days each year to industrial workers without upsetting industrial concerns.  As a matter of fact, we know that many of these industries close down completely for a week, and that no harm is done.  At the end of the week the workers and managers go back and take up where they left off.</P>
      <P>I want also to point to something which would make for difficulty here. There is discrimination between a domestic worker and a non-domestic worker.  As far as I can interpret the Act a man working for a farmer and living in would be classed as a domestic worker.  That was the explanation given.  If this Act applied to a farmer he would have to know his law very well.  He would have to apply one set of rules to the man living in and another set of rules to the man living out.  The man living in would not necessarily get any Sunday or any holiday during the year, but he would get instead 14 days clear holidays.  The non-domestic worker who lived out would get six bank holidays and seven days together.  The seven days must be together.  That is laid down by the Act.  That might give rise to considerable difficulty for a farmer, because he might have one man living in, and one man living out, and, therefore, he would have to treat both in different ways.  Then there is the case of the casual worker.  The farmer would have to keep a very strict account of the number of days a worker had casual work, and would have to give what is referred to in the Act as &ldquo;cesser pay&rdquo; at the end of the period.  That is given in lieu of holidays to such workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious part, however, in the Act is that, to be a holiday, the employer must not admit such worker to do any work for him on that day. Therefore, if it applied to a farmer, he would have to arrange with the worker to give him six bank holidays or six Church holidays.  There are various duties laid down, such as the notice to be given for a change from Church to bank holidays.  In addition, he would have to give the seven holidays in an unbroken week.  It includes Sunday, of course.  None of these days would count if the men did any work <Col N="116" /> whatever for the farmer.  So that if a farmer has one or two men employed, if he has no son to work in the place, if he is a fairly old man or if there is no man at all there&mdash;it might be a widow, as we often have in this country managing a farm with a man or two working&mdash;the men must not come in even to give a horse a drink because, if they do that, the day does not count as a holiday.  I think Deputies will see that that makes it almost impossible to apply the Holidays Act to agricultural workers, as it is, at any rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens when he is sick for a day?  How does the horse get the drink then?  I suppose it goes dry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We will deal with that too.  If Deputy Norton wants to be reasonable&mdash;sometimes he can be&mdash; he will see that there is a genuine objection there.  There is a genuine objection to applying the Holidays Act as it stands.  I am going to concede the point that when I mention these objections, Deputy Norton may very well say to me: &ldquo;But these things can be accounted for.&rdquo;  Maybe they can. I am making the point that this Bill in the form in which Deputy Norton brings it in, to delete a certain paragraph out of a certain Bill, is impracticable, unworkable and could never be applied; but, if you like, we will deal with it on the principle that underlies the Bill rather than with these details because I quite admit that if the Dáil were to vote in favour of the principle of this Bill it would not be reasonable to reject it because it was impracticable; it could be made practicable by looking after details of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is very different from the industries that were legislated for. In the first place, in these industries you have owners and employers comparatively few in number and employees comparatively very much greater in number.  In other words, the average number employed by employers is big compared with the number employed on the farm.  Somebody quoted figures in this House which appeared to me to be fairly correct. In 1944 we had, I believe, <Col N="117" /> employed in agriculture in this country, males over 18 years of age, 495,000, and of that number 83,000 were permanent paid employees and 52,000 were temporary paid employees. These figures have already been quoted.  Therefore, in the agricultural industry you have only about one in four to whom this Act would apply. In the manufacturing industries, as opposed to agriculture, and to which the Act already applies, the proportion, of course, is altogether different. It is probably 50 or 60 employees to one employer instead of being, as it is in agriculture, one employee to three on the employers' side.  They are not all employers, of course, because they have not men employed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan mentioned a matter in reference to the small farmer and I think there is a good deal in the point. Of the 384,000 holdings in this country 242,000 are under 30 acres.  Very few owners of small holdings would have an employee.  If this Act were to be brought in, it may be argued that very few of them would be able to afford the week's holiday that would be granted to the employee employed on the big farm adjoining them and it might make for a certain amount of discontent amongst these people; but, whether it did or not, the point is that the Act would apply only to a certain proportion, say, about 25 per cent. altogether of those who are working in agriculture at the moment. There are very few farmers in this country who employ more than two or three men and it would be difficult for these employers to let an employee off. The employer who has a big number of men, say, six or more, would find it easier to let his men off in turn, but the man with only two employees or one employee would find it extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan said that if the Act were adapted to cover agriculture farmers would not be driven to the expedient of giving holidays during the winter months.  I do not know. I think you will have other ill-effects if they try to get these holidays during the summer because, as farming is at present, with increased tillage, beet growing and so on, a farmer is very <Col N="118" /> busy from March to November, practically without a stop.  If he is forced to allow his men off for a complete week during that period I think he will be forced in turn to take on a casual instead.  I do not favour a system of casual labour and since I came into this office I have done anything I thought would tend the other way, that is, to induce farmers to employ their men the whole year round rather than to keep a certain number the whole year round and to employ casuals for part of the year.  I think these casual labourers are in a most unfortunate position, getting work for four, six or eight months and being unable to find work for the remainder of the year.  Anything that would tend to intensify a casual labour system would, in my opinion, be very bad.  Of course as there is more mixed farming, more tillage and so on, it should have the tendency to do away with the casual labour system because the farmers who employed casual labourers in the past to make hay, which was the only operation they had for them, now have to commence their tillage operations as soon as possible after Christmas, ploughing and so on, and even before Christmas, if they can, and the work goes on continuously for the year, between tillage operations, and attending to live stock in the winter time.  It should have the tendency to make for permanent employment rather than casual employment. Then, some years ago in giving a certain agricultural grant for relief of rates it was arranged so as to give an advantage to the man who employs permanent labour.  I admit that the reward to a farmer for employing a man the year round is small but it is something and it shows at least that, as far as the Government are concerned, they were anxious, so far as the finances would permit, to reward a man who employed labourers the whole year round.  The farm improvements scheme was brought in for the same reason.  Primarily, that scheme was brought in to help farmers to keep their men employed during the winter months, so that if they had good labourers employed for the greater part of the year we might induce them to <Col N="119" /> keep these men for the winter months on some improvements on the farm. We offered them a monetary reward, if you like, to help to keep these men employed.  I mention these matters to show that I have favoured the system of permanent employment.  If we can avoid it, I do not want to see anything happen that might encourage or increase the system of casual labour.</P>
    <P>Another point which I think was probably in the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and those who brought in similar legislation in other countries for industrial workers as that you have in these factories men and women who are on a very uninteresting job.  I suppose there is no Deputy who has not been in some of these big factories from time to time. He will see there a worker doing the same operation hundreds of times every day.  These people want a break of some kind.  The agricultural labourer's job may be drudgery at times&mdash;I admit that&mdash;but one thing about it is that it is varied.  He has not to do the same operation over and over again, because, as every week of the year comes round, there is a different job in front of him.  His job is varied and, in that way, he is not in the position of the industrial worker.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is this.  It was mentioned by Deputy McCarthy when he was speaking on the last night, but he had not time to develop his argument because the debate was adjourned.  Good employers amongst farmers are giving their employees at least the equivalent of what industrial workers are getting. In fact I think I can claim that good employers amongst farmers are giving more.  What is provided for the industrial worker is six holidays, usually bank holidays.  But the industrial employer can substitute Church holidays for these six days by giving due notice.  There is a week's holidays as well.  That week's holidays of course includes the Sunday.  You cannot get seven days together without including the Sunday.  Leaving out Sunday, that amounts to 12 days' holidays for an industrial worker.  So far as my knowledge goes, I think that <Col N="120" /> in practice every farmer gives the Church holidays to his labourers.  There are ten church holidays, so that really he is already giving ten days as against 12.  But he goes farther than that.  I think it will be conceded by Deputies that whenever there is a race meeting or a ploughing match or a function of that kind, the agricultural labourers in the vicinity get a day off from their employers.  They always get a day or two of that kind during the year. Again, I wonder whether there is any part of the country where the farmer employer does not give his labourer a day with a pair of horses to do his plot, or maybe two days; at least, let us say, one day to till and get it ready, a few hours to sow and a few hours at the end of the year if there is any harvesting to be done.  I cannot claim that this is general, but I think that if a farmer's man is sick for one or two days, he is paid for these days.  That may not apply generally.</P>
    <P>I say that the great majority of the farmers in this country are giving ten Church holidays, a day or two for functions in the district, like races or ploughing matches, a day or two for a man to attend to his plot, and a few days during the year for what we might call sick leave.  Therefore, in my opinion, the agricultural labourer is getting very much more than he would get under this rigid legislation which, was applied to industrial workers.  We are only dealing here with holidays. Therefore, I do not want to mention other perquisites that the agricultural labourer may get, because they would be on the wages side.  These are the free days, let us say, that he gets as against the holidays asked for here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, of course, in winding up will be quite justified in saying to me: &ldquo;If things are as good as that with labourers all over the country, why not legislate and make the few farmer-employers who are not giving these holidays do it?&rdquo;  That is a reasonable question.  I do not know that it is necessary.  At the moment I think there is almost a scarcity, if not a scarcity, of agricultural labourers in every district in the country.  At any rate, an agricultural labourer at the moment in practically every district <Col N="121" /> has his choice.  If he is working with a person who is not a good employer, he can leave him and go to an employer who will treat him fairly and decently.  I think, therefore, that the agricultural labourer is in a position to get the holidays, or most of them anyway&mdash;I suppose it varies from district to district&mdash;that I have mentioned, at least amounting to the 12 days that are demanded under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages Act was passed in 1936, I think.  It imposed certain things on the employers and on the employees.  It did good to a certain number of lowly-paid agricultural labourers.  But I have been attacked by many agricultural labourers for the passing of that Act because in some ways it did a lot of harm.  One thing we are all familiar with is that it made it impossible for the indifferent sort of man, what was referred to as the mentally or physically deficient man, to get a job at all. We tried to make that right by amendment.  As well as that, some agricultural labourers hold that they are better off with the relations they have with the farmers than if rigid rules were laid down for them.  The agricultural labourer is in a very different position from the industrial worker.  The industrial employer hardly knows his men.  But the farmer works beside his men in the fields and in the yard.  If he is a small farmer and has only one man, perhaps he eats at the same table as that man and perhaps sits at the same fireside and talks things over with him at night. At any rate, even where the farmer is a bit above that, he does work beside his men occasionally, in fact, very often, and he knows his men intimately. Therefore, the farmer and his labourer are on very different terms from the industrial employer and his men.  I think we should be careful that we do not destroy that relationship by legislation and rigid rules and regulations.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was emphasising that we were placing a very big burden on local authorities even when we were defining the particular institutions for the erection and maintenance of which they would be responsible, without giving the Minister the other power he seeks in the section.  The Minister sets out the various institutions and adds at the end &ldquo;or any similar institution&rdquo;.  That gives a terrifically wide power, so wide that we think it should not be given.  The amendment seeks to delete the words, &ldquo;or any similar institution&rdquo;, and I think a fairly good case has been made for it.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should make his mind up as to the institutions he requires, because when you come to interpret this section, it simply means giving power to the Minister to provide any institution whatever, so long as he can relate it to better provision for the public health.  That is the only way he is tied.  In interpreting this section, the courts would hold that the Minister had power to provide any class of institution whatever, so long as he could show that it related to the health of the people.  He has set out a number of institutions which ought to be sufficient.  He has, by an amendment, added to the list, and there is a case for limiting the number and type of institutions he may set up, bearing in mind that all these institutions will be imposed on the local authority by the Minister's Order, and perhaps without <Col N="124" /> the consent or endorsement of the local authority.  There should be a limit to the number and type of institutions which the Minister wants.  Surely he and his experts know now what they want and should specify their wants in the definition clause.</P>

I do not know how many years it took to accumulate £8,000,000 in the sweeps, but the Parliamentary Secretary's imagination has gone over that long period from the present day onwards.  If his imagination could go as far as that where the expenditure of money is concerned, all we are asking is that he would limit the definition of institutions to the same limits of his imagination.  If he is not able to think of the names of the institutions which might come into being within the next ten or 12 years, I think he should rest content that his imagination has done the best it possibly could and should not ask the House to give him power beyond his imagination, which has been shown to be very elastic and very fertile.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to narrow the door, as it were, and to restrict the definition of parent to the old-time accepted definition&mdash;that a parent includes a parent, step-parent, grandparent, and the legal guardian of the child.  The definition of parent in the Bill is wider than that and includes not only the parent in the accepted sense I have defined and the legal guardian as I have already defined, but says</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where owing to the absence of such person or for any other reason, the child is not living with, or is not in the actual custody of such person, includes the person with whom the child is living, or in whose actual custody the child is&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That would seem to let in a whole lot of people who have no legal liability for the maintenance of the child and is so wide, to my mind, as to let in institutions. It is not at all clear what the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind in this particular definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words which I have suggested in the alternative&mdash;&ldquo;the word parent includes guardian and every person who is liable to maintain, or has the actual custody of any child&rdquo;&mdash;would be better.  The present definition seems to be opening the door to persons who have no legal liability at all, or have not any actual custody of the child. To my mind, it might let in people who may usurp the functions of the parent. I expressed my views on this particular matter on the Second Stage of the Bill and want to reiterate what I said then.  Our Constitution&mdash;apart <Col N="128" /> from natural rights and common law&mdash; protects the rights of the parent and respects them.  It guarantees to the parent the natural right, which it has always, to educate the child.  Education must be taken in the broad sense of not only moral, intellectual and mental training but also physical training. I see here the opening of the door to let in a whole host of other people to usurp the functions of the parent in relation to what I would call the physical education of the child.  I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what case he has for altering the definition.  The words I have suggested are the old-time definition and the usually accepted legal definition of parent.  This takes in people who are even <i>in loco parentis</i>, people of such a wide character that I am suspicious of the definition, to say the least of it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will hear what I have to say all right.  The definition in the Bill as it stands is the draftsman's definition, with no sinister purpose behind it, notwithstanding Deputy Coogan's alleged suspicions.  I fail to see what material difference there is in the definition of parent in the Bill and the definition suggested by him.  He conjures up a position within which the person not having the custody of the child might, under the definition in the Bill, come to assume certain responsibilities.  The Deputy in his own definition says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the word parent includes guardian and every person who is liable to maintain or has the actual custody of any child.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Surely, if his definition includes any person who has the actual custody of any child, there is not any material difference between his definition and the one the draftsman thinks is a better draft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> Deputy Coogan may tell me he has copied this out of a previous Act of 1919, but the draftsman, who is an expert in these matters, says there is no special line of policy involved in it &mdash;it is purely a matter of drafting&mdash; and if he says it is better drafted as it stands in the Bill, it is his job. Deputy Coogan may, perhaps, have special training in drafting&mdash;I know he has special legal knowledge&mdash;but drafting is a fairly highly specialised job and all I can say is that the draft in the Bill has not been put in for any special purpose or to meet any special contingency arising in this Bill.  It is the draft suggested by the draftsman of his own accord and, he being my technical adviser in matters of drafting, I am standing by his draft.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will be good enough to answer a question.  I take it there is some reason for changing the title to the chief medical officer. At the moment it is the county medical officer of health or the city medical officer of health.  I notice that the words &ldquo;of health&rdquo; are dropped. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us why.</P>

      <P>There is no particular <Col N="130" /> reason for the alteration; at least, there is no very deep-rooted reason. The chief medical officer is a more attractive term, if you like, and less unwieldy.  The difference between &ldquo;chief medical officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;county medical officer of health&rdquo;, as a descriptive term, is not so great, but the expression &ldquo;the city superintendent medical officer of health&rdquo; is very much of a mouthful.  Under the Bill the term becomes chief medical officer covering both of these officers&mdash;it is nothing more than that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment in order to emphasise the fact that, under present circumstances, the Parliamentary Secretary ought to concentrate on what is required immediately for improving the institutions and the general matters affecting public health.  He appears in this Bill to take extraordinary powers and he runs along in a way that he can make use of any suggestion that comes into his mind with regard to setting up institutions of one kind or another or inventing additional diseases that will have to be controlled by him.  He seems to look for powers to allow his imagination to develop as he goes along.  I do not think legislation ought to be passed in that kind of way.  I think, after the review the Parliamentary Secretary says he has given to the public health services, that it would be more satisfactory if he concentrated and if he was given three years to deal with the main matters that he is proposing to take action in regard to.  The section says that the Act shall come into <Col N="131" /> operation on such day or days as the Minister fixes.  I suggest that in respect of all matters that he has not fixed inside the next three years, his powers under the Act will drop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose the Deputy will be disappointed if I tell him I am not disposed to accept the limitation he would like to impose upon the Minister by way of this amendment. I appreciate his anxiety to have the provisions of this Bill brought into the earliest possible operation, and I assure him and the House that that will be done as far as it is possible to do it; but I could not bind myself to have this comprehensive measure in full and effective operation within three years.  If I wanted to score debating points, I believe I could cite Acts of Parliament that were passed, even at the time when the Deputy's Party was in power, that were not brought into full and effective operation within three years.  The Deputy will appreciate that.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive Bill like this, affecting practically every section of the community, could not possibly be brought into full operation within the time he specifies.  Perhaps he will be satisfied in the knowledge that, notwithstanding the criticism of the Bill and the opposition to it, we will bring it into operation as soon as it is possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any justification at all for this measure and for the enormous expenditure it is going to call for, it is that it will be put into operation as soon as possible. If the measure is to have the beneficial effect on the health of the community which we are told it will have, then the sooner we have it the better.  It is notorious that disease is growing in this country; it is notorious that the incidence, particularly of tuberculosis, is unfortunately on the upgrade; it is equally notorious that even those people who are anxious to take advantage of whatever institutional treatment is available, have not the accommodation to get it.  Now, this measure is either meant seriously or it is not.  If it is meant seriously, then we ought not <Col N="132" /> to be given the impression that we have been given by the Parliamentary Secretary, that it may not be in full operation for years.  The Parliamentary Secretary, as a matter of fact, has such little hope of having it in operation within any reasonable period that he foresees it will be so long that the amount of money available in the Sweeps Fund will be at least double what it is at the moment.</P>
      <P>This is not a matter on which the Parliamentary Secretary should talk about debating points; it is a very serious matter; with a Minister, with all the ramifications of his Department, with all the preliminary work put into this Bill, with two Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;with two additional Ministers promised to deal with social services, public health, and local government&mdash; we are expected to pass this Bill before we get a picture of what sort of machinery will be established under these two additional Ministers.  If all that is to be provided for, and paid for, when dealing with the health of a falling population, and if we are to be faced by a Parliamentary Secretary with a measure of this magnitude, and not being told when it is going to be put into full operation or what it is going to cost, then I say that Parliament is not being treated as it should be treated.  This is one of the biggest measures ever introduced in this House. It is a far-reaching measure, one that is going to affect every class in the community, both from the point of view of their health and their pockets.  On two fundamentals, the Minister is either unable or unwilling to give the House and the community the information to which they are entitled, concerning the cost of the measure or when it is going to be put into operation.</P>

      <P>The Minister can only answer for his own Party.  I am inclined to make a small bet with the Minister without wishing him an early political death, if we are to take his own words seriously, that he will have ceased to be a member of this House, and ceased to be a member of the Government before this Bill is fully <Col N="133" /> operative.  I should like the Minister, even now, to tell us when he hopes to have this measure in operation.  It is all the more necessary that we should have that information when we are told that this is only the first of a number of measures to deal with the public health.  Are we to come to the conclusion that this is merely window dressing, shadow boxing, or sham; that it is something like the national drainage Act, that will not commence for seven years and will not end for 30 years according to what we were told?  The Minister knows quite well that there is an urgent necessity for certain measures to deal with the health of the community.  I am not subscribing to the view that this measure as it stands is the proper way to go about doing that.  I am not saying that there are not good sections in the Bill, or that there are not parts in it that, given effect, would not beneficially affect the health of certain classes of people.  I am not going to go into the objectionable parts, but I believe that they far outweigh the good parts.  These are the Minister's considered proposals. I assume that the Bill was drafted after the fullest consideration, not only by the Parliamentary Secre-Government, but after the fullest consultation with the best authorities on public health, and that a stage was reached when the Parliamentary Secretary felt that he was able to draft the details of a Bill like this.  He must have felt that he was in earnest, and for that reason he should be in a position to tell the House, not only what it is going to cost but when it is going to be put into operation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>5.&mdash;(1)  By-laws made by a sanitary authority under and for the purpose of this Act shall be under their common seal and every by-law so <Col N="134" /> made may be amended or revoked by a subsequent by-law made pursuant to the provisions of this Act: Provided that a by-law so made by a sanitary authority shall not have any force or effect if repugnant to the provisions of this Act or to any law for the time being in force.</P>
    <P>(2)  By-laws made under this Act by a sanitary authority may provide for imposing on offenders against such by-laws such penalties, not exceeding five pounds, for each offence and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further penalty not exceeding forty shillings for each day on which the offence is continued, as they may think proper.</P>
    <P>(3)  By-laws made under this Act by a sanitary authority shall not take effect unless and until they have been submitted to and sanctioned by the Minister and the Minister is hereby empowered, subject to the provisions of the next succeeding sub-section of this section, to sanction or refuse to sanction, or to sanction subject to such modifications as may appear reasonable, any such by-laws.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister shall not sanction any by-laws submitted to him under the provisions of this Act by a sanitary authority unless he is satisfied that the following conditions in relation to the making of such by-laws have been complied with, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that notice of their intention to make application for such sanction has been given by the sanitary authority in one or more of the local newspapers circulating within the district to which such by-laws relate, one month at least before the making of such application; and</P>
    <P>(b)  that for one month, at least, before the making of such application, a copy of the proposed by-laws had been kept at the office of the sanitary authority and was available thereat during office hours for public inspection without fee or reward; and</P>
    <P>(c)  that the sanitary authority gave public notice in an adequate <Col N="135" /> manner that during the period of one month mentioned in this sub-section any person could, on making application to them, obtain a copy of the proposed by-laws on payment of one shilling and that every such application had been complied with.</P>
    <P>(5)  All by-laws made under this Act by a sanitary authority, or for purposes the same as or similar to those of this Act under any Local Act, shall be printed and kept prominently displayed in the office of such sanitary authority and a copy thereof shall, on the application of any person residing in the district to which such by-laws relate, be delivered to such person on the payment of one shilling.</P>
    <P>(6)  A copy of any by-laws made under this Act by a sanitary authority signed and certified by an authorised official of such sanitary authority to be a true copy of such by-laws and to have been duly sanctioned by the Minister shall, until the contrary is proved, be evidence in all legal proceedings of the validity of such by-laws without further or other proof.</P>
    <P>This Public Health Bill may be taken as an indication of the desire to give us a public health code right up to date, but the form in which this section has been drawn indicates that that purpose has been defeated.  What is still worse is the indication of a growing tendency towards legislation by reference.  As far as the section refers to by-laws, may I say that as by-laws will play a very important part in the operation of the Act, they should be drawn in such a form that they would be readily accessible to those concerned?  The only manner in which they will be available under this Bill will be by reference to previous Acts.  In a comprehensive Bill of this character, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary might have asked the Parliamentary draftsman to include a suitable section incorporating something on the lines I have taken the trouble to suggest in the amendment. I believe the feeling of the House is <Col N="136" /> that we should have something definite and emphatic in matters of this kind, rather than reference to previous Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the House appreciates that this is not, and does not purport to be a complete consolidation of the public health code.  It is very, very far from it.  A measure that would incorporate the public health law that operates here to-day would be a very much more comprehensive one than the Bill now before the House.  If there has been one complaint emphasised more than another, in the course of the debate on this Bill, it is that there is too much in it; that we should have divided it into a number of Bills.  In fact, it only repeals 15 Acts of Parliament, and consequently many statutory provisions in the existing law, some of them very old, must still remain in the code until such time as we are in a position to bring before the House a complete, consolidating measure.  Consequently, it is essential, seeing that we are not repealing the 1878 Act referred to in Section 5 or the particular sections in that Act relating to by-laws, that we must incorporate Section 5 in the Bill.  I do not want to criticise the Deputy's amendment.  I realise the spirit actuating him in drafting this amendment.  There are some minor defects in the sections of the 1878 Act, that he would wish to see repealed, but by-laws have been made under that Act in relation to various measures other than public health, and in order to maintain uniformity until such time as that 1878 Act disappears from our statutory code, it seems better not to have two codes governing our powers of making by-laws or the provisions that can be incorporated in those by-laws.  I have no criticism at all to offer as to the motive behind Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment, but we just cannot deal with every enactment in the public health code in this measure, because it is not a complete consolidating measure.  It has gone a substantial distance but, as I said on the Second Reading, this thing can only be done by stages; other measures will have to be introduced.  As confusing as it <Col N="137" /> has been to Deputies to try to keep abreast of the numerous principles that are embodied in this Bill, I think I have spared them somewhat anyhow by giving it to them in small doses because what is incorporated in the Bill is in fact a small dose when compared to the full public health code.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 18 (1), the Minister, for instance, may by Order declare a disease to be an infectious disease, and by reason solely of the Minister's Order various sections of the Bill will come into operation imposing penal effects on various people, giving him power to take people and to send them into institutions, power to keep people off the streets, power to keep people out of buses, placing bus drivers or <Col N="138" /> tram drivers in the position that if they did not obey the Order, or if they allowed such people to go on buses, they would be liable to penalties of one kind or another.  I think that any Order that the Minister would make of that particular kind should at least be an Order that could in a formal way be brought before the House for discussion and for decision as to whether the House agreed with the Order or not. The Bill provides that where the Minister makes a regulation there will be power by which a motion could be put before the House, and the regulation made by the Minister discussed, and, if it was thought suitable, the regulation annulled.  The amendment asks to have the Minister's Order put into the same position as the Minister's regulation, so that both the Minister's Orders and the Minister's regulations could be brought before this House for discussion, and if necessary for annulment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies who have read through this measure will have noticed, I am sure, that the matters in respect of which Ministerial Orders will fall to be made from time to time are very numerous indeed.  I am quite aware that Deputy Mulcahy does not challenge the propriety of that.  That machinery is necessary in order that administration should be carried out, but it is unusual to put that restriction upon the Minister that he must submit all these Orders to the House. It has been the practice to table in both Houses of the Oireachtas regulations made under various enactments, but I have no doubt Deputy Mulcahy would be interested to know that the Minister is not under any statutory obligation to lay regulations on the Table of the House under the public health code.  The practice has, in fact, been carried out and under the terms of this Bill it is proposed to make it a statutory requirement that regulations made under this Bill shall be laid on the Table of the House.  If it were necessary that I should put before the House in detail the various matters&mdash;many of them small matters &mdash;that have to be dealt with by Order, I think the House will agree that it would be unreasonable. <Col N="139" /> Deputy Mulcahy mentions powers under Section 18, that the Minister will have power to declare, under Section 18, by Order, that certain diseases are infectious diseases. It is not denied.  The wording of the section is quite clear but, under the existing law, not only has the Minister power to declare what is an infectious disease but a local authority has power to declare what is an infectious disease.</P>
      <P>I do not know why Deputy Mulcahy should seek to put this restriction on the Minister, a restriction that nobody considered necessary to impose on any Minister heretofore, a restriction that was not imposed on Deputy Mulcahy when he was Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Why all these restrictions should now be imposed is puzzling, at any rate, to say the least of it.  There may be, perhaps, a good reason.  If there is a good reason, then let us have the good reason and we could discuss it on that basis.  But I have yet to learn that either the previous Government or the present Government have abused the powers in relation to these public health matters that the law has reposed in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not known it in Deputy Mulcahy's time.  I have never suggested that, notwithstanding the fact that he had unlimited powers&mdash;I will probably have something to say later on as to the absence of any limitation on the powers he had to make regulations&mdash;he ever acted improperly.  Since the present Government came into office I do not think they have ever acted improperly in that regard.  Consequently, one must view with a certain amount of suspicion, anyhow, all this concentrated effort to ask the Minister to deliver the goods, to ask him to take all the necessary steps to ensure that infectious diseases will be stamped out or, at any rate, brought under control, but to tie him hand and foot after that. I do not take kindly to being bound up like that.  I do not think I have in a Ministerial capacity ever abused any power reposed in me.  I know I have not been accused of that and I do not suppose I will be accused of it.  But, if <Col N="140" /> the Minister can be trusted to act in a responsible way, why tie him up like this?  If he cannot be trusted to act in a responsible way, I am afraid you will have to appeal to the other tribunal, to the masters outside, to relieve the people of the burden of that Minister.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary suggests that he is going to be tied up if this Bill makes provision, when he issues an Order, that a Deputy may, if he thinks there is reason enough for it, table a motion asking that the Order be annulled so that the matter can be discussed here and the motion annulled, if the House considers it necessary.  I ask him, in the light of what he has said, to look at Section 13, under which a health authority must provide and maintain any institution which the Minister, by Order, asks them to provide and maintain. At the back of that is this great vision of £24,000,000 to be spent on public health institutions within a period of time foreseeable, at any rate, by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that, when he issues an Order like that requiring a local authority to provide an institution which they think they do not want but which he thinks they do, it will be tying him up to have a provision by which a Deputy can raise the matter in the House by a motion asking to have the Order annulled. The Parliamentary Secretary speaks of Orders as dealing with innumerable little things which have to be attended to, and says that they have been attended to in the past quite safely and securely without hurting anyone.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to direct <Col N="141" /> his attention to that section and to the section where he takes power, by Order, to define infectious diseases for various purposes and to treat infectious diseases as different classes of things for one reason or another affecting in very many ways the liberty and the responsibility of the individual.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary does not ask us to take the statement he has made seriously either in the light of Section 13 or of Section 18 or Section 19.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that there is no fear of the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary abusing his powers under this Bill or any other Bill.  When one sees the attitude which the Parliamentary Secretary adopts in this House towards a simple, straightforward amendment like this, one begins to wonder whether a person who reacts in that way can act in a fair and judicial way in relation to the operation of any section of this or any other Bill.  We have not got very far with this Bill yet.  A number of amendments have been debated.  They have not been debated in any heated way. Already, however, we have had the Parliamentary Secretary using the words &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo; in relation to more than one amendment. He talks about the suspicious mind of the movers or the framers of these amendments.  One gets the impression from the Parliamentary Secretary, as one gets it from his Minister, that he is impatient with any amendment being drafted or moved to any measure which he brings before the House.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary described the amendment as unusual; so is the Bill.  He wanted to know what were the grounds for the amendment. The Bill is sufficient ground for it. Deputy Mulcahy pointed out that one of the Orders which can be made by the Minister is an Order directing a local authority to build, equip and maintain any institution which he thinks is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may do that by an Order under this Bill, and, by an Order under the Local Government <Col N="142" /> Bill which is still before the House, if the local authority does not carry out that Order made by the Parliamentary Secretary, then they will be dealt with under the other Bill. I want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary, as I had to remind the Minister for Local Government, that we are not legislating merely for the political lifetime of the present Parliamentary Secretary or the present Minister. It is conceivable&mdash;I will not put it further than that&mdash;that a Minister for Local Government may make an Order directing the Dublin Corporation or the Tipperary County Council to erect an institution or institutions costing from £50,000 to £500,000.  He has power to do that.  Once he makes that Order, neither the local authority nor the Dáil can question it.  All that Deputy Mulcahy is seeking in a very reasonable way under this amendment is that some restriction will be placed on that, and this House will have some right, if they think it necessary, to deal with that Order when made.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, while he conceives that he has duties, and while he is very conscientious about his powers, so has every member of the House a duty.  It is our duty, from the point of view of the community, to make this Bill as watertight as we can.  It is the duty of this House to keep in their own hands as much control as they can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Whatever argument the Minister might make against amendment No. 20, the amendment we are discussing now alters only very slightly the section as it stands.  The two previous speakers have pointed out that Section 13 sets out that the Minister may by Order direct a health authority to provide whatever institutions he directs them to provide, and, without any suspicions and without feeling that I am entering into a conspiracy against the Minister, I, as representing the taxpayers, and being myself a taxpayer, think we must look at this with a certain amount of care and caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 13, the Minister has power to order these institutions to be crected and he can prescribe the specifications. In other words, he can direct <Col N="143" /> that an institution of a certain kind, automatically costing at present a very large sum of money, must be erected.  In that case, it is incumbent on Deputies to see that if an Order of this kind is made, its provisions will be available to the House and can, if the House thinks fit, be annulled.</P>
    <P>But not alone is Section 13 affected, but Section 86, under which section the Minister has power to make an Order applying the provisions in regard to inspection, which the local dispensary doctor is to carry out in national schools, to any school, no matter by whom it may be run.  School managers, college and convent authorities, and all other people dealing with the education of children look on that section with very grave misgivings.  Under the section, the Minister can by Order prescribe that these inspections and examinations shall take place, and, at the same time, these Orders apparently will not be made available, at any rate, to the Oireachtas.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider carefully the advisability of accepting this amendment which provides for placing the Orders before the House and for their amendment within 21 days, if the House thinks fit.  Anything previously done under them is not affected, and I think it only right that Deputies should endeavour to protect so far as possible the interests of the taxpayer and, particularly, in this case, of the ratepayer. For these reasons, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I also direct attention to other sections, under which, in addition to making Orders declaring certain diseases to be infectious and ordering the local authorities to provide certain, perhaps unwanted, institutions, the Minister may make Orders providing that there may be one or more assistant county medical officers, and one or more assistant city medical officers, and may by Order provide also that certain articles shall not be imported into this country?  He may restrict the importation, manufacture or sale of certain articles.  He may also by Order impose certain duties on joint health authorities.  Many of these <Col N="144" /> Orders involve very serious problems and nearly all of them involve matters of expense and very heavy expense to local authorities which have no voice or say in the matter at all.  A local authority has simply to comply, or, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, be abolished.  In these circumstances, it is only right that Orders of a general character should be subject to some review, and the only forum in which they may be reviewed and discussed is this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main argument against acceptance of the amendment, as I gathered it, is that the tabling of these Orders would unduly hamper or obstruct administrative business.  I can very well understand that the tabling of Orders, so far as day to day routine work is concerned, would possibly have that effect, but major or fundamental matters are quite different and one of these has been quoted in relation to Section 18, as well as Section 13.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the local authorities already had such powers in connection with the framing of these Orders.  That is perfectly true, but I suggest&mdash;and the whole purport of the Bill is so designed&mdash;that there will be a new approach to public health and matters relating to public health arising out of the Bill.  The country will be very keenly interested in what will emerge from this House as the Public Health Act.  The Parliamentary Secretary may disabuse his mind straightaway of any idea of a personal approach by members of the Opposition in their attempts to improve any section.  I suggest that that is what members of the Opposition are here for, more particularly having regard to the controversy which the Bill as a whole has aroused.  Those of us who have manifested our interest by tabling amendments are merely giving effect to what we feel is our duty to our constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of Orders, a considerable amount of the time of the House was occupied in the recent past with these matters, and the Taoiseach himself has given expression to a certain amount of anxiety as to the effect of the non-tabling or the inaccessibility <Col N="145" /> of these Orders, and surely matters of major importance, as distinct from the day-to-day routine matters of the Department, to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, should, for the protection of the citizen, be laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We should appreciate that if we here, as the supreme authority, feel it necessary, in the public interest, to give certain powers to Ministers, if there is a demand for increased services and in providing these services it is necessary to vest greater powers in individuals, it is for that reason all the more essential that the House, in granting these powers, should ensure that the necessary safeguards are provided as well.  I am not suggesting that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister desires deliberately to abuse any power given to him, but there is a responsibility on this House to provide, in the interests of the individual and of the community, the necessary safeguards, because in this measure we are empowering the Minister by Order to interfere with the personal liberties of the individual.</P>
      <P>It can be argued that this interference with personal liberties is in the public interest, in order to prevent the spread of infection and so on, but the moment you interfere with them, it is vital that the House should provide every possible safeguard to ensure that these liberties and rights of the individual will not be abused, to ensure that whatever interference takes place is essential and that it will not go beyond what is absolutely essential.  The Bill gives the Minister a good deal of power, not only with regard to individuals but with regard to local authorities. The House should not stand for a sort of machinery that is absolutely bureaucratic, where the people and their representatives are completely ignored.  We should not allow a situation to develop where the Minister can make an Order, satisfied that there is bureaucratic machinery there to operate it, and the local representatives have no power in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has extraordinary power under Section 13.  Regardless of the financial capacity of a particular county, he can direct, in any circumstances, <Col N="146" /> that that local authority must provide certain institutions.  As Minister for Public Health, concerned merely with the health of the public, he is not concerned with the economic aspects.  It is proposed to deny to the local authority any say in the matter. The Minister provides a perfect machinery for the bureaucratic operation of the Bill.  Once his Order issues, it is positive that it will be implemented. We give a lot of lip service to democracy, but if we believe in democracy at all, we cannot stand for machinery which is going to operate on those lines.  Whatever Orders or regulations are made must be tabled in this House and the House must reserve its right to annul those Orders if they think it necessary to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the difficulties we are facing in regard to the particular matter before us at the moment come from a certain lack of discrimination between what is important and essential for carrying out the provisions of this Bill and what are largely matters of administration.  If we could have some approach by the Parliamentary Secretary to an understanding of the basis of the very Bill he has put before the House, we might make more progress.  While the debate has been going on, I have been checking the sections under which the Minister is entitled to make Orders, and also checking those in which he makes regulations.  It appears that the most important parts of the Bill, those dealing with infectious disease, will not come into operation at all until the Minister makes an Order.  Yet there is no obligation to place that Order before the House, not for the purpose of curtailing the freedom of action of the Minister but merely to afford this House, as the representative body of the citizens, an opportunity to consider and, if necessary, discuss the full implications and effects of the Order. That is denied to us.  But if the Minister decides, by Order, to dispose of bodies other than by burial, we can have a whole day's debate.  We can discuss what is being done with the dead bodies but not what is being done with the living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be some lack of consistency. <Col N="147" /> I can understand the Parliamentary Secretary objecting&mdash;and probably I would support him&mdash;in having to place every Order on the Table of the House.  Quite a number of them would deal with matters of a trivial nature, as, for instance, whether an officer should be an assistant in a particular county area or city area.  However, there is also a whole lot of questions of principle which are dealt with by Order, declaring whether a particular disease is infectious or not, the excluding of the operation of infectious disease from certain sections, the means by which local authorities carry out the disinfestation of persons, the question of giving to the Gárda Síochána the carrying out of certain provisions of the Bill, the question raised by Deputy Cosgrave of applying the Public Health (Medical Treatment of Children) (Ireland) Act to certain schools.  All these are fundamental questions.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary has an objection to embodying the word &ldquo;Order&rdquo; in this particular section, and thereby placing on the Minister the responsibility of laying every Order on the Table of the House, that objection could be met to a very large degree by changing the word &ldquo;Order&rdquo; to &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; in certain of the basic sections of the Bill, as we go through it.  In that way, those particular sections in which we would be interested would be covered and we would have an opportunity, when decisions were taken by the Minister, to bring them before the House, if a Deputy thought it necessary to raise the matter.  In so far as certain of these basic features of the Bill are going to be dealt with by Order, it is only fair and proper that members of the House should have an opportunity to debate them.  It may be suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary that that would imply that there would be a certain amount of senseless and useless discussion on purely administrative Orders; but from our experience here we find that every day there are documents laid on the Table and it is seldom that the time of the House is <Col N="148" /> occupied in dealing with them unless there is some fundamental point which a particular Deputy wishes to bring forward.</P>
    <P>The fact that Orders under this Bill would be laid on the Table of the House, even though they might be dealing with very important questions of principle, should not in itself give rise to the feeling that the freedom of action of the Minister to carry out and apply the provisions of the Bill would be drastically interfered with.  If we are going to make an approach to public health in general in this country, it is essential there should be, not only on the part of the members of the House but on the part of the public as a whole, a spirit of co-operation to carry out any legislation passed by this House.  There should be realisation that, whenever decisions are taken by the Minister, even though he may be enjoying the full authority of this House and have the authority given to his Party in the course of elections, there is an opportunity to any citizen, acting through a representative of the House, to have a particular matter raised here and discussed in the ordinary way and have its weak or strong points dealt with.  In that way the submission of any citizen or sections of citizens can be brought to the attention of the responsible Minister in time to have the matter amended or rectified as required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from unmeant wording and unmeant phrases about going on suspicion, the only argument this House is asked to consider seriously is the one set out in the phrase &ldquo;it would be an impediment to action&rdquo;.  The force of the amendment ought to be considered in relation to the section in respect of which it was moved.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself has brought into this House a proposed piece of legislation which contains a provision that regulations made are to be laid before the House. The full obligation put upon him is only to be observed by those who read the section through.  He is to put them before the House &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and he carries on under the regulations; but he is subject to this, that if a resolution annulling the <Col N="149" /> regulation is passed within 21 days, then the regulation is annulled &ldquo;without prejudice to anything already done&rdquo;.  What is the impediment to action?  Even Deputies Larkin and O'Sullivan, who have spoken in a way that can be appreciated by all in this House, have accepted that there is some impediment to action.  What is it?</P>
      <P>I do not suppose, in making a regulation or Order, the Parliamentary Secretary is coming back without some piece of writing.  If he has some piece of writing, all he has to do is to have it dropped before the authorities governing procedure in this House and it is listed on the Order Paper and thereafter appears in the Library.  Unless the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary intend to operate on the basis of something they have conceived in their own minds and not committed to paper, there is no impediment. There is no impediment after they are laid until a resolution is passed, and whatever impediment there is the authorities responsible for this measure have accepted it in regard to regulations.</P>
      <P>I take up now what Deputy Larkin has suggested, but I will add that it is impossible to find any line of principle through this measure as between regulation and Order.  The two most hotly contested parts of the measure are those which deal with making a disease an infectious disease and the pivoting of what is an infectious disease, and the sections which relate to that matter, notably the notorious Section 21.  All turns on an Order. Presumably that Order is not going to be put in writing; it is going to be regarded as a matter of labour if it has to be put in writing to bring it before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second notorious section in the Bill is the one which enables the Minister to have school children inspected, if necessary, naked, without their own medical officer of health being present, without their parents' wish having been sought or obtained.  The medical officer imposed on these people by the Parliamentary Secretary is going to come in and, without the slightest co-operation on the part of the child, subject <Col N="150" /> it to a compulsory medical examination, possibly nude.  The Minister hopes that the medical officer will be able to get into the back history of the child in order to find out what it might be suffering from.</P>
    <P>All these sections pivot upon an Order.  Why should not we have that Order put before the House, particularly when all that is required to be done is to have it put before the House, the procedure to flow on until the House has passed a resolution annulling what is proposed?  I suggest that what Deputy Larkin has suggested should be carried out.  There is one point to be noted here.  This might end in a prosecution through which a person may lose his liberty.  I say that whether you call it an Order or a regulation, it is something that should come before the House.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asked why should there be so much antagonism to this.  I do not call it antagonism to suggest that, through the House, the public should be given some opportunity to know what is in the mind of the authority dealing with this measure.  All we ask is to give us publicity. Let us know what is happening. Some of us may decide to raise the matter by way of resolution.  So far as I can recollect, there has been no resolution annulling a regulation of that type in the lifetime of this Dáil. But it is surely right that these things should be brought before the House so that they may be brought to the notice of the people, particularly any matters relating to a possible prosecution and the loss of liberty of the citizen.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asked for reasons why there should be a certain prejudice.  Let me say that men were under sentence of death on foot of an Order that had not been even published.</P>

      <P>After all, this is a very comprehensive Bill, there is a big number of amendments to it and a large number of them are tabled by the Minister, and if we are to make progress in getting this Bill enacted, as the Parliamentary Secretary hopes, I think he ought to meet the House in a reasonable way.  A very sensible suggestion was made by Deputy Larkin in order to get over what the Parliamentary Secretary described as his difficulty, namely, that he might be called upon to table Orders of a very minor or routine nature.  It would be possible to get over that difficulty by having Orders of a major nature defined as regulations and thus bring them within the scope of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has agreed to table every regulation made, and I think he ought to recognise that many of the regulations that will be made under the Bill will be of a minor nature, whereas many of the Orders will be of a very fundamental and important character.  Indeed, they are the most important matters in the Bill and they will bring into force the most important and most drastic sections of the Bill.  I think a case <Col N="152" /> has been put up to the Parliamentary Secretary which he ought to meet in a reasonable way.</P>

      <P>he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>

When the Parliamentary Secretary issues an Order, and if he defines scabies as an infectious disease under this Bill, he does so without any publication of the fact to this House. If we are going to have this measure put through by the Parliamentary Secretary sitting dumb, and not helping us in spite of my appeal to members of the Party behind him to help, then it is going to be a very sad state of affairs.

      <P>I am pressing the <Col N="156" /> amendment for this reason, that under Section 13 the Minister can order a local body to set up any institution that he dictates; under Section 14 he may, by Order, tell a local body to discontinue any institution that he dictates them to discontinue; and under Section 18, by Order, he can declare any disease to be an infectious disease, as a result of which, under Section 19, a person may be fined £50.</P>

      <P>I was talking about a lodging-house keeper under a later section.  Under Section 19 a person who is a probable source of infection to a disease that the Minister declares to be infectious may, because he is supposed not to have taken sufficient precautions, be fined £50. Under Section 21 parents may suffer penalties of fines because they send their children to school or to church or other places.  There are penalties under Sections 27 and 28.  Under Section 31 the Minister may by Order require local authorities to keep certain machinery for disinfestation.  He may order them to keep certain transport under Section 33.  Under Section 83 he may by Order require local authorities to carry out by advertisement a health campaign or he may make them put up notices or circulate pamphlets or hold lectures or do work by radio or cinema exhibitions, and the House will have no information at all about it.  Under Section 84 he may order joint action by certain health authorities.  Under Section 89 he may restrict the importation or the manufacture of certain articles or instruments. Under Section 101 he may prevent the treatment of people in certain institutions.  Under Section 105 he may require the Guards to carry out work that would be properly the duties of the health authorities.  All these things may be done by Order and we ask that the Order be put in the same position as the regulations of the Minister in that, when he issues an <Col N="157" /> Order, he may proceed to act on that Order but that within a limited period the Order will be placed before this House and that there will be an opportunity, if it is thought necessary, of discussing the Order here so that <Col N="158" /> the Order can be annulled.  It is because of the importance of the matters that the Minister proposes to deal with by Order that we press this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22 on behalf of Deputy Costello:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>All the powers, functions and duties conferred or imposed on local authorities by or under this Act, or any regulation or Order made thereunder, shall be reserved functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> Put briefly, the purpose of the amendment is to see that this Bill, which will impose such very heavy responsibilities, and particularly such heavy financial responsibility, on local authorities, shall not be run merely by the Minister and the county manager or the city manager, as the case may be; that the functions shall be exerciseable by the elected representatives of the people.  I think that any Deputy who has read this Bill, or who will advert to the obligations which may be put on local authorities, will agree that the functions should be reserved functions.  I do not want to drag in the Local Government Bill again; I merely want to make a passing reference to it.</P>
    <P>That Bill, which is at present going through the House, has a very close affiliation with the Bill now before us. I am not so sure that the Local Government Bill was not introduced because this Bill was coming before the House. Remember, that the Minister may now, by Order, such Order not even being laid before this House, put on local authorities obligations which will call for very heavy financial outlay and the local authorities will have no say in that matter.  A great part of the machinery contained in this Bill, in the event of this amendment not being accepted, will be operated by the Minister and by the county manager or the city manager, as the case may be. Now, whatever independence the county manager or the city manager has, when the Local Government Bill becomes an Act the county manager or the city manager will be little more than a creature of the Minister.  It has been said here already to-night that we talk a lot in this country about democracy and that we keep up the pretence of local government.  If we impose on local authorities heavy obligations and the responsibility for finding very large sums of money by heavily increased rates, we certainly ought to give them some voice in that matter or do away with the sham of having local authorities at all.  I do not want to labour this matter.</P>
    <P>I think this amendment is one which speaks for itself.  We know that, in an effort to make men who had an interest <Col N="160" /> in local government go forward for election and take their places on local bodies in the last three or four years, following on the passage of the County Management Act, the Department of Local Government went to some trouble and expense to get out an elaborate White Paper, setting out the responsible functions which were still reserved to local authorities.  They made it their principal point that local authorities retained the power of the purse; in other words, that they were in full control of the striking of the rate.  They are not now, and will be still less so when the Local Government Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>We have seen evidence already this year of most local authorities having been compelled substantially to increase the rates.  If and when the Bill is put into operation, the rates will have to go far higher than they are to-day, and the elected representatives of the people, who are supposed to deal with their local problems and to be responsible for local government, will have no more say in matters affecting local government, affecting the rate or the size of the rate, than the person standing at the street corner who never sought election at all.  If even the pretence of local government is to be retained, I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary can refuse to accept this amendment.  If it is the intention to have this Bill machined and carried through merely by the Minister and the county manager, then of course the amendment will be rejected.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary if he has a case to make against the amendment and I hope that he will at least extend to the House&mdash; I will put it no stronger than this&mdash;the courtesy of giving reasons for his not accepting it.  Ministers have certain powers and they have certain dignity, but they also have certain duties.  They are fond, both Minister and Parliamentary Secretaries, of talking about their responsibility to the people and their full recognition of the fact that they are responsible to the people. That means, of course, in effect, that they are responsible to this House which represents the people, and the Parliamentary Secretary and others should get it into <Col N="161" /> their minds once and for all that this House does not consist solely of members of the Government Party, that the people who sit on this side of Opposition are representatives of the people also, and representatives practically of as many people as the Government Party itself.</P>
    <P>When we speak about majority and minority votes, it ought to be recognised that the Government sits as the Government of the day by favour of a minority of the total vote of this country.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to accept this amendment, he ought to give his reasons, and they ought to be considered reasons.  This is an amendment which should commend itself to any person in the House who has any regard for local government.  If we are to deny to the elected representatives of the people on county councils, corporations, urban councils and other local authorities any real say in legislation passed in this House affecting them, that is an end of local government.</P>

      <P>As recently as last Friday week, the Taoiseach impressed on the Opposition the importance of discussion in this House, of threshing out legislation, of seeking by their views to impress upon the Government Benches the importance of what they have to say, but apparently the Parliamentary Secretary is immune from the Taoiseach's advice and does not intend to follow it.  A new stunt is being tried on here&mdash;to treat with the silence of contempt what is said from these benches.  If that be so, we shall talk until the cows come home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> The amendment is based on the principle that he who pays the piper has the right to call the tune.  The only power left to a local authority under the Bill&mdash;apparently the Minister has overlooked the possibility of taking it away from them&mdash;is the power to make by-laws.  That is one of the reserved functions of a local authority, and under Part VIII of the Bill, a local authority may make by-laws relating to such matters as public bathing, bathing places and wash-houses.  Otherwise, a local authority has no voice, good, bad or indifferent, in the implementation of this Bill.  The Minister may decide that a particular local authority should erect a public health institution at a cost of perhaps £100,000 or £200,000.  The local authority may have very vigorous and very definite views on that question and may not see eye to eye with the Minister, but if the Minister makes an Order, the local authority must execute that Order, or be abolished.</P>
    <P>In actual practice, however, what will happen is that, these matters being executive functions, the Minister or his officials in the Custom House will direct officialdom in the country to carry out the Order, and that is an end to the matter.  There is no voice to be heard from the local authority and no discussion on the matter.</P>
    <P>A public authority may protest; it may refuse to find the money; and then, under the provisions of an Emergency Powers Order or under the provisions of the new Local Government Bill, when it becomes law, it may be abolished, and the Minister and his bureaucrats will simply carry on and ignore the vigorous viewpoints of the local representatives, just as he is ignoring the viewpoint of the Opposition here to-night.  It is only right and reasonable that, where an important matter of this kind is at issue, there should be freedom of discussion and facility for discussion.  Before any Orders are made, some recognition should be given to the local viewpoint. It is quite possible that the Parliamentary Secretary, being a professional man, may take the experts' view in his Department as against the lay view.  That expert opinion may be 50 <Col N="163" /> years in advance of public opinion and may be forced, through the Minister, on the country and, perhaps, in that way irreparable harm may be done.  In all these matters, the right of the local authority which has to find the money should be upheld and they should have at least the opportunity of discussing these matters in all their aspects.  This amendment is seeking to preserve that right for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Deputies on the Government Benches are conspicuous by their absence to-day&mdash;whether by design or otherwise, I cannot say.  Those of them who are members of local authorities will in the very near future have to face this issue in their constituency. I want to sound a word of warning to those gentlemen, that they would at least sit up and take notice of where they are going and what this is going to mean in actual practice.  It simply means that officialdom in the Custom House will dictate to officialdom in the country and that the voice of the people will be suppressed.  If the Minister is prepared to accept any viewpoint of an expert in the Custom House, that viewpoint will be forced on the people in the country, without their having an opportunity to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to it.  I ask Deputies if that is a position into which the public representatives of the people should be forced.  Is that not the very negation of a public representation?  Is it not the very negation of democratic control? It used to be held that whoever controlled the purse, even though only once a year, had some effective say in local administration.</P>
    <P>Now, we have not even that say, as the Minister is able now, under the present Emergency Powers Orders and will be able later, under the Local Government Act, to strike a second or third budget if he finds it necessary, or if he finds a local authority recalcitrant and refusing to give him money for certain measures.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, reaching the position that the only place and time this matter may be discussed is here and now.  The local authority will have no opportunity to discuss it, and we have no opportunity except, perhaps, once a <Col N="164" /> year on the Estimates for the Department. I put it to Deputies that this is a very serious issue&mdash;the old issue of taxation without representation. The Minister may impose on the local authorities new institutions costing colossal sums, against their will, against their advice and against their better judgment.  He may impose all sorts of charges for maintenance in those institutions, against their will, against their advice and against their better judgment.  Nothing can be done about it.  When we are faced with that position here to-night and these matters are raised, the Minister chooses to remain silent&mdash;obviously because he has no answer, because he cannot face these issues, because he wishes to force this measure down the throats of Deputies in a new form of closure.  If that is his policy, if he is going to be persistently silent through the debate on this Bill, I would suggest to Deputies here to become more vocal&mdash;so vocal that the Minister will be forced into saying something before the debate is finished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to be stricken with dumbness, or rather with a particular form of dumbness which implies inability to speak.  It is difficult to know whether he is accepting this amendment or not.  If he is not accepting it, it would be interesting to hear what reasons he has to give. It is due to this House that he should meet representatives of all Parties in a reasonable way and seek to justify the measures which he proposes to put before us.  In another section a reasonable suggestion was put by representatives of the Labour Party, who can hardly claim to be out to obstruct the Bill, but the Parliamentary Secretary neither accepted the proposal nor gave any reason for not accepting.  He may tell us that he has 70 odd reasons which he can use in opposition to any amendment put forward.  He has only to ring the bell and those 70 odd reasons will come into the House-and some of them, as he will admit, are very odd. That is not the way to treat this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister flatly refused, at the inception stage of this Bill, to tell us the liabilities which will be imposed upon the local rates.  He gave one <Col N="165" /> particular item, in respect of the nursing service, but did not give any indication as to the liability which will be imposed on ratepayers under other sections of the Bill, those which provide for the establishing of new institutions and which provide for the maintenance of relatives of patients in various institutions.  Whatever this Bill costs the ratepayers, the representatives of the people should have the right to implement the various sections.  This amendment seeks to ensure that they will have that power, but the Parliamentary Secretary has not indicated yet whether he is going to meet us in that respect or whether he is going to say that all the enormous powers which are vested in him and in the local authorities will be exercised through officials of the Minister, namely, the county managers.  It is about time the rights of the elected representatives of the people were recognised and that those representatives were treated as such and not as members of the Fianna Fáil Party, to be herded into the division lobbies behind a silent Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

If I try to meet the Opposition viewpoint, I am wrong.  If I do not try to meet the Opposition viewpoint, apparently I am wrong too. No matter what way I turn, I will be wrong anyhow in the eyes of the Opposition.  I venture to say that I will not be too far wrong in the eyes of the public, and I will not be too far <Col N="167" /> wrong in the eyes of the Church, notwithstanding the anxiety of all those pillars of the Faith on the Opposite Benches.</P>
      <P>Now, we are asked in this amendment, this innocent looking amendment, in the spirit of co-operation that Deputy Mulcahy talks to me about, radically to amend the County Management Act.  Deputies are aware that Section 16 of the County Management Act, in the Second Schedule, sets out the functions that are reserved to the local authorities.  This amendment suggests that these functions, in so far as they relate to public health, should be altered.  The suggestion is that the whole basis of the structure should be altered.  Is that helpful?  Is it meant to be helpful, or is it meant to be constructive? Of course it is not.  Is it a constructive suggestion that, in so far as public health is concerned, certain functions should be reserved and, so far as local government and general administration are concerned, that a different type of function should be reserved.  Bear in mind, in case you should forget it, that the County Management Act has been adopted by this House, by this democratic Parliament, and the Government that was responsible for the County Management Act has got the approval of the people.  I am asked, innocently, by the amendment from the Opposition Party, to abandon the whole principle of the County Management Act in so far as public health matters are concerned.</P>

      <P>That is put forward in a spirit of co-operation and construction. I cannot co-operate to that extent. So long as the County Management Act remains on the Statute Book, it will apply to the public health functions of the Minister to the same extent and in the same manner as it applies to his other functions.  It could not be otherwise, and if Deputies think they will deceive anybody here or outside by their attitude on this Bill, they are making the biggest mistake of their lives, and they are welcome to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary's silence or his bad-tempered attempt at a speech is the more objectionable. Certainly, his silence, bad and all as it is, is probably much more helpful to the proper discussion of this Bill, which is going to affect the lives of thousands of our people, than the irrelevant, bad-tempered speech to which we have just listened.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not deal with the amendment.  He talked about the amendment being put forward in an innocent way.  It is so framed that it ought to be understood even by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It does not seek to do anything like what the Parliamentary Secretary suggests regarding the County Management Act, but it does seek to retain for the elected representatives of the people some little authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real objection to this amendment is that it is deliberately designed to see that this measure, when it becomes law, will not be operated solely by the officials in the Custom House and the officials of the local authorities.  When I talk about the officials of local authorities I mean the county managers and city managers.  I will emphasise this, that when the Local Government Bill becomes law, the city and county managers will be as completely the creatures of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister as if they were merely officials working in the Custom House-mere penny boys. The Parliamentary Secretary talks about this democratic Parliament. Mind you, there has been very little democracy in what we have been discussing here since the beginning of this year.  There has been very little democracy in the measures put before the House, and the measures we have been discussing in the main for the last two months have been taking the last shred of local government and democracy away from this country.  The Parliamentary Secretary gets annoyed and loses his temper and utters words which, I hope, on reflection, he will be sorry for having uttered, but, knowing <Col N="169" /> the Parliamentary Secretary both in power and in Opposition for nearly 19 years in this House, and having listened to him just now, I am afraid he has not learned much in those 19 years.</P>
    <P>We have every reason to talk about the fear of bureaucracy and dictatorship when we see the last shred of local government being removed.  Deputies should make up their minds about this, that if local government is killed all democratic government will be killed.  We cannot have complete centralisation at the Custom House and retain a democratic Parliament and democratic government here.  Local representatives are elected on the same franchise and by the same people as Deputies.  The people are considered capable of electing to this House representatives who are able to legislate for the country as a whole, representatives who are fit to form a government, and fit to control Departments, but the same people are, in effect, told that they are incapable of selecting those capable of administering Acts passed by this House.</P>
    <P>I say that this House, through the Minister, is suggesting that the elected representatives of Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation, or the council of any county in the State, are unfitted to administer the Bill.  If that is so, then we are unfitted to discuss or to pass the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary is not dealing with a frivolous amendment now.  He is dealing with something fundamental, but he has not been able to grasp that.  He talks of political play-acting.  If it is play-acting to seek to retain for the representatives of the people whatever little authority is still left to them, then I plead guilty to that type of play-acting. What I consider to be political play-acting in the real sense, is to have the Minister getting up and mouthing about democracy and local government and, at the same time, removing the last shred of democracy that it is within his power to remove.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise what he is seeking here?  Under <Col N="170" /> Section 13 there is power to maintain certain institutions.  Is action going to be taken there by the manager, on the Minister's Order, and irrespective of the local representatives, or is it the function of local representatives to deal with the Minister on matters arising under the section?  Section 15 deals with the Minister's Order to discontinue certain health institutions.  Is that a matter between the Minister and the county representatives, or one between himself and the county manager? Under Section 15 health authorities, in lieu of not providing institutions, may make arrangements with another body to use institutions that are not necessarily in their area.  Is that to be a matter for the county manager or for the local representatives? Under Section 16 charges are set out or decided which must be paid by the people receiving institutional service under the health authorities. Are these charges to be decided by the county manager or by the local authority? Rules are made under Section 17 for the regulation of patients in institutions, and for admission on special terms as to payment and accommodation. Is that a matter for the county manager to decide or for the elected representatives of the people?</P>
      <P>According to Section 34, where a person suffers from an infectious disease or is undergoing treatment, but is unable to make reasonable provision for his maintenance, is that matter to be decided by the county manager or by the elected representatives?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary point to any provision in the Bill which is not a matter that ought to be decided by the elected representatives of the people or by any local authority rather than by the manager?  That is what is at issue here and that is why the amendment is moved.  What I have mentioned are matters on which we should have a direct answer from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Under what Order or regulation is it reasonable to demand from Dublin Corporation £168,000 for the hospital treatment of necessitous patients?  What power had the corporation to refuse that demand?  The <Col N="171" /> Minister agreed with the corporation to accept the equivalent of 1/- in the £ in the rates to cover that demand. There is an outcry in the newspapers about this matter and a public meeting is being held in the Mansion House to-night, condemning in all its moods and tenses, the Dublin Corporation and its elected representatives, who are being forced to agree to levy the extra 1/- in the £ on the rates.  The Minister almost put a pistol at the heads of the corporation.  I want to know if the Minister has power to make that demand, and what is the intention, if this Bill goes through without the amendment being accepted?  What powers are being left to the corporation or the local authorities?  Have they power to fix the amount of the rates?  Have they any reserved functions?  As a public representative for many years I say that the Minister has filched all power that the corporation had within the past couple of months.  The position was brought to a head this week by Dublin Municipal Council having reluctantly to accede to the demand that was made upon them.  The original demand for the hospitals would have increased rates in Dublin by 1/9 in the £, but the Minister eventually agreed to accept 1/-.  Surely some Deputy ought to be in a position to explain what power is being left to local representatives?</P>

I want to emphasise this point, that the <Col N="172" /> most important of these 22 reserved functions was the striking of the rate once a year.  That power is now gone because, if the Custom House tells the manager, &ldquo;You must get more money from the local authority&rdquo;, and the local authority refuses the manager or the Minister, then the Minister has power to introduce a second budget. So that the power of the purse has been transferred from the local representatives of the people on the local authorities to the Custom House.  Now, of the other powers, eight were related to town planning; one related to the making of by-laws and, as far as I remember, one related to the promotion of litigation or the defence of the local authority in litigation and the conferring of the freedom of the city on distinguished strangers, and things of that kind&mdash;all very unimportant functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are seeking to add a few powers to the 22 topics upon which the local authority may legislate. We are seeking to give the local authority back some little power. Other Ministers have introduced measures quite recently into this House imposing certain duties on local authorities and making these duties reserved functions.  We are not in any sense seeking to distort the whole principle of the Local Government Act of 1941, or the County Management Act. We are not attempting to do any such thing.  We are merely attempting in this to preserve to the local authority <Col N="173" /> the power which they should have, the power of the purse, the power to have some voice in the raising of the money, even if it be at the behest or at the order or ukase of the Minister.  That is all we are seeking to do and in that we are not play-acting.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a local authority, the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council. I regard it as an insult to our intelligence and to the intelligence of the people who sent us there, that we have no powers other than those I have named, that we simply go there to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the manager if the manager simply takes us into his confidence.  On the other hand, we have a Minister for Local Government quite obviously afraid of the limits to which they have gone in shearing local authorities of their powers and sending circulars to his managers, town clerks, and secretaries of county councils, to be read at the meetings of the local authorities, impressing upon those local authorities the importance of the duties which have been left to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear to any intelligent person who takes the trouble to study these matters that we have gone too far east; that instead of controlling and supervising local government, as was the original intention, we have shorn the local authority of any control or of any supervision or any authority in local government, and we have transferred the entire authority, lock, stock and barrel, to the Custom House.  All we are seeking to do here is to stop that tendency, to ensure that in any measures that come before this House, where duties are imposed upon the local authority, at least these duties would be given to them as reserved functions.  It is a complete distortion of the case to say that we are play-acting and that we are dishonest in this matter.  I, as a member of a local authority, am very keen on this matter&mdash;very, very keen, because, from my knowledge of local administration, I feel that we have reached this position, that the local government service has become a part of the centralised Civil Service, and that it is a misnomer to refer to the local government service any longer.  That service is entirely controlled from the Custom House&mdash; managers, secretaries, town clerks and <Col N="174" /> accountants are shifted about all over the counties as mere draughts on the Custom House draughtsboard.  The local authority has no say&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;in the matter.  During the past three years we have had at least three of our town clerks transferred to various important positions on promotion.  We are a nursery for other local authorities.  They no sooner begin to know their job in Dun Laoghaire than they are sent to Roscommon, Cork or Wicklow.</P>

They have to find the money or the greater part of the money and it is only right and proper that the principle of taxation as it was hitherto known in every country should obtain, that there should be no taxation without representation, that those people whose representatives are there to voice their grievances, opinions or feelings about the matter should have the right to express themselves on these matters and, if necessary, refuse the money when they feel there is no case for its being raised.</P>

      <P>The Minister is charging us on this side with dishonesty in proposing these amendments and this particular amendment which we are now discussing.  In essence, it is to restore the power of the purse to the people who find the money.  If we go back to the time when the people got that power, I think we will find that they got it from King John.  I believe that that is the time when control of money matters was given to the elected Parliament of the people.  This year we have gone back here to the time before King John.  The Parliamentary Secretary thinks that that is quite an unimportant matter.  It is a very important matter.  Public representatives have ceased to have the power of the purse.  They cannot say that rates levied in their area are too much for them.  They cannot say that they do not wish for certain things or will not pay for them.</P>

    <P>I submit that that is about the most important piece of legislation that has ever been passed in this House.  On a point of order, I think, Sir, you told Deputy Coogan that there was nothing about that in this Bill.  I take it that it started in the Local Government Bill, and that it has been continued in this Bill.  This Bill is taking the power of the purse from the people so far as public health is concerned.  I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary will plead that he is an elected representative of the people, and that he is not in the position King John was in, namely, that he can do what he likes.  But, so far as the public are concerned, the Government are going to dispose of the funds raised without the consent of the <Col N="178" /> elected representatives of the people and without the control of this Dáil.  If that is not an important matter, I do not know what is.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this matter, but the perversion of history which I have just listened to from Deputy Dockrell brings me to my feet.  Runnymede was not a strike on behalf of the people.  It was a very successful strike on behalf of the barons in those days.  The barons were not the people.  They were a certain number of upstarts more or less of the type of Parliamentary Secretaries. I am not speaking now with any sense of indignity.  They were lifted a bit above the people.  They struck to get powers for themselves, and struck very successfully.  But the people were not in it, any more than the people are in the local government system at this moment.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the arguments put forward in this matter.  The only one I recognised as having any force is one with which I disagree, that this is an attempt to get back from the county manager system.  It is not.  If it were, I would welcome it all the more strongly.  It is an attempt to prevent more power being given than ever was intended to be given to county managers.  That is the beginning and the end of it.  We have had an extension of that power.  We have seen two fundamental changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has been put so strongly that there is no necessity to repeat it, namely, that the county manager in the future is not to be regarded as any sort of an independent person whatever, but a person who obeys an order. The second is that the power previously held by those who represented the people, the power to strike the rate, is taken not merely from them, but from the county manager.  It is to reside entirely and completely in the hands of a member of the Government. We seek by this to put our feet down and say that that is a bad tendency to which we have objected, and that we do not want that tendency to proceed any further.  We certainly want to get out from the control of the county manager or the Minister, and we want to reserve to the representatives <Col N="179" /> of the people all the matters dealing with public health which are proposed in this measure.</P>
    <P>That is a very small part of the changes which I would like to bring into the whole county manager system. When the matter was first thought of, the only good general idea that found ready acceptance was that, instead of a multiplicity of persons administering an area, we might give administrative power to one.  But certainly the people's representatives were supposed to be still in the background to determine policy and, particularly, to carry out that function that representatives of the people are generally given, namely to determine what amount of money would be provided for certain purposes in accordance with their policy.  We are going violently away from all these things.  There is general approval of the view that we should get back to the old system of having people's representatives elected on a proper basis and giving them the control of policy and, consequently, giving them the control of the money with which to carry out that policy.  So far as I can further that change, I will further it to the best of my ability. It will be a welcome change, and I think it will be all the more readily accepted by the people once they have seen the excess to which the control of the purse is drifting towards certain people in this country, which is far beyond anything the barons won.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary accused Deputies on this side of the House of being dishonest.  I think he said they were play-acting. But if anybody is play-acting, it is the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government, who have been play-acting with this House and the country for the last two or three years.  We have had the Local Government Bill and this Bill teeming with such expressions as &ldquo;local government&rdquo; and &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo;.  I was at pains to impress on the House a week ago that there are no such things as local <Col N="180" /> authorities and local government in this country.  Deputy Byrne put the query to us a few minutes ago: what redress has the Dublin Corporation in certain circumstances?  They have none; he ought to know they have none.  Up to last week there were some people in this country who believed that some shred of power was left in the hands of local authorities.  There were some foolish people who were misled by the Minister into the belief that under the Managerial Act they still had the power of the purse.  I have argued in this House since the Managerial Act was passed that they had no such power.  It was made absolutely clear to everybody last week that whatever vestige of power they had under the Managerial Act was removed then.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that we are asking to have the Managerial Act amended.  The Parliamentary Secretary is trying to persuade us that under this Bill the people's representatives will have some powers of administration and the power of the purse.</P>
      <P>I hold that under the Local Government Acts as they exist they have no authority whatever.  But the Parliamentary Secretary, who accuses us of play-acting, is trying to bamboozle the House and the country into the belief that under this Bill local authorities will have power to do certain things. I say they will not.  This amendment would give back to the local authorities some measure of power.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that if the amendment were passed it would put back some power into the hands of local authorities.  That is why I support it. I am convinced that local authorities have no power to do anything.  Deputy Byrne asked what power they had.  I said they had none, except to be mere puppets of the Minister.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, March 21st.</P>
