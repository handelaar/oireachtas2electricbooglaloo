      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that coal importers on the southern coast have been promised limited cargoes of coal from Welsh ports as and when small coasters are available; and if he will state if official permission will be given to such importers to sell such coal for ordinary local domestic use, especially in parts of West Cork, such as Kinsale, Courtmacsherry, etc., where remoteness from bogs makes the supply of turf precarious and excessively expensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any offers to importers on the southern coast of cargoes of coal from Welsh ports as suggested by the Deputy.  In any event, coal distribution arrangements are based on the total supplies likely to be available and I could not undertake, while the present scarcity of coal obtains, to grant exceptional treatment in the matter of supplies for domestic use in any particular area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether any estimate has been made of the total amount of coal which it would be necessary to obtain from Great Britain for (a) industrial, and (b) domestic purposes in order to provide for our needs from now until the end of April, 1947; whether any negotiations or discussions have taken place on this matter, and if so, with what results; if he will also state the total imports of coal suitable (a) for industrial, and (b) for domestic purposes expected from Great Britain between now and the 30th April, 1947; the extent to which such expected imports will fall short of our normal requirements; and the estimated amount of coal which may be available for domestic purposes during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Allocations of fuel for industrial and domestic purposes are normally planned at least six months in advance.  In the existing supply circumstances such allocations are necessarily based on the quantities of turf and other fuels, in addition to coal, expected to be available for distribution. Any estimate of our requirements of coal must have regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to the question of quality.  Discussions with the appropriate authorities in Great Britain are constantly taking place with a view to securing improvement in both the quality and quantity of our coal supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am assuming that the recent average weekly rate of imports of 26,000 tons will be maintained, and this quantity will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the public utility concerns while at the same time preserving the existing scale of allowances for general industrial purposes.  Our imports do not include any coal of the <Col N="301" /> pre-war household quality, and it is not possible to state when the resumption of imports of such coal may be expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire if the Minister has made any representations to the appropriate authority in Great Britain with a view to securing superior quality coal in the strictly limited field of coal required for smithies and individual blacksmiths as I have reason to believe that if he would make representations in regard to that strictly limited requirement a better quality coal would be made available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the unfit condition of corn, necessitating the use of greater power than is normally required for threshing operations, coupled with a very late season, when maximum throughput and expedition is essential, he will consider increasing the allocation of coal for threshing purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowance of coal granted in 1945 for the movement of threshing sets has this season been doubled and it is not possible, in addition to this increase, to provide coal <Col N="302" /> for the actual threshing operations.  I understand that satisfactory results are being obtained from the use of the available alternative fuels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must realise that because of the very poor condition of the grain crop generally, contractors, especially steam operating contractors, are experiencing great difficulty in getting a fair output during threshing operations.  There is a good deal of bad turf available but threshing operations are very slow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the abnormal amount of farmers' grain intended for feeding purposes, required to be conditioned by kiln drying, he will consider providing an allocation of coal for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the continuing difficult anthracite supply position it is not possible to make an allocation to commission millers for the drying of grain intended for animal feeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his Department has recently authorised hotels and institutions to buy supplementary supplies of Irish anthracite to heat their establishments and, if coal is available for that purpose, surely it should be made available for the limited period when it would be required effectively to dry the wet grain the millers have to handle at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no coal being used for heating purposes that would be suitable for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that if you make it available some of the small millers will use it and be glad to get it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a shortage of jute is adversely affecting the operation of the factory <Col N="303" /> of Messrs. Goodbody, Clara, Offaly; if he will take all necessary steps to ensure that jute supplies will be made available to keep this factory working as, if it were to close down, upwards of 500 local people would be deprived of their employment, with consequent serious loss to the town; and if he will give an outline of what he proposes to do to assist this industry to keep in production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a shortage of jute which is affecting employment in the factories of the firm named in the question.  Difficulties affecting the exportation from India of jute allocated to this country have recently been removed. The allocated quantity has been purchased by the firm and will be imported as soon as possible.  An approach has been made to the Indian Government for an increased allocation of raw jute, and an allocation of jute products.</P>

      <P>I regret that I have nothing to add to the reply which I gave the Deputy last May, when I informed him that I was unable to say when the passenger service between Rosslare and Fishguard may be resumed. He will, no doubt, have seen in the Press the report of a statement by the British Minister for Transport, that the service would be restored as soon as the work of reconditioning a vessel recently released from British Government service has been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has given consideration to the question of formulating proposals for the provision of constant employment for building workers so as to encourage the return to Ireland of skilled building operatives who left the country in recent years to take up employment in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government does not contemplate taking any powers of control of building activities other than those now being exercised.  The Deputy is, no doubt, familiar with the proposals outlined in the White Paper entitled &ldquo;The Post-War Building Programme&rdquo;, which was presented to the Oireachtas.  These proposals are designed to ensure maximum employment in the building industry, having regard to the limited supplies of materials available.  The building programme for many years ahead will be adequate to provide full employment for all skilled building workers, assuming that the position concerning building materials continues to improve.  In the circumstances, I consider that there is every encouragement to such workers, who emigrated during the war, to return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the anticipated shortage of skilled building trade operatives, would the Minister consider taking the initiative, as between builders on the one hand and trade unions on the other hand, in formulating some scheme whereby constant employment would be assured in this country, notwithstanding weather or other conditions, so that skilled building trade operatives would be guaranteed regular employment and thus encouraged to come back to participate in national house-building activities here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a matter which might usefully be discussed between the employers' organisations and the workers' unions concerned in this trade.  If the Government were to <Col N="305" /> attempt to operate a scheme which would make effective a guarantee of that kind, it would involve taking powers of control over the industry-which I think everybody regards as being undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ascertain the Minister's opinion in the matter. Therefore, I ask if he would take the initiative in arranging discussions of this character, with a view to projecting the minds of employers and trade unions on the desirability of arranging an organised employment programme such as would be calculated to induce skilled building trade operatives to come back here for building activities. At this stage I am not suggesting that the Minister should take powers of control.  I am suggesting that he should project the minds of these people on to the problem, in view of the national advantages to this country of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is in existence, and meeting regularly under the auspices of my Department, a committee composed of representatives of building employers and labour unions, discussing all aspects of the labour problem in connection with house-building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister knows that none of those discussions has gone so far as to try to evolve some kind of organised plan by which, if people come back from Britain to work in the building industry, they would be assured of constant employment here.  Would the Minister even consider endeavouring to initiate discussions with that object in view?  I am not suggesting at this stage that he should take any powers in the matter. My main concern is to ensure that their minds will be projected on that problem.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health when it is intended to introduce <Col N="309" /> legislation to revise the Dáil constituencies for the purpose of securing that the number of Teachtaí for each constituency shall be in accordance with Article 16 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the Dáil constituencies in which, at present, the number of Teachtaí is not such as was contemplated by paragraphs 2 and 3, Section 2, of Article 16 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer the Deputy's two questions together, as the replies overlap to a considerable degree.</P>
      <P>The constitutional requirements concerning constituencies for Dáil Éireann are contained in Section 2 of Article 16 of the Constitution, which provides, briefly, that constituencies will be determined by law, returning not less than three members who shall be elected by the system of proportional representation, and that constituencies shall be revised under the Constitution at least once in every 12 years.  In addition to these, there are the provisions of Article 16.2.2º and Article 16.2.3º to which the Deputy specifically refers.  It may be as well to quote these in full:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.2.2º</P>
      <P>The number of members shall from time to time be fixed by law, but the total number of members of Dáil Éireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each 30,000 of the population, or at more than one member for each 20,000 of the population.</P>
      <P>3º</P>
      <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Article 16.2.2º, if the population of the State were approximately 2,970,000, as it was in 1936, the membership of the Dáil should not be greater <Col N="310" /> than 148 nor less than 99.  The present membership of the Dáil is 138 and is well within the limits prescribed.</P>
    <P>Article 16.2.3º, which I have quoted, qualifies the requirement in relation to a common ratio between Teachtaí and population in two respects, namely, the population should be that as ascertained at the last preceding census, and the ratio shall be the same so far as is practicable.  Particulars of the population as ascertained at the last preceding census are not yet available. It is true that the ratio of Teachtaí to population varies to a certain extent in constituencies throughout the country, but it would be possible to have complete uniformity of ratio in every constituency only at the expense in many cases of ignoring social, economic administration and geographical considerations. That would not be practicable.  This natural variation between constituencies has been accentuated by the shifts in population which have taken place since the last revision.  Just what these changes have been we cannot say until the results of this year's census are available. I might add that the period in which the first revision of constituencies under the Constitution must be made does not expire until December, 1949.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept, therefore, the implications in the Deputy's questions that the number of Teachtaí for any constituency is not in accordance with any of the provisions of Article 16 of the Constitution.  It is accepted, however, that revision of the existing constituencies should be undertaken under the Constitution as soon as the essential census figures are available, and I hope to lay proposals to that end before the Dáil as soon as it is practicable to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that maternity cases from Edenderry area have in the past been accommodated in the County Hospital, Tullamore, while accommodation for such cases has not yet been available at Edenderry District Hospital.  Provision was made for accommodation for maternity cases in an approved scheme for improving the hospital at Edenderry in the year 1941.  It is understood, however, from correspondence with the county <Col N="312" /> manager, that the equipping of the ward proposed to be used for such cases could not be undertaken owing to conditions arising out of the emergency. As the difficulties in connection with the provision of equipment are not now so acute, it has been intimated to the local authority that they should now be in a position to make provision for the reception of maternity cases at this hospital.</P>

      <P>In view of that fact, would the Minister give sympathetic consideration to the question of reinstituting the scheme for the provision of additional benefits before January next?

Will the Minister favourably consider the desirability of introducing an amending Bill so as to make these benefits available?  You do not cure dental or optical defects simply by waiting until money is made available. There should be no trouble in making these benefits continuously available so long as there are substantial assets to the credit of the society.</P>

      <P>The footbridge over the River Shannon at Doonass was erected in 1942 at a cost of £1,724 8s. 10d.  It has been offered to the Limerick County Council for the sum of £862 4s. 5d., which is half the cost of construction, as representations were made to me that the bridge would be of great use to residents of the nearby districts.</P>
      <P>I am aware that an Order has been made under Section 36 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, authorising the Limerick County Council to exercise the powers conferred by the said section in relation to the purchase and support of the bridge and authorising the Clare County Council to exercise the powers conferred by paragraph (b) of the section to contribute to the purchase and support of the bridge.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the original cost of the bridge and to the amenity which it provides, it is not unreasonable to ask the local authorities to contribute a share of the cost.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that the present General Post Office there is much too small to eater for the needs of Wexford town; that at certain times during the week the staff on duty is inadequate to give prompt service to the customers; and if he will take steps to have these matters remedied.</P>

      <P>I have been aware for some time of the need for an extension of the accommodation at Wexford Post Office to meet the growing needs of the town.  It is now possible, and steps are being taken to have the necessary building alterations carried out.</P>
      <P>The indoor staffing arrangements at this office were revised quite recently when provision was made for additional assistance at the public counter. The staff now employed is regarded as adequate.  The staffing arrangements at Wexford, as at all other post offices, are kept under constant review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The delays complained of are due to shortage of circuits on the cross-Channel route.  Some additional circuits have recently been provided which have reduced the delays, but it will not be possible to give full relief until a new cross-Channel cable can be laid.  Arrangements to this end are proceeding in co-operation with the British Post Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is abnormal delay on calls between Boyle and the South, due to congestion on the Dublin-Sligo lines over which the traffic is mainly routed.

Following upon previous questions by the Deputy and by Deputy Commons in May last the Land Commission had noted this case for inquiry in due course as is their usual practice; but it is not their practice to interfere with public auctions; nor do they propose to be moved by agitation and intimidation of the type which has developed in this case.</P>

I would press on the Government that, although the Government may have no business to be considered at this particular time of the year, there are 18 Private Deputies' motions that require urgent discussion.

There are urgent matters to be discussed on behalf of the people by the Opposition <Col N="352" /> Parties, if the Government are behind with their work.  So far as I can see, it looks as if no work will be done by the Government before Christmas and that we will have all the Government work piled on us during the time when financial business has to be considered next year.  There are 18 Private Deputies' motions dealing with matters of public importance on the Order Paper and, so far as we can, we intend to see that Parliament sits on the ordinary days every week from this until Christmas, if necessary, to dispose of the business.  There is also this to be considered, that there will be other urgent matters arising&mdash;a number of them are already appearing on the horizon&mdash;and they will require discussion between this and Christmas. I ask the Government to appreciate what the general position is and to decide to sit three days every week, as I have suggested, so as to give private members an opportunity of discussing matters that they consider of public importance.  I suggest that can be done if the Government have no business to offer to the House.  If it is proposed to adjourn the House to-day until some time next week, when can that particular matter be discussed?</P>

      <P>There are not half a dozen Deputies aware of what it means. That motion introduces a new procedure in Dáil Éireann, a procedure known to no other Parliament.  That motion introduces into our procedure a departure from everything this Parliament has done since the State was founded.  That motion introduces a new system of procedure in this House which, under close observation, can be made to do useful work, but which, on the other hand, can be made a very dangerous instrument of tyranny.  This motion is designed to provide what is, in fact, a short circuit procedure to deal with Bills of a strictly limited type: that is, Bills which are designed to gather in between the covers of one Act all legislation then in existence, but there must be no amendment.</P>

      <P>If the members of this committee do not realise the importance of their task, a very grave injury might be done to Parliamentary procedure, and I think it is right that the House should know this.  Mind you, this is a vitally important matter.  So far as I am aware, it has puzzled both the members of this House who were on the Special Committee and the expert officers of this House whose advice they sought as to how a plan can be devised whereby the members of such a committee as we are now electing can determine whether a comprehensive measure which is alleged to do no more than bring together between the covers of one Act all the existing law is not, in fact, a subtle amendment of the law.  Nothing is more easy&mdash;and we have much experience of it in this House&mdash;than for the Minister to come here and say: &ldquo;This is a consolidating clause&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am always anxious and willing to submit to your ruling but when this House comes to appoint a committee it seems right that it should consider the purpose for which the committee is to be appointed and the qualifications needed to enable members adequately to discharge the task which we propose to give them.  I submit I am entitled to argue that if the members of this committee relax in their duty it is quite possible that what is represented to be no more than a consolidating Bill will, in fact, materially change the law.  The House is surrendering by this resolution to the Select Committee a wide part of its discretion to examine into the question as to whether what is represented to be a consolidating Bill is or is not, in effect, an amending Bill.  The members of the committee who come back to answer to this House on that question <Col N="357" /> will have to answer a kind of question which leaders of the Irish Bar told me they would be very reluctant to write an opinion upon, so that, even though we do set up this Standing Committee, I want to warn the House that, while I believe it was right to establish this new procedure for a very limited task, it must be very careful to satisfy itself, before any Bill is delegated to this Select Committee, that it is truly a consolidating Bill and is not a subtle amendment of the law. That is why I take advantage of this occasion to remind the House of what it is doing.  If members ever forget that in connection with this procedure, we, and those who come after us, may have bitter cause to deplore the resolution we now propose to pass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well <Col N="360" /> aware that there is wholesale dissatisfaction with the telephone facilities provided by his Department.  The telephone staffs are, certainly, not to blame for this condition of affairs.  They have performed miracles of efficiency with the very inadequate equipment at their command.  Invariably, the Minister's reply to complaints was that he could not procure equipment.  I am prepared to agree that in the latter stages of the emergency it was impossible to procure telephone equipment but, nevertheless, it was possible to obtain a restricted amount of equipment up to 1941 and it would appear that the Minister or his Department made no effort to procure it.  The Minister apparently failed accurately to gauge the situation and did not realise that the emergency would last for so many years.  The result of his remissness in this respect is that it would take five or six years at least to bring us to the position that we should normally be in if the emergency had not taken place.  In other words, telephone users in Northern Ireland and Great Britain will still be many years ahead of us both in efficiency and in development. I do not see any excuse for the Minister's lack of vision in regard to the provision of telephone equipment. I think the Minister fell down rather badly in his job.  It was his duty to see that whatever equipment that was available at that particular period was obtained and that the telephone service was maintained in a higher state of efficiency than it has been during the whole of the emergency period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the third Telephone Capital Bill that has been introduced in a period of ten years.  There was a Bill introduced in 1936 which provided for an expenditure of £500,000 on telephone development.  There was a Bill introduced in 1938 providing for the expenditure of £1,000,000 on development and I understand there is still an unexpended balance of that money. In this Bill the Minister is asking for a sum of £6,000,000 and, according to his statement, he hopes to spend that money in a period of four or five years. I am quoting from memory but I think his exact words were that he hoped to spend that money in a period of four or five years.  If it has taken the <Col N="361" /> Minister so many years to spend £1,500,000, how many years will it take him, at the same rate of progress, to spend £6,000,000?  We have no guarantee that the Minister will be able to spend that money in the period he has mentioned and the Minister's words have created uneasiness in the minds of many members of the Dáil. He dilated on the difficulties involved in laying cables and in providing modern and automatic exchanges.  He stated that it would take 18 months to build and equip an automatic exchange and that it would take two to three years to lay a cable between Dublin and Cork.  On that basis it would take the Minister 15 to 20 years, at least, to spend the £6,000,000 which he asks for in this Bill for the purpose of telephone development.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not be bound by the time factor, that it is his duty, in view of the backward state of telephone development in this country, to engage as many engineers and technicians as he can get, to see that they are trained in the special work for which their services are required and to have them set to work in order to compensate for past neglect.  The situation, certainly, is urgent and it is necessary that all the men available should be put on to the work which is there to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention supplies in the course of his statement. In 1936, in 1938, and in reply to various questions in the intervening years, his stock reply to complaints about delay in telephone development in various parts of the country was that equipment could not be obtained.  I should like to know if the position has altered since the war, if equipment is now freely available and if when construction work is undertaken there will be no interruption due to absence of equipment.  By the plans which the Minister has adumbrated, he hopes to treble the number of telephones in use. I submit that the plans for large scale and long range telephone development should have been made, not this year, but ten years ago because it was perfectly obvious that it was only a question of time, and a very short time at that, until the telephone would supplant the telegraph as a means of communication. <Col N="362" /> Development has outpaced the anticipations of the Minister and his Department.  The Minister mentioned that it would be necessary to undertake a campaign of propaganda for the purpose of getting more users but, since 1936, the Minister has not been able to keep pace with the demand for the telephone.  Why then does he think it necessary at this stage to undertake a propaganda campaign for the purpose of getting more subscribers when he is unable to cater for all the subscribers or to provide reliefs for those who have been anxious to get a service during the past ten years?</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that a sum of £10,000,000 is to be spent during the next ten years, I assume, or during the coming years on telephone development.  The Minister has asked the Dáil to vote £6,000,000 of that total sum but for how long does the Minister anticipate that this £10,000,000, when it is spent, will make up for past neglect, will modernise the whole telephone system in the country and will anticipate future developments for, say, ten years after the scheme has been completed?  It seems to me that any worth-while planning must provide for future developments or anticipate future developments and if the £10,000,000 is intended only to make up for past neglect and to bring the system to the same standard of efficiency as obtains in Great Britain at the present time, I say that is mistaken policy and that the Minister should ask for a larger amount so as to ensure that there will be adequate provision and that the needs of the people for a number of years ahead will be provided for.</P>
    <P>It is certainly time the Minister decided definitely to change over to the automatic system.  The automatic system has been in operation for about 30 years in the cities and towns and even in rural areas in Great Britain. It has been in operation in Northern Ireland for a number of years.  I cannot understand why it has not been brought into the cities and towns of this country earlier.  I think the Minister did mention the question of cost on one occasion but in view of all that <Col N="363" /> has happened during the past ten years the question of cost cannot be a very important factor.  In any event I am glad that the Minister has decided at last to change over to the automatic system and that exchanges are to be established in suitable centres throughout the country for the purpose of providing modern and up-to-date facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister made one statement which was rather enigmatic.  It seemed to contradict what had preceded it.  He said he must guard against providing plant too far in advance of being required.  Surely if the Minister is planning at all he must plan for future development.  What exactly does he mean by the statement that he must guard against providing plant too far in advance of being required?  At the present rate of demand it is very unlikely, even if plant is provided slightly ahead of requirement, that it will remain very long unused.  It is much more likely to be used up very soon after it has been provided.  The Minister should elaborate and explain that statement, as he has created confusion in the minds of some Deputies listening to him.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention especially to the conditions in the telephone exchange in Sligo.  By means of a question on two occasions in the Dáil, I tried to elicit some information from the Minister concerning his intentions with regard to that exchange.  There is a staff of 14 or 15 working in a small room about 15 feet square&mdash;probably less.  Representations have been made to the Minister over a period of ten years to have the exchange enlarged and made more adaptable to modern needs.  The Minister and his officials promised on numerous occasions that they would build a modern exchange for the people in Sligo.  As a result of the very insanitary conditions prevailing in the exchange at the moment, the rate of illness is exceptionally high &mdash;probably higher than in any telephone exchange in the whole country. Still the Minister and his officials have taken no definite steps to relieve the very serious situation which exists in Sligo.  I want from the Minister now <Col N="364" /> some definite promise that steps will be taken in the very near future for the purpose of providing the telephone staff in Sligo with a suitable place in which to work.</P>
    <P>If such conditions prevailed in any private concern or if employees were working in such conditions in any business house in the country, I am perfectly certain that the inspectors of the Department of Industry and Commerce would very soon take action and see that proper conditions were provided for the staffs.  It is a scandal that the Minister should be allowed to have members of his staff working under such conditions.  I want a guarantee from him that some steps to provide relief will be taken.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will carry out his plans quickly, speedily and effectively. The telephone service is certainly in a grave state of disorganisation at present, and urgent steps are necessary if the tempers of the people are to be quietened.  The Minister cannot expect the people to be patient with him any longer.  They showed extraordinary restraint and patience during the war years, but that patience has reached breaking point now and the Minister must do something to relieve the very grave and serious situation.</P>

      <P>I suggest further that the Minister should separate the telephone buildings altogether from the post office and that in each large town there should be a separate telephone exchange with call boxes, as there are in other countries. In certain towns in my constituency the amount of space at the counter and the amount of space for people waiting for telephone calls is inadequate.  I understand that in Dublin the Central Telephone Office is situated in Crown Alley and that it is contemplated erecting a newer and bigger building in the city. I suggest that the Minister follow that up and provide telephone buildings in <Col N="365" /> every provincial town, including commodious places with call boxes built all round, where people may go to put through their telephone calls.  The ordinary business of stamps, money orders, dog licences and so on could continue to be done at the counters of the post offices.</P>
      <P>The experience in my constituency in the Midlands is that, if you go in to make a trunk call to Dublin, Cork or Limerick, you are standing there for anything from an hour to three hours, getting in everybody's way and losing time.  If I were asked which is the more important&mdash;to use the poles that are coming in for the Electricity Supply Board or the telephone service&mdash;I would say to the Government that the poles should be used for the telephones, since all business is being paralysed by the inadequate telephone service.  During the emergency, on account of the lack of transport, the people have been doing their business by telephone over the past seven years and have become telephone-minded, so that more and more people are looking for telephones.  All this proves the necessity to separate the telephone service from the ordinary business of the Post Office.</P>
      <P>When speaking on the Minister's Estimate some years ago, I remember dealing with the general lay-out of the Post Office services and I stated that it was based on the lay-out of the railways and that there should be a new approach to it.  For instance, County Meath is served by the Great Northern Railway and the old telegraph lines run along the railway lines to Navan and Kells and along to Oldcastle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Seosamh Ó Cinnéide Seosamh Ó Cinnéide">
      <NameTxt>Seosamh Ó Cinnéide</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear that in mind.  These telegraph lines are used now for the telephones.  If I want to make a call from Castlepollard, about eight miles from Oldcastle, the call has to go on the old Midland Great Western Railway line <Col N="366" /> to Mullingar, then up to Dublin and down on the line constructed on the Great Northern Railway through Navan and then up to Oldcastle.  With all due respect, I think I am in order. I advocate that there should be a new approach to the lay-out of telephone lines and that the towns should be linked up.  To illustrate my point, I mention the small town of Delvin, which is five statute miles from Collinstown, County Westmeath.  Up to recently, if you put a telephone call through from Delvin to Collinstown, it had to go to Mullingar, then up to Dublin and down the whole of County Meath and back into Westmeath.  A friend of mine put a call through there some years ago.  He waited about an hour in Delvin and then drove to Collinstown and did his business there.  Then he went back to Delvin and cancelled the call, which was still being put through.  In recent years, the Post Office authorities have linked those places up and now you can get the call through in a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time before I became a member of the House, the late Deputy Shaw advocated year after year the installation of a telephone in the village of Ratoath, County Westmeath. The reply given, year after year, by the Minister, or Parliamentary Secretary, in charge of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the late Deputy Shaw was that it would be a physical and technical impossibility to do that.  When I became a representative for the County of Westmeath I took up the running, and it was also indicated to me that it would be a physical and technical impossibility to install the telephone at Ratoath.  When the emergency came upon us, the officers in the L.D.F. came to me to get access to the telephone in the Garda barracks, I was again met with the same reply.  I was brushed aside, but within a fortnight the L.D.F. and the Army had the telephone in in that village.  I think there is need to break a lot of this red tape in connection with telephone development. For years the reply was that it was a physical and technical impossibility to get the telephone installed in Ratoath, but as I say, the L.D.F. <Col N="367" /> and the Army were able to get the job done within a fortnight.  In my opinion, if there is to be a development of telephone facilities, whether in villages like Ratoath or even smaller ones, then the outlook in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will have to be different from what it has been during the last 19 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>I have been advocating, for quite a long time, a carrier line from Mullingar to Dublin.  You have to wait for hours at Mullingar for a call to Dublin.  I renew my advocacy for that carrier line on this Bill.  Deputy Roddy referred to the smallness of the area in which the operators in the Sligo telephone exchange have to work.  The same thing applies to nearly every other provincial town.  In Britain, I have seen exchanges not merely in big hotels but in mediumsized hotels.  The space in them at the disposal of the operators is much bigger than that at the disposal of operators in a number of our provincial towns. That is another reason why, I think, in the case of these telephone exchanges we should get away from the post office building altogether.  I think, the telephone exchange should be in a separate building.  I have seen that system in operation in practically every part of Italy.  The telephone exchange is always the best building in the place. We should have the same thing here. We should have the telephone exchange in a separate building so that there will be ample public telephone facilities.  In conclusion, I want to say that if the choice were left with me as to whether the allocation of the poles and the timber that we get should be for Electricity Supply Board electrical development or for telephone development, I certainly would place the telephone development first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's statement in introducing the Bill, while it was certainly very interesting I suggest that it might have been far more comprehensive.  If there is one service more than another which is causing a headache to the public it is the telephone service.  I can find no indication in the Minister's statement that this trouble is going to be eased immediately.  The Minister, in the <Col N="368" /> course of his statement, said that the expenditure under the main headings was estimated to be as follows: new exchanges and buildings, £2,072,000; trunk circuits, £2,400,000; subscribers' circuits, £1,360,000; kiosks and call offices, £275,000; other works, £245,000, giving a total of, roughly, £6,000,000. I suggest to him that his Department, as Deputy Roddy has pointed out, must have, in the years of the emergency, taken advantage of that period to have a comprehensive lay-up plan for the extension of the telephone service.  The main interest to the public at the moment is to know when the present position is going to be remedied.  Can we have, in regard to that plan, from the Minister or his Department some indication as to whether there are to be selected areas, or whether there shall be certain priorities so far as telephones and kiosks are concerned? We have no indication that the very bad position in Dublin at the moment is going to be rectified, say, within 12 months or two years.  What the Minister said was that it was likely that the money would be spent in the next four or five years.</P>
      <P>Since I became a member of the House I have been drawing attention to the absence of kiosk facilities in the City of Dublin.  The position at the moment is that it is utterly impossible at certain hours to get a call through at some of them.  One has to queue up.  We have no indication in the Minister's statement when that position will be eased.  Can we be told when the materials are likely to be available for the erection of kiosks?  Previously, in regard to these the Minister's reply was that cable was the trouble.  Will he now tell us whether the cable position has improved?  When may we expect to have an addition to the present number of kiosks in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roddy referred to the Minister's statement in which he said that he anticipated going out on a campaign for public subscribers.  I know from experience that the present subscribers feel that they are not getting value from the facilities which are being afforded to them.  Naturally they will want to know when that position is going to be eased.  As regards this <Col N="369" /> campaign for future subscribers to which the Minister referred, can he tell us the number of houses that are now awaiting a telephone service in the City of Dublin?  Would it be possible for him to give that number as well as some indication as to when they will get a service?  My complaint in regard to the Minister's statement is that it is not sufficiently detailed. Can we be told something about the lay-up programme which will give an indication to the public as to when the position in Dublin will be eased, and the same with regard to Sligo and other areas?  The Minister, in my opinion, has not given sufficient details.</P>

      <P>Last evening between half-past five and six o'clock I tried to call Ballaghaderreen which is 117 statute miles from Dublin.  I could have driven home and transacted my business in Ballaghaderreen before the telephone call came through.  It did come through at 8.30 as a result of repeated remonstrances.  The supervisor on two occasions replied that he would call back instantly, but on both occasions he forgot about it, until finally at 8.20 I said that I had an appointment at 8.30, and that I wanted to get the call or else cancel it.  A very civil man then got the call for me.  I am going to suggest to the House that the present pandemonium in the telephone service, in so far as it is due to inadequate supplies of machinery or equipment, cannot be wholly blamed on the Minister, because the equipment is not to be had.  Is lack of equipment the only reason?  I do not think it is. I think that lack of trained personnel and the fantastic parsimony of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in providing trained personnel in their exchanges are very largely responsible for the present situation.  I have repeatedly said in this House that it is a very rare exception in dealing with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to receive anything but courtesy and consideration.  In 99 cases out of 100, where you have a complaint or an inquiry to make, whether you are given a satisfactory answer or not, they will be civil&mdash;and apologetic where they feel they have put you to an inconvenience. But there are occasions <Col N="370" /> when some wide departures from that customary rule take place.  I have invariably felt on such occasions, and have been able to confirm my view on making inquiries afterwards, that I was speaking to somebody who was frightfully overworked and who was driven to the last stage of exasperation by a burden of work quite beyond his or her capacity to bear.</P>
      <P>Now, while that state of affairs exists, not hundreds, but thousands, of girls are emigrating to Great Britain to be domestic servants or to become so-called nurses in public health hospitals in England because they cannot get employment in their own country. We are told that we are spending £8,000,000 to £10,000,000 on telephone development but not a single instrument of the additional equipment which we are seeking will be of any value if highly-skilled operatives are not available to work that apparatus. Let the Minister doube or treble the telephone staff.  Let us have now a fantastically redundant staff.  Let us be able to change the girls on the switchboard far more often that ordinarily we would consider desirable, so that the maximum efficiency of a fresh operative will be available all the time to get the very most out of the inadequate equipment we have at the moment, and so that when adequate equipment is installed we shall have a trained expert staff who can be at once spread over the whole system.</P>
      <P>What I apprehend is going to happen is that we are going to wait for the trained staff until the equipment is available and then we shall be told that we have no staff for the equipment. Ten years ago we were told that the trouble was that we had not the staff.  Then when we got the staff, we were told that we had not the equipment. Now, when we get the equipment, we shall be told again that we have not the staff.  We shall have to wait again for the staff, and I suppose by the time we get the staff the equipment will again be inadequate. We shall be chasing our own tail continually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This apprehension of mine is not just conjured up in my own mind because I remember the present Minister for <Col N="371" /> Posts and Telegraphs saying in this House that it was the policy of his Department to wait for a public demand before public money was spent in providing means to satisfy it.  That is simply crazy.  The aim of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be to keep ten years ahead of an existing demand steadily.  I do not know what telephone facilities are available in Italy now but when I knew them, they were very bad.  You were presented with an instrument which looked like a cross between a child's bugle and a Victorian lady's trumpet.  You spent half the day shouting &ldquo;Allo&rdquo; and getting no comprehensive reply.  I should be long sorry to see either the French or the Italian system held up as the criterion for this country but the British system, at least before the war, was reasonably efficient. The best system of which I had experience was the American system. I remember when in America taking up a telephone in Chicago and telling them that I wanted to speak to Big Bill Dillon, who was on holiday in Florida. They asked me if I could give them his address, and I told them that I could not.  All I could tell them was that he was staying at some hotel in Florida on holidays.  They said: &ldquo;Very well, we shall ring you back when we get Mr. Dillon&rdquo;.  They rang me up in about 35 minutes' time having searched every hotel in Florida until they found the person I wanted.  They rang up every holiday resort along the Florida coast until they located him and then called me and said: &ldquo;Here is Mr. Dillon for you&rdquo;.  They have this additional attraction, that if a lady picks up a telephone and says: &ldquo;My husband is in Florida, will you get me in touch with him?&rdquo;, before putting the husband in communication with her, after having found him, they will ask him: &ldquo;Are you in the hotel where you said you were going to?&rdquo; That is service.  If he says: &ldquo;No, I am not&rdquo;, they will ring back and apologise to the lady who called them and say: &ldquo;We cannot find him&rdquo;.  That is service.</P>
    <P>I recognise that we should be somewhat ambitious if, in the early future, we were to aspire to that degree of service owing to the comparatively <Col N="372" /> small number of instruments which will be employed within any foreseeable time in this country, but if the telephone system were run by a private corporation, that is the kind of service people would get, because that corporation would know that unless it kept its service up to the highest standard, the system would be perhaps given over to the State.  Once the State gets control, then the consumer can take what is given to him and, if he does not like it, he can lump it.  I put it to the Minister that at this moment there is an acute scarcity of trained personnel in the telephone system in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no scarcity of personnel, why is it that if you ring &ldquo;0&rdquo; or &ldquo;31,&rdquo; it takes three to seven minutes to get a reply, and if you complain to the superintendent, you are told: &ldquo;We are overwhelmed with calls and we have not got the apparatus or the staff&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the apparatus and the space that are lacking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that the staff are unable to cope with incoming calls. Suppose you ring &ldquo;31,&rdquo; you hear the bell ringing in the central exchange and you stand there listening for anything from three to seven minutes without a reply.  You then ring &ldquo;30,&rdquo; which I think is telegrams.  That usually answers fairly quickly.  Generally, when you ring &ldquo;O,&rdquo; you hear the bell ringing, but you never get the engaged ring.  Somewhere in the exchange the instrument is ringing, but there seems to be no one to answer your call.  I have been told by the Minister's Department that that difficulty is due to shortage of staff.  I want to know if the Minister believes that he has sufficient staff to deal with the equipment which he hopes to have at a reasonably early date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to put this suggestion. Deputy Kennedy has referred to a telephone call that went down the Midland Great Western Railway to Dublin and up the Great Northern Railway line, <Col N="373" /> back to Meath.  He did not say whether, when he was making his call, he could hear half the railway porters, signalmen and stationmasters at all the railway stations down the Midland line and up the Great Northern line discussing what had become of a certain wagon or asking: &ldquo;Have you any pigs on the train to-night?&rdquo; In the midst of the most romantic conversations, conducted on the telephone line, you are likely to have a male voice introduced to know if someone had taken the dung out of the wagon that was on the siding yesterday.  This, I understand, is due to some difficulty which arises through the lines which carry the telephone conversations of this country being closely approximated to the lines of the railway company's private telephone, and so you get this strange interchange of messages across the line, and frequently one has to discuss one's business on a background of complicated argument between the signalman at Mullingar and the stationmaster at Kilfree Junction as to whether the wagon which the signalman said had gone down the line had, in fact, gone down the line or not.</P>
    <P>I want to make a simple practical suggestion for the abolition of the perennial persecution which people in rural Ireland have to suffer when they use the telephone.  At present, if you make a trunk call from many country towns, there may be five separate connections in the process of linking you up with the other subscriber, and the facility with which you can talk depends on the effectiveness with which each of the five operators drives the plug home in the board over which he particularly presides.  You have to go through a whole series of small post offices and I want to make the suggestion that all subscribers in the Ballaghaderreen district should be connected up with the Ballaghaderreen post office&mdash;that is necessary in order to permit the making of local calls&mdash; and that Ballaghaderreen should then be connected direct with some county centre, which county centre should in turn be connected direct with the national exchange.</P>
    <P>That procedure seems perfectly <Col N="374" /> simple to me and perfectly obvious, because it means, in addition to reducing the number of connections necessary to link up two rural subscribers, that there are very few places in the system where a bottleneck can grow up.  The only place where you can get a bottleneck is at the county centre or the exchange in Dublin, and provided these are kept wide open, with abundant equipment, one may reasonably expect to have an efficient service throughout the country.  I speak of the Ballaghaderreen situation because I know it peculiarly well.  The service between Ballaghaderreen and Sligo is bad, but, when you get through to Sligo, pandemonium reigns, because into Sligo is pouring Donegal, Sligo, North Roscommon and parts of North Mayo, and once you get into that maelstrom, you may throw your hat at it.</P>
    <P>It does not matter what additional lines are provided from Sligo to Dublin. The Sligo exchange simply cannot handle the traffic it is trying to handle. If all the towns in Roscommon were routed down to Roscommon, if all the towns in Mayo were routed to the appropriate town in Mayo and all the towns in Sligo to the appropriate town in Sligo, we could proceed at once to resolve the difficulties where they manifest themselves, but if the present system goes on, as I see it, we will be engaged in an interminable system of patchwork.  I would much rather see the Post Office embarking now on a complete new network, designed on some coherent plan such as I suggest, with the intention of abandoning the existing network as soon as the new network is fit to function and using the present equipment for running repairs on the new system as the necessity arises.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that it is not reasonable to blame the Minister for shortages in service resulting from the world shortage of equipment, and, if that were the sole explanation, I think we should have to acquit him of any guilt; but it is not.  I charge that this Minister, by his own ineptitude and incompetence, failed to take reasonable precautions in the years before the war to anticipate the demand which any school-child knew was waiting around the corner.  I charge further that the <Col N="375" /> Minister, well knowing that, as part of a future programme of development, a new exchange was required in the City of Dublin, directed proceedings to be instituted to secure a situation in which that exchange would be built and equipped.  Now I propose to tell the House the story of the negotiations which began in 1932 and which continued in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941.  At the end of that period what had been achieved by three Departments?&mdash;the removal of seven barrows of bricks from one derelict site, a site which was derelict in 1931 and which was still derelict in 1941.</P>
    <P>In case any Deputy doubts this story, it is here in a Government publication, the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts for the years 1938-39, Appendix 7.  I may say that this is a matter which came up annually at the Committee of Public Accounts, and eventually, in despair, I suggested that some responsible officer of the Post Office should sharpen his pencil and set down at his leisure, in black and white, what happened to create the grotesque situation with which we found ourselves confronted in the year for which these accounts came under review.  This is what he wrote with regard to the St. Andrew Street, Dublin, post office site:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For a great number of years, the accommodation in the College Green Post Office has been inadequate; there is no means of extending it and the cost of complete rebuilding would be prohibitive.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs had therefore been seeking alternative premises in the vicinity.  About 1932, the Department discovered that a suitable site in St. Andrew Street was on the market but before they could acquire it the Agricultural Credit Corporation leased the site from the Dublin Borough Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is a quasi-Government Department.  They jumped the site and that knocked the breath out of the Post Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recorded here with great triumph that, after nine years' effort, they got these bricks out and there is mutual congratulation between the three Government Departments. The breath was knocked out of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs when the Agricultural Credit Corporation got the jump on them.  Now I return to the report, which continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Department later entered into negotiations with the corporation with a view to the provision of post office accommodation on the ground floor of a building which the corporation proposed to erect.  The rent demanded was, however, regarded as too high and this scheme and an alternative one, by which the Department would pay the capital cost of part of the building and a smaller rent, both fell through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of further negotiations <Col N="377" /> a fresh scheme was put forward to and sanctioned by the Minister for Finance on 15th June, 1934....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I have read out is the result of two years' labour.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;under which the site would be transferred to the Department in return for reimbursement of the corporation outgoings, including cost of clearing the site, architect's fees for building plans, rent, etc., the entire building to be erected by the Board of Works and the Department to lease accommodation to the corporation&mdash;the possibility of the Industrial Credit Company also renting accommodation to be explored.</P>
    <P>Plans were prepared by the Office of Works accordingly, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation agreed to lease from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the first and second floors and half the basement at a rent of £1,450 per annum (the accommodation and the rent to be divided between the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Industrial Credit Company).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the House to note this.  The great solicitude of the Department was to call the lame, the halt and the blind to share the costs of this business and to rent accommodation in the building, afraid they would not be able to fill it.  Before I reach the end of this story they discover that the building is not big enough for themselves, and they try to break out of these agreements:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The detailed scheme was sanctioned by the Minister for Finance on 15th June, 1935, and the initial steps regarding the transfer of the site were taken&mdash;the Agricultural Credit Corporation being asked to give a definite assurance that the Corporation and the Industrial Credit Company would enter into lease as described.  The Industrial Credit Company, however, withdrew from the arrangement and the Agricultural Credit Corporation undertook by letter dated 23rd March, 1936, full responsibility for the rent, etc., of the entire upper floors on the conditions that they would be granted permission to sub-let any rooms not required for their immediate use, and <Col N="378" /> that the building would be ready for occupation within two years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They arrived at that important stage four years after the business began.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that this Bill deals with telephonic development, not general Post Office work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the funny part of it.  In the heel of the hunt they discovered that this building was to be a telephone exchange and they proceeded to evict everyone, but the tenants would not go and they were eventually mulcted in a heavy sum:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Dublin Borough Council gave their approval to the transfer of the site and consented to an extension of the building period up to 25th March, 1939.  The legal formalities were proceeded with and the deed of assignment from the Agricultural Credit Corporation was completed in June, 1937.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They were getting on famously now.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The deed did not contain any stipulation as regards the renting by the Agricultural Credit Corporation of accommodation in the building.</P>
      <P>It had been intended to commence work on the building as soon as the site was legally transferred to the Department, but owing to a dispute in the building trade progress was delayed.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation then gave notice that they intended to withdraw from their agreement, on the grounds it was not possible to have the accommodation available for occupation by March, 1938, and that, as their existing accommodation was inadequate, it was necessary to make alternative arrangements without delay.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, the whole position was again reported to the Department of Finance by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It was then clear that if buildings were erected on the St. Andrew Street site the whole of them could be utilised for Post Office purposes, and, in fact, were definitely needed for accommodation for Post Office services. In the view of the Minister for Finance no purpose would have been <Col N="379" /> served by requiring the corporation to keep to their bargain to take up accommodation in the new building. The only question which then remained for settlement was whether, in releasing the corporation from their bargain, any fine or other consideration should not be expected of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Accordingly the Minister consented to certain concessions.  That only brings the House to 1939.  At this stage, the Secretary of the Department takes the field.  I shall quote further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Only such as are relevant.  I spent seven years as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts dealing with it, not seven minutes which I am asking the House to spend.  The Secretary, Mr. O'Hegarty, appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts on May 6th, 1943.  He said that as far as he could see, Mr. McGrath,. the Comptroller and Auditor-General, had a bee in his bonnet about this matter.  &ldquo;I tried to explain this,&rdquo; said Mr. O'Hegarty, &ldquo;year after year to Mr. McGrath but he still has a bee in his bonnet about it.&rdquo; On being pressed, Mr. O'Hegarty said that he had brought Mr. Blake with him who was head of the building section of the Post Office and that he would be better able to explain than Mr. O'Hegarty was.  Mr. Blake then took up the story.  I have brought the House up to 1939.  Mr. Blake said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We did not get this site for telephone purposes until July, 1939. Plans of this nature take from 12 to 15 months to prepare, and after that it would take from 20 to 21 months to build a structure of this kind.  The man in the street looks at buildings <Col N="380" /> and says to himself that one building is like another.  The weight-carrying capacity of an ordinary building is 70 lbs. to 100 lbs. per foot superficial.  In this case we would have switchboards on the second floor, the weight of which would be 1,700 lbs. per six feet, apart from other materials and live weight.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes into a series of technical details and winds up by saying that plans were with the Board of Works to erect a building in reinforced concrete. Mr. O'Hegarty is asked: &ldquo;Are you going to start the building now?&rdquo; and he replies, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Benson, at Question 156, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Connolly informed us that the plans were not with his Department yet.  Last year Mr. O'Hegarty was asked if plans had been prepared, and the answer was &lsquo;No.&rsquo; Mr. Connolly says the Board of Works are handling them at the moment.  I also asked last year, &lsquo;If there was any prospect of building being undertaken at the moment,&rsquo; and Mr. O'Hegarty replied: &lsquo;Not at the moment, I think, because tenders have to be sought and received.  The plans had to be recast to provide for reinforced concrete instead of steel, as steel cannot be got.&rsquo; I then remarked: &lsquo;But it is proposed to go ahead with the building and not wait until the war is over,&rsquo; and Mr. O'Hegarty answered: &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;It is a question of supplies&mdash;that is all.&rdquo; Fourteen years have elapsed since <Col N="381" /> they made up their minds that they would like to build on the St. Andrew Street site.  There were seven years spent chopping logic with the Dublin Corporation, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and the Industrial Credit Corporation, trying to lure them into the building.  There were two years spent throwing them out again.  Then they discover that they cannot get any supplies, so they get the wheelbarrow, remove several barrels of bricks, and then they have a mutual admiration party saying: &ldquo;Is not that wonderful?&rdquo; All I am afraid of is that they will start some similar transaction again and, by the time they get around to building the telephone exchange, the capital of Ireland will be moved to Tara or Athlone and they will find they have built it in the wrong place.  I would like to know from the Minister now has he got the final plans?  I would like to know from him if the plans have been approved and if the tenders are out.

      <P>I see them erecting numerous buildings which incorporate considerable quantities of steel and I want to know from the Minister if he has been as hot off the mark as he wishes this House to believe?  Did he at any stage during the war make up his mind, if they could not build this building during the war, to complete the plans so that the moment the supplies again become available they could put the building out to tender and put it under construction on the first priority, on the ground that this is the bottleneck of bottlenecks?  As long as that building is not erected, no effective work can be done to provide the community with a reasonable standard of efficiency in the telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not because a shortage of supplies has made it hard to run the telephones at the present time that I indict the Minister.  It is because he has been lazy, lazy in not making his Department do its duty during the ten years before the war.  It is because he thinks it is good enough now to shrug his shoulders or give impudence when his Department is criticised here and <Col N="382" /> imagine that is an adequate reply to the charges which lie against him.  It is because he is lazy now and thinks it is good enough to shrug his shoulders and say: &ldquo;It is a matter of supplies.&rdquo; It is not a matter of supplies.  It is a matter of contemptible incompetence on the part of the Minister responsible.</P>
    <P>There are people going around this country and, because they are soft and agreeable and pleasant, you cannot say anything about them other than: &ldquo;He is a decent poor fellow.&rdquo; We all know the Minister is a decent poor fellow; we all know he is an agreeable person; we all know it is no agreeable assignment to use strong language about him; but the plain fact is that he is bone lazy and he always was and that is at the root of the troubles in the Post Office.  Let him do one of two things.  Let him turn over a new leaf and make the people in the Department work, as he should; make them realise that the programme which the community demands should be completed within a reasonable time, and he is quite competent to do that if he wants to do his work, or else he should fulfil the prognostications of the <i>Irish Times</i> and go out and become an ambassador in Paris, Berlin or Rome.  But it is intolerable that the whole community should be held up indefinitely simply because the Minister thinks his responsibilities can be discharged by shrugging his shoulders and saying: &ldquo;It is a matter of supplies.&rdquo; It is not a matter of supplies.  It is a matter of one Minister not doing his work, not trying to get done what ought to be done.  If he was one-tenth as solicitous in getting telephones into the homes of the people and into business houses as he is in getting nominees of the Fianna Fáil clubs into the sub-post offices, we would not be in the position in which we are at the present time.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us he has a long waiting list.  I should like to know, when materials are available, what form of priority will be given.  I have in mind the new housing areas in the City of Dublin that are without an adequate telephone service.  They are also without an adequate bus service, without proper lighting facilities and <Col N="383" /> without the shelters that were promised them.  Are the new residential areas in Drumcondra, Killester, Donnycarney, Kimmage, Crumlin, Cabra West and Cabra to be left aside and not given adequate facilities?  These new areas have no facilities whatsoever and they are being treated with a kind of indifference. I should like the Minister to see that the new shopping centres are given proper facilities.  Traders are making every effort to provide for the people in these added areas.  I should like an assurance that the new shopping centres will be given a priority and that they will get all the services they require.</P>
      <P>I have read a lot and written a lot about the cattle market area&mdash;the North Circular Road, Glasnevin, Phibsborough and Cabra.  If anybody in that area applies for a telephone for business purposes he gets a reply to the effect that the cables are overloaded. That is no proper answer for people who are anxious to carry on business.  That is a most important area, not alone for Dublin but for the whole country.  Telephone services are necessary there not alone for the people in the area but for the use of people who come from England and from the country districts around Dublin to sell or purchase cattle.</P>
      <P>I will not attempt to follow the line adopted by Deputy Dillon.  I have no complaints to make.  I find that, if I have to ring up the Department, any little grievance that may be mentioned is removed within the shortest possible period.  So far as courtesy is concerned, I can say I get nothing but courtesy, no matter what Department I come in contact with.  I have no fault to find with the Department, but if the speech of Deputy Dillon will encourage the Minister to use a little driving force it will be all to the good.</P>
      <P>We are told that the cables are overloaded.  I hope the position in that respect will be improved and that the people who want telephones will get them.  I am particularly anxious that the new housing areas around Dublin will not be neglected much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> If you talk about the inadequate bus service, you are told that there are no materials.  For seven years, that has been the excuse.  If you ask why weather shelters are not put up, as promised, you are told that there are no materials.  There is the same excuse in the case of lighting facilities.  It is a good thing that Deputy Dillon took the line he did&mdash;not in the way of making an attack on the Minister's Department. I think that he accepted the statement of the Minister and his officials that the materials are not available but what are the Government doing to make them available?  Is it not possible for the Minister to cross to the other side or for the Government to send representatives to see what could be done in the way of getting materials? Deputy Dillon said that they were told that the difficulty in connection with the building of a telephone depot was scarcity of steel.  Three weeks ago, I was on an inspection committee which visited the North Wall.  There we saw 400 tons of steel girders and iron girders being unloaded for the Electricity Supply Board.  They came from some continental area.  If the Electricity Supply Board has the initiative to send out men and place orders, why cannot the Government do likewise? The supplies they would obtain could be allocated to the various Departments and to the transport and lighting services which I mentioned and the Government should see that Dublin, on account of its big population, gets a reasonable share.  I support the case made by other speakers for kiosks.  There should be more telephone kiosks in the City and County of Dublin, particularly when lighting facilities are insufficient.  If an accident takes place or a purse is snatched, we are told that there was no light in the area and no telephone kiosk by which the Gárdaí could be called.  I hope that the few words of encouragement I have given the Minister and those given him by Deputy Dillon will have good results.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill if it is intended to be a serious and comprehensive effort to face up to the serious telephone problems which confront not only the Post Office but the whole country.  Such a Bill is long overdue. <Col N="385" /> The intentions behind the Bill, as indicated by the Minister, should have been given effect long before the emergency, instead of as a post-war effort. There is no doubt about the necessity for improving the telephone service and developing it.  There is no doubt about the necessity of providing those who operate the service with the means of serving the public properly.  Deputy Dillon, Deputy Byrne and others may talk about the inadequacy of telephone exchanges and equipment, but, to realise the conditions in which the staffs are herded, one should really go into some of the telephone exchanges in the country.  Many of them are simply appalling.  It is an exaggeration to describe them as exchanges.  That is a euphemism for a miserable, little, overcrowded and badly-ventilated room in many cases.  The Minister does not know anything about this at all.  If he were to go on a tour of what are described as telephone exchanges, he would have his eyes opened and he would realise that his speech is about ten years out of date.  The Minister should go down to Claremorris or Sligo or Ennis or Waterford.  These are only a few examples of the frightfully bad telephone exchange position throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and some of the people responsible at a high level for telephone policy could only see the places which masquerade as telephone exchanges in the country, they would be ashamed to be associated with them. Many of these exchanges were built when the telephone directory was little more than a pocket diary.  Has the Minister the telephone directory for 1900?  If not, somebody in his Department should show him one and tell him the telephone statistics for 1900.  He will then see how completely the telephone service has outgrown the clothes in which it was first wrapped.  The service has expanded completely beyond the capacity of the Post Office for adjustment.  The telephone directory is now a very substantial volume, indicative of a rapidly expanding service. Yet, the Post Office continues to deal with it in the manner indicated by the correspondence which Deputy Dillon read.  Deputy Dillon's statement of the way the Post Office deals with <Col N="386" /> this business is no exaggeration at all. The Deputy may have embroidered his remarks with some expletives and adjectives but, if the embroidery is stripped off, then Deputy Dillon's description of the leisurely, easy-going approach to the question of building is undoubtedly as indicated in the correspondence which he read.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that it is almost impossible to get anything in the way of definiteness from the Post Office.  If you ask them whether they propose to carry out any structural work, they will say that they hope to do so but they never state definitely when they will commence or when they will finish.  The remarks by Deputy Dillon typify the whole attitude of the Post Office as regards the provision of proper buildings for the transaction of the business committed to its care.  Is it any wonder that there are frequent complaints of delay so far as the telephone service is concerned?  The whole position has got so bad that the Post Office is stumbling towards the acceptance of the position that delay is inevitable. They realise that, while the service has grown, they have not been able, for reasons within their own control, to provide adequate buildings and equipment to meet the increased demand. Many of the irritated subscribers give vent to their irritation by making complaint to the telephonist, as if the telephonist was responsible for the management of the exchanges.  Many of those irritated subscribers think that the telephonist is reading an interesting book or knitting and that that is all that prevents her from promptly putting through their call.  The truth is that the telephonists are being asked to carry a load which it is impossible for them to carry satisfactorily and efficiently with the equipment at present available to them.  When the public blame the telephonist they should remember that the telephonist is as much a victim of the short-sighted policy of the Post Office as they are. The Minister in introducing this Bill told us that the intention is to provide a large number of new circuits, junctions, lines and improved buildings but he did not tell us when it is hoped that this work will be undertaken.  Can he give us any indication as to what <Col N="387" /> the achievements will be in one year or five years hence?  The Minister remembers that recently an Arterial Drainage Bill was introduced in this House and when the Bill was being finally passed we were told that the work would not be undertaken for a very considerable time and that in fact it would take seven years to get the machinery together and 28 years before the job of draining the country was completed.  I hope this Bill is not a twin brother of the Arterial Drainage Bill.  I hope that something satisfactory will be done towards the development of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>I want to bring the Minister back to the position of the telephone service in Dublin.  The present telephone service in Dublin is unsatisfactory because the Post Office has not been able to measure up to the problem before it. It was not able to do that when there was an abundance of building material available and when equipment could be obtained very much cheaper than present-day costs.  The central telephone exchange, that is, the Exchequer Street Exchange, is utterly unsatisfactory from the point of view of the chief telephone exchange in the capital city. The place is overcrowded and there is no attempt in that building, which is merely a converted building, to measure up to what a telephone exchange in the capital city ought to be. I have seen telephone exchanges in other countries, and what purports to be our central telephone exchange has no claim whatever to be ranked in the same category.  I have seen large telephone exchanges in other cities and they are all well ahead of what is our central telephone exchange.  The Minister will probably say that we have in mind building a new exchange in St. Andrew Street but a telephone service cannot be run on intentions or good hopes.  There will never be a satisfactory service in Dublin until a proper exchange is erected on the St. Andrew Street site.</P>
    <P>The Minister gives himself credit for intending to build that exchange with the utmost expedition but there is always something in the way.  The Minister is bursting to build that exchange but something prevents him. <Col N="388" /> Ought not the Minister to tell the Government that the erection of an exchange at St. Andrew Street is much more essential from the point of view of the national needs than the erection of cinemas in various parts of the country, and ought not he be able to convince the Government that the provision of this telephone exchange ought to take priority over many of the luxury buildings which are being put up?  In so far as I agree with Deputy Dillon's comments, I agree with Deputy Dillon that the Minister is on the bottom rung of the ladder so far as pushing forward the claims of his Department are concerned.  During the war a Department of Industry and Commerce building was erected across the street&mdash;a magnificent building.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could tell us of a single post office building that was erected during his period as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  So far as I can recollect there has not been a single one.  There certainly has not been one over £1,000.  When it comes to providing essential services it seems to me the Minister is at the end of the queue and, by the time the Minister makes up his mind to look for something for the Post Office, it has all gone and then the Government use on the Minister the same kind of argument as Mother Hubbard used on the dog.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to wake up and realise that, whether he likes it or not, the public hold him responsible for the provision of a first-class public service and that therefore he ought to insist that in the matter of equipment and of buildings he has as good a right to be heard at the Cabinet meetings as other Ministers.  There is one thing he ought to say in any case and he ought to say it soon, that is, that, so far, the others have been getting away with what they like and that unfortunately he always seems to have a fork when the Cabinet are giving away soup.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the organisation within the Post Office Department for the erection of telephone buildings, I have complained and I want again to complain that the Post Office have not the first notion of how to start in so far as the erection of post office buildings is concerned and appear <Col N="389" /> to become completely ineffective in having proper buildings provided for the transaction of post office work.  The building section in the Minister's Department is the most hopelessly staffed section of the Department.  I should like the Minister personally to look into this matter of the staff that is in the building section.  If he does, he will realise that an urban council charged with the erection of a few houses now and again probably has a much better technical staff than there is in the building section of his Department.  I do not blame the people there.  I sympathise with them.  I pity them.  They are trying to implement a building policy without adequate staff and without a single technician.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon quoted a statement made by the officer in charge of the building section before the Public Accounts Committee in which a great deal of technical language was used as to the capacity of buildings to bear certain weights and pressures.  Deputy Dillon apparently did not know that the officer who was using that language was not in fact a qualified technician from the standpoint of being an engineer or an architect.  It is true that he has acquired qualifications as a result of long association with building work but equally it is true that the Post Office, in what is described as a building section, have not a draughtsman, an architect, an engineer or any kind of craftsman.  There is not a single person there that has ever served an apprenticeship to any type of building work.  That is the building section of the Post Office Department.  If one deliberately set out to make a mess of the section he could not do it so successfully.  That is the position in the building section.  I think there are only four or five officers in the place, and while they may have got one or two more since I last complained about this matter, the place is appallingly understaffed, starved for staff and starved for technicians.  It is, no wonder that there are unsatisfactory post offices and telephone exchanges throughout the country when that is the situation in the Minister's own office.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the Minister cannot be <Col N="390" /> induced to take a sufficiently deep interest in the matter to remedy a situation of that kind.  I wonder when he is going to wake up over this whole business and provide a proper building section in the Department, staffed by technicians, staffed by people who know what building operations are, by people with some imagination as to what the future development of the Post Office service in its various branches is likely to be.  While an improvement in that particular section should help in the production of buildings more speedily and in a more satisfactory type of building, the Minister ought to try to think more deeply even than that.  The Post Office is a very essential service and if it is to cater satisfactorily for the needs of the people, it must have within itself the authority and the powers of control necessary to such a nation wide service.</P>
    <P>At present, before the Post Office can expend any money, they must get sanction from the Department of Finance and, when they have got that sanction, they have to ask the Board of Works to look at the scheme and see if they can carry it out.  Between the Post Office, the Department of Finance and the Board of Works, there is an endless stream of correspondence which goes on and on and on.  If anybody wants you to provide a satisfactory service, you cannot do it by circulating a file from the Post Office to the Department of Finance, then to the Board of Works and then back to the Post Office.  People dealing with correspondence in that way finally get the impression that the file is the important thing and not the subject matter of the file.  It seems to me that the main concern is to keep the file right, to keep it properly minuted and, so long as the file is right and there is no evidence of any delay, you can keep up this circulation process and it does not matter much what the file is about.  That is not the way to provide a satisfactory service.</P>
    <P>The Minister should do a bit of deep thinking about this whole position and stake his claim with the Department of Finance and the Government&mdash;and <Col N="391" /> he has some rights with the Government, though he may feel he has none with the Department of Finance.  He ought to stake the claim that the Post Office should be given some autonomy, some sense of independence, some freedom from the rigidity of financial control which operates to-day.  If the Post Office, as a widespread service, wants to give the public the best possible service, it ought to be able to provide that service of its own volition, within wide degrees of economy and ought to be able to provide, within its own Department, the necessary sections&mdash;such as building and equipment sections&mdash;for the purpose of implementing its intentions in providing improved services.  The present control which the Department of Finance exercises over the Post Office is a stranglehold control.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that if a world-famous vocalist arrived here to-morrow morning and offered to sing a few songs from Radio Éireann for 2/6 each, someone would have to write to the Department of Finance to get sanction, to see whether the man might be allowed to sing them at 2/6 a time. Again, if you suggest that a female duty should be made a male duty, as it would be done better in that way, they say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, but they have to go to Finance to see whether a female job can be converted into a male one.  That is the state of affairs in the national Post Office service, or a service which masquerades as one; that is the control which, apparently, the Post Office has not sufficient energy even to try to shake off.  It may not be easy, but at least someone should make an effort to shake off that type of control.  So far, I do not know whether the Minister has done anything in the matter.  If he has, it has been conspicuously unsuccessful. I suggest to him that, in view of the new and wider services which the Post Office is taking into its administration, there should be a greater measure of autonomy there and that he should try to get out of the muzzle and handcuffs in which he is at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell the Government and the Department of Finance that his Department is so far-flung and has such widely-spread services that it <Col N="392" /> is essential to have a measure of control to enable it to administer those services much more efficiently and much more effectively than it is doing to-day.  So far, I do not know whether the Minister has even stumbled across that notion.  Someone should do it and make an effort to get the Post Office the control which it needs.  If that control were passed to the Post Office, as it has passed in a very large measure to the British Post Office, the public would get speedier decisions and a more satisfactory service as well.</P>
    <P>In connection with the telephone administration, I want to deal with the staffing of the telephone services.  Quite frankly, I have never been able to understand why the Post Office huckstered with staff so much.  It has not distinguished itself in the provision of sufficient telephone staff in Dublin.  I can see that the service has been improved a good deal lately, although there is still much leeway to be made up.  Yet, if you tell the Post Office that there is an insufficient staff in the Telephone Exchange, the reply is: &ldquo;Very well, we will recruit six temporary people&rdquo;; and it seems to take so long to recruit them that, by the time they have been appointed, it is not six but three times six that are needed.  Then, when there is complaint, they have another look: &ldquo;We recruited six recently and, if the position is still very bad, we will look for another six.&rdquo; This miserable huckstering practice in the provision of staff goes on, until one gets the impression that the Post Office do not want the telephone service to develop and have got themselves into a rut, in which they say: &ldquo;Why are the public using the telephone so much and giving us so much trouble to provide more staff?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anyone dealing with a commercial undertaking similar to the Post Office would probably welcome circumstances in which it was necessary to increase the staff, but when you approach the Post Office and say that the staff is insufficient, there is one defence: &ldquo;Do we really need more staff?  Why do we need them?  Can we not do with a certain number of people and manage in a particular way?&rdquo; They forget that this is a national service which ought to be operated on the basis of making <Col N="393" /> a generous allowance where staffing requirements are concerned.  In respect of the telephone service, that is a particularly desirable policy, as anyone who was ever inside the service would realise at once that telephone operating is a very onerous, a very fatiguing and a very nerve-racking operation, and that, if the best is to be got out of the service, it will not be got by working the staff under such conditions.</P>
    <P>If this service were a losing service, the Minister might plead that in defence of a niggardly staff policy, but the fact of the matter is that, according to the last commercial accounts, the Post Office is making a surplus of £250,000 per year.  I suggest, therefore, that the way is clear for the implementation of an enlightened telephone policy, by the provision of decent wages for the staff, by extending to the staff decent conditions of employment and by recognising frankly that the character of telephone operating work is so nerve-racking and fatiguing that the staff employed on it ought to have the most ideal conditions so far as the Post Office can ensure them, especially since it has got a surplus of a quarter million pounds per year on the telephone service.</P>
    <P>With respect to the wages which it pays to its telephone staff, whether for day time or for day and night attendance, the Post Office has nothing to plume itself on.  The wage scales ought to be very much better, having regard to the importance of the work, and to the fact that a large measure of the surplus which is available at the moment is got by employing staff at wages and under conditions which are in need of urgent improvement.  With respect to the employment in the grade known as night and Sunday telephone attendance, I think the Post Office ought to be thoroughly ashamed of itself.  I have never seen in my whole life such a huckstering and miserable mentality as that which the Post Office displays when it comes to employing night and Sunday staff on telephone attendance work in provincial offices.  With regard to that particular service, the Post Office has <Col N="394" /> such regard for the Constitution and the Encyclicals that it advertises for people to do the job at the lowest possible price and gives the job on a bargaining basis.  If people will present themselves to do the job for such and such a rate, the attitude of the Post Office&mdash;one of the organs that one would imagine would have some respect for decent conditions and for decent concepts of life&mdash;is this: &ldquo;Very well, we will take the lowest bidder,&rdquo; and it takes the lowest bidder in a matter of that kind.  All that is done by a telephone Department which is making a surplus of over a quarter million pounds per year.  I think that the Post Office ought to be ashamed of itself so far as the wage rates it pays for night and Sunday telephone attendance are concerned.  I think the Minister might well try to exonerate himself from the responsibility which devolves on him in this matter by making some personal inquiries into the low standards of remuneration paid to those people, especially having regard to the hours during which they work and try to pay them a wage that will not oblige him to hang his head when the amount of it is mentioned.</P>
    <P>I want to see, and I think the House wants to see, an efficient and well-managed telephone service provided.  I think everybody realises that it is an essential service, and one capable of bringing a considerable measure of convenience and comfort into the lives of the people.  But, if we are to have that well-managed and efficient service, then we ought to recognise at once that there is need for an enlightened outlook so far as the provision of adequate staff is concerned, the provision of satisfactory buildings, and extending to the staff conditions which will ensure that they can co-operate to the fullest in the provision of the most efficient service that the Post Office can provide.  I have got the feeling, in regard to the telephone service, that it is a kind of unwanted child so far as the Post Office is concerned.  It has been the last acquisition by the Post Office.  The Post Office was originally a Post Office Department.  It later became a Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The acquisition of telephone <Col N="395" /> activities came later.  I have always felt that the Post Office mind has never measured up the fact that it is now the foster-father of the telephone service.  This latest addition to its service seems to have had a cramping and crippling effect upon it. If the Post Office is going to provide a satisfactory telephone service for the country, then I think it will have to shed that mentality, and will have to recognise that the telephone service is one of the natural children of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It will have to get away from the unwanted child philosophy, and recognise that if telephone development is to be encouraged until it becomes an efficient service, the Post Office must adopt new methods, more comprehensive methods, and it must see that telephone development gets as good a chance as other aspects of the work done by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this measure represents a departure from the attitude adopted previously, not by the Minister but by the chiefs in the Department, I welcome it.  I remember that for quite a long time, when application was made for facilities in some rural areas, one was told that they would not be justified because of the number of people who might avail of them.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that under this Bill it is proposed to extend the telephone service to some country post offices.  On that question, I want the Minister to go much further.  I think that in many ways the telephone service is as important as rural electrification.  I think that to a large extent the telephone service should be looked upon as a social service&mdash;one to provide amenities for the people in the rural areas.  I want the Minister to adopt this attitude, that in future he will endeavour to cater for the isolated rural areas irrespective of whether or not there is a post office in them.  The people living in isolated areas, in mountainous areas along the western seaboard, some of them ten and 20 miles from the nearest town, should, in my opinion, be provided with telephone facilities so that they will be able to get medical assistance, <Col N="396" /> to call the priest or to get a veterinary surgeon if they want one. They should be placed in as favourable a position as the people living nearer the towns.  The attitude of the Minister should be, irrespective of the question of cost, to provide them with the amenities that I speak of.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk from time to time in this House about people flying from the land, as well as on the question of the lack of amenities in the rural areas.  The Minister could go a long way towards correcting that situation by providing telephone facilities in isolated areas.  I do not know how much there is in the argument that this Bill should have been introduced a long time ago.  I have the feeling that possibly we were not ready for a measure of this kind until recent years, because of the fact that the number of people who took advantage of the existing telephone system was comparatively few when a comparison was made with other countries.  The fact now is that the telephone has become a necessity for businessmen and others. It has also become a necessity from a social point of view.  It is essential that this service should be available to the people.</P>
      <P>On the question of priorities, I would ask the Minister when he comes to carry out operations under this Bill to give them a rural bias, and to cater for those parts of the country where the people are crying out for this service. It can be said that the people in the cities and towns have at least a skeleton service.  I know many areas in the country, in my own constituency in fact, where people have been agitating for a telephone service for a number of years.  I should like to see those people given a priority when the scheme under his Bill comes to be operated.  It will be useless to say in ten or 15 years' time that we have depopulated rural areas if we fail now to give to the people in the countryside the benefits which other sections of the community, living in towns, enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that a rather narrow conception of its responsibilities is being taken by the Minister's Department in its attitude towards the telephone service in the country.  The Department ought to visualise the day, and <Col N="397" /> work and plan for the day, when each and every rural household, each and every farmer, will be in a position to connect with the telephone service if he wants to do so.  The aim of the Minister should be to provide a telephone service in every village in the country.  I have the feeling that possibly one of the reasons why the telephone has come into such popular use in the United States is that you have various types of concerns competing against one another in running that service.  I have the feeling that if we had private concerns in control of the telephone service in this country, and competing against one another, we possibly would have advanced much further than we have under the control of the Department. I think the Minister should visualise the day when the people of the country will insist on getting the same facilities as their brethren in the towns and the Department should accordingly plan for the time when each and every citizen, no matter how isolated his homestead may be, will be in a position to avail of this service.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter which I want to bring to the notice of the Minister.  Viewed from the point of view of popularising the service, I consider that the rentals are too high. They may be quite all right for a large business concern or for the ordinary professional man in the country who uses the telephone service, but I think that in order to popularise it and in particular to make the service available, in so far as it is possible to make it available for the rural community, there should be a specially reduced rate in rentals for the rural community.  The more isolated an area is, the more reasonable the charges should be so as to encourage the rural community to make use of this new service.  In other words, I should like the Minister to give a completely rural bias to his plans for the proposed changes.  The Minister or his advisers may suggest that this would not be economic or that it could not be done, but I think that if the service were made available at a cheaper rate, as time went on, you would have a very much larger number of people anxious to avail of it.</P>
    <P>I believe that if you brought the telephone <Col N="398" /> within reach of the ordinary working man and the farmer, so that they could avail of it for shopping and for the carrying out of ordinary transactions in the country, the number of telephone users would increase tenfold. The way to popularise the service is to make it cheap for the people.  I believe that if the rentals were cheaper a very much larger percentage of the population would avail of it.  I do not know what proportion of the £250,000 profit made on the Department is attributable to the profits made on the telephone service, but I feel that the rentals charged at the moment are out of all proportion to what people, for whom I want the Minister to cater, should be called upon to pay.  I want the Minister to extend the telephone service to the rural areas, to the working man and the small farmer throughout the country, and to dissociate his mind, in so far as he can, from any question of finance in this matter because I think this service is as much a social service, in so far as it caters for the people of the country generally, as the rural electrification scheme.  I should like the Minister to bear in mind particularly the question of priority for isolated areas so that a start can be made in districts that are crying out for this service.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has referred to the really grave matter that is involved in this discussion.  I want to confirm the Deputy's statements, though not necessarily in the language he used.  He said that he had been seven years on the Committee of Public Accounts, when they were dealing with the matter of providing a central telephone exchange in the city.  I had the misfortune to spend ten years on that Committee, and the manner in which this question was dealt with was one of the reasons that compelled me to retire from the Committee. Nobody entrusted with the duty of assigning responsibility for these matters would tolerate the way in which the observations of the Committee were dealt with.  It is a long, sad and discreditable story.  Deputy Norton says that he pities and sympathises with the Minister.  I neither sympathise with nor pity him.</P>

      <P>No effort was made to inaugurate an effective telephone system when it was obvious that the telegraph system had failed. Obviously the telegraph system throughout the world was on the dead line and was looked upon as antiquated. According as it declined, the charges for telegrams were increased until ultimately nobody would touch them at all.  Then we had the future distinctly marked out for us as to what road we were going to travel.  The delay described by Deputy Dillon in regard to the scheme was utterly indefensible. The site at St. Andrew Street was clear at a time when material was cheaper than it had been at any period for 50 years.  Then there was this hugger-mugger between two outside bodies and the Department with the result that the whole scheme was held up.  In my opinion nobody but the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should have any say in this matter.  I should like to hear from the Minister now when he is going to initiate the construction of this building.  We hope that the lay-out of the exchange will be a credit to the Department, not only in the matter of the efficiency of its technical staff but in the matter of the pay and conditions of those recruited to the Department to bring this service to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not forget that efficiency and expedition will be demanded of the people in the exchanges, and that we will not get them, unless we provide for these people the very best conditions and pay possible.  I understand that a large number of these employees are recruited on a temporary basis and paid some meagre, paltry wage which would not meet the charges for board and lodging which obtain at present in Dublin. I do not mind whether the Department makes a profit or not, but if the public demand service&mdash;and they must get it&mdash;they should be asked to pay for it. They should not get it on the basis of slave labour and slave conditions.  I ask the Minister to see to it that a <Col N="400" /> restaurant and rest-rooms for the workers will be provided in the new building and also that there will be a recasting of the conditions under which girls have to work.</P>
    <P>I do not normally poke my nose into matters like this, but girls tell me that the long hours and poor pay lead to a breakdown in health.  I regard that as immoral.  The first people with a claim on these profits referred to by Deputy Norton are those who do the work and make the profit possible, and if these services are to be provided, the House will willingly vote the money necessary to give the employees the conditions and pay which will ensure a good service, because the service will never be efficient unless those who provide it enjoy the best conditions of service and pay. Expedition is the very essence of the service and there should be no &ldquo;humming&rdquo; or &ldquo;hawing&rdquo; about providing the necessary money.  We should embark on a whole-hog policy of giving a first-class service and the House and the country must appreciate that it can be given only by people enjoying the best possible conditions.</P>
    <P>I could go on to labour the charges made against the Minister by Deputy Dillon&mdash;and it was right and proper for Deputy Dillon to refer to them in order that we may see where we have failed in the past and where reform is necessary in the future&mdash;but I do not believe in inquests.  The effect of the delay in providing a better service will be to prevent people from becoming telephone-minded.  I spend a couple of months each year in the country and I have gone into post offices, which shall be nameless, and have had to wait an hour and two hours before getting a call through.  Surely the Minister must appreciate that in this busy world, people will not be satisfied to wait an hour or two hours for a call.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that in the case of urgent calls for doctors or ambulances &mdash;cases in which an urgent operation may be required&mdash;over a distance of 20 miles should involve a delay of an hour or two hours.  Steps to remedy that situation will have to be taken as quickly as possible, if the public are not to be turned against the telephone. <Col N="401" /> If this money is to produce results, it is essential that we should make the people telephone-minded at once. There are technical difficulties which give rise to these delays and apparently, at the moment, the defence is lack of equipment, but the Minister will see that it is futile to invest a very large sum of money if we so sour the public that they will not bother about the service.</P>
    <P>With regard to charges, I have said here before that the popularity of this new undertaking will depend ultimately on the price and I regard the present scale of charges as far too high. The rates for extensions are far too high and the rentals also are too high. Deputy Moran spoke of getting a telephone into the working-man's home. What a world Deputy Moran is living in if he thinks the working man could afford a telephone on the basis of the present charges for installation and rental! We will never popularise the telephone on the basis of these charges, and I suggest it would be a good investment to do what commercial undertakings do, that is, to sell at a loss at the beginning in order to gain in the future.  We should take a long view and should make sacrifices in the matter of charges, knowing full well that ultimately the Post Office and the State will gain.</P>
    <P>The Minister can spread this system through the country and can put up these exchanges, but a return on the money invested can be got only by giving an efficient and cheap service, because nothing is ever really popular unless it is reasonably cheap.  On the basis of the present charges for installation and rental, nobody but people with money, middle-class people, will be able to afford the installation and rental charges, plus the charge for calls.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to turn over a new leaf.  I would ask that this telephone exchange be tackled at once.  That eye-sore has been in St. Andrew Street for the last 14 years. The Public Accounts Committee have been dealing with it.  Ground rents have been paid and yet there has been all this fiddling with it.  Not a brick has been laid yet.  A first-class job <Col N="402" /> ought to be made of it.  I cannot see how the Minister can have any defence in connection with it.  In Kildare Street, the Minister for Industry and Commerce put up one of the finest buildings in this island in a fraction of the time.  That building was not thought of when the St. Andrew Street site was acquired.</P>
    <P>I wish again to reiterate that unless you give an efficient and cheap service you cannot achieve success.  That is the cardinal element in a successful business.  The Minister also should not forget that in order to get that he will have to give his employees good working conditions and good pay.  There should be no cheeseparing, because bad pay and bad conditions of service will mean inefficient work.  You cannot get efficient work out of people serving under these conditions.  I understand young girls are taken in at about 30/- per week.  I am not positive about that and there may be some bonus given; but, if that be true it is really a scandal to ask any decent man's daughter to live in this city on 35/- or 37/- a week, considering the cost of board and lodging, clothes, etc. It is indefensible and, so far as I am concerned, I want to dissociate myself from it.  If that is obtaining now, I hope that an end will be put to it at once.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to enter on the records of the House a protest against the extraordinary way in which this debate has been allowed to be conducted.  There were questions raised here about matters which occurred between 1932 and 1938, matters which should never have been allowed to be discussed on the Bill at all.  That was followed up by a display of bad temper and of personal abuse both of the Minister and of the Department, which, coming from a person of the breed of Dillon, was surprising.  I am not going to follow that line or answer him on the same plane in which he spoke.</P>

      <P>Turning to the debate itself, I quite realise the difficulty which Deputies had in dealing with the difference between discussing matters which should be discussed on the Estimates and what should be discussed on this Bill, which was the only matter before the House.  The object of this Bill is to devote £6,000,000 to a very large extension of the telephone service in the country.  I do not think that at this stage I should enter into any details on the matters raised.  Deputies know perfectly well that the staff of the telephone department are always willing and ready to give full information and as adequate a service as can be given under the present conditions. Undoubtedly, the telephone service is labouring under very grave difficulties.  It has manifold difficulties because of the fact that supplies were completely absent during the six years of the war, while at the same time the telephone appetite has developed in this country.  People have become telephone-minded. We all welcome the progress and the vitality shown by the people, not merely in the cities but throughout the country.  We say, however, that the best we can do is to spend ultimately £10,000,000.  I should like to spend that £10,000,000 in ten years; but, having regard to the elaborate amount of plant which has to be imported and the enormous mileage of main trunk and side lines which has to be put down, all that is going to take a very considerable time.</P>
      <P>Planning is well ahead.  The staff has to be increased.  We are going to increase our staff by 1,000.  That includes people at headquarters and people in all the exchanges that will be spread all over the country.  We are going to increase the number of private subscribers' lines from, we hope, 31,000 to at least 100,000.  Probably the number of people who will be looking for telephones will hardly reach 100,000, but we cannot supply them if we do not apply for them.  In the meantime, we expect that it will take us about 18 months to deal with arrears arising out of the war.  There are, I think, about 1,700 in the area of Dublin and about 4,000 in the whole country.  Then again we are going to put telephones into every post office in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to take them in a certain order of priority, because we must take the ones where the population is larger first.  But we hope to spread it throughout the country.  We should be able to do it in from seven and a half to ten years. We aimed at five years, but I am afraid that that is asking for more than can possibly be done.  Beyond that, I ought not to go into details.  We want to spread out in the rural areas as widely as possible and we propose to reduce the rates of charges.  Some charges were made during the war which, we admit, were prohibitive. There was no use looking for more business during the war period.  Now it is different.  We want to go out and get as many subscribers as we can.  Someone made reference to the fact that I was faced with a certain limitation in regard to putting the telephone into areas where it would not be used. Naturally enough, we must deal with the most populous areas first, the areas where it will bring us in a proper return.  People advocate that we should be almost extravagant in the expenditure of money.  We have always to have regard to the taxpayer. Deputy McMenamin would be the first to feel the criticism of his farmer supporters, if we were to be too extravagant and spend too much of the taxpayer's money.  The profits from the telephone service, which constitute the favourable balance in the balance sheet, are not made out of the general public.  If you were to take away the services given to the other departments for which we get credit, you would take away our whole balance of profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; but the money is ultimately coming out of the taxpayer's pocket and we have to have regard to that.  Now we are to have this £6,000,000.  I hope to be able to spend the whole of the £10,000,000 on this service and to see it spread as widely as possible.  Beyond making these general remarks, I do not think that I should go into details.  We are always <Col N="405" /> prepared to deal with individual cases and, when we are asked about any particular matter, to give answers.  There will be plenty of opportunities on the Estimate to raise all these grievances.</P>
      <P>We hope to have the Andrew Street premises commenced next year.  One could not expect a building like that, which will contain elaborate machinery and the floors of which will have to bear a tremendous weight, to be erected in a short period.  Its construction will take a considerable time. I think Mr. Black's answer, as given in the records, was quite adequate, having regard to the difficulties of the time and the impossibility of getting steel and, subsequently, reinforced concrete. We have to remember the enormous weight which will be placed on the different floors in the building.</P>
      <P>I do not feel that the criticisms that were made were at all fair to the Department, having regard to all the difficulties. Some of the criticisms would appear to have been drawn by my original statement.  If I wished, perhaps the best way to answer those criticisms would be to quote what I said in my original statement.  In the circumstances, however, I do not think I need go any further.  The important thing is to get this Bill through, to get the money and to get on with the work. The Department can be judged on the results which we hope to achieve within the next five years and in the later stages when we complete the work.  I would like to end on this note.  I feel the attack made on my Department has been most unfair in view of the extremely excellent, expert work which the officials have put through their hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat troubled about Section 2.  How is it proposed to operate this measure? Who is to be the licensee and are the police to have control over these buildings? I take it all the premises erected in bogs for the accommodation of the turf workers will not be licensed and that the licence will be granted only for a specific portion of a building.  If that must be so under the licensing laws, then who is to enforce the provisions of this measure?  Are these licences to be offered to people such as general caterers who do this sort of thing throughout the country, or will they be given to some individual who has been in the licensed trade?  Are these licences to be attached to a café or restaurant that will be part of the premises and will police approval be got by the Minister prior to the sanction of these licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can foresee very grave abuse where there are a lot of men congregated in a very limited space unless there is pretty rigid control with regard to the management and the premises are conducted within the provisions of the licensing laws.  I think considerable care should be taken that this thing will not develop into a scandal.  I am not objecting to the provisions of the Bill at all; I am only anxious that this scheme will not be abused.  These men are decent fellows and I am anxious that the scheme will not be loosely conducted and that these young fellows will not have excessive access to intoxicating drink at all hours by reason of the <Col N="408" /> establishment of these premises in bogs.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should take great care that this scheme is tightened up as far as possible.  I should like to know if the restaurant portion of the premises where the men take their food is to be a separate building, excluded from the place in the huts where the men normally live and sleep. Will the building which will be licensed lend itself to effective control by the Gárdaí so as to ensure that the provisions of the Licensing Acts will be enforced and that the young men who go there from all over the country will not have excessive opportunities of getting on the downward slope and degrading themselves by the undue consumption of intoxicating drink?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, I want to bring to the notice of the Minister a matter which goes to the root of the Bill.  My objection to Section 2 is that I think the Minister is interfering in the normal activities of the licensed business.  I agree, as I said before on this Bill, that it is essential to provide accommodation for those men on the bogs who may be living a great distance from the nearest public house.  What I do not see is why the Minister should not leave it open to the licensed trade to obtain a licence to run canteens and cater for these men.  By an amendment to this section, the Minister could provide that a licence could be applied for by a publican to cater for this job in the same way as caterers meet the requirements of the attendance at race meetings or in the same way as publicans cater for canteens in military barracks.  Publicans should be allowed to tender under this Bill for catering for the turf camps and I do not see why this should be the exclusive business of Bord na Móna.  I take it that, under the Bill, they will have the sole supply of the liquor and the provision of the necessary facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would achieve the object he has in view if Bord na Móna erected, in connection with their present canteens, suitable premises which they would hire to the publican whose tender for catering would be accepted.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter on this section. <Col N="409" /> Local publicans should be placed in the same position as that in which publicans now are in connection with the military barracks.  It is their province and it should not be interfered with.  No matter what may be said, this scheme will interfere in greater or lesser degree with the trade of the local publicans. We are all agreed that it is necessary to provide facilities for the workers.  I am prepared to support the Minister in providing those facilities but I see no reason why this should be the exclusive right of Bord na Móna.  As I have said, the business of catering for these people should be left, by way of tender, to the publicans and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that aspect of the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill, I took great exception to the form of the measure on the ground (1) that it set aside the entire procedure which hitherto obtained under the licensing code and (2) that it excluded <i>in toto</i> the jurisdiction of the courts. On that ground alone, I think that the principle of the Bill is a very bad one and one which should not receive the sanction of the House.  I put it to the Minister that this problem of catering for the bog workers could have been approached in an entirely different way without violating the principles of our licensing code&mdash;in other words, by preserving the procedure which gave the right to the police, to the trade, to temperance societies and to interested persons to go into court and, if they so desired, to voice their objection to the grant of a licence.  It would also enable the courts to dispose openly of matters of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seriously suggest that the Minister should withdraw this Bill in its present form because, in essence, it is transferring to anonymous civil servants the right to grant, renew and transfer licences, all of which functions are, properly speaking, within the jurisdiction of our courts.  It would have been a simple matter to prescribe procedure whereby licences could be granted in the bog areas without in any way interfering with the law relating to the grant, renewal and transfer of licences. I suggest that a simple formula could be devised by which the provisions of <Col N="410" /> the 1902 Act could be related to these licences.  As the Minister and the House are aware, under the 1902 Act, which is law still, no new licence can be granted unless the applicant can show that there has been an increase in the population of the district in which the licence is sought to be granted of not less than 25 per cent., as shown by the figures of the previous census.  It would have been a simple matter for the Minister to bring in a Bill which, in the case of those bog licences, would presume, by reason of the presence of these men in the bogs, that that increase had taken place.  In some places, where 400 or 500 men are assembled on the bogs, their presence would represent an actual increase of 25 per cent. in the population of the area but, assuming that their number does not, in fact, amount to such an increase, a formula could be devised whereby such an increase would be deemed to have taken place.  If the Bill had been framed in that fashion the present procedure and the jurisdiction of the courts would have been fully preserved.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister the desirability, even at this stage, of considering that matter.  If he is prepared to accept amendments on these lines, I shall have suitable amendments provided for Report Stage.  This is so serious a departure from the licensing code which at present prevails that all members of the House should sit up and think seriously of what we are doing. We are vesting in an anonymous civil servant the right to grant, renew and transfer licences without any inquiry or objection by the police and without any opportunity being given to temperance societies, interested traders or other such persons to come in and voice their opinion, if they wish to do so.  Not only that but a serious principle is involved in the whole business.  You are setting the State up in business in competition with the small trader in the country.  The Minister and his colleagues claim to respect the principles of democracy and claim to cater for the small man.  I see nothing in this Bill but an attempt to squelch the small man, the country trader, and to set up instead a monopoly, whether it be a monopoly under Bord na Móna or a <Col N="411" /> monopoly under persons to be selected by the Minister independently of Bord na Móna.  I would remind Deputy Moran that Bord na Móna does not appear in this Bill.  The Minister says it is the intention that the camp superintendent appointed by Bord na Móna will be the licensee.  If that is so, it is not set out in this Bill.  In that regard I want to repeat what I have already said, that the person who is in charge of the canteen or the bog manager may be very good in his own way but may have no experience of running a licensed house or of controlling a crowd lit up with drink in a licensed house. They may be the wrong type of people for this type of work.  It is essential that we should be careful in this regard because, under the provisions of this Bill, the Minister can withdraw the licence at any time from a particular individual and give it to another individual. I want to put this case to the Minister, that the type of gentleman I have in mind, who has no experience of the business, who is unable to control a crowd in a public house&mdash;and not even all experienced publicans can control a crowd in a public house&mdash;may allow things to get to such a pitch that the Minister or the board may have to step in and take the licence from him and the police may have come in on a few occasions and endorsed the licence.  The Minister forthwith gets rid of this man and transfers the licence to the next man and the supervision of the licensing laws becomes a physical impossibility.</P>
    <P>I am dead against State monopoly and against State competition with private enterprise.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Minister from giving the catering licences and the liquor business to either manufacturing or wholesale firms, as in the case of the Army.  It is not correct to say that in the case of the Army members of the licensing trade as such, that is the retailers, get the licences.</P>

I want to put it to the Minister that it is bad business for the State to hand over a virtual monopoly of that kind to big wholesalers and to cut out the small man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that we are discussing the grant and renewal of licences.  I put it to the Minister that, instead of granting licences as he proposes to grant them, he should reconsider this whole matter and consider the retail trade as the proper trade to which licences should be granted.  In the bog areas the presence of these men will create a boom.  They will have wages to spend.  In many of these areas there are licensed premises within reasonable distance of the bog and though the Minister may think it unreasonable to ask a man to travel a couple of miles for a drink after his day's work, very often the farmer and labourer in the country have to travel three, four or five miles for a drink after their day's work.  The retailer in the area, if he wants to go into the business, should have the right to seek this licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would even go further and suggest that the licence to be granted to him should be in the form of an extension of his existing licence and, if he misconducts his licence in the bog, that it should be an offence by him as a licensee under his own licence, in other words, that any irregularities that may occur in the camp will be regarded in law as irregularities in his own licensed premises and be dealt with as such by the police and by the courts. That would not be unreasonable and <Col N="413" /> it would be a safeguard to the public and to all concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I think is appropriate to this question of licence and that is the question of supplies. The Minister has not told us where the supplies are going to come from, but we do know that, by some mysterious workings of his Department, supplies can be had for the hotels under the Tourist Board and for the airports, while everybody engaged in the licensed trade is up against the proposition that he cannot get supplies except on the basis of a quota fixed years ago.  If a man goes into the business in the morning and buys a licensed premises, he has to operate on the quota that obtained in the particular premises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is pertinent to the grant of a licence.  It is an extraordinary position that these supplies can be forthcoming when they are denied to the ordinary trade.  I want to stress that point, because I think it is unfair to the trade and it is unfair to the community who have a livelihood out of that trade.  In any event, I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole position in the light of what I say and to restrict the grant of licences to the traders in the areas. First of all, give them the preference and, failing any trader in the area willing to avail himself of the licence, then give it to any retailer, wherever he may be, who wants to take up the contract, but I want to keep out the manufacturer or the wholesaler.</P>
      <P>I want to stress another point, that the policy envisaged in this Bill is contrary to the policy of the Minister for Justice.  At the present time in many areas it is impossible for a publican to get a grant of a new licence except by cancelling an old licence.  Under the 1927 Act, we had provision for the cancellation of redundant licences.  Here we have a Minister of State going into the business of the licensed trade, indirectly, through Bord na Móna and setting himself up with several licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the whole approach to this problem is on the <Col N="414" /> wrong lines.  It is transferring to the bureaucracy of his Department the right to grant new licences and transfer them, a vicious principle and one that this House should not endorse.  I suggest seriously to the Minister to reconsider this whole Bill in the light of what I say and to bring in a simple provision by which the District Court would be enabled to grant a certificate on the assumption that, by reason of the presence of bog workers in a particular area, there has been a 25 per cent. increase in the population.  At the same time, I want to preserve the right of all persons to come in and object to the grant, renewal or transfer of the licence, as the case may be.  I want to give priority in consideration to the local trade and, failing the local trade, then to any retail trader who may wish to come in.  I think that is only reasonable and it would meet the objections, which are very many, to this particular measure in its present form.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coogan has asked me to amend the Bill in the light of what he said.  I cannot undertake to do that.  I do not know exactly what he is seeking.  There is nothing in the Bill about granting a State monopoly to civil servants in the transfer or granting of licences.  This Bill is to enable Bord na Móna to run canteens at turf camps in isolated areas.  That is the sole purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not put Bord na Móna in the Bill and let them go to the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that was the purpose of the Deputy's argument. It seems to me that the purpose was in the opposite direction.  He seemed to argue in favour of giving the licence to someone other than Bord na Móna.  Deputy Moran was quite frank in regard to that.  The Bill does not prevent the possibility of Bord na Móna having the canteens run under contract.  I would not regard it as a desirable method, nor do I think the board contemplates it.  They have stated to me that they intend to run <Col N="415" /> these canteens themselves, that is to say, that the camp manager will be an official of their own and hold the licence and, if he loses that position, he will lose the licence.</P>
      <P>So long as it is the camp manager who holds the licence, <i>ex officio</i>, there is no property in the licence, as he holds it as an official of the board.  If he loses his employment because he does not do the job properly, he loses the licence and his successor takes it on.  If the camp is wound up, as all these camps will be wound up, when the bogs adjacent to them have been exhausted, the licence will be extinguished and there will be no problem in that regard.</P>
      <P>I think it is far more desirable that the board should run these canteens themselves and manage their own staff.  I am certain there will be no difficulty whatever in getting suitable people to manage the canteens and there should be no question of any private interest in the licence.  The objection I see to the board operating these canteens on contract, or to the alternative suggestion of giving the licence to a private trader, is that the interest of the private trader will conflict inevitably with the interests of the board.  The board is concerned merely to see that the camps are properly managed, while the private trader is mainly concerned with getting a profit out of the licence. It is inevitable that the profit motive of the trader would come into conflict with the board's management.  I think the board should be in charge of the canteens and have full power of supervision over them, including the power to dismiss the manager of the canteen, who would be the holder of the licence, if it thinks such a course would be proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that the Bill has not been framed so as to exclude absolutely the possibility of the board having its catering arrangements carried out for it under contract, just as the catering arrangements at the airports are done under contract.  Similar legislation to this was passed to enable restaurants, in which liquor could be sold, to be established at the airports and again I think the necessity for the departure from the principle of the Intoxicating <Col N="416" /> Liquor Acts was quite sound.  This is not a case in which it is necessary to go to the courts and give other trading interests, or the police or the temperance societies, an opportunity to object.  It is agreed here in the Dáil that it is desirable that in these isolated camps there should be facilities for the recreation hours of the men employed in them and the necessity for having them there can be appreciated by everybody here.  We do not have to go through the procedure of making a case before a district justice in order to get that necessity recognised.  Everybody here recognises it.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill, I said I would not be prepared to grant a licence to an official of the board for the sale of liquor at the board's canteen where the camp operated by the board was within a reasonable distance of suitable licensed premises operated by private traders.  Deputy Coogan has quoted me as objecting to workmen travelling a couple of miles for a drink after their day's work.  What I said was that I would regard it as undesirable if they had to travel more than a couple of miles for a drink after their day's work.  Certainly, in my view, if there were suitable licensed premises within a radius of two miles from the camp, there would be no necessity to grant them a licence under this Bill and no licence would be granted; but where, as will be the case in the majority of instances, the camp is in an isolated area where there is no licensed premises within a reasonable radius from the camp, then it would be unfair to the workers employed there if they could not get a drink at the end of the day without travelling many miles for it.</P>
    <P>If it is agreed that in these isolated camps there should be some canteen facilities, it seems to me to follow automatically that there should be agreement that those facilities should be provided by the camp managers and supervised by them, that there should be no private property in the licence to sell drink, that the licence may be withdrawn at any time from the person to whom it was given, if he ceases to be an official of the organisation and <Col N="417" /> also can be withdrawn if and when the camp is closed up, so that there would be no continuing ownership interest concerned.  That is the sole purpose of the Bill and the sole purpose of this section.  There is nothing in the Bill which is in conflict with the principles contained in the Intoxicating Liquor Acts, and nothing for which there is not a precedent.  I mentioned the precedent of the legislation which empowered the granting of licences in connection with airports.  The exemption in the Intoxicating Liquor Act for canteens run in connection with Army barracks is also a precedent.  I would not at all agree&mdash;in fact, I would strongly disagree&mdash;that it is preferable that these canteens in turf camps should be run by private traders for their own profit.  I think it is infinitely preferable that they should be run by the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Minister and disagree with Deputy Coogan on this question of the necessity to bring this matter before the courts.  The tests laid down for the courts under the licensing laws are mainly, first, the character and suitability of the applicant, and secondly, the suitability of the premises.  This would not arise in these cases, as they are new premises and, at all events, 98 per cent. of the applicants who apply are in the main suitable and would not fail on those grounds.  I do not see why the Minister would not leave the position, in connection with these camps, the same as it was in the case of the Army.  In the latter case it was open to the licensed trade to tender for the running of these establishments.  It is admitted, of course, that the provisions of the licensing Acts will apply to licences granted under this Bill.  The Minister has yet to convince me that some manager appointed by Bord na Móna knows more about the licensing business than a member of the licensed trade.  The Minister makes a point about the question of profits. Where are the profits made by the managers under this particular Bill to go?  Will they not accrue to the benefit of Bord na Móna?  Surely <Col N="418" /> profits will be made, and, if so, why should they go to Bord na Móna rather than to an ordinary member of the licensed trade?  Under the Bill, the Minister can put in any safeguard that he sees fit with regard to the conduct of the camp or the running of this business.  There is nothing to prevent him from doing that.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister of this: that every year the publicans in this country have to go to the courts for a renewal of their licences, and before getting that renewal they have to satisfy the court that they have been running their businesses in a proper manner&mdash;that they have complied with the law.  In addition, a publican has to prove to the court, by a certificate signed by, I think, eight of his neighbours, that he is conducting his business in a proper manner. Otherwise, his licence will not be renewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there is that check on every member of the retail licensed trade&mdash;that his licence has to be renewed each year by the court.  If the Minister leaves it open under this Bill to members of the retail licensed trade to tender for the running of these camps, they will, of course, have to comply with the existing law, and will have to make application each year to the court for a renewal of the licences. All that I am asking the Minister to do is to reconsider this matter.  I am putting it quite frankly to him that I believe in publicans being allowed to carry on their business, just as I believe in lawyers and doctors being allowed to carry out their professional duties.  I think that the proper people to carry on a licensing business are members of the retail licensed trade.  I would be satisfied if the Minister would now indicate that it will be open to any member of the licensed trade under this Bill&mdash;and if the Minister would recommend that to Bord na Móna&mdash;to tender for the catering at these particular camps.  If the Minister does that, I am quite sure that the members of the licensed trade will conduct these canteens as efficiently as they conducted the Army canteens during the emergency.  I had experience of that in my own town where different local publicans tendered for <Col N="419" /> the catering for Army canteens.  That was the position with regard to the canteens in Castlebar.  I never heard any suggestion that there were any abuses or that those licensed traders did not do their job well.  I would ask the Minister to leave the publicans' business to the publicans.  I think that he should recommend to the board to allow the arrangement that existed in the case of the Army canteens, an arrangement that was proved to be quite satisfactory, to be carried out under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has made any case at all for a departure from the normal procedure so far as the issue of licences by the court is concerned.  The proposal in the Bill represents a complete departure from the present licensing code.  I think it is highly dangerous that the Minister should take on himself responsibility for the issue of these licences.  The Minister informed the House that it is contemplated that the board will provide and run the canteens themselves.  It is also mentioned &mdash;and that is the reason why the board is not mentioned in the Bill&mdash;that they can have this service operated by contract. The Minister can then pick the man to run the service, and that is where the objection comes in.  I think this is an extraordinary procedure, but the Minister is consistent in regard to it&mdash;that this is a State company and is, therefore, entitled to special facilities. This corporation is being put in an altogether different position from that of the ordinary civilian.  I think the Minister is unwise to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appears to think that there is a case for a service of this kind on the bogs, but surely the place to make that case is in open court.  If there are people opposed to it, give them the opportunity of going into court and stating their opposition there.  The place in which to satisfy the public that a service of this sort is necessary is in open court.  Why should the decision be made behind closed doors in the Minister's Department, that a service of this sort is necessary? Surely that is a matter for the court to investigate, whether the provision of <Col N="420" /> this service&mdash;and how it is going to be operated&mdash;is going to be conducive to public order and decency.  That is a consideration that arises, and is one that ought to be decided in open court. It is not the Minister's job to decide it. I think that in departing from the normal procedure the Minister is making an unwise decision.  He would be wise to reconsider the matter.  As regards the issue of licences by the Minister, I put it to him that, in his own interest, it is unwise for him to do that.  It is unwise, from the personal point of view, for him to accept that position.  The responsibility for that decision ought to be put where it rightly belongs, and that is on the courts.  If the matter is decided in open court, then the local clergy can come in there, people interested in temperance and other interests can come in and can give expression to their views.  Let the justice then decide whether it is wise and proper, and in the interests of public order and decency, to have this service provided. Let him satisfy himself that the service is going to be properly conducted, and that there is no political wire-pulling or anything else.  The Minister has attempted to make no case for reserving for himself the right to issue these licences.  It is an irritating procedure to single out a State corporation and put it in a very privileged position, with advantages over and above those enjoyed by the ordinary citizen.  If it be felt that it is necessary, in a case where men are working very hard, to have a service of this sort&mdash;a refreshment bar &mdash;then I repeat that case should be made in open court.  I ask the Minister, for God's sake, not to reserve this function to himself, that it is an unwise decision and that he should reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>I think that the Minister gave his whole case away when he said that the board <i>per se</i> may appoint one of its own officers to conduct the business, or, alternatively, that it may sub-let by contract to outsiders. At first I did not think that the question of patronage did arise under this Bill, but I see clearly now that it does, and that it is the Minister's intention through his instrument, Bord na Móna, to grant <Col N="421" /> licences to his own particular nominees whether these be monopolists, wholesalers or manufacturers, but they cannot be retailers.</P>

      <P>The Minister is afraid to do this.  He is afraid to take this course because it would lead to the creation of property in a licence.  Again I say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I put the point&mdash;and I think I made myself clear&mdash;that in granting a licence to a local retail trader, the licence could be granted by way of an extension of his existing licence with all the obligations and penalties of that licence; in other words, that the local trader could have his licence extended to take the canteen for the period of the bog work.  It would cease automatically with the ending of the operations in the bog. Surely it is not beyond the resources of the Parliamentary draftsman to give us a formula that would do that.  I also ask him to consider doing that by a formula which would presume that a 25 per cent. increase in population had taken place.  Of course, the Minister does not know anything about the licensing laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's own words were that a two-mile radius would represent a suitable area.  Again I hold that a two-mile radius is a very narrow limitation and that, in fact, there are many districts in the country where the nearest licensed premises to a farm worker would be four or five miles away.  There is the consideration I put to the Minister before of police supervision.  That is a very serious consideration because, if the Minister reads his paper, he will have seen where the Guards were chased out of a public house in Robertstown by bog workers some time ago.  If you set up a &ldquo;pub.&rdquo; in every camp I should certainly not like to be the Guard who would go in there and try to enforce the licensing laws.  These things will have to be seriously considered.  I hold the Minister has a better safeguard in giving a licence to the man who is always under the supervision of the Guards, whose licence will be merely an extension of his existing licence and who will have to face the problem that if he offends in the bog camp against the laws, an endorsement automatically follows on his licence at home.  That is a considerable safeguard. <Col N="423" /> You have not that safeguard under this Bill because the Minister can, in actual fact, under the Bill, once an undesirable person gets charge of a canteen and is not able to control the crowd, take the licence from him and give it to another person and in that way defeat the provisions of the law.</P>

I do not think Deputies fully understand that we are not proposing to operate a public house.

      <P>If you give a licence to some trader to conduct a public house within the vicinity of a bog camp, you cannot have the supervision by the police over that public house that the board can exercise over its own canteen.  The Deputy talked about Guards being chased out of public houses but there is a far more effective method open to the board of ensuring proper behaviour in its canteens than supervision by the Guards.  That is the dismissal from the employment of the board of any person who breaks the regulations made by the board for the conduct of these canteens.  The board will have to conduct the premises in accordance with the licensing laws.  It will make <Col N="424" /> its own regulations in providing these amenities for its own employees.  Its own official will be in charge and if he does not carry out the regulations he can be dismissed and another person appointed who will carry them out.  If any person is guilty of a breach of regulations he can be dismissed from the board's employment.  That is a far better system than handling over the canteen to some private person to conduct it for his own profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asked about profits.  The board does not work these camps for the purpose of making a profit out of the sale of beer.  If the board does make a profit, that profit will, presumably, be devoted to the purpose of increasing the amenities available or towards the reduction of the cost of meals.  The board will be mainly concerned to see that it does not lose on its catering business which it runs for the benefit of its employees. It is not at all unlikely that there will be some profit from the sale of drink which will be available for use by the board in improving the amenities available for the workers and reducing the cost of other services provided for them.  I am quite certain that if I introduced a Bill designed to facilitate the giving of a licence to private persons to trade for profit in the sale of beer in these camps, I would meet with far greater opposition than I am meeting here to-day.  It would be urged that the operation of these canteens should be under the management of the board itself.  No sensible person visualising the problem which is involved here, would consider any other solution. We are talking about camps in isolated areas, places where the incursion of workers will mean not merely an increase of 25 per cent. in population but the bringing in of 300 or 400 men to an area where nobody lived before. It is extremely improbable that there will be, within any reasonable radius, licensed premises capable of catering for that number of workers. If they are to get facilities and get them under proper supervision, then it is far better that they should get them through the medium of the camp canteen and under the supervision of the board.  What we are arguing about is not the provision in the Bill, which would require no amendment to give <Col N="425" /> effect to Deputy Coogan's suggestion. We are arguing about the manner in which I have indicated it is the intention to use the powers conferred by the Bill.</P>

      <P>So far as the issue of the licence is concerned, I understood from the Second Reading debate that there was general agreement that it was reasonable to provide canteen facilities in these isolated bog camps.  If there is that agreement, why not just go ahead and do it?  We are as competent to judge the need for the giving of these facilities in isolated bog camps as the district justice for the area.  We all recognise that it is reasonable to do it and that, in the long run, there will be much less trouble in the management of the workers employed if these facilities are provided than if they are denied to them and they have to go four or five miles to a neighbouring town, after work or during the weekend, for the purpose of getting a drink.</P>

      <P>I want to urge one further point, and it is an important point.  If the licence is given in accordance with this procedure, there is not and cannot be at any time a personal interest in it.  It will be given to the board's officers <i>ex officio.</i>  They will hold that licence as officers of the board and will lose it when they cease to be officers, or cease to have the particular responsibility for camp management in any individual case.  There can be no question of personal interest in a licence.  There can be no question of efforts by individuals to retain a licence which might be withdrawn from them.  It will be clearly recognised that the camp manager, the camp superintendent or canteen manager will hold the licence <i>ex officio,</i> as trustee for the board, knowing that the licence will be taken from him if he fails to carry out the regulations of the board and, at any rate, must surrender it when he ceases to hold office in the board's service.  I think that is a far better system of managing this business than any other suggested and I should be very reluctant to depart from it.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what I have said already, but I want again to point out to the Minister that under the section it is possible for him to transfer the licence for any reason. As I have already stated, that may mean that the licensee is unable to supervise the business and gets himself into trouble with the local guards and the Minister gets rid of him forthwith and takes on a new licensee.  I say that is not calculated to bring about an effective enforcement of the licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything more effective.  I cannot follow the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this way, that all the Minister has to do is to get rid of his man.  If a retailer were in the business, the licence which he would have in the canteen would be an extension of his ordinary licence.  He would have to face the problem of endorsements of his ordinary licence&mdash; an entirely different position.  For that very reason he would ensure that the canteen business was at least as effectively supervised and as well conducted as his ordinary business.  That is what I have been trying to convey to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For any private trader, perhaps selling in competition with other traders, the eventual punishment for non-compliance with the law is that he loses his licence.  That is a solution that cannot be applied here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very extreme case&mdash;where he loses his licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The ultimate punishment for deliberate defiance of the law is that he goes out of business.  He loses his licence to continue in that trade.  That solution does not apply if we are to have a canteen.  We want to have a canteen and to provide these facilities.  Therefore, the remedy for mismanagement or lack of proper supervision in the conduct of the canteen must be the replacement of the manager.  It cannot be a withdrawal of the licence, because we want the licence to continue.  It must be a transfer of that licence from the person appointed to do the job and who fails to do it properly to some other person who will do it better.  In practice, the obligation of appointing persons who are competent to do this work will be on Bord na Móna.  If the person they appoint does not do the job, they just dismiss him and appoint someone else, so that the goodwill of the original licensee will be automatically transferred. As regards these words, &ldquo;for any other reason&rdquo;, obviously there can be no profit in the licence.  I am sure the House will agree that the person who gets the licence will have no profit in it.  It is merely for facilitating the <Col N="429" /> workers.  It can in no sense represent an asset of his which he can transfer for a consideration to another person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the section, will there be a particular type of licence created by this Bill?  I should like if the Minister would make it clear whether the premises and the licensee proposed under the Bill will be under the same rigorous inspection, whether it will be open to the Gárda Síochána to take the same measures by way of inspection and enforcement of the licensing laws as in the case of the publicans.  I take it that under the section a particular type of licence will be granted, and will be excluded under one of the sections from some of the provisions, at all events, of the ordinary Licensing Acts.  Does that imply in any way that the licensee of these proposed premises or the premises themselves will be excluded from the ordinary licensing laws in respect of hours, supervision, etc.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not altogether.  The only respects in which the licence is different from other licences are that it is granted by the Revenue Commissioners on the Minister's certificate, notwithstanding the provisions of the Licensing Acts, and Section 4 excludes that licence from the scope of Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, which relates to the extension of licences.  It is obvious that that part should not apply in this case.  These are the only two respects in which the licence granted under this Bill will differ from a licence issued under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the question of property in a licence, I again want to urge this point with the Minister.  The licence I had in mind would be granted to X, an existing licensee, by way of extension of his existing licence and its duration would be limited to the period of the operations upon the bog; in other words, when the bog operations would cease, he would revert to the ordinary licence for his existing premises.  There can be no <Col N="430" /> question of creating in himself or his family property in the bog licence.</P>
      <P>The section is much wider in other respects.  It sets aside the jurisdiction of the courts in the matter of extension of licence to other premises, in the matter of structural alteration or even in the matter of destroyed premises. All these matters are at present the subject of court proceedings in the ordinary way and the licensee has to satisfy the police authorities and the court of the reasonableness of the alterations and, in the case of destroyed premises or adjoining premises, he has to make his case before the court.</P>
      <P>Here you have the position created where all these safeguards are set aside and the Minister's will obtains.  The Minister cannot possibly be expected to be familiar with the measurements and the accommodation of every camp canteen.  He cannot be expected to be familiar with the necessity for structural alterations, and I submit that you are giving there a power to an anonymous civil servant to advise the Minister on matters which should properly be thrashed out in open court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the district justice get that information&mdash;by inspection of the premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is inspection of the premises by the Superintendent of the Gárda or by one of his subordinates. The applicant has to go to court and make his case.  The police are there to say whether or not the alterations proposed will render more easy or more difficult, as the case may be, the supervision of the premises. These, are the proper authorities to ensure that no camp commandant could set up a secret den where he and his pals could evade the licensing laws. That could conceivably happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It happens outside turf camps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not be a very serious matter, but I can see cases arising where the Guards will be put to the pin of their collars to supervise. These things go to the whole root of the present procedure.  The principle of setting aside the entire procedure, <Col N="431" /> the safeguards given to the public in these matters and the jurisdiction of the courts, is a very vicious principle and one which we on this side of the House cannot endorse because we have no guarantee that in the course of time the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, may not see fit to wipe out the present procedure and jurisdiction and apply this procedure all round.  We have had evidence of State interference and I submit that this is further evidence of the State mind, the Civil Service mind.  It is quite clear that this is the mentality behind the Bill&mdash;&ldquo;Away with the police, away with the existing procedure, we will do what we like and not only will we do these things but we will do what we wish with the profits.&rdquo; There is nothing in this Bill to prevent any of these things that I have indicated being done.  It is giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister's Department to play ducks and drakes with the licensing laws&mdash;that is what it amounts to.</P>
      <P>I, from my police experience, see grave objection to putting the Gárda authorities on one side, as is proposed in this Bill.  Whether the Minister or Bord na Móna may like it or not, it is essential that the police should be given effective supervision of these camps.</P>
      <P>If you are to begin this business by setting aside all existing law and procedure, what is the inference to be drawn by the ordinary Guard?  He will say: &ldquo;This is the Bord na Móna republic; we had better let them do what they like there.  We dare not go in because, if we do, we will be reported to the Minister.  If we attempt to exercise the licensing laws, what chance have we of succeeding?&rdquo; I can see that position being created. I can see a camp commandant who will regard himself as above and outside the law, resisting any supervision by the Guards.  I can see an impossible situation arising, perhaps at a great distance from the Gárda barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are aspects of the matter which I mentioned on Second Reading and on the previous section and I do not want to cover that ground again. <Col N="432" /> I merely want to emphasise that a simple Bill which would enable the District Court to presume a 25 per cent. increase in population would have been sufficient to give the Minister and the Department all the power they need. There would be no delay.  If it is a question of urgency it could be claimed that the District Court would be empowered to hear this application at any ordinary hearing.  In the matter of transfers and renewals, that also could obtain.  On the question of delay, nothing untoward need arise as far as the administration of the camp or the Minister's Department is concerned.  I cannot see why that could not be done and I again urge the Minister to reconsider the Bill between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am about to deal with the transfer and variation of licences. The Minister told us that the licence would be issued in order to provide for the turf workers, and he said that all the existing liquor laws apply, with the exception of one or two to which he referred.  If that is so, I presume the hours of opening and closing will apply.  If the existing laws apply, how are the general public to be excluded? Is it desirable that the general public should be permitted to enter the premises? If the general public have access to the premises, can the board exercise the control that the Minister <Col N="433" /> suggests, by the dismissal of an employee in the event of any disturbance?</P>

      <P>I said on the last day that I could not lay down as a hard and fast rule that only persons employed in a particular camp would be served in the canteen of that camp. Circumstances might arise in which officers of the board from headquarters or from other camps would be visiting the camp and, perhaps, bringing with them people to advise on various aspects of the work there.  They could not reasonably be excluded from the facilities of the canteen but the intention would be to confine the service in the canteen to workers employed at the bog and resident at the camp or persons who were in the camp on the board's business, or, with the board's knowledge, for some purpose connected with their business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  As I explained, the licence will be held by the official of the board in charge of the camp at the absolute discretion of the Minister.  The Minister may transfer it or cancel it at any time and it is that <Col N="434" /> fact which ensures that there will be no vested interest in the licence on the part of the licensee.  He cannot transfer it or secure a property in it and that is the way of dealing with the matter at which we should aim.  These camps will be only of limited life, because the men will be working a wasting asset. The job may involve 15 or 20 years' work but, at some stage, the bog will be exhausted and the camp will be closed.  The staff of the camp may, perhaps, be transferred to another camp. At that stage, the licence will be withdrawn and the canteen will be closed.</P>

      <P>What about Sunday? Will the ordinary licensing hours apply to the canteen on Sunday?  The Minister indicates that they will.  The sale of drink in a canteen could be abused because of its being a canteen and there may be another licensee in the locality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If there is another licensee in the locality with suitable premises, this licence will not be granted.  I want to emphasise the question of the suitability of the premises. I ask Deputies to visualise what we are talking about.  We are talking about bog camps established in isolated areas where there is no human residence, not to speak of a licensed premises or of a town.  Even if there were a licensed premises within some miles of that bog, the proprietor of it would be completely incapable of providing the service which workers in the camp would reasonably require.  If there are within a radius of two miles of the camp suitable licensed premises, I would not regard it as desirable that a licence should be issued.  In the case of some existing camps, licences would not be granted.  Those are camps on the outskirts or within easy distance of large towns.  Members of the House will know, from the list given in the White Paper, of the bogs to be developed. Some of them are many miles from any town and workers should be provided with reasonable facilities for entertainment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed that as a personal opinion.  I should say that the existence of suitable premises within a two-mile radius would be an overriding consideration, justifying the Minister in refusing an application for a licence under this Bill.  If there were suitable premises within two and a half miles, he might also refuse the application <Col N="436" /> but, if there were no suitable premises within three or four miles he would, probably, feel bound to grant the licence.  These camps will be of different sizes.  There might be a camp containing only 50 workers whose requirements could be catered for by a particular type of premises, whereas a camp of 500 workers would be inadequately catered for by the same premises. Again, the element of discretion would have to be exercised.</P>

I thought that he proposed to issue the licence to the board and that they would put in an officer as manager.  But if the officer gets the licence, then he alone will be responsible to the law.  There is no use in the House &ldquo;codding&rdquo; itself in this connection.  The licensee is the only person responsible for the observance of the law.  We have not got the remedy which we thought we had&mdash;of bringing this matter before the House&mdash;because it is the actions of the board and not of an officer which could be brought before the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter in respect of which I have a difficulty. The Minister says this licence will be subject to the ordinary provisions of the licensing laws but I cannot see where that is provided unless it is by implication in Section 4, which excludes certain parts of the 1927 Act.  I would again point out to the Minister that this particular type of licence is a completely artificial creature of this Bill, that there are special definitions of bog premises, licensed bog premises, and so forth under this Bill and that these definitions do not relate to the definitions in the licensing code now in existence.  There is nothing that I can see in this Bill, no matter what the Minister says, which suggests that these premises would be subject to the ordinary provisions of the licensing laws except, by implication, Section 4.  I think the Minister should consider that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that there is.  This is a special type of licence being granted for bog premises under this particular Bill that could never be granted before the passage of this Bill and which has no relation to the definitions <Col N="438" /> in the licensing laws.

      <P>If the Minister is satisfied, well and good, but I wish to point out to the Minister that from my reading of this Bill it does not appear to me that it is made clear that the ordinary licensing laws do apply and I am warning the Minister that, if it should so turn out, what the Minister has in mind will completely break down because there are no penalties provided under this measure.  If a manager of a turf camp, being an employee of Bord na Móna, breaks the law, under this Bill there are no penalties provided for his breach of the law.  How is his breach to be proved?  It certainly is not at all clear to me under this particular section or under the Bill that the ordinary licensing law will in fact apply to the new type of special licences that are going to be granted by the House under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Moran.  I agree with the Minister that in the ordinary way restrictions such as the prohibited hours and other restrictions of that kind apply but, when it comes to renewing a licence, if the Minister grants a certificate, the Revenue Commissioners may then, notwithstanding anything contained in any licensing Act, renew the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>So that you can get this position, that even though the camp commandant has conducted his business in a most unsatisfactory manner and has rendered himself liable to umpteen endorsements and is generally loose in the <Col N="439" /> enforcement of the licensing laws, if the Minister, even in these circumstances, issues a certificate, then the Revenue Commissioners must comply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  The licence has not to be withdrawn but I take it that if a licensee is fined in a court for committing some breach of the Licensing Acts the Minister would be under an obligation to request from the board their observations on the incident and to consider whether the licence should not be transferred from the particular individual to some other person in the board's service.  There will be two minds at least working upon the question of the suitability of continuing the licence in the person who had been responsible for lack of supervision, both the mind of the board and the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The origins of this Bill are to be found, first, in <Col N="442" /> the need, which became obvious during the emergency, of having available to the Government a commercial organisation which could experiment with and, if considered desirable, undertake the manufacture of chemicals which are essential to various industrial processes and the production of which has not been and is not likely to be undertaken by private enterprise; secondly, in the problem of transferring to a more suitable organisation the manufacture of explosives and of other chemicals used in the production of matches, which was carried on during the war by the Department of Defence in collaboration with the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau; thirdly, in the desirability of facilitating the Industrial Alcohol Company in extending its own productive activities, as a result of experience gained during the war.</P>
      <P>The need for a manufacturing organisation which might interest itself in the production of industrial chemicals will not, I am sure, be disputed.  There are many chemicals used in industry which are not now produced in this country, which are essential to the industries concerned and the war-time scarcities of which added greatly to our difficulties.  Because of the smallness of our home market relative to the capital cost involved in their manufacture, it is unlikely that private enterprise will be interested in their production. In some cases, at least, production on a satisfactory price basis would not be possible unless supported by special measures or carried by some more profitable lines undertaken by the same producer.  The Government thinks it desirable to have a suitable organisation to investigate the practicability of manufacturing industrial chemicals here.  The establishment of the Industrial Research Institute will ensure that the scientific problems involved can be properly examined, but after the scientific aspect of manufacture has been investigated the commercial practicability will still require study.  In regard to chemicals, it is intended that the work should be entrusted to the Industrial Alcohol Company, when reconstituted with new functions, as is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> In consequence of the changed functions, the title of the company will also be changed.  Henceforth, instead of the rather cumbersome title &ldquo;Monarchana Alcóil na hÉireann, Teoranta&rdquo; it will be known as &ldquo;Ceimicí, Teoranta&rdquo;.  I do not wish to convey that any particular programme is in mind or that the company will embark immediately upon activities in connection with the manufacture of chemicals.  There are, of course, certain possibilities in view, but they are not at the present time more than possibilities.  One of these is sulphate of ammonia.  Some members of the Dáil will remember that we went a long way towards getting sulphate of ammonia manufactured here before the war.  In fact, the completion of the plans which were made was prevented only by the outbreak of hostilities.  It is certainly the desire of the Government that the matter should be taken up again and it is intended that the work will be entrusted to Ceimicí, Teoranta.  Before the war, the examination of the plans for the establishment of the sulphate of ammonia industry was entrusted to an inter-departmental committee.  It was not a satisfactory instrument.  The members of the committee were officers who were fully occupied with other duties and the commercial negotiations which were involved proceeded, therefore, very slowly.  It is considered that the reexamination of the matter in the post-war situation can best be done by a commercial organisation which might itself be entrusted with the task of undertaking the establishment of the industry.</P>
    <P>During the war, the factory operated by the Department of Defence, in collaboration with the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, produced potassium chlorate, phosphorous and phosphorous sesquisulphide, which were required either by the Army or for the production of matches.  The practicability of that production was amply demonstrated, but the costs, particularly under the conditions in which the Department of Defence had to operate, had no relation to the prices at which those chemicals are ordinarily available through commercial channels.  The practicability of continuing on a commercial <Col N="444" /> basis some or all of the processes carried on by the Army during the war in the post-war era will also be investigated by the company.  It will be appreciated by Deputies that the decision to use this company is prompted solely by the suitability of its organisation for the purpose and the desire not to add to the number of commercial undertakings operating under Government authority.</P>
    <P>The sole purpose of this Bill is to alter the objects of the company so as to permit it to undertake new responsibilities, should it be so decided, and to make certain other changes consequential thereon.  It is not proposed to alter the capital of the company by this Bill or to make any additional financial provision for extending its activities.  Under the original Act, the maximum amount which the Minister for Finance can invest in the shares of the company is £500,000.  The issued capital of the company is £275,763. The granting of a licence to the company to undertake a new form of manufacture, if it should require that additional capital above the limit now fixed in the principal Act must be provided from the Exchequer, must also involve fresh legislation so that the Dáil will have a full opportunity of discussing the proposal.  The main immediate effect of the Bill will be to empower the company to begin investigations and to spend money on such investigations out of its revenues which it could not do under its existing powers.  During the war the company, in addition to supplying petrol distributors with power alcohol, was able to supply undenatured alcohol to laboratories, hospitals and industrialists who found it impossible to obtain continued supplies of imported alcohol for their purposes.  Experience has shown that there is a demand for a highly rectified spirit more suitable to such purposes, and it has been decided to install at the Cooley distillery additional equipment for the production of very pure neutral spirit to meet that existing demand.  However, some doubt has been raised as to the power of the company under the principal Act to sell alcohol to any person other than a petrol distributor.  Section 9 of this Bill is intended to remove that doubt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> Deputies will have observed that provisions of the usual kind are included in the Bill to ensure that, as far as possible, Ceimicí, Teoranta, in any of its future manufacturing activities will not come into competition with private enterprise, and that no licence to engage in the manufacture of any commodity may be granted to it until the intention to do so has been published, and until the Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that the commodity is not being, and will not be adequately manufactured by private concerns.  In view of the possibility that the publication of intention to license the company to undertake a particular form of manufacture may lead to exceptional imports of the commodity in question, which might prejudice the success of the industry, power is taken to the Government to apply a quantitative limitation to imports in such circumstances. Ordinarily, it will be the policy of the Government to leave the field clear for private enterprise in this industry.</P>
    <P>If, however, economic production is practicable only on a monopoly basis it will be agreed that there is a case for entrusting it to a State owned concern.  In the products in which the company will be mainly interested, it is likely that either economic production will not be possible at all while other considerations may prompt its undertaking and some special form of State support may be needed, or else, as in the case of sulphate of ammonia, the capital required would be so substantial that it would not in our circumstances be forthcoming from private sources unless the position of the undertaking was secured by legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not wish the Dáil to think, however, that in passing this Bill it is committing itself to approval of whatever propositions may be subsequently submitted at the instance of Ceimicí, Teoranta.  Each such proposition will be considered on its merits, and any large-scale proposition which may emerge from its investigations and receive the approval of the Government requiring the provision of additional capital will be possible only <Col N="446" /> if fresh legislation is introduced.  The sole immediate purpose of the Bill is to enable the company to devote money from its present revenues to investigation of the commercial possibilities in various chemical fields.  I had contemplated that the company would undertake that investigation after the war but found that there was a legal difficulty arising out of the terms of the principal Act which precluded the company spending any money on such a purpose.  The passage of the Bill will permit of the expenditure of money by the company on these investigations.</P>
    <P>If these investigations lead to the possibility of the company extending into new fields of chemical manufacture then the procedure laid down in the Bill will be followed to ensure that the field which it proposes to enter is not likely to be covered by private concerns and if it involves substantial capital outlay the position is left that the Dáil must be consulted by means of a new Bill to provide that capital. The enactment of this measure, therefore, cannot by itself produce any substantial change.  It will make available to the Government an organisation which is ideally suited to supplement the work of the Industrial Research Council by investigating the commercial practicability of any proposition which the Industrial Research Institute proves to be technically possible. For that reason, I think it is desirable that this Bill should be passed and that the reconstituted company should have these further functions which it is now proposed to give them.</P>

      <P>We have listened to a very strange contribution from the Minister.  While one might look askance at the Bill as it was presented to us, I do not see how anybody could support it at all after the statement which we have just heard.  The Minister asks for authority to change the powers of the Industrial Alcohol Company so that it can indulge in a certain amount of research with regard to the commercial manufacture and distribution of a certain number of chemicals. I do not know whether it is the intention that the new company will go ahead with the production of sulphate of ammonia and other phosphates.</P>

      <P>The Minister left us under the impression that this work need not necessarily be undertaken by the company at all but that there are some unspecified chemicals which the Minister did not care to mention on which they might work.  Generally, he created the impression that he wanted this machinery but that he had no idea of what it was going to be used for, that it might be used for some purpose connected with the investigation of some chemical or with the commercial manufacture of some chemical.  It would be bad enough to set up a separate company for the purpose that the Minister has mentioned, but to ask us to graft it on to the framework of a <Col N="448" /> company with the history of the Industrial Alcohol Company is, I think, asking the Dáil far too much.  When the Government venture into the manufacture of industrial alcohol was first discussed here, the Minister was very emphatic that it would turn out alcohol at 1/9 to 1/10 per gallon.  Both Deputy McGilligan and myself put forward certain arguments, basing them on certain calculations the accuracy of which the Minister was not prepared to admit.  In reviewing the matter when the Industrial Alcohol (No. 2) Bill was before the House on the 20th July, 1938, the debate being reported in column 901, I recalled the fact that on the 25th February, according to the Parliamentary Debates, column 2146, when we were discussing the price at which industrial alcohol was going to be sold, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The price at which we contemplate that industrial alcohol will be available ... will not in our opinion, exceed 1/9 and 1/10.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I also recalled that, in subsequently discussing the matter on the 29th May, the Minister, as reported at column 1997 when his estimate of 1/10 was again under discussion, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As I was listening to Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dockrell trying to prove that this alcohol was going to cost anything up to 3/- a gallon, it just occurred to me that possibly when they were going to school mathematics was an optional subject. They did not succeed in proving anything like what they set out to prove.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Actually the arguments which we put forward when the Minister was beginning his experiments in this particular matter, have been perfectly justified by the operations of the company. The Minister's whole attitude in regard to the production of alcohol at the time was that it should develop a war-time industry but it did not function during the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It did function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It functioned to the extent to which materials were available.  The materials required were to a large extent potatoes.  The Minister's forecast, prophecies, and arguments <Col N="449" /> to us were that it was an industry for which we might have to pay through the nose in peace-time but that it was going to be of very great service in war-time.  Now, the Minister is going to extend for peace-time purposes the operations of that particular company.  He is going to use some of the revenue that is accruing to it by charging 7/6 per gallon for alcohol for industrial purposes, money squeezed out of the users of industrial alcohol at an exorbitant price, for further experiments. The experiments are likely to be along the line of the experiment carried out in the Department of Defence during the war.  Deputy McGilligan, I think, has already given some very revealing and suggestive accounts of the experiments carried out by the Department of Defence during the war.  I do not think there was anything in these accounts that would suggest that we should allow the Industrial Alcohol Company to proceed in the same way without very clearly understanding what they were going to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asks us to accept these proposals in regard to the company by suggesting that anything that may be done by the company in future will come up here for review later and that, if any more money is required, we shall have to vote it here.  But the fact is that this Bill will give the Industrial Alcohol Company power to use some of the revenue it has at the moment on experiments of this kind.  I think we might consider, in this connection, the approach to matters of a much bigger nature in Great Britain and consider what the British Government are doing in connection with work related to the development of, say, atomic energy. The British Government has not set up a special company.  It has given to companies that already exist there and to the universities, special sections of work connected with the development and use of atomic energy.  I should like to know why some of our universities or why some of the commercial chemical companies that are in existence here, are not used by the Government in order to get this work done.  The suggestion that access to certain chemicals that may be required for industrial or other purposes here, <Col N="450" /> because the Minister thinks they should be experimented on by this company, should be denied to companies that want them here is not a very justifiable proposition at this hour of the day. Instead of availing of the machinery that would increase the price of the necessary chemicals for industrial firms here on the one hand, or reduce, on the other hand, the supply of these chemicals for ordinary commercial firms, these firms should be induced to go ahead in their own private way with the developments of these products.  As the matter stands at the moment, I am very much opposed to the Bill and the explanation which the Minister has given has only served to strengthen my opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, inasmuch as the Rent Restriction Code has become so complex and in many respects so inequitable and uncertain, especially in so far as it is related to rents payable in 1914, the purpose of fair rents would best be served by the substitution of a comprehensive Fair Rent Code analogous to the Land Act, 1881, and requests the Government to submit suitable legislation for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion raises no very controversial matter, but, none the less, I think, directs the attention of the House to a matter of some consequence to a very large number of people.  It is true that the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, removed certain ambiguities in the old legislation and reduced the opportunity for open exploitation of tenants by landlords, but it does leave the whole rent restrictions code in an utterly chaotic state, and I am informed by experienced practitioners that already it is becoming evident that the new code, created by the superimposition of the 1946 Act on the previous Acts, <Col N="451" /> bids fair to produce as much or more litigation than all the previous Acts combined did in their day and that the bulk of this litigation arises not from aggrieved tenants availing of the provisions of the new Act but is made necessary in order to clarify the position created by the new Act taken in conjunction with all previous Acts.</P>
    <P>All this code was primarily designed by the Oireachtas to prevent an undue rise in rents in a time of housing shortage, but, ancillary to that prime purpose, there was a clear intention to ensure that houses of equal quality and convenience would command approximately equal rents.  The result of the code has been very much different.  To ascertain the lawful rent of a house, the inquiry is not primarily related to the usefulness of the house, or to what it costs the landlord to erect or purchase it, or to the value which it represents to the tenant who pays rent for it, but to the answer to some or all of the following questions: Was it built before 1919; if so, was it let in 1914 and, if let, at what rent; if it was not let in 1914, what would it have fetched if it had been let in that year; if it was not built before 1919, was it built before 1941; if so, was it let in 1941 and, if so, at what rent; if it was not let in 1941, what rent would it have fetched if it had been let in 1941; if it was built before 1919, did it become vacant after 1926; and if it was built before 1919 and became vacant after 1926, what was the poor law valuation of the house when it was vacated?</P>
    <P>Conceive that medley of speculation applied in a multiplicity of cases all through the country for the purpose of ascertaining what rent the tenant ought to pay now.  Complex as that procedure is, if it produced a coherent result, we could bear with it, but it does not.  I do not think it is much of an exaggeration to say that if you wish to inquire into what rent was actually being paid in 1914 in respect of a house in this country, you are engaging in something approximating to archaeological investigation, the answers to which are extremely undependable, and, as a result of this peculiar criterion, <Col N="452" /> I am informed by experienced practitioners that, instead of ensuring that all similar houses are liable to a similar rent, it is not uncommon to find two houses side by side, virtually identical, the rent of one of which, as a result of having been let or not let at a particular rent prior to 1914, is double that of the other, although the amenity value of both is the same. That can arise.</P>
    <P>If you have a 1914 house the rent of which is the 1914 rent, plus 20 per cent., and which is identical in all particulars with a 1941 house, under the law as it stands, it could be that, though these houses were in all particulars virtually identical, the rent of one would be £65 and of the other £110.  That is not all, because, suppose you had a house in 1914 and you had a widowed sister or a relative in some part dependent on you and to help out the exiguous income of that relative, you admitted her as a tenant at little more than a nominal rent to your house, that is the basic rent upon which the rent of your house is to be controlled to-day.  If you were a kindly landlord, a just man&mdash;leave out the question of a bereaved relative or anything of that kind&mdash;who felt it right to charge not more than what seemed a fair rent in 1914, you are entitled to that fair rent, plus 20 per cent., to-day. What other commodity is selling in the world in which we live at the 1914 price, plus 20 per cent.?</P>
    <P>But if you were a bloodsucker in 1914 who sucked out of the person in a difficult situation the last penny that person could afford to pay, is your iniquity marked by the rent code as operated now?  Not at all.  We may indeed say, with the Scriptures, that the children of light are not as wise in their generation as the children of this world, because the child of Mammon who got the last drop he could out of his tenant 30 years ago is now congratulated, the unjust steward comes in for his commendation and is told that he did well to make friends with the Mammon of iniquity.  As a result of that the law is going to ensure that he gets more in 1944 for each house than the child of light who tried to be fair and just.</P>
    <P>Now you will have two houses side <Col N="453" /> by side, one of which was owned by a rack-renting landlord and another by an honest landlord in 1914.  The honest landlord is getting the rent of 1914, plus 20 per cent, and the rack-renting landlord can cock a snook at him and say: &ldquo;I told you 30 years ago that you were a damn fool, and Dáil Eireann has confirmed my estimate.&rdquo; All this means that there is uncertainty, that there is no equality of treatment, and that there is unnecessary litigation in order to ascertain what the law ordains. Nothing is worse from the point of view of the citizen than that people should not know their rights.  Nothing is worse for the community than that the people should be forced to have recourse to legal proceedings before their rights are defined.  Nothing could be worse than that the operation of law should be manifestly unjust, so as to permit one landlord to charge £65 for his house and the landlord holding the house next door, identical in all particulars, should be allowed to take £110.</P>
    <P>I therefore suggest a simple remedy. This whole rent restriction scheme, the wisdom of which many may question, has created a situation in which rent control of some kind or another has become a necessity.  Without going into the merits of the whole system of rent control, if we have to have rent control, let it be a fair rent control.  Let all men be equal before the law.  Let every landlord get justice and no more than justice.  Let every tenant get justice.</P>
    <P>If you go to a person now who is poor and who has been called upon to pay an excessive rent and you say to that person: &ldquo;No one can deny that your rent is manifestly excessive comparing it with the rents of all your neighbours and you ought to go to law to get your rights,&rdquo; that person can say quite truthfully and, indeed, prudently: &ldquo;No one but a lunatic would go into court against a rich landlord and face the possibility of protracted litigation when the law itself is so uncertain that, if you bespeak the opinion of three lawyers, you will get three different opinions as to what the result of your litigation is likely to be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I, therefore, suggest to the House that there should be established either <Col N="454" /> in the local authority area, as is the practice in Great Britain, or in any other area that the House, in its wisdom, may think right to define, a rent tribunal for each part of the country where it appears the services of such a tribunal are necessary and before which any tenant who feels that he is being charged an unfair rent for his house can appear, and that that tribunal, having regard to the average rents paid in the neighbourhood for the same kind of accommodation, will be entitled to fix a fair rent for that particular lodging, whether it be a room or a flat or a house, whereafter the landlord will be obliged to charge that and no more.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to pursue a proposal of this character into all the detail of administration at this stage, as we are concerned here to-night to consider only the principle as to whether fair rent tribunals, such as the Ashbourne Act established for the purpose of rented land in the old days, or fair rent tribunals such as the British local authorities all over England are operating, should be set up. I think they should.  I think it would simplify the situation very considerably and that in a very short time you would get equitable standards fixed all over the country for particular types of houses, so that any person living in a street of small villa houses would know at once that, if all his neighbours were paying 8/- per week and he were being asked for 12/-, he was being manifestly overcharged and would go to such a tribunal and ask the tribunal to fix a fair rent.</P>
    <P>That would work both ways.  There is no need to multiply examples.  I do not profess to have expert knowledge of housing and rents and landlords' agreements as some of my colleagues here have.  I do not come here as a specialist to deal with specialist problems.  I am concerned simply with the general principles of equity and justice as between fellow-citizens, and, to me, the fundamentally important principle that the law should be clear and available to everybody, rich and poor alike.  As it stands, I think it is not clear and, in effect, it is not readily available to rich and poor alike.  As it stands, I do not believe <Col N="455" /> that it gives to everybody equal privileges.</P>
    <P>As is stands, it appears to me that the landlord who was a child of light in 1914 is now severely penalised by his own Government in comparison with the child of Mammon.  That appears to be unjust.  The whole procedure appears to be inexpedient and for that reason I invite the Dáil, at its leisure and with due circumspection and care, to substitute for the whole complex and complicated code a simple measure designed to produce justice and equality in respect of landlords and tenants for all.</P>

      <P>I notice that Deputy Dillon in this motion did not point out the means whereby he would achieve the object he set out to achieve, or did not tell us what rules he would lay down for the guidance of the court in arriving at what he wants.</P>
      <P>The whole basis of the increase of rent code, looking at it from the tenant's point of view, and the only basis on which the lettings can be judged, is the letting value of the premises. Deputy Dillon was very careful not to mention the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931, which deals with a very large section of buildings in this country and which controls every business house in the country.  Under the 1931 Act we continued the system of letting values.  Where somebody to whom the 1931 Act applies is served with a notice to quit, and there is the intention to eject him and he claims under the provisions of the 1931 Act, he comes before the Circuit Court and on what does that court base his new rent?  The Circuit Court bases it on the letting value of the premises.</P>
      <P>The necessity for the increase of rent code, prior to the passing of our last Act, arose during the first Great War. They had to start at some particular stage.  They had to fix some date in respect of which they would legislate and take the letting value.  They fixed the 3rd August, 1914, in order to base the standard rent on the letting value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> Presumably they fixed that date because the abuses in regard to which they were legislating had not arisen then.  They went back to a date at which time lettings were normal and the abuses they were catering for had not then arisen.  The landlords in the country in those days had not very much time to rush in to increase their rents.  The Government decided it was a fair test to take, when letting conditions were normal.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view expressed by Deputy Dillon, that there is such a big number of philanthropic landlords in this or in any other country.  I do not believe we have such great numbers of benefactors going around building houses.  I believe any of them who erected houses did so from a business point of view, in order to get as much as they could out of the houses.  They let the houses to the best advantage from their own point of view.  I, therefore, take it that on 3rd August, 1914, you would have comparatively normal letting conditions, with the ordinary rules of supply and demand operating. There was no particular reason why any section of landlords in 1914 would let houses at a cheaper rate to their tenants than their brethren in the business rented theirs.</P>
    <P>The increase of rent code was based on the prevailing letting value and that code was continued down to the passing of legislation here.  As Deputy Dillon well knows, the landlord must give the letting value of his premises in 1914, if the premises were let then. If the premises were not let until 1919, the landlord is bound, on the application of the tenant, to give particulars of the letting when it was first made. I think Deputy Dillon did not refer to that.</P>
    <P>There is a difference in the position of the landlord who erected a house in 1914 and the landlord who erected a house in 1937 or 1938.  The landlord who let the house in 1914 was drawing a profit from the letting down through the years and he was also entitled to various permitted increases on the 1914 rent, as the Deputy pointed out. By 1938 he had made a profit all down <Col N="457" /> the years from 1914.  There is also this difference, that money values were different in 1938 from what they were in 1914.  The cost of building was altogether different.  The individual who put up a house for letting in 1938 had a far greater outlay than he would have had in 1914.</P>
    <P>There is a control, as the Deputy well knows, under our last Act, on the lettings of new houses&mdash;that is, houses built since 1919.  Under the Act the tenant can apply to the court, and I do not see how the court can approach this problem except from the letting value point of view.  The whole rating code is based on the letting value.  That is the only way the rating authorities can assess the value of a particular holding&mdash;the letting value.  Various things may affect the letting value.</P>
    <P>We have gone further here than any other country in providing for what the Deputy described as the very poor tenant.  The Deputy has doubts about the tenant getting fair play.  Under our last Act there is a provision to the effect that the landlord may be ordered to pay the tenant's costs, even though the tenant brings the application. The whole code under the 1914 arrangement, and continued under the 1931 Act and by the last Act passed here, has been weighted in favour of the tenant.  The law, as interpreted by the judges, has been weighted in favour of the tenant.  The decisions of the courts invariably have been in favour of the tenant.</P>

      <P>As regards the houses built in 1914, there are very few of them in which the tenants are not statutory tenants or in regard to which the provisions of Increase of Rent Acts <Col N="458" /> have not been applied.  There has been, as the Deputy mentioned, quite an amount of litigation under the 1914 Act as between landlords and tenants.  The vast majority of those cases&mdash;90 per cent. of them&mdash;were brought not by landlords but by tenants, because the whole code is designed to protect the tenant and ensure that he gets his rights.  Those powers have been invoked by every town tenants' league throughout the country.  In the few years prior to the passing of the recent Act&mdash;which will give rise to more applications by tenants&mdash;all the cases we used to have in respect of houses built before 1919 in respect of standard rent had practically faded out in our courts.</P>
      <P>Various other questions arose from time to time but very rarely during the past few years have I seen any application in such cases solely based on the question of standard rent.  However, the provisions are there.  In my part of the country, we have not had any experience, so far, of the operation of the Act which we recently passed, but, if I understand it correctly, it will be open to the tenant to apply to the District Court clerk in chambers&mdash;his application will, eventually, come before the district justice&mdash; simply alleging that his rent is exorbitant. The district justice is entitled, under that code, to call in a court valuer who will give evidence of the letting value, even though no test of standard or basic rent can be applied.</P>

      <P>Not to leases covered by the 1931 Act.  The 1931 Act deals very effectively with business lettings.  A very revolutionary idea is contained in the 1931 Act.  A tenant may get into a house without any provision preventing him from carrying on business there.  All he has to do is to put a few pigs' feet in the window, sit behind them for three years and go into the Circuit Court and, irrespective of his <Col N="459" /> landlord, he can get a lease from the Circuit Court for 21 years.  What the Circuit Court will do is fix a rent on the letting value.  In respect of a business carried on for a period of over three years, I cannot conceive any more revolutionary provision for the protection of the tenant than that to which I have just referred.  In the discretion of the court, the tenant can get a lease for up to 21 years, which will be ultimately renewed, so that the position, in these circumstances, of a man under the 1931 Act, is that he cannot be put out of his premises so long as he pays the rent fixed by the court. The landlord cannot get possession of the premises.  With all this legislation to guide our people and with these provisions administered in favour of the tenants, I cannot conceive how we should proceed in order to achieve what the Deputy seems to want to achieve&mdash;if he is referring to the hardships of the tenants&mdash;under this motion.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy has not made any case to convince us that there is any reason why we should change the basis of all this legislation as to letting value.  I do not know of any fairer means which could be laid down as a test by the court than letting value.  If you leave out the letting value, I do not know how you could fix the rent.  That is the test which has been operated throughout our whole code and under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is only some months since this House debated what is now the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946. There was a very full debate and there <Col N="460" /> were a great number of amendments. The debate was conducted in a very friendly atmosphere.  The Act passed was somewhat different from the Bill, as introduced, but I think all were agreed at the time that this House had done the best possible job of work in regard to the problem of rent restriction. Now, Deputy Dillon, in that irresponsible way of his to which we are accustomed, comes along and asks the House to scrap all that legislation and go in for some entirely new idea which has not, so far, been tried in regard to the renting of houses.  I could not possibly support any such proposals.  I am afraid that to do so would create too much of an upheaval.  If you have courts to fix rents by reference to fair letting value, you will, undoubtedly, get a good many rents reduced, but you will also get a good many rents increased. The whole principle of the Rent Restrictions Act was to leave things very much as they were before the present acute shortage of houses&mdash; that is, going back to May, 1941, in one case, and to 1914 in the other case. The aim was to leave things so that the owner of a house would get the same net profit rent out of it as previously, but no more.  That is about the only basis upon which you could go. I do not say that our present system is perfect.  There are several difficulties and complexities.  Cases crop up in which it is almost impossible to say what is the right thing to do, but I suggest it is the best system that can be evolved and that it involves least expense to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to set up rent courts would involve the State in considerable expense.  Not only would you require courts but you would, I think, require to have inspection of every rented premises in the country by an expert valuer.  There are some items in the present law to which I suggest the Minister might give his attention.  I am sure he is considering these aspects as they change from day to day.  One of them is the present position in Dublin regarding furnished flats.  The scarcity of premises to rent in Dublin is growing every day.  The situation was never so acute as it is now and I think that the control of rents of furnished flats is not adequate.  Complaints are <Col N="461" /> being made all round that exorbitant rents are being charged because flats are furnished.  The Minister might have that aspect of rent restriction considered with a view to tightening up the control.  The other problem is rather older.  It is the problem of expiring leases and the rents that may be charged under the Act of 1931.  The Minister has already intimated that he will bring in legislation to remedy that situation.  I am sure the House will not have long to wait for it.  The only effective control of rents is the provision of more houses.  Deputy Dillon may forget that, in 1914, a landlord had to go out and look for a tenant. The position is just the opposite now. When you have a better supply of houses there will not be any need for Rent Restriction Acts and perhaps the day when we will reach that situation is not so far off.  It does not certainly seem so far off now as it did a few years ago or even when the Act of 1946 was being debated in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two observations of Deputy O'Connor with which I must profoundly disagree. With some of his observations I am in agreement.  I profoundly disagree with him when he said that the last Rent Restriction Act which was passed by this House received the general approbation of the House and was the best job of work that could be done in the circumstances. It certainly did not receive my benediction.  I spoke against it as vigorously as I could on Second Reading and, generally speaking, washed my hands of it after that because I found myself almost in complete disagreement with every side of the House.  I think that last Act has made the housing shortage far more acute than it was before that Act passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Connor that the only solution for the problem is the provision of new houses.  I said so on the Second Reading of the last Bill.  I pleaded for it and said that that Bill ought not to be passed into an Act without some plan being available and put forward for speedy execution, under Government auspices or with Government benediction or through private enterprise or some other way, <Col N="462" /> to go step by step with decontrol of houses.  What is the position at the present time?  We have a complete code of rent restriction with the desire of preventing the exploitation of tenants, whether they be poor or not so poor. We are all in complete agreement.  The position at the present moment is that nobody, rich or poor, is able to get a house or even part of a house to let. There has been created under this rent restriction code a privileged class, a limited class of the community.  With that class we all have sympathy.  We all extend sympathy with a person who may be the subject of exploitation by a rapacious landlord but when we find that outside that limited class it is an absolute impossibility, at all events for people in the City of Dublin, to get, not merely a house to let, but even a room in a house to let, at any price, I ask this House to consider whether we have solved any problem by this rent restriction code or whether we have not, as I stated on the Second Reading of this Bill, made the problem still more acute.</P>
    <P>The present position is that no landlord or owner of a house, once he gets clear possession of that house, will let that house for any money even if that house, when he gains clear possession of it, is not subject to existing controls. He is afraid, in the first place, that some supplemental Act will be introduced by this Dáil bringing that house within the ambit of the rent restriction code in the near future.  For that reason alone he will not make any letting. But there is a far more cogent and compelling reason why he will not do it, because, at the present moment in the City and County of Dublin, house property which is sold with clear possession is going at enormous prices and it is only the new rich in this country that are able to afford these houses. At the present time, houses are being built with remarkable rapidity.  You can see them being built almost daily before your eyes around the city, with expedition and dispatch by the builders, because they know that the market is there at its peak and they want to get the high prices from the new rich who are able to pay these exorbitant prices, before the market falls.</P>
    <P>The ordinary person in this country at <Col N="463" /> present has no chance of buying a house and no chance of getting a house to let and the utmost he can hope for is to get a flat, again at some exorbitant rent.  What is happening people who are getting married and hoping to rear families?  What future is before them? There is no prospect before the ordinary person at present, the person who has to make his living and who has to live on a moderate income by ways and means which do not allow him to cash in on the opportunities which have been presented in the last few years of making vast quantities of money.  The only prospect he has as far as can be seen at the moment is to live in difficult circumstances in an expensive flat and to try to rear a family in the inconvenient conditions involved in living in such a flat.  That is the problem to which we ought to be directing our attention.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy O'Connor that this motion was put down by Deputy Dillon in an irresponsible fashion.  There is a motion on the Paper in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Mulcahy, and my name, which had as its inspiration the existing acute housing shortage in this country, and not merely in the city. That motion was put down with a view to bringing about some consideration of the problem that exists.  We are allowing builders to make a profit at the present moment, legitimately if you like, on the market that is available there, the limited market of a very limited class of people who have made money in this country or who are coming over to this country with money in their pockets, leaving the vast majority of the ordinary persons who have to live on moderate incomes without hope of any housing accommodation. That problem should be settled. Those people who have the good fortune to be in occupation of controlled houses have the benediction and the protection of the law and the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran has spoken about the standard upon which the rent of those houses should be based and has spoken as if it were either the letting value or the 1914 or the 1941 value.  He referred to the Act of 1931.  So far as the Act <Col N="464" /> of 1931 is concerned, it is based upon the letting value of houses.  The letting value of houses at the present moment does not exist.  There is no letting value of houses because you cannot get them to let and it is purely hypothetical value guessed at by a set of auctioneers on the one side giving different evidence from a set of auctioneers on the other side, and based entirely on guesswork.  They take the case, if the house were vacant and if normal conditions existed&mdash;and they certainly do not exist in our time &mdash;the letting value would be so much.</P>
    <P>As a basis of calculation of a rent, whether it be fair or otherwise, letting value has ceased, in my opinion at all events, to have any basis in reality.  There is no standard on which to base it.  There is no standard by which auctioneers giving evidence can really base their expert testimony at the present moment.  So far as letting value is concerned it is purely illusory and, therefore, it is on that aspect of the case I find a weakness in Deputy Dillon's motion, on the question of fixing fair rent for houses.  I take it that that part of the motion is not vital to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that Deputy Dillon has put down this motion merely to draw attention to the fact&mdash; the undoubted fact, which everybody knows, including Deputy Moran and, more particularly, Deputy O'Connor, as he deals with them or has heard of them in the City of Dublin&mdash;that extraordinary inequalities and inequities exist in relation to controlled houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not any experience of the working of the recent Rent Restrictions Act in the country.  I certainly had some considerable experience under the earlier Acts in connection with the control after the 1914 war. There are extraordinary inequities and inequalities and I think that, at the present moment, the position is as Deputy Dillon has stated in this motion, that the legal requirements and legal principles&mdash;if there are any principles at present in this code and particularly in the last Act&mdash;are so <Col N="465" /> complex that they are bound to lead to impossible situations.  In the last few days, I understand a decision was given on this Act, pointing out a matter that was omitted from it&mdash;a small matter, but still just a percursor of what is going to take place.  So far as I am concerned, these people who are controlled are in a special class.  I am not grudging them their privilege. I am strongly in favour of preventing the exploiting of the poor and the new poor&mdash;and even more strongly in favour of preventing the exploitation of the new poor than I am of the old poor.  I want to see them protected.</P>
    <P>The new poor are those who have moderate incomes, on which to raise a family in decent comfort with some leisure and some enjoyment.  Those people are living below the border-line of subsistence at present.  The ordinary poor have charitable organisations and State organisations to look after them; they have some people to take an interest in them; but the people really suffering are those who are the backbone of the nation, people on moderate incomes, mostly on fixed incomes or incomes which cannot be raised to meet the appalling rise in the cost of living, in the cost of housing and everything else.  These are the people for whom I am really advocating.  These are the people who are not in controlled houses, young people trying to start life on small salaries or small incomes, derived from business or profession. They have no chance of getting a house.  Would Deputy Dillon's fair rent tribunal give them a house?  Not long as the position is allowed to remain that there is a certain limited class of houses controlled which, once they become vacant, can be sold at an exorbitant price, extracted by the necessities of some unfortunate person who has nowhere to go and who must mortgage his future prospects in life to raise the amount to pay that exorbitant price&mdash;as, otherwise, if it is attractive enough, the house will be sold to one of the new rich.</P>
    <P>There is no prospect of any amelioration for them and it is the most acute problem existing at the present time. I do not think the problem of high rents is anything like as acute as the <Col N="466" /> problem of providing accommodation for people who cannot get it at all at present.  I have people coming to me from my constituency, day after day and night after night, asking me to get houses for them, or even a room.  I hear stories that would wring the heart of a stone&mdash;and I can do nothing. Very often, they are a decent class of tradesmen, in good employment and ready to pay a decent rent, but they cannot get any accommodation.  No fair rent tribunal is going to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is for political reasons that we all say how strongly we are in favour of preventing rents being increased, or whether it is that we really believe it.  I rather fancy it is because of the political backing that may be got from saying we will not let rents be increased that we are in favour of control.  Perhaps that is what draws general support for an Act of this kind to control rents.  I pleaded, during the Second Reading of the last Rent Restrictions Act, for that larger class of people who are not being catered for and to whom, as far as I and my colleagues can see, there is no thought being given and for whom no provision is being made. There is no use in having any sort of tribunal, whether the rent is fixed on the basis of the letting value in 1914, 1940 or any other year, or whether it is fixed on a fair letting value by a fair rent tribunal, unless you have houses to go into.  There is a problem here, as Deputy Dillon says there is, of inequalities or inequities, and anyone practising in the courts knows that. The housing problem is raised in relation to houses built since this State was set up, and which were built before the last Act was passed and are subject to control.  They exist in the case of dwellings built by public authorities and into which the working people went, or those who wanted to buy their houses on the principle of paying a composite rent and interest.  In the same street, you will find one man paying £1 a week and another paying 10/- a week for precisely the same type of house.  The inequality exists since this State started, under the Housing Acts passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I want to raise my voice again to <Col N="467" /> direct attention to the real problem, which is not rent restriction but provision of houses.  If we leave the position as it stands at the moment, where certain houses are restricted as regards their rent and the other houses are left free, there will be, as in the case of the City and County of Dublin, no letting to tenants.  There is nothing but houses for sale, at prices far beyond the reach of the ordinary individual. You have only to look at the back pages of the newspapers every day, and particularly on Saturdays, to see the numbers of houses offered for sale. Attend any auction or inquire the price given for them.  I do not know anybody who has not been in some of the industries or trades which were able in the last five or six years to make vast profits, who is going to be in a position to buy any house in the next quarter of a century, unless something is done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that it is only when a problem, such as that with which we are confronted now, reaches its climax that we become somewhat inconsistent in our approach to it, as compared with other matters. On the one hand, we find Deputies finding fault with restrictions on what is called free sale of property, free sale of rent; and the very same Deputies, when asked their opinion regarding houses, advocate the removal of free sale of house property.  What Deputy Costello said is quite true.  There is such an extreme shortage of housing accommodation that difficulties arise and advantage is taken by people who feel an opportunity has arisen, if they can get possession of a house which is rented, to sell it for cash, knowing that there are people in extraordinary necessity who will pay twice or three times its value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who are also attached to local authorities are very close to this problem.  It is very hard to know what is to be done.  Recently, the Dublin Corporation sent a request to the Department of Local Government asking that legislation be framed to prevent <Col N="468" /> the very persons to whom Deputy Costello has alluded&mdash;people who had bought houses on the hire-purchase system through the Dublin Corporation &mdash;from selling those houses in a free market.  At the same time, other people are permitted to exploit even further the needs of people who require accommodation. Rent restriction is necessary and possibly this motion will serve some useful purpose in this sense that it will cause us to think further about this matter.  I think the Minister ought seriously to consider the introduction of further legislation to prevent people getting possession of houses, which were hitherto let, for the purpose of selling them.  Deputy Costello talked about people who have made huge fortunes in the last few years being able to buy houses at any price.  I think we all agree that some form of control should be exerted over those house-building gentry, and that their margin of profit should be fixed and controlled by the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>If that were done local authorities might then be able to secure materials to build houses.  The local authorities are unable to build all the houses that they would like to build because they cannot get the materials, which are going to private speculators in house-building. They are going to them at high prices and this makes it impossible for local authorities to build houses to let at an economic rent to tradesmen, small businessmen and others.  That is the position in spite of the very heavy subsidies which the State is giving towards the building of houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not all that under the control of the Department of Industry and Commerce?  Must you not have a licence to get building materials?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain percentage of materials is reserved exclusively for local authorities, but then there are other materials which are let on to the free market, and there is no control of timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed a communication to the Minister for Industry <Col N="469" /> and Commerce only recently, pointing out that the licences issued to private individuals for the building of small houses had no value in securing materials.  How that is I do not know.  I have asked him to investigate that, but that is beside the point we are discussing.  The point is that the Government, by the huge subsidies it is giving for the building of houses, has indicated its willingness to help on that work.  The local authorities are doing their best to get materials and labour.  We find that the rate of building houses is below what it should be for two reasons.  One is that sufficient supplies of material are not available, and the second is, that the number of skilled tradesmen and labourers is not up to requirements.  In the Dublin Corporation we have been considering the possibility of changing the whole idea of employment in the house-building industry so that skilled workmen can be guaranteed constant employment for a period of ten years. That would enable us to continue without a break our house-building programme for ten years.  We have all kinds of problems and difficulties to contend against.  It is quite clear that the rent restriction, which was provided for in the 1946 Act, was very necessary.  It may be necessary at a later date to tackle another aspect of the problem, the one to which Deputy Costello alluded to-night, and that is, that houses hitherto let should not be permitted to go into the market for sale for their cash value but should be kept for renting purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how the tribunal, which the motion suggests should be set up, would help the situation.  What would help the situation is that all of us should agree that we have got to get more houses.  Meanwhile, every effort should be made to prevent the exploitation that is going on, even in spite of the provisions in the 1946 Act. I am quite sure that the Minister is willing to deal with these matters when they are brought to his notice. Deputy O'Connor talked about the exploitation of people in connection with furnished flats.  I do not know how it is, but the fact is that, no matter what Act is passed by a <Col N="470" /> Parliament, some people seem to be able to find a way of getting around its provisions by approaching the problem that it is aimed to deal with from a different direction.  In that way the people whom the Act was intended to protect find that they are deprived of that protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider having a very strict and rigid control over this furnished flat business.  There is an aspect of it that I would like to deal with.  All Dublin Deputies are aware that we have people coming to us every other day looking for houses and flats.  This flat business is creating a shocking situation.  We find certain people creating a sort of new form of landlordism in the way of lodgings or accommodation for students who come from the country to Dublin.  Those students are being packed&mdash;as many as three, five and nine&mdash;into a room, sometimes with two or three in the one bed.  There is no means of protecting those young people.  I think the Minister ought to look into that and see if something cannot be done for them.  The position is that you have people paying exorbitantly high prices for big houses, and then turning them into lodging houses for those unfortunate young people who come up here to try to make their way through college. I suggest that if that is looked into it will be found that at the moment it is a shocking racket.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope the Minister will take a note of certain matters that have been brought to his notice. I do not think that it is necessary for us to pass this motion.  I am afraid that its passing would only get us farther away from the problem that we want to deal with.  In fact, the passing of it might be a danger because it might lead people to believe that the setting up of the tribunal envisaged in it was going to end all their troubles in the matter of housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>What I urge on the House is that we should use every means possible to bring about the building of houses as fast as possible, so that we may be able to get back to the 1914 position <Col N="471" /> to which Deputy Moran referred. At that time a landlord had to give good value before he got a tenant because there were plenty of houses available.  Therefore, I suggest that every effort should be made by everyone everywhere to get down to the building of houses as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary for the Government to consider whether materials should be permitted to be made available for the type of house to which Deputy Costello alluded.  The rich gentry should be made wait for their accommodation until the requirements of the less fortunate people in need of housing accommodation are met.  I do not think the Minister or the Government would meet with very much resistance from anybody if they pressed that point of view.  It is true that speculative builders are going ahead with the building of houses which are far beyond the reach of ordinary people.  So long as we have the same currency as they have across the water you will find a number of trustees buying houses for people who feel that there is far greater security for their money in house property in Ireland than there is in having it in the Bank of England or in the securities which they favoured formerly.  All these things are contributing to our difficulties. You have people shifting their money into house property.  They are acquiring houses, a thing which they never thought of doing before.  That means that they are using up materials in their house-building operations which, I suggest, should be allocated to meet the housing requirements of people less fortunately circumstanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate provides an opportunity to direct the Minister's attention to two matters that arose in debates here recently. One is connected with the Act to which reference has been made, namely, the Rent Restrictions Act of 1946.  During the debates on that Act, the Minister indicated that he was prepared to deal at the earliest possible moment with the problem of the furnished flat.  At that time it was pointed out to him that the matter could be dealt with by <Col N="472" /> means of a simple Bill and the Minister indicated that he thought that was the best means of dealing with the problem.</P>
      <P>However strong the case might have been for the introduction of legislation of that type at that time, I need hardly remind the Minister and the House that the necessity for such a measure is all the more acute at the present stage.  It is almost impossible for newly-married couples to get one or two rooms in the city and, if they do succeed in getting them, it is only by paying prohibitive rents.  The situation is becoming more aggravated day after day.  In addition, there is the position that thousands of our people, particularly workers, are no longer in a position to look forward to getting houses at any stage, even six months or 12 months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that this question of housing, in so far as it affects workers and other classes referred to by Deputy Cosgrave, constitutes something in the nature of a national crisis and that unless the problem is courageously faced grave moral consequences will ensue, so far as Dublin at least is concerned.  Anybody who knows anything about the position in the city will admit that there is only one solution and that is the provision of more houses.  We have got to ask ourselves how are these houses to be provided and when?  It is said that there is only a limited supply of building materials available.  Can we augment the present supply and when and how?  Are the agencies at our disposal actively engaged in augmenting that supply and in making that national survey which, in my opinion, is a matter of urgency at the present time?  I may say that steps along these lines are being taken.  Deputy Briscoe has referred to the position so far as the corporation is concerned.  The position there is definitely grave.  We need something like 20,000 houses at the present time and we hope, with some luck, to be able to produce 2,000 houses per year for perhaps three or four years.  I am saying that we hope to do that because we know that there are certain difficulties inherent in the position. There are difficulties from the point of view of supplies and difficulties so far as the question of skilled labour is concerned.  On that point, may I <Col N="473" /> say that we recently received a deputation representing master builders and builders' providers who gave us an outline of the supplies position and it is the intention of the corporation to approach the Minister for Industry and Commerce at an early date to ascertain if the supply position can be improved.</P>
    <P>A motion of this character can, I suggest, do some practical good by focussing the attention of the Government on the gravity of the situation, which is particularly grave so far as young people are concerned.  Anybody who states that in six months' time there will be houses round the corner does not realise what he is saying.  It is going to take years to remedy the position if progress is to be limited to the rate which we are achieving at the moment.  My sole purpose in joining this debate is to bring home to Deputies the seriousness of the position and to ask that the Government might enter into consultation with the local authorities, who are the main bodies concerned, to see that every avenue will be explored and to ensure that we should get the maximum amount of materials in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the labour side of the question will solve itself on the basis of a continuous programme of employment.  If Irish builders or workers, at present employed across the water, find that conditions here are such that they can look forward to decent wages for at least five or ten years, obviously they will prefer, to return home and remain at home.  An early solution of this question will depend on how we organise our supplies. Deputy Costello made the point that while there is one set of houses controlled and another set free of control, you are going to have confusion. I directed attention to that point also when the 1946 Act was going through and I pointed out that if the date could be brought forward control could be extended to the houses to which Deputy Costello referred.  My own view is that as the number of such houses is rather small, it does not affect the position seriously.  So far as Dublin is concerned we need thousands <Col N="474" /> of houses and the question is how we are going to provide these houses.</P>

      <P>I cannot see for the life of me how Deputy Dillon's motion, if it were accepted, would better the position.  We have had this rent restrictions code in operation for 30 years.  I would be the first to admit that it is by no means perfect but surely it is better to retain it than upset it.  It provides a certain basis, anyway, for determining what rents should be.  The 1946 Act made it unnecessary to fix rents on the 1914 basis, as had been the position prior to the enactment of the 1946 Act.  That is no longer the position.  Thousands of cases, I am sure, have been settled on the basis of this Act and if we were to upset the Act, which is really the issue involved in this motion, and introduce legislation to set up courts to fix fair rents, we would then throw the whole matter into the melting pot again.  Instead of having a certain standard as we have now, every case would have to be decided on its own merits.  As far as I can see, in such circumstances you would have a most expensive and chaotic system.  I have had no evidence whatever that the passing of the last Act has led to a more chaotic position than existed before.  Deputy Dillon may have such evidence but he has not given us any instance of it here.  I should like to remind the House again, having regard to what Deputy Costello said, of the position that existed before we introduced the 1946 Act.  We are all well aware of the restrictive effect of these rent restrictions on building.  Before <Col N="475" /> the Act was passed at all, we had to pass an emergency Order fixing rents because many people were getting notices of big increases in the rent of houses in which they were living, and, in some cases, ejectments had taken place.  No new houses were being erected, and there was no possibility of houses being erected at that time, due to the shortage of materials, and consequently, unless we were to have people out-bidding each other to get houses, finding, when they got into the houses, that others had been thrown out, and these new tenants coming in, having agreed to pay a rent which was beyond them, in turn being put out, so that we would have evictions all over the place, action had to be taken.</P>
      <P>We all agree that the provision of new houses is the remedy.  I can remember, as any of the older people in the House will remember, that, up to 1914, landlords were actually looking for tenants.  Younger people will scarcely believe that, but it is a fact, and one could have the choice of practically any number of houses before 1914.  Immediately after the war, there came the rush into the towns, particularly in England&mdash;a rush of munition workers and so on into the towns&mdash; where there was no accommodation. The landlords, like any other business people, naturally took advantage of the supply and demand position and did what every other class does, when it gets the opportunity, that is, get as much for the goods they had on hands as they would fetch, with the result that the British Government was forced to bring in the Rent Restrictions Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the new Government was set up in this country, it tried to decontrol. Several Acts were passed yearly, designed to reduce eventually the valuation of houses under control, in the hope that in due course houses would cease to be controlled and we would get back to the position in which there was free building and houses could be got as they could before 1914.  That did not materialise. It was discovered that houses were not being built for letting and that, as they became decontrolled, they were either being sold or let at a greatly increased <Col N="476" /> rent.  The last Government decided that the decontrol system would have to be stopped.</P>
    <P>When the last war came along, we found the same thing happening.  The Government and everybody else realise that when there is that control of rents, there will not be as much building of houses for renting as there would otherwise be, but there is no way out of it until we get the houses built.  The building of more houses is a matter which is engaging the attention of the Minister for Local Government and of the Government generally.  We are fully aware of the position, but the remedy, of course, is to get more materials.  I do not know what powers the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to restrict the building of the luxury type of house and to concentrate what materials are available on the building of ordinary houses, but it is a matter with which I am not in a position to deal.</P>
    <P>I am merely asked here to substitute for the present rent restrictions code a fair rent code, but no indication is given as to the basis on which the new rents are to be fixed, and, as I said, I believe that the position which would arise in such circumstances would be worse than the present position, in which there is a well-established system of fixing rents.  Deputy Dillon thinks there is some way out, but, if he has any plan, he did not give it to us. Neither I nor the Government need to be told of the necessity for more houses, and that is the aspect on which practically everybody concentrated.  I no not think it was quite in order; I thought we should deal with the merits of the proposal in the motion and the existing rent restrictions code.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke of the child of light as compared with the Mammon of iniquity&mdash;the people who charged very little rent and those who got full value. So far as I remember, the 1914 rents were competitive.  There was not very much of that sort of thing, in the towns, anyway, but there were cases in which a person brought in a relative or perhaps a poor friend and charged only a low rent.  In these cases, only a certain percentage increase on the 1914 rent could be charged, but that <Col N="477" /> position was remedied by an amendment accepted in the Seanad.  Deputy Dillon must not be aware of that.  I do not think that there is any grievance in that respect.  So far as I can see, the situation is not likely to be bettered by adopting the motion.  He has not shown me that it is, and I can assure him that I approach this matter with an open mind, as I think I showed when the Rent Restrictions Act was going through.  I was then prepared to listen to amendments, no matter from what side they came and to deal with them on their merits.</P>
    <P>With regard to furnished flats&mdash;a matter which is scarcely relevant either &mdash;I did say that I would look into it and have it examined.  I did so, but no decision has been come to.  I shall have to look further into it and see what can be done.  It is a very difficult matter to deal with.  As to accommodation for students, how could we deal with that matter?  I do not see how we could possibly deal with it.  We cannot compel people to take students or other lodgers into their houses if they do not want to do so.</P>
    <P>I should like to be able to do it, but I fail to see how it is to be done.  The kernel of the problem is more houses and that is a matter for the Government and not for this particular Minister. It is a matter primarily for the Minister for Local Government, who, I think, is doing all he possibly can to meet the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that, under the existing system, there are the widest inequalities between the rents charged in respect of very similar premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, and, so far as I know, it was due to decontrol. The position was that when a person left a house and the landlord got vacant possession, if he either sold or let the house, the house became decontrolled and he was consequently able to get a bigger rent for it than the owner of a similar house which was still controlled and of which the tenant had not given up possession.  That is how it arose.  These inequalities do exist and that is how they came about. <Col N="478" /> There was also the other situation referred to by Deputy Moran that as time went on and building costs became higher, similar houses, and in fact houses of worse quality, cost a lot more to build, and, if they were let for rent, a bigger rent had to be charged.  There is also the question of the value of money.  We all know that money went further before 1914 than after 1914 and all these things had to be taken into consideration.  The last Act passed, however, has certainly improved the position.  It is only a temporary measure.  We hope that, in five years' time, there may be an improvement and a certain measure of decontrol may be brought in, as the last Government thought in their day.  How far we can go with that remains to be seen.  It will depend on the progress made in providing houses.</P>

      <P>Even that, in itself, is a good thing because the more houses being built, the better chance there will be, in the long run, of prices coming down.  Looking around the City of Dublin, I am surprised by the number of houses which are springing up having regard to the supply position. Near where I live, in the Killester area, many houses are being built.  They are not occupied yet, but they are springing up very quickly. There is no suggestion of remaining where we are for five years, but the Rent Restrictions Act will have to remain operative for about five years, until things improve and until we see some justification for bringing in an amending measure, which can be done at any time.</P>

    <P>During the year ended 31st March, 1946, the Minister for Finance agreed that provision could be made in the Estimate of the Department of Industry and Commerce for the year 1946-47 for recoupment to local authorities of losses incurred since 1941 in connection with the sale of turf to persons other than Fuel Importers Ltd., local institutions and Government Departments. Losses incurred by the Tipperary (S.R.) County Council on such sales up to 31st March, 1946, are provisionally estimated at £45,160 7s. 0d.  On a certificate furnished by this Department a payment of £37,500 on account of the losses was made by the Department of Industry and Commerce to the county council in August, 1946.  The losses incurred by the Tipperary (N.R.) County Council are provisionally estimated at £16,000.  A certificate of these losses will shortly be furnished to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

These amount to £1,767 9s. od. for the whole country over the seven years mentioned in the question but it should be noted that during the same period decreases were made in 82 turbary valuations, representing a total reduction of £514 12s. 0d., so that the net aggregate increase was £1,252 17s. 0d.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that an attempt is being made to prevent a number of persons from Lorrha, County Tipperary, entitled to draw turf from the Annagh Bog on the Stoney Estate, from doing so over their accustomed route, on the grounds that transactions by the Land Commission have terminated the right of way over this road; that the alternative route offered them is a much longer one; and if he will state when, and by what transaction, any right of way between the Annagh Bog and the road to Lorrha was terminated, and the authority, if any, under which any such action was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Formerly, some turf-cutters on Annagh Bog were permitted to use the shorter route to which the Deputy is referring but there was no right of way for their benefit over that roadway.  It was found impracticable to extend its general use to turf-cutters but a right of way over a suitable alternative route has been provided for them by the Land Commission.</P>
