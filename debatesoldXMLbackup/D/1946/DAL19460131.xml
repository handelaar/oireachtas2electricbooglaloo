    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The County Management Act specifically reserved to managers for local authorities the control of the staffs of local authorities and debarred members of authorities, with which managers are associated, from interfering with the managers' functions in relation to the staff.  The effective control of staff includes the power of assigning, with the sanction of the Minister, the remuneration, duties and conditions of service of such officers and servants as are for the time being in the employment of the local authority concerned.  If it is proposed to vary these in any way the manager concerned must take public responsibility for the variation.  Where the managers or local authorities concerned have been unwilling or unable to accede to demands put forward by particular officers, or groups of officers, there has been an increasing tendency to approach members of the Oireachtas, particularly members of the Dáil, to induce them to bring their personal influence to bear on the Minister so as to persuade him to bring pressure on the manager concerned to vary conditions of service in particular cases. There is also a tendency to ask for assurances to county managers that in the event of particular proposals being submitted by them to the Minister they will be favourably considered, that is to say, to ensure that instead of being dealt with impersonally on their merits they will be approved of on personal and not on public grounds. These developments are clearly contrary to the spirit of the managerial system.  Members of local authorities are, as I have indicated, debarred by statute from interfering with the manager in the control of staff.  Managers, on the other hand, are bound by their statutory obligations to carry clear and undivided responsibility for that control.  An attempt on the part of public men to use their position as members of the Oireachtas for the <Col N="185" /> purpose of influencing the Minister either in his consideration of proposals submitted to him by the manager in relation to staff, or to induce the manager to make staff proposals which he otherwise would not make, is clearly quite inconsistent with the doctrine of managerial responsibility and with the maintenance of the statute bar on members of a local authority acting in this way.  The Deputy in putting this question is acting as a member of the national legislative Assembly which has by law determined that, as a member of a local authority, he would be debarred from interfering in the exercise of these particular functions.  In my view it is inconceivable that where members of the local authorities are debarred, persons in other capacities should have the right to interfere.  In view of this I trust that, whatever he may consider his public duties to be, the Deputy does not suggest that I should connive at his disregarding the spirit and the letter of a statute for the administration and enforcement of which I am responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Local Government Act, 1941, any officer aggrieved by the action of a manager has a right of appeal to the Minister.  All such appeals are considered by me in a judicial manner and decided on their merits.  If a local officer is not content with a right of appeal which has been given to him by that statute and which he did not possess before it came into operation, and tries by private representations to influence the Minister in his favour, then it must be assumed that he either believes his case will not get reasonable consideration or that with influence to aid him he will obtain a more favourable consideration than the merits of his case warrant.  I would remind the Deputy that in 1923 and again in 1932 civil servants were reminded of the regulations forbidding them to make applications for personal concessions in their favour except through the heads of their Departments.  These prohibitions aimed at the same practice as the circular letter of last July and have not been regarded as a hindrance to public representatives in the discharge of <Col N="186" /> their public duties.  There is no reason why officers of local authorities should be put in a privileged position in this regard.  I have only to say that if the Deputy acts in the spirit of his letter to the Press of the 14th August, 1945, and ventures to address private representations on behalf of any officer, his efforts will not help the officer concerned but will be regarded as an improper attempt on the part of the officer to influence me in the discharge of my duty.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether any examination has been made into the various detailed items of costs, which enter into the total cost of house-building under local authorities in (a) urban, and (b) rural districts; and, if so, if he will state what were the detailed costs disclosed by such inquiries.</P>

      <P>The various items of cost in connection with local authorities' housing schemes are constantly under review in my Department and statistics of the all-in-cost of all subsidised schemes undertaken are maintained. As the Deputy is aware there was a considerable falling off in building activity both in urban and rural <Col N="188" /> districts since 1940, owing to difficulty in securing supplies of materials, and no reliable conclusions could be drawn from any examination of such information as was available.  In Dublin City, where house-building was continued at an average level throughout the emergency period, the various costs have been kept constantly under review.  There was an upward trend in the average of building costs throughout the period.  The costs ranged from £462 in 1938, £504 in 1940, to £750 in 1945.  I may point out that the various factors affecting the provision of housing schemes in Dublin were examined in detail by the Commission of Inquiry into the Housing of the Working Classes in the City of Dublin, and their conclusions are contained in paragraphs 216 to 271 of their report which was published in 1944.</P>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, two tables will be circulated with the debates.  The first is an itemised table of all-in-cost in respect of a particular scheme for which the Corporation of Drogheda received tenders in 1941 and 1946.  The second table shows the costs in Dublin County Borough in June, 1939, and September, 1945, of the approximate quantity of principal materials required for an average four-roomed house.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the establishment of three new sanatoria containing over 2,000 beds is a project of very considerable magnitude.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, having regard to the fact that many owners of motor cars and lorries who had taxed their vehicles prior to 1st January, 1946, did not receive their petrol coupons until 21st January, 1946, he is prepared to arrange for a refund to such owners of the proportion of the road tax applicable to the period during which, through no fault of their own, they were unable to use the vehicles.</P>

      <P>I understand there were some printing difficulties in connection <Col N="193" /> with the issue of petrol coupons.  So far as my Department is concerned, the position is as follows: Where a motor vehicle is used on a public road in any portion of a period for which it has been licensed, liability is incurred for that period.  A refund of licence duty could not be considered in respect of a period of less than a full calendar month and then only upon certain evidence being forthcoming. Provided a licensee can establish that the vehicle was not used in the present month of January and surrenders the January petrol coupons intact, a refund of a month's duty will be considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state with reference to the White Paper on Guaranteed Market and Prices for Dairy Produce (a) the reference in the <i>Irish <Col N="195" /> Trade Journal</i> from which the prices of concentrates and hay quoted in paragraph 18 are taken; (b) whether the price of hay quoted in the same paragraph is taken as half the price of meadow hay or of first or second crop hay; (c) whether the calculated cost of 5.12d. per gallon for feeding is to be taken as the basis on which present prices are fixed and on which, in the five years' plan, future adjustments, if any, will be calculated, and (d) if he will give some examples of price adjustment to illustrate how the scheme will operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are the particulars asked for:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  In the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> the average quarterly retail prices of feeding stuffs in towns and the average quarterly prices of hay at fairs and markets are given.  The prices quoted in paragraph 18 of the White Paper on Guaranteed Market and Prices for Dairy Produce represent in the case of crushed oats and meat meal the average of the prices in the <i>Trade Journal</i> for the four quarters ended September and December, 1944, and March and June, 1945, and in the case of hay half the average of the prices given for the same four quarters.</P>
      <P>(b)  In calculating the average price for hay the prices of meadow hay and first year's and second year's crop were all taken into account.</P>
      <P>(c)  and (d)  5.12d. is the portion of the milk price allowed for roots, hay, crushed oats and meat meal and only that portion of the milk price will be affected after 31st March, 1947, by the future cost of the items mentioned or of cheaper substitutes if available in quantity.  For example, if the yearly average of the prices of hay at fairs and markets as published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> rises or falls by 20/- per ton half the increase or decrease will be reckoned since, for the reasons stated in the White Paper, only half the cost is taken into account in making up the basic price for milk. This would mean an increase or decrease of 6d. per cwt. on the ration of 33 cwt. or 16/6 in all equivalent to .38d. per gallon of milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state, with reference to the price of 5.12d. per gallon for feeding stuffs set out in paragraph 18 of the White Paper on Guaranteed Market and Prices of Dairy Produce, whether he has arrived at the conclusion that the balance of 5.47d. per gallon of the average guaranteed price of 10.59d. is sufficient to cover cost of grass, labour, delivery, depreciation of stock, etc., and leave a reasonable margin of profit for the producer; and, if so, if he will set out the calculations on which the decision was based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the White Paper referred to it is stated that the average milk price made available to creameries during the current financial year will be taken as the basic price to be guaranteed for the next five years, subject to variations in accordance with changes in costs of milk production.  Since the main item likely to show any considerable change during the coming years is food other than grass, the White Paper indicates how much is included in respect of that item in the present milk price.  It is not correct to assume, as the Deputy does, that the balance of 5.47d. per gallon, arrived at by deducting the amount included for feeding stuffs (5.12d.) from the creamery milk price of 10.59d. per gallon, represents the amount available for the other items of cost specified in the question.  There are obvious credit items which he has apparently overlooked, and if these are taken into consideration it will be seen that the balance is appreciably greater than that stated by the Deputy.  For his information I propose to circulate with <Col N="197" /> the Official Report a statement of the items making up the cost of milk production in creamery districts.</P>
      <P>The statement is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>COST OF PRODUCING MILK IN CREAMERY DISTRICTS DURING 1945 BASED ON ESTIMATED COST OF KEEPING A 525 GALLON COW.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together. Both classes of clerks are pensionable when the conditions laid down in the Superannuation Acts are fulfilled, but not otherwise.  In the majority of cases, these conditions are not fulfilled. In the case of District Court clerks, the usual obstacle is that the clerk is not employed whole-time as required by the Superannuation Acts.  This is a fatal objection.  In the case of clerks in Circuit Court offices, some are <Col N="202" /> eligible in every respect except that they were not appointed with a certificate from the Civil Service Commissioners. Legislation would be required to overcome this objection.  Proposals in that respect are under discussion with the Department of Finance.</P>

In connection with the sale proceedings of this estate under the Land Acts, 1923-1939, a trust fund was established to assist the tenant purchasers in the upkeep of certain embankments and other works in these and other townlands.  The execution of repairs to the works as they become necessary is a matter for the local trustees representing the tenant purchasers, who are responsible for the administration of the fund.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A harbour authority in lieu of appointing a person to be a collector of rates for their harbour may appoint the secretary to be in addition a collector of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is that it should be optional for the harbour <Col N="209" /> authority to appoint either the secretary or the harbour master as collector of dues.  The harbour master will usually be very fully occupied looking after the work of the port, the maintenance of the machinery and the staff, and if it is at all conceivable that he could not also carry on the duty of collector of dues, then it would be more reasonable that the secretary would be able to do it.  The section, as it stands, would prohibit that being done.  The amendment will enable the harbour authority to appoint the secretary as the collector of dues rather than the harbour master, if they want to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (4), line 30, to insert before the words &ldquo;shall apply&rdquo; the words &ldquo;other than sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 7 and Section 11 of the Local Authorities (Officers and <Col N="210" /> Employees) Act, 1926 (No. 39 of 1926)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from discussions with the Local Appointments Commission.  Sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 7 of the 1926 Act empower the Local Appointments Commission to fix the qualifications for offices to be filled.  These powers were found to be inadequate and these sub-sections were repealed by the Local Government Act of 1941, which gave the Minister for Local Government power to fix the qualifications for local authority offices. We are following the same procedure here and are proposing that these sections of the Act of 1926 will not apply.</P>
    <P>Another amendment will propose that we give to the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to fix the qualifications for harbour offices to be filled by the Local Appointments Commission &mdash;powers similar to those given to the Minister for Local Government in the Local Government Act of 1941.  The other change effected here&mdash;that is, the non-application of Section 11&mdash;is proposed because that section is not relevant to the suspension of harbour officers.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>This change is also suggested by the Local Appointments Commission.  It was felt the use of the word &ldquo;fee&rdquo; might cause ambiguity.  Fees are paid by candidates and it is proposed to provide that the harbour authority will pay such amount in respect of expenses incurred by the Local Appointments Commission as may be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to bring to the Minister's notice concerns one harbour in County Cork.  There are four harbours in Cork that come under the Bill&mdash;Youghal, Cork, Kinsale and Baltimore-Skibbereen.  It is to the Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour that I would like to call the attention of the Minister.  The Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Board was formed about 1884 and it was functioning until recent years.  As far as I can learn, it has not been functioning for some time.  I have been informed by the chairman of the urban council in Skibbereen that that body got no notification to attend any meeting.</P>
      <P>The position there is that there was one man doing the duty of harbour master and lightkeeper.  The position of lightkeeper at the lighthouse at Sherkin Island is a very important one. The harbour master has not been paid his salary in recent years.  He had to give up the position of harbour master because he was unable to do the work without payment, but he is still in charge of the lighthouse.  He informs me that his salary was £52 a year for the two positions.  The finances of the board got bad and that amount was reduced to £32.  For 5½ years he has received about £46 for managing the lighthouse.  This man lives in Sherkin Island and he is not in very comfortable circumstances, but he is still carrying on his duty as lightkeeper.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to take into consideration that this is not covered by the Bill&mdash;the position of such men &mdash;and I would also like to call attention to the fact, although it might not come under this section, that there are other harbours, such as Castletown, Berehaven and Bantry, that do not come under the Bill.  There are people deeply interested in these harbours, and if these people make application later, as the Minister has power to bring them under the Bill, I trust that he will give due consideration to their request.  I would like him to give special consideration to the position of the lightkeeper on Sherkin Island, who has not been paid by the harbour board for a number of years.</P>

      <P>I mentioned this amendment earlier when moving another amendment consequential on it.  The Harbours Tribunal recommended that each of the four principal harbours should have a general manager and secretary.  The Dublin Ports and Docks Board are anxious to have a general manager and a secretary and it is not proposed to make it obligatory upon these harbours to have one officer filling both posts. They may have one officer filling the posts, but they may, if they wish, have two officers, one for each post.  This amendment is designed to give effect to that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 79:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (4) in page 24 and substitute therefor the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  The general manager and secretary of a harbour shall, subject to confirmation by the harbour authority, have sole power to engage, suspend and discharge employees (other than officers) of the harbour authority for the harbour to whose appointment the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts, 1926 and 1940, as applied by this Act, do not apply but it shall always be competent for the general manager and secretary to delegate in any particular case the powers conferred upon him by this sub-section to the appropriate officer serving under him.</P>
      <P>I referred on Second Reading to the position regarding the powers of the general manager, and I think we have evidence of a rather keen desire on the part of the Minister, during the discussion on this Bill, to ensure that the Bill will be strictly in line with local government.  I suggest, however, that, in the case of a harbour authority, there is not a line ball position with an ordinary public authority, as, for instance, a county council or a borough council, so far as the position of the manager is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here you have the nearest approach to what I might call a private undertaking. In the case of the Dublin Port Board, which manages its business in its own way, so far as staff are concerned, I know of no friction which has ever arisen between the board and its main officers in the matter of staff, and I think I would be correct in saying that the members of the board who have experience of this matter would resent any suggestion, even by implication, that complete powers were to be placed in the hands of the manager in the matter of staff.  I know the Minister will refer me to an earlier section regarding the overriding authority of the board so far as the manager is concerned, but the section is very wide in that it gives the manager power to engage, suspend and dismiss and contains <Col N="215" /> no reference to the overriding authority of the harbour board itself.</P>
    <P>I understand also that the committee of the port board which dealt with this matter requested that powers might be delegated by the manager to other officers.  There are three main undertakings within the jurisdiction of the Dublin Port Board: the engineer's department, the harbour master's department and the warehouses department. Obviously, it would be quite proper to ensure that the existing regulations regarding employment should continue, that is, that these separate officers should have power in the normal way to continue in the matter of employing staff, suspending staff, where necessary, and so on, and that that power should be delegated within the section in the manner I have indicated.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the Minister that what I am aiming at is ensuring that the manager of a port authority will not be a dictator within the board so far as staff are concerned. I stress again that it has worked smoothly.  The board have never interfered with their main officials regarding employment or anything else, and I have no doubt that even with the manager that state of affairs will continue, but it is eminently desirable, and in fact absolutely democratic, that the overriding authority in the matter of staff should still be the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to remember that we cannot just frame this Bill, which is to lay down the law for all harbours, exclusively on the basis of the experience of the Dublin port authority.  The Dublin port authority established certain practices in relation to the recruitment of staff which were very commendable, but in which I think they were alone.  Certainly, in the case of a number of other port authorities different practices were followed, practices which were much more open to question than those followed in Dublin.  I would not be prepared to agree to modify in any way the responsibility which it is proposed to give to the general manager of these Class A ports in respect of the engagement <Col N="216" /> and suspension of employees, other than the executive officers who are to be appointed through the Local Appointments Commission.  I think an intelligent manager will discharge this function in agreement with his board, but the ultimate legal responsibility for the recruitment of staff and the management of staff must rest upon the general manager.</P>
      <P>I should like to consider further the Deputy's suggestion concerning the power of delegation.  I do not see that there need be any objection in principle to empowering the manager to delegate his power to subordinate officers.  I should not like to create a situation in which the subordinate officers could act independently of him. It is clear that the responsibility must be the manager's, and that, if he delegates it, he does so, knowing that he is delegating not merely the power but also the responsibility.  In the case of a port like Dublin, however, I can appreciate that it might be an administrative convenience to have that power rather than to have a situation in which the manager had inevitably to act himself and could not authorise anyone else to act on his behalf.  If the Deputy will leave that part over, I am prepared to consider whether we could frame an amendment for Report Stage which would provide for the delegation by the manager of this power, but I would not like to accept any words which would imply that the responsibility of the manager in relation to the recruitment of subordinate staff is not absolute or would be in any way subject to the overriding authority of the board.</P>

      <P>(5) The general manager of a harbour may suspend any officer of the harbour authority of the harbour, but any such suspension may be determined by the harbour authority.</P>
      <P>(6) The harbour authority of a harbour may suspend or, with the sanction of the Minister, remove the general manager of the harbour, but no such suspension or removal shall be effected save by a resolution passed by the harbour authority for the purpose of such removal or suspension (as the case may be) and for the passing of which not less than two-thirds of the members of the harbour authority voted and which was so passed after not less than seven days' notice of the intention to propose the resolution had been given by post to every member of the harbour authority.</P>
      <P>This amendment gives the general manager power to suspend an officer of a harbour authority subject to this, that the harbour authority is given power to terminate the suspension.

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may declare a <Col N="219" /> qualification of any of the following classes or descriptions to be a qualification for a specified office under a harbour authority or for such of the offices under harbour authorities as belong to a specified class, description or grade, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) qualifications relating to character,</P>
    <P>(b) qualifications relating to age, health, or physical characteristics,</P>
    <P>(c) qualifications relating to education, training or experience,</P>
    <P>(d) qualifications relating to residence,</P>
    <P>(e) qualifications relating to sex,</P>
    <P>(f) the qualification that any woman holding the office in question be either unmarried or a widow.</P>
    <P>(2) The Minister shall not declare under this section that any qualification relating to sex is a qualification for any office unless he is of opinion that the duties of the office so require.</P>
    <P>(3) Before declaring under this section that any qualification is a qualification for any office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts, 1926 and 1940, as applied by this Act, apply, the Minister shall consult with the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(4) Every reference in the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 (No. 39 of 1926), as applied by this Act, to the qualifications prescribed under that Act shall be construed in relation to every office under a harbour authority as a reference to the qualifications (if any) for the time being declared under this section to be the qualifications for such office.</P>
    <P>(5) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (6) of this section, no person shall be appointed to any office for which any qualifications are for the time being declared under this section to be the qualifications unless he possesses those qualifications.</P>
    <P>(6) Whenever it is necessary to fill immediately any office for which any <Col N="220" /> qualifications are for the time being declared under this section to be the qualifications, and no suitable person possessing such qualifications is available for appointment, the Minister may, on the application of the harbour authority concerned, authorise an appointment, limited as to its duration to a specified period, to be made to the office without reference to such qualifications and thereupon such appointment may be so made.</P>
    <P>(7) A person appointed to any office in pursuance of an authorisation under sub-section (6) of this section shall (unless for any reason he has previously ceased to hold office) cease to hold office on the occurrence of whichever of the following events first occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the expiration of the period specified in that behalf in the authorisation,</P>
    <P>(b) the appointment to the office of a person possessing the qualifications for the time being declared under this section to be the qualifications for the office.</P>
    <P>(8) For the purposes of this section, the fact that a person has been recommended by the Local Appointments Commissioners for appointment to any office shall be conclusive evidence that he possessed at the time of the recommendation the qualifications (if any) for the time being declared under this section to be the qualifications for the office.</P>
    <P>(9) The Local Appointments Commissioners shall, before recommending a person to a harbour authority for appointment to any office, satisfy themselves that such person possesses the requisite knowledge and ability for the proper discharge of the duties of the office.</P>
    <P>This is the section which enables the Minister to declare the qualifications which must be held by candidates applying for various offices under the harbour authority.  Under the original Act establishing the Local Appointments Commission there was a local appointments commissioner given the <Col N="221" /> power to prescribe qualifications.  That was found in practice to be unsatisfactory, and under the local government code the relevant sections to the 1926 Act were repealed and that power was given to the Minister for Local Government. We are adopting a similar procedure in relation to harbour boards.</P>

      <P>This is the section which provides for the sanction of the Minister before a harbour authority may remove an officer in their service.  The powers to employ and remove officers derived in the case of most harbours from the Commissioners Clauses Act of 1847 which was incorporated in the Acts and Orders relating to harbours.  That section gave power to employ and dismiss officers.  In the case of officers employed by these harbour boards they will now have the added protection of this clause.  The harbour board can vote for the removal of an officer, but their decision in that regard will not become effective until the sanction of the Minister has been secured.</P>

      <P>This section makes it mandatory on harbour authorities to provide facilities and accommodation for passengers as well as for vessels and goods.  It might be a very expensive thing, in the case of the Dublin Port Board if it were made mandatory on it, to provide accommodation and facilities for passengers.

You might have a situation arising in which one of the big companies making a great deal of money out of passenger traffic would refuse to supply adequate accommodation for passengers.

      <P>I move amendment No. 91:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-sections (2) to (5) and substitute the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) A harbour authority may make such charges for the use of anything provided by them under this section as, with the consent of the Minister, they may fix from time to time.</P>
      <P>(3) Where a harbour authority were, immediately before the passing of this Act, making charges authorised by law for the use of anything mentioned in sub-section (1) of this section, such charges shall be regarded for the purposes of sub-section (2) of this section as having been duly fixed under that sub-section.</P>
      <P>(4) A harbour authority may let out for hire anything provided by them under this section for any period not exceeding three years on such terms as they think proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of changes being made here.  The amendment deletes the first paragraph of sub-section (2) of the original draft and this new sub-section is substituted.  It was thought that charges for the use of appliances and machinery referred to in sub-section (1) would be included under service rates which are regulated under Section 103.  On reconsideration, however, it appeared that that was not the case.  The amended section provides for the consent of the Minister to the rates as fixed from time to time. The deletion of sub-sections (3) to (5) of the original section is merely a drafting change.  These are being inserted in another part of the Bill, where they are deemed to be more appropriate.  The new sub-section (3) provides that statutory charges for appliances, machinery and the like, are to be deemed to have been fixed under the section.  They can, of course, be altered from time to time with the Minister's consent.  The new sub-section (4) is introduced to meet a point raised by the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  They pointed out that the lease of a transporter crane for a period of years might conflict with the provisions of Section 91 which provide <Col N="227" /> that facilities shall be available equally to all persons on paying the appropriate rates.  The section permits of the lease of these facilities by a harbour board for a period not exceeding three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 93, in the name of Deputy Larkin:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 46 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A harbour authority may provide and operate service vehicles for the conveyance of workmen and other persons lawfully having recourse to the place at which ships are discharged, to transit sheds, to customs posts or offices or to any vessel loading or discharging cargo within the precincts of the port under the management or control of such harbour authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the point that Deputy Larkin had in mind here was the necessity of having a bus service along the quays to facilitate a number of people of a good many descriptions who would be using the port and docks, etc., as, for instance, the workmen engaged in the port service and all other services along the quays and a number of individuals who would be using the Custom House docks, and merchants generally.  I think the Minister, who knows the district pretty well so far as the Port of Dublin is concerned, knows that it is a rather inaccessible place from the point of view of general business.  The service that is in operation would not appear to be all that could be desired or to fulfil the need.  I understand that the amendment is based on the fact that a service of this character is in operation on the other side, particularly in the Port of London, which actually gives free transport from the head of the city down to the docks.  The Minister does provide, in another section, for an arrangement with carrying companies where services can be entered into but the point that Deputy Larkin had in mind was that the port authority itself should have the power, if it so desired, and if it felt it necessary, to <Col N="229" /> initiate transport services for the purpose I have indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree that the port authority should have the power.  Perhaps it is not fully appreciated that in so far as a public transport service is required there is power to require Córas Iompair Éireann to provide it.  We are talking now about normal circumstances, when there is no difficulty about vehicles, buses or anything else and new services can be conceived. In such circumstances, if a public transport service is required in the dock area and Córas Iompair Éireann do not provide it as an ordinary development of their own business they can be required to do it. If there is a desire to have a special arrangement with them for the provision of vehicles in which the employees of the board would travel free of charge, that can also be entered into.  I do not say we would sanction it now but that is merely because of temporary difficulties created by the scarcity of vehicles and equipment. But in normal circumstances that could be arranged.  There might, of course, be a problem in getting the assent of the Gárda Síochána to the operation of a public transport service in the dock area on grounds of safety but that matter could be considered if and when such services became practicable. Certainly, the Guards would, I am sure, insist upon certain rather rigid rules to ensure that there would be no undue risk to passengers in these services travelling through dock areas.  However, I suggest that the proper way of ensuring that such a service is provided is by using the public transport companies and there is adequate power to ensure that if they do not provide that service as an extension of their business, they can be required to do it.  In so far as the port and docks board may desire to provide special facilities for their own employees then they are empowered to do it.  So that this section is not really necessary except it is desired for some special reason that this service, if provided at all, should be provided by the Port and Docks Board.  I do not think it should be provided by the board.  I think it can be provided much more <Col N="230" /> efficiently and much more satisfactorily by the public transport company.</P>

      <P>Might I draw the attention of the Minister to the point that in Section 46 power is given to issue licences to the owners of vehicles?  I think that the committee of the corporation dealing with these amendments made representations to the Minister on the question of the ferry service which it operates on the docks and expressed the desire that the Minister might incorporate in the Bill machinery by which the ferry boat system would be transferred to the port authority.  I would be glad to know if the Minister has considered that point and if he would provide the necessary machinery for the transfer of that ferry boat system.  I want to be fair to the Minister and to say that it is not exactly taking over a concern that is paying tremendous dividends.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear why it should be considered that the provision of a ferry service connecting two city thoroughfares should be the function of a harbour board.  I think the framers of the original charter were right in giving that power to the Dublin Corporation. It seems to me to be the normal function of the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> Certainly, I have not been convinced that it is good policy to transfer the service or the power to run that service from the corporation to the harbour board.  It is, however, such a trivial matter, that if the corporation feel keen about it I would be prepared to meet them.  Ordinarily, I would say it is more a function for the corporation than for the harbour board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the necessity for the ferry service is due to the surroundings, namely, the docks.  All the people operating there are in the dock area and under the jurisdiction at least of the port authority.  Therefore, it would appear to me to be correctly related to the port authority.</P>

      <P>It might be more convenient to have it operated by the port authority, but the provision of a service of that kind in any city is, I think, the responsibility of the city authority.

If the corporation feel strongly about it, I would be prepared to provide some section to enable the corporation to get rid of it.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan.  I should like to point out to the Minister that this service is not a very profitable one, in fact, it is run at a loss.  Now that the corporation has lost the anchorage and the various other ancient rights which it had got, it is rather hard to take the assets from the corporation and leave them the ferry, which is a complete liability.  Now that the corporation will have very little rights and, I think, still less duties in the port area, I think it would be an act of justice to remove the running of the ferry from the corporation, always provided that it will be kept running.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 96:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 49 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act it shall be lawful for the Dundalk Harbour Commissioners to purchase, take, use, or otherwise interfere with the quay, wharf or lands in occupation of the Dundalk and Newry Steam Packet Company, Limited, and known as the Dundalk Steam Packet Quay, <Col N="234" /> with or without the consent of the said company, provided however that where the said company is aggrieved thereby it may appeal to the Minister who may order that such interference shall cease or alternately make arrangements for the compensation of the company.</P>
    <P>(2) The Dundalk and Newry Steam Packet Company shall not sell or dispose of the said steam packet quay, wharf or lands to any person or corporation other than the Dundalk Harbour Commissioners without the consent of the said commissioners.</P>
    <P>I thought it well to introduce this amendment immediately before Section 49.  Section 48 of the present Bill enables harbour authorities, if they so desire, to appropriate any part of their harbour, including any dock pier, etc. In the Dundalk Harbour and Port Act, 1925, Section 32 gave to the B. and I. Company the right solely to occupy the berth known as the Dundalk and Newry Steampacket berth and quay, with a provision attached to it that they could not sell or dispose of these premises without first acquainting the Dundalk Harbour Board and giving the harbour board the option of purchasing these quays and premises, if they so desire.  The harbour board is very much interested in the trade of the port in so far as it has been carried on by the Dundalk and Newry Steampacket Company, which is really at the moment the B. and I. Company. Notwithstanding this section and its implications that they could not sell or dispose of the premises, some years ago they got round that by a simple transfer of shares.  The harbour board feel that they should have the right to acquire these premises for various reasons, the principal reason being that, for some years past, the B. and I. Company, for reasons best known to themselves, have allowed, so far as they are concerned, the trade of the port to deteriorate to such an extent that at the moment it is negligible.  I should like to be fair to the B. and I. Company and say that I can understand that there are very good reasons why the trade should become somewhat <Col N="235" /> negligible, especially during the five or six years of the war, and also for the reason that, due to the same set of circumstances, the condition of the port was such that possibly it might be dangerous for vessels to berth at their former berth, owing to silting up as a result of steamers not coming into the port.  The mainstay of the Port of Dundalk, to a greater or lesser extent, and of other ports on the eastern seaboard, is the import of coal.  Of course, under present circumstances, that trade is practically gone.  We hope to have it resumed somewhat in the near future.  At the moment, with the exception of a few cargoes coming in to the G.N.R., it is extinct, so far as Dundalk is concerned.</P>
    <P>We would like to have this power, not that we are going to exercise it for the mere sake of exercising it. We hope and trust that, now that the reason for trade being so bad, so far as the B. and I is concerned, in the last few years, is being removed, the trade will be of such a nature that they will be able to have at least a weekly sailing into the Port of Dundalk. As far as I understand, they have a sailing now into the sister Port of Drogheda.  In fact, Drogheda was in much the same position.  They had a certain grievance against the B. and I. also, but they have succeeded, I am glad to say, a little bit better than we in Dundalk.  It is quite on the cards that they may send in a ship or two in the near future. At all events, the harbour board think that it is wise to have this power if, at some future date, they deem it expedient and in the best interests of the people of Dundalk and surrounding districts to acquire this quay and premises.  Of course, there would be fair compensation, as we do not mean to confiscate the property of anyone. We hope that the position will not arise, but we would like to have the power.</P>
    <P>The Port of Dundalk, like the neighbouring Port of Drogheda, had a very big trade some years ago.  I remember that, at no far distant date, there were three regular sailings a week from Dundalk to Liverpool and vice <Col N="236" /> versa, and through both ports there were exported very large numbers of cattle and very large quantities of agricultural produce in the form of eggs and poultry.  Due to modern transport and to a change in the arrangements for marketing, and also to the holding of fairs, and beyond and above all, due to the Border being established, a great deal of that trade has gone in other directions, so much so that the sailings were reduced from three to one for years prior to the Great War, and during the last war, which has lasted for six years, they have practically ceased.  We are in a position now in which a large thriving town like Dundalk, with a population of 16,000 or 17,000, and with a big hinterland, for which it catered in former years, has no weekly sailing at all at the moment, to import goods badly needed, and on the other hand to develop an export trade, which can be developed within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>We feel&mdash;at least, the members of the harbour board and the citizens of Dundalk, in general, feel&mdash;that for reasons best known to themselves, as they have alternative ports from which to run their ships, the B. and I. are not taking just that interest in the Port of Dundalk which they should take, and that it is a matter of little concern to them whether we are left without any sailing whatsoever.  I think the Minister would be well advised to accept this amendment, which would give power to the harbour board to acquire the quay and premises, if they think it necessary to do so in the future.  We hope it will not be necessary, as we hope the B. and I. will develop trade, now that the war is over, and now that there is no excuse for not doing so.  We hope the trade will be to such an extent that there will be no reason to put this amendment, if accepted, into operation.  We feel we should have the power, though we do not want to use it without paying fair compensation to the B. and I. for any loss they may sustain as a result of the acquisition of the quay and premises at present occupied by them.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I ask the Minister to <Col N="237" /> accept this amendment.  We think it will be in the best interests of the people and of the town of Dundalk and the surrounding districts.  The Minister is aware that already, under the Dundalk Harbour and Port Act, the board acquired the quays of the various coal owners who, before that, owned those quays, and that all the berthage and quays in the docks under that Act were in the sole power and ownership of the Dundalk Harbour Board, with the exception of the Dundalk and Newry Steampacket quay.  Now that there is no provision in this Bill to make the situation clear as to what the future may hold out, especially in regard to the Dundalk and Newry Steampacket quay, I thought it advisable to propose this amendment for insertion in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is really necessary, if I understand the Deputy's purpose rightly.  Under Section 126, which provides for harbour works Orders, the Dundalk Board could apply for a harbour works Order, empowering them to acquire this steampacket quay compulsorily.  If they got such an Order and did acquire the quay compulsorily, the compensation would be fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  The Minister may authorise a harbour authority to acquire compulsorily any land in the vicinity of the harbour.  If such an Order is made, this harbour authority will have power to acquire this quay compulsorily, subject to the payment of compensation. It, of course, would be their obligation under that agreement, to pay compensation, to be fixed by agreement, or in default to be determined by arbitration under the same Act.</P>

      <P>In any event, it seems to me to be the proper procedure to adopt.  The Deputy left out one important fact in his account of the history of this quay.  The Act of 1925 provided that the harbour board could not take over the steampacket quay without the consent in writing of the Dundalk and Newry Steampacket Company. <Col N="238" /> It put that limitation on the powers of the harbour board.  Neither could the shipping company sell the quay without offering it first to the harbour board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact the Deputy left out was that, when the steampacket company transferred the quay to the B. and I, the harbour board were a party to the deed of conveyance, and they admitted in that deed of conveyance that they were given the option to purchase the quay and failed to exercise it.  The new arrangement means that the harbour board stands in relation to the B. and I. in precisely the same position as it stood in relation to the Dundalk and Newry Steampacket Company, that is to say, the board cannot acquire the quay without the consent of the company, and the company cannot dispose of the quay without offering it first to the harbour board.  That is the position as it stands at the moment.  I do not think they could set that aside, as the harbour board were a party to the agreement, and failed to exercise their option when it was open to them to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that, at the moment, they would not want the quay, unless there was some other company prepared to use it, in which case it would seem reasonable to apply for a harbour works Order.  That is the type of thing which this Bill is designed to facilitate, namely, the prevention of any people having exclusive rights to property in the vicinity of a harbour which they can hold to the detriment of other parties unreasonably. All the powers of this Bill are designed to ensure that everybody will have the same facilities in a harbour and anybody who gets an exclusive right can hold it only so long as it is reasonable to hold it.  An aggrieved party can appeal to the Minister and, if there is reason in the complaint, the Minister can make an Order adjusting the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any time a harbour authority can get powers of compulsory acquisition over any land within the limits of the <Col N="239" /> harbour and, if the circumstances appear to be such as to justify action by the Dundalk Harbour Board, they can apply for a harbour works Order involving such compulsory acquisition. Such an Order would be made in circumstances in which it was obvious that ownership by the British and Irish Steampacket Company was holding up the development of the port or depriving other people from availing of facilities to which they would be entitled.</P>

      <P>The reason I put down the amendment was to have an explanation from the Minister in regard to this whole matter.  We were not quite sure of the position.  The members of the harbour board were not quite sure whether they would have that power under the Bill.  It is for that reason I put down the amendment. I might say that I am quite aware of the agreement that was reached at that period between the Dundalk and Newry Steam Packet Company and the B. and I.  I do not want to enter into too many details, because it might weary the House.</P>
      <P>This Order may never be asked for. It will all depend upon what use will be made of the quay, the berth and the premises by the B. and I. in time to come.  I and the people I represent do not ask for the impossible.  As I stated at a meeting of the chamber of commerce, shipping companies cannot run vessels for nothing, for the mere fun of running them, and it will be up to the traders in the district and to all concerned to help in every way possible to have these services restored and give the company all the trade they can deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suspicion arose in the minds of people there, and in Drogheda as well, that the B. and I. were trying to have <Col N="240" /> all their trade carried through the Port of Dublin and other places, to the detriment of the smaller ports.  We are merely fighting for our existence and we do not want to let that happen if it is possible to prevent it.  I am glad the Minister has made the matter clear, that harbour boards throughout the country will have the power, by making application for a harbour works Order, to safeguard their rights. I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position with regard to existing premises which have been provided for the purpose of harbour accommodation.  The people in my area have not been so unfortunate as Dundalk in that respect.  When Deputy Coburn points out the losses that have been sustained through the change of administration here and the creation of industries, and when he mentions that the imports coming through ports and harbours in this country have in some cases ceased, I would like to mention that we have been largely compensated for those losses by the establishment of industries in different parts of the country. I say that those have compensated us in a large measure.  We have our boot and shoe factories, our cement and clothing factories, and I suggest that these give much more employment than ever the harbour boards gave at any period in their history.  I am quite satisfied about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a situation in Drogheda somewhat analogous to the position of the Dundalk Harbour Board.  We were never so foolish as to part with any of our river frontage, but the Drogheda Steam Packet Company disposed of their interest in lairages.  These lairages are away from the waterfront and they were sold to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company.  Subsequently they went to the London, Midland and Scottish Company and finally they came into the hands of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company. Those people are not utilising the lairages but they turned the key in the door and no one else can have them.  We canvassed other shipping companies to give us an alternative <Col N="241" /> service.  Of course, the ring was pretty close, except in one direction, but the difficulty confronting us was that we had not lairages to offer to a new company that might come in if we could offer them such accommodation.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should give us power to enable us to decide whether a shipping company is properly utilising the lairages and other accommodation and, if not, we should have the right to acquire such accommodation from them and make it available to other shipping companies.  We have not parted with our rights so far as shed accommodation is concerned.  Our predecessors made sure to maintain that on a yearly lease and we can dispose of existing interests at six months' notice.  But the position is different with regard to the lairages and I would like the Minister to say now whether we could assert our rights if we felt that the British and Irish Steam Packet Company was not prepared to utilise the existing accommodation and give us a proper service. I charge them with not giving us the service to which we are entitled.  I charge the British and Irish Steam Packet Company with deliberately diverting the cattle traffic to the Port of Dublin rather than through its natural port.  That is all I have to ask the Minister with regard to this matter.  I would like him to clarify the position as to whether we have the right to purchase these things compulsorily.</P>

      <P>Before Section 79 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) A harbour authority may make in respect of goods, being goods which they permit to remain on any quay or other place within the limits of their harbour after the expiration of the time for removal of the goods specified in the by-laws of the harbour authority, charges on the owner of the goods in accordance with such scale of charges as from time to time they may fix with the consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>(2) Where a harbour authority were, immediately before the passing of this Act, making charges authorised by law in respect of goods permitted by them to remain on any quay or other place within the limits of their harbour after the expiration of the time for removal of the goods specified in the by-laws of the harbour authority, such charges shall be regarded for the purposes of sub-section (1) of this section as having been duly fixed under that sub-section.</P>
      <P>This is a redraft of Section 79.  A harbour authority may make by-laws fixing the time during which goods may remain on the quay after landing or before shipment.

      <P>I think a provision of this kind would be very dangerous.  In any event it would be very difficult to draft a form of words to meet it.  The suggestion would appear to be that where a harbour authority, in order to preserve perishable goods does some service in relation to the goods without the knowledge of the owner, it can not only charge the owner the cost, but it can attach that charge to the goods.  I think it would be unwise to adopt that provision which could, apart from the difficulty of drafting a sub-section to achieve that precise purpose, be a rather dangerous sort of precedent to establish.  I do not think that harbour authorities have, in fact, experienced difficulty in securing payment of such services from an owner where the services resulted in the preservation of the goods.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board has not this power under any of the existing Acts, and I do not think it is a power it should have.</P>

    <P>As the section stood the revenue of a harbour could be used for, amongst other purposes, the payment of pensions and gratuities to officers and servants of a harbour board.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners pointed out that they are authorised under the Cork Harbour Act of 1903 to grant allowances to widows and children in certain categories, and that the wording of this section, as it stood, would appear to deprive them of their power.  Consequently, I am proposing to change the wording so as to authorise the use of the harbour revenues for the payment of any pensions or gratuities payable by the harbour authority.  This change will also meet representations which were made by the Dublin Port and Docks Board to pay pensions and gratuities to widows and families under their Act of 1902.</P>

I mention that because the power of the board to do so is likely to be repealed under Section 177.  The Minister, if he refers to the Schedule which covers the Act of 1902, will see that it seeks to repeal that Act.</P>

The county council may pass it and send it on to the Minister for Local Government who may hold it up, under this Bill, for six months.  As I pointed out, at the end of that period the harbour board may have to look for an extra grant owing to the wastage caused by the unnecessary delay.  I suggest that three months should be sufficient for all parties.</P>

      <P>The procedure is that if the harbour board applies to the local authority for assistance, and the local authority passes a resolution deciding to give that assistance at the expense of the ratepayers to the harbour board, it must publish that resolution and then wait at least 60 days before confirming that decision by another resolution. The intention is that any of the ratepayers who may object to the local authority using their money for this purpose will have ample opportunity of making their objection known and, therefore, the local authority must make its decision in two stages: a resolution deciding to give the assistance, publication of the resolution and a confirming resolution not earlier than 60 days, that is, two months later.  If it confirms its resolution after 60 days then, subject to the consent of the Minister for Local Government, the assistance is given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the outside limit, but at present the procedure is to publish the fact that a motion is going to <Col N="256" /> be moved.  The council must give 15 days' notice and at the following county council meeting it will be discussed.  There will be six weeks' notice already given to the ratepayers, and anyone who may object can do so. The representatives of the ratepayers are there and, if they decide by a majority, then it is entirely a matter for the Minister for Local Government to approve of their decision or not.  It is not the same as a public inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see where the question of urgency comes in.  We are dealing here with a larger type of harbour works, where a loan has to be raised to carry out a scheme, on the preparation of which engineers, architects and other experts have to be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that all that would be arranged before they look for the loan.  I am more concerned with the small harbours that are trying to exist at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest they would not have it all arranged before looking for a loan.  It would be bad business to employ engineers to prepare schemes without knowing whether or not they have money to pay for it.  It seems to me that the first step of a harbour authority where assistance from a local authority was required would be to go to the authority and say: &ldquo;How much are you prepared to back if we spend £50,000 or £100,000 on the harbour?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the case of the Galway Harbour scheme, which took a long time and a great deal of negotiation between the harbour authority and the various local authorities, the Galway Corporation, the Galway County Council, the Mayo County Council, the Roscommon County Council, before they could get a scheme of financing their development.  Eventually, they got assistance from the Galway Corporation and the Galway County Council only, and their development scheme had to be based on the amount they could afford to raise, knowing what the local authorities were prepared to guarantee and what the harbour revenue would support.  Then they determined on the amount of the loan <Col N="257" /> they were going to float.  That seems to me to be a procedure which permits of time being available to enable the local authority to make up its mind, knowing all the facts, whether it is prepared to enter into very definite commitments on behalf of the ratepayers or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience is that the local authority will always demand to know what it is going to cost.  They are not going to take a layman's opinion, so that they must have engineers in advance to give the approximate cost of the repairs to enable the members to put down a motion to raise £1,000 or £2,000, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be much more. The Deputy is thinking of a small loan such as the Wicklow Harbour might require to meet a purely emergency problem.  What is involved in this is something like the Galway harbour undertaking, involving an expenditure of £250,000 and a charge of 1/- in the £ on the rates in Galway City.  In such a case the Deputy will agree that the ratepayers should be given ample notice of what was intended, and the opportunity of voicing any objection they saw.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not find any of the public representatives over anxious to grant loans, but, where you have a council unanimously agreed, I say six months is too long in a case of emergency, because the original amount might be increased by a couple of hundred pounds or more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is dealing with the case of an emergency.  There is at present some system under which a harbour authority, which has exhausted its resources, can get a Government grant on condition that the local authority puts up a similar <Col N="258" /> amount.  That is not to meet development work such as is contemplated here, but the cost of essential maintenance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one injustice which appears to me to be evident in this section.  I understand that a number of local authorities can join in guaranteeing a loan.  But, suppose that two local authorities are benefiting by some work and one of them agrees to guarantee and the other refuses; there would seem to be an injustice there, inasmuch as one would be bearing the entire responsibility, whereas the other, which would be also getting the benefit, would be avoiding all cost.  I can see a danger of disputes between one county and another and the danger of long delays arising from that.  I was wondering if the Minister could find some way of getting over that difficulty by a joint meeting of the county councils concerned.</P>

      <P>In the case of the Galway Harbour development, which is the only one I can remember where this procedure was followed, the Galway authority thought that they could make a good case for financial help from Roscommon and Mayo on the ground that the Galway harbour served a wider area than Galway City and County and that improvement of the facilities in the harbour would benefit Roscommon and Mayo.  They did not succeed in persuading the county councils of Roscommon and Mayo that the benefit would be of such dimensions that the ratepayers of these areas should guarantee a portion of the loan or meet any of the interest charges.  There was a great deal of negotiation and argument before they accepted that situation and proceeded with the development <Col N="259" /> scheme with help given by Galway County and City only.</P>

      <P>Surely Deputy Everett must be aware that any improvement carried out in a harbour will have to be a long-term policy, so that the question of six months does not arise.  No scheme for the development of a harbour could be completed in six months.  It would take six months to prepare the plans and specifications. No maritime county in this country will object to maintaining and improving its harbours.  I have no doubt that any application which comes before a county council will be met pretty readily.  I suggested some time ago that the Meath County Council should make some contribution in connection with the Boyne.  I think the Minister should do something about that Deputy Giles opposed that at the Meath County Council; yet he tabled an amendment to this Bill asking for representation.</P>

      <P>Under the section as drafted, the Minister could, on his own initiative, make a harbour works Order transferring to a harbour authority a specified port or pier.  Application would require to be made by the harbour authority and, under Section 130, the harbour authority would also be required to pay a fee.  It is possible that a harbour authority might be willing to take over some small port or pier provided they were not required to pay a fee or do it on their own initiative, and this amendment is intended to deal with that possibility, where the harbour authority will be willing to do it if they are asked, provided they do not have to pay a fee or make application.  In other circumstances, the thing could not be done at all unless the harbour authority applied and agreed to pay the fee.</P>

    <P>(c) transfers to a local authority a part of the harbour of a harbour authority, being a part as respects which the Minister is of opinion, and so states in the Order, that, by <Col N="261" /> reason of its extent, it ought not to be transferred without the sanction of the Oireachtas, or</P>
    <P>(d) transfers to a harbour authority a specified port or pier, or</P>
    <P>This amendment could be described as the reverse of the previous amendment. The Cork Harbour Commissioners suggested that a small part of a harbour might be transferred to a local authority and that it would seem unnecessary that the Order giving effect to such transfer would require to be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. I propose to change the wording of clause (c) so as to give a certain amount of discretion to the Minister; in other words, to enable him to authorise the transfer to a local authority of a small part of a harbour without the necessity for introducing confirming legislation, where he is of opinion that, owing to its extent, confirming legislation is not required.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 127:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 136, but in Part IX, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Subject to the provisions of the next succeeding sub-section of this section, a person shall be disqualified for being elected or chosen or appointed or being a member of a harbour authority if he is concerned by himself or his partner in any bargain or contract entered into with such harbour authority, or participates <Col N="263" /> by himself or his partner in the profit of any such bargain or contract.</P>
    <P>(2) A person shall not be disqualified for being elected or chosen or appointed or being a member of a harbour authority by reason merely of being concerned by himself or his partner&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) in the sale or lease of any land to such harbour authority, or</P>
    <P>(b) in any contract with such harbour authority for the supply from land of which he is owner or occupier of stone, gravel or other similar materials, or</P>
    <P>(c) in any newspaper in which any advertisement relating to the affairs of such harbour authority is inserted, or</P>
    <P>(d) in any contract with such harbour authority as a shareholder in any joint stock company.</P>
    <P>(3) The provisions of this section shall apply and have effect in relation to any committee appointed by a harbour authority in the same manner and to the same extent as if such committee were, in fact, the harbour authority.</P>
    <P>(4) If any person acts, when disqualified, as a member of a harbour authority or on a committee of such authority in contravention of this section, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £20 in respect of each contravention of this section without prejudice to the disqualification as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>This clause is taken, with some slight modifications, from the Application of Enactments Order, 1899, relating to local government.  The Minister, of course, is aware that these restrictions lapsed under the County Management Act, 1940, apparently the view being taken that, since local authorities had no longer the same control over contracts, these restrictions were not necessary.  Here, of course, in the case of the harbour authority, the position is the reverse of what is now obtaining so far as local authorities are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> While not very much tying myself to the actual wording of this particular amendment, I introduce it mainly as a question of general principle, to ensure that certain standards of conduct shall apply to the individual members who constitute the board.  I am not tied to the wording, but seek an expression of opinion on the desirability of introducing a section of this character.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the advisability of having a section of that type in the Bill when it was being framed, but I came to the conclusion that it would have the effect of practically excluding shipping interests from membership of a harbour board.  It seems to me almost certain that shipping members must have contracts and other business arrangements with the harbour authority and it is precisely because they have these business arrangements and contracts with the harbour authorities that they are given special representation upon harbour boards.  Whatever may be the general grounds for a section of this kind, I think that in relation to harbour boards it is impracticable.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may suggest &mdash; and I thought of the idea &mdash; excluding the elected members from its scope; but, as I mentioned earlier, it is not intended that shipping interests should be only elected representatives.  We have the local authority nomination, the chamber of commerce nomination and the Minister's nomination.  In fact, any of these bodies would certainly appoint some persons associated with shipping on a harbour board, if they thought such interests required additional representation.  I thought it would be undesirable to exclude from harbour boards persons who had got these shipping interests merely because their shipping inevitably brought them into a situation in which they had contracts and business arrangements with the harbour authorities.  In fact, in some of the smaller harbours, the only people who take a really live interest are the people who have contacts with the harbour.</P>

The employees of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, other than the officers appointed prior to 1940, who have statutory rights have, however, been granted pensions on a liberal scale, including provision for widows and dependents, under the permissive provisions of the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1902.

    <P>This amendment arises from representations made by the Officers' Association of the Dublin Ports and Docks Board, who pointed out that officers who entered the service of the board since the passing of the Act of 1940 would be placed at a disadvantage, as they have no statutory right to pensions and would have no option but to enter the new scheme.

Section 26 says that &ldquo;if a person knowingly acts as a member of a harbour authority when disqualified from being such a member he shall be guilty of an offence... and shall be liable... to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds&rdquo;.  Section 163 would prevent him from taking an appointment on a harbour authority for ten years, even though his chamber of commerce or local authority might think he was a most desirable person for the position.</P>

      <P>It seems to me an extraordinary thing.  A person acting in that capacity, when disqualified <Col N="270" /> from being a member may not, in individual circumstances, be guilty of such an extraordinarily great crime at all.  At the highest point of criminality the person could not be fined more than £20, and if the harbour authorities are the type of responsible persons that the Minister makes us feel they will be &mdash;with strong Ministerial and local authority representation &mdash; and if they desire to appoint a particular person, even though he was guilty of an offence a few years before that under Section 26, it does seem almost inventing difficulties to have a provision in the Act that a person has to spend ten years after his conviction before he can get employment under a harbour board.  He may be particularly qualified, and the fact that he has particular qualifications might have been the motive that would urge them to act against the law as indicated in Section 26.</P>

      <P>(1) Whenever a proposal made at a meeting of a harbour authority would cause an illegal payment to be made out of the funds of the harbour authority or would be likely to result in a deficiency or loss in or to such funds, it shall be the duty of the secretary (or, where he is not present, of the officer of the harbour authority present on behalf of the secretary) to make objection to the proposal and to state the grounds of the objection.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall that on Second Reading I drew attention to the position of the quay police.  I understand, as a matter of fact, that he has since then received representations from the port authority that the existing arrangements might with advantage be allowed to stand.  The work being carried on there is of a rather specialised character, calling for continuous supervision, and providing, as a result of that supervision, a link up with the officers of the board in the matter of reporting any untoward incidents that might occur in the discharge of their duties.  The change proposed to be made will not give service of the same character because it would not be possible in the ordinary routine of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the added reason that the staff in the Port of Dublin &mdash; a comparatively large staff &mdash; are young, and if they were to be discharged now, despite any compensation paid to them, it would mean unemployment and hardship.  On the merits of the case and on the representations of the port authority itself, whose experience in the matter counts for something, the request is being made that <Col N="274" /> the existing arrangement in the Port of Dublin might be allowed to stand and I suggest the Minister might accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This section does not require the Minister for Justice to make an Order bringing to an end the powers of a harbour authority to maintain harbour police.  It empowers him to do so, and that was the recommendation of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  They recommended that that power of harbour boards should cease, and that the policing of all ports and harbours should be undertaken by the Gárda Síochána.  What we are proposing here is that the power will cease forthwith in the case of harbours where it has not been exercised, but where it has been exercised in Dublin, Galway, Sligo and Westport, the power will continue unless and until the Minister for Justice makes an Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill was originally framed, there was a provision which required a harbour authority to pay to the Minister for Justice the cost of policing a harbour area.  That provision has been deleted, and, in view of its deletion, I think the Deputy may assume that the Minister for Justice will not be too anxious to make this Order in the case of Dublin, where the policing of the harbour area would involve a substantial addition to the personnel and to the cost of the Gárda Síochána.  Different circumstances may prevail in Westport and Sligo, as the Deputy will appreciate.  If an Order is made, there is, of course, provision for compensation for the harbour police who may be disemployed in consequence, and one can conceive circumstances in which the Minister for Justice may be glad to get some of them into the Gárda Síochána because of their specialised training in this work, but that is a matter which the Minister for Justice would have to consider.  I do not know whether the regulations governing recruitment for the Gárda Síochána would require amendment before that could be done, but I think it desirable that we should adopt the recommendation of the tribunal and have this power to bring <Col N="275" /> to an end the right of a harbour board to maintain its own police.</P>
    <P>I certainly think we should end the power where it has not been exercised, and, in places like Dublin and other areas where it has been exercised, we should have power to bring it to an end where the Minister for Justice considers that the wisest course to adopt. The Deputy may be quite certain that the Minister will not make an Order under the section without full consultation with the harbour authorities concerned.</P>

The provision is that when an Order is made the Minister shall make such provision providing for the payment by the harbour authority of compensation to the constables and officers whose services may be dispensed with under the Order and who have not reached the normal age of retirement.  It is wiser to leave the provision as wide as that, rather than to attempt now to frame general provisions.</P>

The Port Board and I would be very sorry to see the existing arrangement in Dublin interfered with, and I am glad to have the Minister's assurance that it will not be lightly interfered with.  The new provision under which the board is let off the obligation to pay might, from the financial point of view, appeal to the board, but I think the whole position with regard to the harbour police is very hard on the men concerned.  They will have this hanging over them for the rest of their existence, or at least until they retire.

      <P>From a purely bureaucratic point of view, it might appear undesirable to have undivided control.  There is the point, however, that the whole work in connection with the ports tends to become specialised. The hours at which the police are there is known to the harbour authorities.  I think you would get more divided control over the board's property if you had an outside body such as the Gárda Síochána.</P>

      <P>The board at any time would be entitled to maintain watchmen over its property for the detection of pilfering and so on.  That is when you talk about harbour police responsibility. In all other cases it has been found desirable to establish a specialised section of the police force so that they could become familiar with the geography of the harbour.  Where the persons concerned are members of the national force their authority extends outside the harbour area even though they may be specially experienced in the problems arising therein.  Harbour police have, of course, a very limited authority.  I think that, in fact, a large part of the harbour area has to be controlled by the Gárda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Before Section 173, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the amount in a sinking fund maintained by the Cork Harbour Commissioners in relation to any mortgages and stock made or issued by them before the passing of this Act equals or exceeds the amount remaining due in respect of the mortgages together with the nominal value of so much of the stock as remains outstanding, any obligation of the commissioners to make further contributions to the sinking fund shall cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork Harbour Acts, which empower the harbour commissioners to borrow money from time to time, require them to pay 1 per cent. on the <Col N="280" /> aggregate sums borrowed into a sinking fund for the purpose of paying off the loans while any part of the sums borrowed remain outstanding.  The harbour commissioners have borrowed £419,000.  An interpretation of the Acts requires them to pay £4,192 annually into the sinking fund while any of the loans remain unpaid.  The commissioners will eventually reach the position that the redeemable stock issued by them and the money borrowed by them on mortgages will be cleared off. They have still outstanding £6,320 worth of irredeemable stock, and they will continue to pay 1 per cent.  On the aggregate sums borrowed into a sinking fund while that irredeemable stock is outstanding, according to their interpretation of the Acts.  They ask, therefore, that provision should be made in the Bill to enable them to discontinue payments into the sinking fund after having cleared off all other sums borrowed.  The amount of the sinking fund would be the equivalent of the nominal value of the irredeemable stock outstanding.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is to ensure that the property of the corporation will not become vested in the State in the way that the section says. Certain valuable properties along the quays have been in the possession of the corporation for a long number of years.  I would like to remind the Minister that, on the North Quays, a valuable strip of property will be falling in a comparatively short period to the corporation.

    <P>Amendment No. 155 and amendment No. 155a seek to get some recognition for the harbour running from Bantry to Berehaven, the harbour of Bantry Bay, and it has been suggested that the Minister might extend the scope of the Bill to cover both places. It has been suggested, and it seems to me a reasonable proposal, that the Minister should agree to have the local authority, being the county council and the town commissioners in the case of Bantry, and in the case of Berehaven, the county council and the local development association, which would be the local chamber of commerce in Castletownbere, the representatives of the business community in the place, as the harbour authority. I should like to get from the Minister whether there is any hope that he would favourably entertain the proposals, partially or wholly, and whether in the event of his not being able to do it now, he would, having regard to the general authority that is afforded him in the measure, be in a position to give the matter further consideration later.  If that were the case I would not unduly obtrude myself on the Minister now, but I should like to get some word of recognition for an area that I regard as very important, as there is a good deal of surprise that some provision is not being made for it in this measure.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  The general <Col N="286" /> scheme is that we should have these four main harbours with authorities constituted as proposed here, a number of secondary harbours with authorities constituted as proposed here, and other harbours managed by the county councils where the harbour revenue is so small that it could not support a harbour board and the administrative apparatus which a harbour board should have.  The view of the Harbour Tribunal was that they should be managed by the county councils. If at any time their trade develops to the point at which they could claim to be included in the list of Class II harbours, there is provision in the Bill under which they can be so elevated and an Order made giving the harbour board the authority which any harbour board under this Bill will have.  But at present there is, as far as I know, only negligible revenue from the use of these harbours and certainly revenue altogether insufficient to meet the expenses which would fall upon the harbour authority of these harbours if constituted.  Therefore, the management of them for the time being rests upon the county council.  If they develop, then, on application at any time, they can be elevated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The extent and complexity of the Irish Land Purchase code make me reluctant to make yet another addition to it but the introduction of a new Land Bill is a prime necessity if the Land Commission are to have the authority which is necessary to enforce the carrying out in practice of the policy of land settlement. Experience is perhaps the only method of bringing to light certain defects in the code and this short Bill is intended mainly to close certain loopholes which have afforded opportunity for evasion by allottees of their undertakings to the Land Commission in regard to the use of their parcels of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question is the matter of residence by allottees in the houses provided for them by the Land Commission. It is very important that houses built at considerable expense <Col N="291" /> out of State funds should not be allowed to remain unoccupied or should not be sublet by the allottees. This matter was dealt with in Section 19 of the Land Act, 1939, which purported to give the Land Commission sufficient powers to enforce residence, but they have been advised that an allottee who has been called on, under that section, to take up residence within three months (or such longer period as might be allowed him) and who has actually gone into residence following that notice may subsequently cease to reside in the house, leaving it empty, and the Land Commission have no further legal power to interfere with him.  Allottees have also discovered another means of evasion, that of a pretence of residence.  They instal a few items of furniture, perhaps sleep occasionally in the house, but really live in their old homes. There is no guarantee that residence of this nature might not be held to constitute legal residence.  It is therefore proposed to repeal Section 19 of the Land Act, 1939, as inadequate, and have it replaced by Clause 2 of this Bill.  It would be very difficult to persuade me that it is a hardship on any allottee to compel him to take up residence in a house that has been constructed for him and I feel that the Dáil will support the view that the Land Commission should have the power to say, in effect, to an absentee allottee: &ldquo;Get in or get out!&rdquo; and that an allottee's residence should be to the satisfaction of the Land Commission which has provided him with his house and holding.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the matter of the proper use by allottees of their parcels of land &mdash; a matter of vital national interest. It was thought that previous legislation had sufficiently empowered the Land Commission to enforce continued ownership or occupation and good husbandry.  The purchase agreements signed by allottees contained clauses providing negatively against selling, alienating, subletting or parting with the possession of their parcels prior to vesting, and positively for the working of the land to the satisfaction of the Land Commission.  In case of any default by the allottee in complying <Col N="292" /> with those conditions the Land Commission reserved the right to recover possession of the parcels.  Some recent High Court decisions, however, have declared that lettings of parcels by allottees for grazing or in conacre did not necessarily constitute breaches of the condition in the purchase agreements that the parcels should be worked in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, with the result that allottees unsatisfactory in this respect could not be dispossessed.  The policy of land division never envisaged a mere changeover from big landlordism to little landlordism, but was intended to put genuine working small farmers on the land.  Clause 3 of the present Bill is devised to prevent subletting of parcels and Clause 4 to prevent bad husbandry.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is the matter of the devolution of parcels on the death of allottees.  Clause 5 is concerned with this subject and is intended to remove a doubt which the lawyers believe to exist in connection with the devolution of certain parcels of land allotted by the Land Commission.  The doubt exists only in regard to parcels which, at the date of allotment, were not registered in the Land Registry and, therefore, not subject to the provisions of Part IV of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, regarding devolution.</P>
    <P>The position is that, after vesting, all parcels, and before vesting, those parcels which, at the time of allotment, are subject to the provisions of Part IV of the 1891 Act, devolve, as it is technically termed, as chattels real, i.e., they pass, on the allottee's death, to his personal representative for, broadly speaking, the benefit of the next of kin if the allottee died intestate, or for the benefit of the devisee if the allottee died testate.  Clause 5 is designed to ensure that the remaining parcels (i.e. those not subject to Part IV at the time of allotment) shall devolve in the same way.  The Land Commission have, in fact, generally regarded these parcels as so devolving.  Section 32 (4) of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1896, was enacted to rectify an anomaly of an analogous nature in relation to purchasing tenants.</P>
    <P>The clause will ensure that the Land <Col N="293" /> Commission are satisfied as to their powers to appoint limited administrators in respect of all classes of deceased purchasers and to deal with such administrators as entitled to the interest of the deceased purchasers and to vest the parcels in such administrators.  As very many parcels have been vested in personal representatives, the clause has been made retrospective for the validation of such of those vestings as would come within the doubtful category mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fourthly, there is the matter of consolidation, i.e., the amalgamation of a parcel with an existing holding for the enlargement of which it has been allotted so as to form a single economic unit.  The whole object of the allotment is nullified if the allottee is free to dispose of either his parcel or his holding before they are consolidated.  Such a separate alienation is prohibited, except with the consent of the Land Commission, by Clause 6 of the Bill, and the prohibition applies to parcels allotted before or after the passing of the Land Act 1939.  This Clause supersedes Section 23 of the 1939 Act, which was intended to effect the same result, but has been found not to be retrospective.</P>
      <P>Clause 7 is complementary to Clause 6, being intended to ensure that, without the consent of the Land Commission, a parcel given as an enlargement to a holding should not be estranged therefrom by passing to a different person on the death of the original allottee.  It is proposed that the parcel must go to the successor to the holding.</P>

    <P>The Bill is largely an amending Bill and does not introduce new principles. The powers it confers on the Land Commission are complementary rather <Col N="294" /> than fresh.  It should assist in the expedition and improvement of the existing policy of land settlement.</P>
    <P>The Dáil may desire to have some idea of the extent to which evasion of their undertakings by unsatisfactory allottees has taken place.  Complete figures are not available, as it has only been possible thus far to investigate a comparatively small number of allotments as to usership, but the &ldquo;cross-section&rdquo; revealed has been sufficiently disquieting to make this Bill an imperative necessity.  Owing to the pressure of land division under the Land Act 1923 and amending Acts, it was not until the year 1938 that the Land Commission found it possible to have special inspections made to ascertain how allottees were using their parcels &mdash; and then the investigation was only partial and occasional.</P>
    <P>Up to the year 1944, over 4,200 allotted parcels had been inspected for usership and it was found that some 200 were badly worked and some 700 sublet in whole or in part &mdash; that is to say, in 21½ per cent. of the parcels investigated the allottees were not then properly fulfilling their obligations.  It was also found that some 820 houses built by the Land Commission for allottees were either unoccupied or sublet to other persons.  Subsequent investigation, however, showed that the warning letters issued by the Land Commission had a salutary effect in a large number of cases and a great improvement was effected.</P>
    <P>In the year 1944 it was decided to set up a special section of the Land Commissions staff to deal with investigation for usership, and since then inspection has proceeded in a more systematic way.  Including some re-inspections in cases already brought to notice by previous investigation, nearly 4,000 holdings and parcels have been inspected for usership during the past year, and of these some 700 were found unsatisfactory &mdash; 17½ per cent.  Sixtynine of some 1,250 houses on holdings covered by this inspection were found to be unoccupied.  Outside this systematic inspection, some 175 additional cases of non-residence and 500 cases of unsatisfactory user have been brought to notice individually, making a total of 1,200 unsatisfactory user and 245 <Col N="295" /> non-residence cases disclosed so far. Appropriate action is being taken by the Land Commission, but pending the enactment of the powers asked for in the new Bill effective steps, other than the issue of warning letters, are not possible in the majority of cases.  As regards action for the termination of agreements with allottees, some 90 notices of termination have been issued during the past year, and possession has already been obtained in 42 of these cases, covering an area of 473 acres.  The enactment of the present Bill will enable the Land Commission to proceed with vigour in compelling allottees to fulfil their obligations. That is not to say, however, that there will be any harshness.  The Land Commission are prepared to give special consideration to cases where there are mitigating circumstances and have, in fact, done so in many instances. The object is not so much to punish as to reform, but Deputies will agree that the Land Commission should have adequate punitive measures over the &ldquo;incorrigibles&rdquo;. The Bill is very necessary and fills such a want on the part of the Land Commission that I have no hesitation in recommending it to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is very regrettable that it should be considered necessary to introduce a measure of this sort, because it goes a long way, in a very positive way, further to undermine the fundamental rights of the individual tenant, particularly the right of ownership &mdash; and that is a very important matter.  We are travelling a bit further on the road to regimentation in this country.  I do not subscribe to the dictum of the Minister that the Land Commission should have power to say to an individual holder: &ldquo;Get in or get out&rdquo;.  We do not want bureaucratic control to that extent. Control placed in the hand of the bureaucrat is dangerous and is always open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel the whole Bill is a reflection on the work of the Land Commission.  I do not blame the inspectorial staff of the Land Commission so much for that as I do the policy forced on the Land Commission by the present Government. <Col N="296" /> If the work of selection was properly carried out, there would be no necessity for a Bill of this sort.  The prospective tenants were selected not for economic or social reasons, but for political reasons, and this is the result of the type of policy which has been in operation for 12 or 14 years.</P>
    <P>In the early life of the Fianna Fáil Government we heard a lot about providing land for landless men.  I think, under the present Minister, we are inclined to depart to a great extent from that policy, but still we hear a lot about land and we note the promises made in that connection by spokesmen of the Fianna Fáil Party when they are addressing their supporters all over the country.  Even as late as last Sunday the Minister for Justice, addressing his constituents in Roscommon, said that land division was still a burning question. He put it this way, that &ldquo;he was coming to the burning question of land division&rdquo;.  That speech was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> last Monday.  The Minister said, in the same speech that four inspectors were now allotted to Roscommon, and he finished by saying: &ldquo;There is no county that did better in way of land division than Roscommon, and I would like that to be borne in mind by members of our organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel that that is an inducement to every type of supporter of the Fianna Fáil organisation to come in and get his name down for land, irrespective of whether he is qualified in any way to work land.  It is inevitable, if an estate is acquired by the Land Commission for division purposes, that his name will be submitted from the local Fianna Fáil club.  I am sorry to say that such lists as are submitted by the Fianna Fáil clubs are permitted to dominate the selections made and the result of that type of procedure was clearly illustrated in the House by the Minister when he read the list of inspections made and the high percentage of failures shown by these inspections.  He indicated that out of 4,200 inspections there were 200 holdings badly worked, 700 sub-let in part or in whole, and 820 houses unoccupied. Surely that is a very sad commentary on the work of a Department charged with the responsibility of selecting men qualified to occupy land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> This whole policy of land division is costing the State a considerable sum, and surely there is responsibility on the Minister and his Department to carry out a preliminary examination of prospective tenants so as to ensure that they have the capacity to work the land that is about to be given them as a gift from the State &mdash; land which men are expected to use in the interests of themselves and their families. Quite a lot of the tenants were selected on the political ticket, and they never had any intention of working the land. Their intention was to set it and cash in on it as quickly as they could.  I know of cases in North Kildare, not small allotments, but very big parcels of land, that were allotted to the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, and they were allowed to cash in on their holdings to the tune of over £3,000 per allottee in certain cases.  I addressed questions to the Ministry on the subject recently.  I made a few cases the subject of Parliamentary questions.  I say it is a shocking state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Now, in order to remedy that condition of things, that inept administration of a Department which has pursued a policy dictated by a political Minister who is interested in allotting land for political purposes, this Bill is introduced.  We have this sad story of the work over a long period of years, and then we have this type of bureaucratic control denying the individual any right of appeal.  A civil servant will be sent down to find out whether a man is carrying on a good system of husbandry or not.  The civil servant will be the judge and jury as to whether an individual is to be &ldquo;hoofed out&rdquo; or not.  That is the type of legislation the Minister says he has no hesitation in asking this House to support.</P>
    <P>I would, without any hesitation, vote against the Bill but for this fact, that there is a big problem there so far as a number of people are concerned and there is a good deal of Land not being properly worked.  The land is abused as conacre year after year.  Its fertility is being affected, with the result that if this situation continues it will be worthless.  Some drastic action will have to be taken.</P>
    <P>The whole idea embodied in the Bill is repugnant to me.  The problem has <Col N="298" /> been created by the political policy of the Government.  The rights of individuals under the Department have been flagrantly ignored.  They were promised certain things and these promises have not been fulfilled.  Quite a number of them, working in a legitimate way, were expecting to be vested six or seven years ago after receiving the land, but there is no sign yet of the holdings being vested.  Now, because of the failure to vest the land in the holders and the failure to carry out promises made at the time of the division, every individual who occupies an allotment will be at the mercy of the Minister under the administration of this measure.  Civil servants will be sent down to decide whether or not an individual is working his land properly. If some of the conditions set out in the Bill were embodied in the purchase terms there might be some justification for such a harsh piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>However, as I said, the position is so bad that some drastic action will have to be taken, and I suppose that, with the greatest reluctance, we shall have to consent to give the Minister power to deal with these cases of people who never intended to use the gift given to them in the way of an allotment.  The majority of the people who, the Minister says, failed to comply with the conditions never intended to comply with them and some were not suitable, in the first instance.  They had not got the equipment; they had not the means; they were landless men who could never hope to make good. They were selected for one reason and for one reason only.</P>
    <P>The whole system of selection is wrong.  The idea of sending inspectors around from one neighbour to another to ask Mick Murphy how John Doyle will work his land, and whether, if he got an allotment, he would work it properly, was an inducement to people to tell lies about their neighbours, because naturally a man who is asked these questions is afraid that, if he praises his neighbour and says he will be an ideal tenant, there may not be enough land for him, so that he will blackguard his neighbours.  The whole method of sending an inspector to live in a locality for a few months, to poke around the locality and to find out in <Col N="299" /> a secretive way, by secret service methods, the right type of tenant is all wrong.  If the Minister intends to face up to the realities of the situation, he ought to overhaul the whole system of making selections and ascertaining the suitability of prospective tenants.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that if, in the post-war period, we are to have land division, we will forget political angles and get down to the social and economic angle and give land to people who are entitled to it, that we will cut out all this nonsense about landless men and will face up to the problems which exist and try to solve them.  I hope that when Ministers in future go down the country they will not try this political stuff which I have read out and which occurred last Sunday &mdash; this stimulating of political support by appealing to the greed of the people for land by suggesting that here is a grand opportunity for them to cash in on something with which the State can provide them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will face up to the realities of the situation and to the responsibilities placed on him and that when he gets these extraordinary powers which he is seeking they will not be abused.  In addition to asking for these powers, he asks us to agree to paragraph (b) (ii) of Section 2 which sets out that the Land Commission may at any time revoke any direction given to a purchaser under the section. I hope that sub-paragraph will not be abused to permit certain individuals who have not fulfilled their obligations to continue to occupy land.  I hope the Minister will make a resolution honestly to face up to his responsibilities in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that there is any need for this Bill.  There is only one section in it with which I would not find fault, that is, the section which makes inoperative any clause in a will which seeks to bequeath a portion of an allotment of land on death or subdividing a holding, thereby undoing the work of the Land Commission.  We knew that a Land Bill of some kind was to come before us for quite a while, but we thought it would deal with <Col N="300" /> different problems altogether.  We find now that the Minister is seeking power which, so far as I can see, the Land Commission already has under various previous enactments.  A clause is slipped into the Bill about bad husbandry and they take it upon themselves to define what is bad husbandry. I tell the Minister and the House that too many sacrifices have been made in the past for the land of this country to allow anybody to come in to a farmer and tell him that he is working his farm well or badly.  That is one step we will not stand over or allow.  We know quite well that it is deplorable that a farmer should not work his land in a good fashion, but it is still worse to put it into the power of any official to dictate to a farmer and to tell him that he is running his farm well or badly.</P>
      <P>I should like to see every acre of the country being worked for all it is worth, and we know that in many cases there are holdings that are not being worked for all they are worth, in some cases through sheer idleness and sheer laziness on the part of the holders.  I do not want to see that, but the way it is sought to remedy that position in the Bill is not the right way.  To the end of time we will have people owning not only land but businesses who will not run them properly and we will have paid officials not doing their duty and acting as the bad or the slack farmer acts, that is, not doing his best for the country; but we will not allow anybody to tell a farmer that he must get out because he is not running his farm properly because that is taking a step which suggests we are inclining gradually towards the policy of a certain country in Europe.  When we give into the hands of an official the power to tell a farmer to get out because he is not working his farm properly, we are reaching a dangerous point, and I tell the Minister that that is one thing we will not stand for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully realise that there are many people in the country in a desperate plight for want of land to work.  The Minister gave a list of holdings given by the Land Commission over a number of years past which have not been properly worked.  I challenge him to <Col N="301" /> produce 15 or 20 cases in the whole of my county of the kind he has described.  I think he gave the number of 820 unoccupied houses.  I wish he would give the figures for the various counties and tell us what happened. In the very recent past, men were brought up from particular counties and put into holdings at the expense of the State &mdash; men who could not reasonably be expected to know how to work that land for all it was worth.</P>
    <P>What I should like to see done in regard to migration is people brought from very bad areas and put on fairly good land, and the people on those lands put on better land, because you cannot give a man who has perhaps made a living at fishing, or who is perhaps a carpenter or other kind of tradesman, 20 or 30 or 40 acres of the very best land in Meath and ask him to make as much use of it as a man who had previous experience of fairly good land would make.  That is the cause of the Minister's trouble.</P>
    <P>I thought that when this Bill came along it would be a Bill to help the Land Commission, to help to straighten out difficulties, to settle the land question once and for all, particularly along the west coast where there is trouble. With regard to the section which empowers an official to walk in and say to a farmer that his land is not being well worked, the first holder of land in the country against whom it would be operated is the Land Commission which has in its possession for 15, 25 and 30 years, holdings in my county which were taken over in fairly good order, which were perfectly free and good arable land.  At present they remind one of what one sees on the cinema &mdash; pictures of the bush in Africa or Australia &mdash; absolutely overrun.  That land has been deliberately held and not divided for any reason that I can see. If I go into the Land Commission about it, or put down a question in the Dáil, I will be told that they are waiting to acquire other land alongside it before proceeding with its division.  By the time some of the farms acquired by the Land Commission are divided, no one will take them because they are <Col N="302" /> absolutely worth nothing.  It will take from £25 to £35 per statute acre to clear the scrub and the bushes that have grown on them since the Land Commission became the owners.  This section speaks about bad husbandry, but if there was a complete and full examination made it is to the Land Commission itself that that description should be applied.  I have spoken in the House again and again of the desperate situation in which many small holders in the West find themselves. I know quite well that the Land Commission have great difficulties to contend with, and that they have their own troubles.  This Bill, in my opinion, is not going to remedy anything.  If the Minister's figures are correct, there must have been great laxity on the part of the Land Commission in the past, or else deliberate mismanagement.  We are now told that 820 houses are unoccupied. Surely, that is not due to the fact that those people got bad health or that something happened to their mental system.  It must be that they should never have got holdings, or that the system of selection of migrants is altogether wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes spoke of the system of giving holdings of land to supporters of the Government Party, in recompense, I presume, for services rendered to the Party.  That may or may not be so.  But the Minister's figures show that there must have been great laxity on the part of the Land Commission. A tale of woe of that sort from the Minister does not inspire confidence at this late hour.  If the Bill was introduced with the object of helping the Land Commission to settle the land question once and for all, we would support it.  In my county, for example there will be continual trouble until the valuation of the holdings is brought up to £10 or £12.  There will be grumbling and grousing.  What struck me in connection with the Minister's statement was that there is not unity or harmony amongst the members of the Government themselves on the policy which should be followed in regard to land.  If their statements are not actually contradictory, certainly their different statements would seem not to hang together on one policy, as one would imagine they ought to.  The <Col N="303" /> Land Commission, in my opinion, have failed completely in their jobs as far as the division of land is concerned. They have a huge area of land on their hands in my county, an area which, if distributed, would go a long way to even out things fairly well.</P>
    <P>When the Vote for the Department of Lands was before the House in May or June last year, I suggested a way out to the Minister of settling the land question once and for all.  I suggested to him that, in addition to the annual sum voted for the Department, he should also take the amount of the land annuities for the whole country, and with that sum of money settle the land question once and for all county by county.  He could make a start with the counties that are most in need, with Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo or Sligo, or any other county.  Even if a Government during its term of office were only to settle the question in, say, two counties, well, it would have done good work.  The present policy of the Land Commission is to take over a farm of land and split it up like a patchwork quilt, giving portions of it to people who may live one or two miles away.  That is proving to be more of a nuisance than anything else. While I agree with certain sections of the Bill, I want to warn the Minister that we here will contest strongly other sections of it.  We are not prepared to give the right to any official to go in and say to a man that he is a bad farmer, and that he must get out of his holding of land, simply because he may not be working an acre of that land the right way.  There is the danger, too, that that power might be used in a wrong way for political purposes by the present or some future Government.</P>
    <P>There is the question of giving holdings of land to people and of seeing that they work them properly and of living in the houses.  I am not advocating that the State should give a parcel of land as a free gift to a person, and then allow that person to sit down so that the land will grow nothing but nettles and weeds.  In my opinion the correct solution for that situation is not contained in this Bill.  I would be <Col N="304" /> in favour of giving power to the Land Commission to deal with the odd case where a person takes a holding of land, goes away to England and leaves it unworked.  Under Section 3, the Land Commission are taking power to refuse a person permission to sublet a part of his holding or to take in grazing cattle or set it out in conacre.  What does the Minister mean to do in the case of a migrant, a man with a growing family who has been taken out of a small holding of 5, 6 or 10 acres and given a fairly decent one, and has not the necessary capital to work it?  There is no provision in the Bill to provide the man with the capital which he would require to work that holding.  Bear in mind he is the type of man who deserves help.  If a man of that kind has a few hundred pounds to stock the holding he is all right, but if he has not what is to become of him? Is he expected to live inside the four walls of the house?  He will not be allowed to sublet the land or set it for grazing to enable him to make ends meet.  Is he to be pitched out, and if he is what is to become of him?  Is the policy of the Land Commission going to be this, that it is only farmers with money &mdash; they may not be the right type of men to give holdings to &mdash; who are going to get holdings?</P>
    <P>This Bill, in my opinion, is a huge disappointment.  If the Minister had introduced a Bill which was aimed at getting at the root of the trouble and that would attempt to settle this Land question, we on this side would support it.  There is no need to dwell on the conditions which prevail in my county.  The Minister has already heard enough from me on that since I came into the House.  I have said a good deal from time to time in regard to the various estates in the county. This business of using very drastic measures will never settle the land question.  I think the Land Commission should go ahead with the powers they have already, acquire land and take steps to divide it.  If some of the people who have been offered land will not take it, well there are plenty of others who can be got to take their places.</P>
    <P>All I say is that the most objectionable part of the Bill in my opinion is <Col N="305" /> the power of officials to go in and tell a farmer that he is working the holding in a good, bad or indifferent manner.  I do not stand for that.  That section will never hold.  It is a section that will cause very serious trouble.  It is the thin end of a wedge of a very definite colour that we will never tolerate in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the occasion has arisen for the introduction of this Bill.  I do not agree with all the uproar created by Deputy Hughes about it.  The particular cases covered by this Bill are different from the cases of ordinary farmers.  The persons covered by this Bill are persons who have received from the taxpayers of this State a present worth anything from £300 to £1,000.  Surely if a man gets a present from the State of a farm of land, the State is entitled to expect that that man will live in the house provided for him and will work the farm.  I admit we get bad farmers, just the same as political Parties, like Fine Gael, get bad leaders.  Farms disappear just as Fine Gael disappeared. It cannot be helped.  The first thing stirred up by Deputy Hughes was that there were political appointments and that these people got the land for political reasons.  I do not know how long the tenants concerned have been in occupation of the holdings.  I do not know whether one of those holdings is the holding of the district justice in Tipperary who got a present of 600 acres from Fine Gael, or not.  But I do know that an individual of this State who gets a present from the State of a farm of land and a house, takes that holding over with its obligations, and should carry out those obligations.  We hear all this talk about political influence and the suggestion that because certain people were members of Fianna Fáil they got farms of land.  I remember individuals that I never suggested were appointed for political reasons, who were good friends of the Fine Gael Party, who got land.  One of them got a farm of land on the Barrymore estate. He lived there for seven years.  He had a small holding in Bandon, in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency.  At the end of the period of seven years during which he lived on that holding <Col N="306" /> he owed 6½ years' annuities.  He was evicted.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission had taken over approximately 30 acres of that man's holding in Bandon, for division amongst small holders in the locality. When the man was evicted he went back to the holding.  He got six months in gaol.  It cost £170 to shift him from Bandon to Watergrass Hill. When he came out of gaol the Land Commission made a bargain with him. What was the bargain?  That they would put him back again into the farm in Bandon that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government had taken over seven years before for distribution amongst small holders.  He was put back, at the cost of another £170, by the Land Commission.  There was no political influence at all there. Nobody could touch Deputy Hughes Party in respect of that transaction.</P>
      <P>We will have good farmers and we will have bad farmers just as in any walk of life there will be good workmen and bad workmen.  If individuals take over holdings who are not prepared to do the duty that the State expects from them in respect of those holdings, then the State has every right to resume the holdings.  As Deputy Blowick said, it is not the case of an ordinary tenant.  These are men who have got a present of a livelihood in the shape of landed property. The least that can be expected from them is that they will work the land and live in the houses provided for them.  If they are not inclined to do it they had no business in taking them over.  I have neither sympathy nor mercy for the man who gets a present of a farm from the State and who is not prepared to carry out his obligations to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are on the subject of land, there are other matters that I should like to refer to.  I should like to know from the Minister how it is that the B. &amp; I. were able to buy 700 acres of land in Meath which, as Deputy Blowick said, is wanted for division. I should like to know how it is that the Duke of Westminster or any other alien is able to sail in here, and buy farm after farm amounting to 1,000 acres of land that is wanted for distribution. <Col N="307" /> These are matters we should like the Minister to tell us about.  When the Minister is on the job of resuming holdings I hope to see him taking some steps to have the 700 acres taken from the B. &amp; I. and divided amongst the people.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see the big farms that the Duke of Westminster seems to be able to buy all over the country taken by the Land Commission and divided amongst those who have been dispossessed of them.  These are the matters we want to hear about from the Minister.  I suggest he should consider the question of the Duke's husbandry and the husbandry of the B. &amp; I.  Deputy Blowick made a great fuss about the power of taking over land because of bad husbandry.  That power already exists in previous Land Acts, whether Deputy Blowick is aware of it or not, and it is not necessary to have it in this particular Land Act unless the lawyers have again driven holes in badly-drafted Bills.</P>
    <P>As far as this Bill is concerned, while I regret that it has to be brought in, I regard it as necessary.  If other Parties and other Governments did not carry out investigations to bring this matter to light, when it is brought to light, and when we have a Minister so earnest about his job that he dug into it and found out what was wrong, then we should support him.  There is very little use in providing holdings for the people and putting the State to the expense of building houses on those holdings if you are going to have a large proportion of those houses unoccupied. There is no good in the State providing homes for people if the people are not going to live in them. It is all very well to talk about this right and that right.  A man who gets a gift from the State has no right if he does not carry out the obligation due to the State.  That is the way in which I look at this matter.  I think it is a fair approach to it.  Whilst I am more than anxious to see the land of this country divided up, and to see people living happily on those farms, I am not prepared to see State money put into land for people who are not prepared to carry out their obligations <Col N="308" /> to the State in regard to the land they get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I, for one, am not prepared to vote for this Bill, although I come from a county where there has been division of land on a vast scale and where there are a great many grievances against many of the tenants who got the land.  I hold that this Bill will not bring harmony and peace to the country.  There are other ways of dealing with these holdings which are left derelict.  I believe if the present Minister was in charge of the Land Commission 10 years ago, we would have a good system of land division.  I believe he is an honest, straightforward man.  But the Minister who was in control of the Land Commission from 1932 to 1938 should be arraigned for the manner in which he allowed land to be divided.  Deputy Corry said there was no political patronage.  I say definitely that 80 per cent. of the land in Counties Meath, Westmeath and Kildare was given to members of Fianna Fáil clubs from 1932 to 1938.  Not three miles from where I live, an official of the Land Commission who came down asked for Captain So-and-So.  That man was never even the captain of a goose club.  He was supposed to be the captain of the new I.R.A.  He could not write his own name.  Yet a Land Commission official came along and brought him into a place in a back street and got from him a list of members of the new I.R.A. &mdash; people who never raised a gun in their lives.  All they did was to try to loot.  They were not I.R.A. men.  Almost every one of the men on that list got land.  Three or four, or even five or six, of these men who got land were living on home help.  They never had a bob and, if they had it, would drink it.  That is the type of man who got land in County Meath.  I have been fighting for 10 years against this and I am glad that some Minister has had the courage to stand up to it.  I am sorry that the present Minister has to do the dirty work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not vote for the Bill because I know there is a better way out of this. Many of these men got farms eight or 10 or 12 years ago.  Some of them when <Col N="309" /> they went into the holdings were married and had one child.  At the present moment I know some of them with nine and 10 children who are now down and out.  I will not vote to put these people on the side of the road.  The Land Commission put them on the land and it is the Land Commission's responsibility to deal with these people with equity and justice.  I will stand behind these people in their fight for the home the Government gave them.</P>
    <P>I know it is an awful thing to say, but I will say this, because I have a human heart.  I know that for years the crow bar and battering ram were used to put people out of their homes. They will have to be used again to put these people out, because if you put them out by the front door they will come in by the back door.  One thing that can be done is to vest all these holdings which have been divided for the last eight or ten years and allow those &ldquo;duds&rdquo; to sell the land.  They may get a few pounds for it.  The sons of good farmers with a few hundred pounds will buy the land and work it. That is the easiest and best way.  I should like to see the Minister standing beside the sheriff and see him put a man with ten children out on the side of the road.  I would not stand for that and I am sure the Minister would not stand for it.</P>
    <P>The bringing in of this Bill is all &ldquo;ballyhoo.&rdquo;  There is no need for it. There has been ample power up to the present to deal with the matter.  The Land Commission did not deal with it, notwithstanding the fact that they had hundreds of officials going around the country who were nothing more than spies trying to find out who were living in the houses.  I know one of them who used to creep up to the window of a house to see if the bed was made in order to find out if the man had slept in it the night before.  We do not want that.  We want something manly and decent.  They should have met the men themselves and found out whether they were living in the houses or not.  If not, they should have given them three months to get out.  After leaving these men in these houses for ten or 12 years during which they have reared big families, you are now going to put them <Col N="310" /> out and flood the workhouses.  That is a despicable thing for the Government to do.  But the chickens are coming home to roost.  The Government knew that this would happen.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to withdraw this Bill and to get on with land division in a proper way by giving land to men who will work it and who have the tradition in their blood, not to those who are out to get things for nothing and who do not intend to pay either rents, rates or taxes.  These are the men you have in these holdings to-day and these are the men you are going to put out of them.  The job is yours. You will not get any help from me in doing that dirty job, although I would have been glad to help if you did it ten years ago, not now after you have allowed this corruption to grow and when these men have no home to go to.</P>
    <P>Five or six years ago these men would have walked out willingly, but they have no place to go to to-day. There is no alternative but to vest these holdings and let them be sold and see that they are sold to men who need land and who will work the land and who have the cash to work it. What has been wrong about land division for 25 years is that, in most cases, land was given to men who had not any cash.  How could we expect a man with seven or eight children to live on 22 acres of poor land, with the house not even furnished and without even an ass or a horse to start with? How could we expect men like that to be farmers?</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Land Commission have divided land in the Midlands has sown greed and jealousy and hatred there.  They bring men from the North, South, East and West to Meath, Westmeath and Kildare and give them a good farm of land, with a splendid house, a pump, gates and piers, flour and meal, hens and ducks and horses.  They give them everything they want.  They bring them there in buses and give them a feast in the nearest hotel.  They are put into holdings that are fully stocked. In many cases they have not to pay any rent for two years.  In other cases, they parcel out holdings of 15 or 20 acres and say to the allottees: &ldquo;Go <Col N="311" /> and fend for yourself; we will give you nothing only the bare grass&rdquo;. How can you expect these men to make good on these holdings?  The result of that is that you have to-day hatred and enmity and jealousy.  I know sons of migrants, some of the greedy type, who walked the derelict farms of these other men in County Meath 12 months ago.  They knew there was a Land Bill coming in and they said: &ldquo;I am going to see that I will get this land&rdquo;.  In the next six months we will find that the sons of these migrants will be the grabbers of the lands of these unfortunate men in Meath, Westmeath and Kildare who are not able to work the land to-day. I will not help to flood my county with men from Connemara who never saw anything but a fishing hook.  Some of these men were given land on the best farms in Meath which should never have been divided.  They are now being brought into the police courts, morning, noon and night, and they are a disgrace to me, to the Minister and to Connemara.  I am not saying they are all of that type, but many of them are.  It is not alone Moore Street and Gloucester Street that are dangerous at night-time, where you might be knifed in the back.  I defy the Minister to go on a dark night through the streets of Athboy after a fair day.  He would be lucky if he came out of it with his life.  Then we are told that land division is a success.  I have been telling the Minister for the past 10 years that it is a failure and a fiasco, creating, bitterness and enmity.</P>
    <P>I also say that a very good type of migrant was brought from Kerry, Mayo and Donegal who worked the land efficiently and well, but the devil thank them for that, as they got everything to make them work.  The Commission did not take a migrant from Mayo or Kerry with a young family. Those who came had four or five sons of 15, 20 and 25 years of age in Ireland, and two or three sons in England and America, packing the money home to pay the rates, rent and taxes.  As a result, many of the persons from Donegal and Kerry can buy, not alone a 20-acre farm but a 200-acre farm, on account of the gold flowing from the <Col N="312" /> British colonies.  The Minister did not bring any migrants with young children not able to work.  In Meath, he put in the unfortunate person with a young family and even with a poor wife who could not help, because she was always sick and undernourished, and that man had not even a penny to pay wages to any man.</P>
    <P>Then you say such a man must not be allowed to set part of his land on the 11-months' system.  What is he going to do with it?  Why should he not set it on the 11-months' system, if he gets good, honest, hard cash in the public auction and pays his rent, rates and taxes?  If I want 15 acres of land, I go to the public auction and pay £10 an acre for it in cash, and the other man pays his rent, rates and taxes and his shop bills and clothes his children.  You want to stop that man to-day and make a pauper of him and leave him nothing.  I say he should be let alone, to set his land on the 11-months' system if he cannot work it.  Is he to let it go wild, let the heather grow over it and let the grass grow across the ditches?  Why should he not set it, if a neighbour happens to be better off and can stock more land?  If by setting the land he can get something, why not let him?  You put the wrong man there.  I challenge the Minister to tell me of any honest farmer's son who came from 20, 30 or 50 acres of land, with a tradition of land in his blood, and who was a failure.  In County Meath you have not alone one, two, three, but 50, 60 and 70 failures &mdash; failures before they signed the document giving them the land. They could not be otherwise, as most of them did not know the first thing about land and did not want to know it.  They were good men, but they spent the whole time, even after Mass on Sunday, trying to get a drink in a public house and did not care who paid for it.  They would do anything sooner than work any land.  Now they are farmers in Meath and find they have to pay for the priest, the doctor, the nurse and the deaths, whereas before they got the land they had to pay nothing and needed only the red ticket to get nurses and hospital attention.</P>
    <P>They find now where they stand and <Col N="313" /> they are very sorry they touched it. They find that the old homestead is gone, and where are they to go?  Will the Minister tell us what he will do with the ten children?  I know one case beside me of that kind.  Now, surely, if this Bill is passed, there will be an attempt to put the poor devil on the side of the road, but if you bring the crowbar and the battering-ram I will defy you and I will go to Mountjoy for it if necessary, as you have no right to do it.  It means we are going to let loose in this country the Gestapo, to go along and take the lives and liberties of people into their own hands.  You have them to-day, prying around and trying to get information and, if they are afraid to go to the front door, they will crawl to the back door or go to a neighbour.  You always know that the second or third neighbour is looking for something for himself.  That is the very man they will go to, and that is the man who will say that his neighbour never lives at home and is a waster, that he should be put out, that is the man who will say: &ldquo;I have three or four sons and will work the farm.&rdquo;  We do not want that game.  It was played before in Clanrickarde's time.</P>
    <P>I hope the present Minister, who is an old I.R.A. man, will not let that happen.  He is a man who fought for the same thing as I fought for, who bled for it and who was prepared to pay for it with his life.  He was never prepared to put up a Cromwell's &ldquo;get&rdquo; in this country, and I know he will not do it.  I say he should withdraw this Bill.  It is a dirty Bill, a mean Bill, an un-Irish Bill, and something like Hitler and the Gestapo tried to introduce.  I stand four-square for these people, though they are no good, and I hate to say it.  They are rotters and wasters, and many of them drunkards, and they never should have got the land, but I will not see it taken from them and them put out on the side of the road.  I will take their side, much as I despise them, and I will do it as an Irishman.</P>

      <P>As usual, Deputy Giles, having practical knowledge of rural Ireland, puts his finger on one of the principal evils that have arisen out of <Col N="314" /> the corrupt political interference in the Land Commission during the past 15 years.  I am sorry that Deputy O'Grady, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Industry and Commerce, has gone out of the House, as he was responsible for the administration of the Land Commission during the greater part of that time.  What has Deputy O'Grady to say to the House, now that the present Minister for Lands has announced that 17½ per cent. of all the tenants comprised in the second survey of persons put in to holdings by Deputy O'Grady while Minister are going to be cleared out as unsatisfactory?  Is not Deputy Giles perfectly right?  Is it not true that for rotten, corrupt, political reasons, Fianna Fáil Deputies took unfortunate men and thrust land upon them which those men then set and proceeded to rear large families out of the proceeds of setting the land?  They now find themselves with wide family responsibilities, and absolutely incapable of doing an honest day's work, because Fianna Fáil has turned them into lazy ne'er-do-wells.</P>
      <P>The remedy Fianna Fáil proposes is to adopt the same attitude as Clanrickarde, that is, to say they are not good tenants and to throw them out on the side of the road.  What are you going to do with them?  Take the type of man to which Deputy Giles refers. It is all very well to say you are going to clear the man out, as he is not a good tenant, but what are you going to do with his wife and ten children?  Are you going to treat him as Michael Davitt was treated, with the father in one end of the county home, the mother in the other end, and the ten children sent to an orphanage?  Where are you going to put them?  Do not let us imagine that we are dealing with striplings and with men of 20 and 24 years of age.  A very large percentage of that 17½ per cent. of unsatisfactory tenants are men with large families. Are you going to provide a labourer's cottage and a guaranteed job for them, from the day you take the land over from them, and how are you going to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been made necessary by the corrupt interference of the Fianna Fáil Deputies with the administration <Col N="315" /> of the Land Commission.  Everyone knows that rotten, corrupt interference has been going on for the last 15 years. Certain elements in the Land Commission have strenuously and courageously resisted it and many a man has suffered for the honest fight he put up to maintain some standards of decency in the operation of the land law by the Land Commission since Fianna Fáil came into office.  Why has everybody become so mealy-mouthed about it?  Does not every Deputy of Clann na Talmhan know that Fianna Fáil Deputies went down to constituencies and proclaimed they were going to do the dividing?  I remember speaking at a meeting in the town of Cavan and being told that one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies from Cavan was at that moment holding a meeting down in a village adjoining an estate being acquired by the Land Commission, with a view to dividing up the land amongst the members of the Fianna Fáil Cumann and he boasted of it and gloried in it.  I have no doubt that, in some measure, some of the senior officers of the Land Commission do resist the wholesale depredation by those gentlemen, but I am as certain as that I am standing here, regarding 95 per cent. of the tenants who are going to be dispossessed under this Bill, that if we can get the files &mdash; which we will never get &mdash; dealing with the apportioning of land to them, we would discover in almost every case they got the land as the result of improper pressure brought by Fianna Fáil Deputies themselves or by the Minister, on the administrative officers of the Department.</P>
    <P>I know the senior inspectors of the Department from their work throughout the country for the last 30 years and I will say that if the preparation of schemes for the distribution of land were left to the senior inspectors of the Land Commission, and their discretion was not interfered with, there would be very few people who would have to be put out under this measure.  How many people had to be put off their farms prior to 1931?  The Land Commission has been functioning for the past 50 years.  Every estate that was divided, was divided by the Land Commission or by the Congested Districts Board, which is now a part of the Irish <Col N="316" /> Land Commission.  How many unsatisfactory allocations of land were made in the old days?  Very few that I ever heard of.  When did this crop of worthless tenants begin to grow?  When did a situation arise when we had to take evicting powers in order to disencumber the land of this country from the worthless, thriftless characters that have been put upon it?</P>
    <P>Who put them there?  Were they put there 16 years ago, or 17 years ago?  Were they not put there in the course of the last 15 years and, if they were, who put them there?  Why do not the Fianna Fáil Ministers for Lands come in here and render an account of their stewardship?  How is it that the present Minister for Lands finds 700 holdings sublet, 200 badly used and 820 houses sublet or empty, in a survey covering only a very small fraction of the total allocations that have been made during the last 15 years?  How is it that, in a second survey, 17½ per cent. of the total allocations made are now deemed to be unsatisfactory by the Land Commission that made them, and 470 houses are not being lived in by their owners?</P>
    <P>Why do not the Ministers who were responsible to this House for the Land Commission when these houses were built and these allotments made, come here and tell us how did that happen and what were they doing?  Why did they allow the Department for which they were responsible to create a situation which it is now sought to remedy?  In order to remedy that situation, what are we asked to do? We are asked in Section 4 to abolish the right of any citizen of this country to go into the courts with a view to having a matter of fact determined as between himself and the Executive.</P>
    <P>See what can happen.  A perfectly respectable individual may have a house built and an allotment given to him and, <i>bona fide</i>, he will go to live there, leaving his father and mother on the home farm.  That man's father may get a stroke of paralysis three months after he has gone to live in the new house and he may go home to help his widowed mother, perfectly <i>bona fide</i>, until he is satisfied that she has made proper arrangements to make <Col N="317" /> up for the absence of her husband from the working of his farm.  Any Fianna Fáil T.D. can go to that man and say: &ldquo;I will get the Minister for Lands to issue a certificate under Section 4 that you have committed a breach of the undertaking,&rdquo; and when you go into court all that will happen is that the certificate will be produced and the moment it is produced you will not be allowed to say that your father got a stroke of paralysis, that your mother is a widow and could not carry on the holding without your help, and that you lived in the house continuously until your father was stricken down. You will not be allowed to say that you are going back to the house or that you have been out of the house only for two or three months.  The certificate will be final and conclusive evidence and no other evidence as to the facts or the circumstances of the situation may be even tendered to the court.</P>
    <P>We are driven to that expedient in order to clear the lands of the ne'er-do-wells that the Fianna Fáil Party put on them and now not one of the ex-Ministers for Lands is here to tell us how all this has come to pass.  The only one who was here was Deputy O'Grady, but he has hooked it out of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are told that the situation amongst Fianna Fáil allottees of land has become so intolerable that if a man gets an addition to his holding he may not sell his original holding without the consent of the Land Commission.  A man may have a holding of which he is full owner.  He may get an additional parcel under one of the recent Land Acts, but that additional parcel may not vest in him for 15 years.  During that time he has lost freedom of sale in respect of his original holding.  He must now go to the Land Commission, exactly as people had to go to the landlords in the past, to crave permission to dispose of his tenant right.</P>
      <P>Surely there must be some Deputies who understand sufficiently the atmosphere in which the land war was fought to appreciate that their fathers and grandfathers were not fools when they sacrificed all they did sacrifice to get freedom of sale, fair rent and fixity of tenure. Surely it was not for fun they worked out that slogan, the Three F's. Surely they knew that if these things were not maintained it would react to the disadvantage not only of the people who lived on the land but to the land itself and, consequently, to the whole community.  Everything that Fianna Fáil has done in regard to land, since it came into office, has been directed towards destroying fixity of tenure and free sale.  It has turned a large part of our people into grabbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember the case in Roscommon a few days ago when 15 respectable men walked on to a neighbour's land and drove his cattle off. They called in the Guards and said they had driven the cattle off, and, when they were asked why they did so, they said: &ldquo;Because we want his land.&rdquo;  Could anyone here ever have imagined that a situation would be created in which young fellows down the country would be tempted to go in and drive their neighbour's stock for no other reason than that they wanted his land?  They knew that there was power in the hands of the Government to take their neighbour's farm and <Col N="319" /> give it to somebody else.  Was that situation ever anticipated by anybody who was concerned for land reform? Is it desirable or good?  Do we want to turn all the people living on the land of this country into tenants again? Was the whole land war wrong?  Was it all a mistake?  Should we, when we were expropriating the landlords, have vested all the land in the Government and made the people liable for land annuities in perpetuity?</P>
    <P>Is that the intention?  Does the Fianna Fáil Party mean to say that they have changed their mind about fixity of tenure, about fair rent and about free sale, that they think free sale a bad thing, fixity of tenure a bad thing and fair rent a bad thing, and they want to revert to the system which the landlords defended in this country &mdash; that no man shall live upon the land and work the land unless he is somebody else's servant, that there shall be no land owners in this country and that everybody who adopts agriculture as his livelihood will be for ever under surveillance and have hanging over his head for ever the sword of Damocles, of being thrown out on the side of the road, because whoever happens to be the Government of this country does not like the way he is working the land, or does not choose to hear the justification he wants to make for the way in which he is living on the land, unless he is prepared to go in with his hat in his hand to a political Minister and crave him of his bounty not to make the certificate which he is entitled to make under Section 4?  No man living on the land in this country hereafter will have the right to go into court even to claim his fixity of tenure because he knows he can be met there by the final and conclusive certificate under Section 4 of the Land Act of 1945.  Did any landlord in this country ever dream of challenging fixity of tenure in such a way?</P>
    <P>I am told that I ought not to oppose this Bill, that the land is encumbered with a collection of duds, frauds and &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;, that the Minister himself says their multitude has become so great that he must take steps to clear <Col N="320" /> them out.  I am supposed gladly to forswear every guarantee that the tenant purchasers of this country have of fixity of tenure in order to deal with Fianna Fáil's duds.  Now that Deputy O'Grady has come back, I want to ask him to intervene in this debate.  He was Minister for Lands for a protracted period and was responsible for the working of the Land Commission. I want him to tell us how it is that, during his stewardship, persons were put upon the land who have produced this result, that, when a survey is made of 4,000 holdings, 700 are found to be sub-let, 200 badly used and 820 houses built under his administration or that of his colleagues either sub-let or empty, and that, in a second survey, 17½ per cent. of the people he put on the land are unsatisfactory and 470 of the houses built while he was responsible to this House for that Department are untenanted.</P>
    <P>Have we not got a right to ask him to tell us how that came to pass while he was holding himself out to the House as conscientiously discharging the duty of trustee for this House of the Land Commission?  Does he propose to get up and say: &ldquo;I had nothing to do with it; it was none of my business&rdquo;?  Does he propose to deny that during that time he was warned again and again that if the Land Commission were called upon to divide land at the rate which, for political purposes, he insisted they should operate and that the Land Commission said that if they were persistently interfered with by his supporters down the country the allocation of land must be unsatisfactory and would be unsatisfactory and would ultimately call for reconsideration?  He cannot deny it if he proposes to tell this House the truth.</P>
    <P>Do people in this House realise what Fianna Fáil did when they passed the 1931 Land Act?  Do they realise the &ldquo;slush-fund&rdquo; they opened for the purchase of votes in this country?  Do they realise that under the existing land law the Land Commission buy an estate and improve that estate, and that, having done that, they ascertain the economic rent payable in respect of each farm on that estate, <Col N="321" /> according to the formula laid down in the earlier land code and that that rent is designed not to redeem the price of improvement, for that is a charge upon the Exchequer, but to redeem what the land actually cost the Land Commission, together with certain minor expenses which are involved? That rent is further abated if, in the judgment of the Land Commission, the holding is not such as to permit of an annuity sufficient to liquidate the purchase price and to leave the farmer a reasonable standard of living, not only for himself but for his wife and family as well, and the rent, having thus been ascertained, is cut in two and the land conveyed to the incoming tenant at half its cost.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder there is land hunger in this country?  Is it any wonder that every camp follower of Fianna Fáil is running around with his tongue out to get land, because the day he goes into a holding he acquires an asset corresponding to half of the total of the land for nothing?  If he does not sell it, he can mortgage it.  Is it any wonder that every Fianna Fáil T.D. went down the country and said: &ldquo;We have largesse to distribute amongst our supporters if they will only toe the line?&rdquo; Is it any wonder that their fulfilment of that undertaking has resulted in the necessity for this Bill?  Let somebody answer the question put by Deputy Giles. What are you going to do with your own duds?  What are you going to do with them, poor, miserable and contemptible as they are; poor wretched creatures who sold their souls for penny rolls and lumps of hairy bacon? We do not want to see them treated as dirt under your feet.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party may think it is practical in this country to go down and corrupt simple people, to degrade them, to use them and then to cast them aside like a sucked orange and trample them into the earth, but they will find they cannot, and it will not be their own wretched dupes who will rise against them.  It will be the decent elements in the country who never allowed them to corrupt them, those who have not been taught the filthy lesson of jealousy and hatred and the desire to grab your neighbour's holding, those who would have scorned ever <Col N="322" /> to grab their neighbour's land, no matter what powers were conferred on the Land Commission by the 1931 Land Acts or any of the Acts which followed it.  You cannot take people for whose misfortune you yourselves are responsible and kick them into the ditch because the decent elements in the community will not let you do it.</P>
    <P>I think it is deplorable that we have so many cases of this gross misuse of land, and when I speak of misuse of land, I mean its granting to persons who never meant to use it, and who, those who sought to get it for them knew, would never, could never and in fact never did use it, but I do not believe that that horrible situation can best be remedied by destroying the last vestige of fixity of tenure left to the people.  I do not believe that situation can best be remedied by upsetting the whole system of the law, and remember that Section 4 more rightly belongs to a Criminal Law Amendment Bill than to a Land Bill.</P>
    <P>Suppose there was a provision in any Criminal Law Amendment Bill that the penalty for an offence under the Act would be the confiscation of a person's entire property, would Deputies not say that that was an appalling penalty, a penalty worse than life imprisonment, because it meant a condemnation to disruption of the family and to chronic poverty and destitution?  That is what Section 4 provides.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Lands issues the necessary certificate everything the unfortunate man has is gone from him because the alleged cause of issuing the certificate is that he is subletting the land and has neither stock nor anything else wherewith to work it.  Does the House believe that that is a proper-method of dealing with an evil which the present Government itself created and admits itself that it created it? It was you put them on the land; it was you who chose them for the land; it was you who boasted that you were going to put them there and that you had put them there, in spite of everybody, and in the face of any advice that experienced persons were in a position to give you.  I say deliberately that such a remedy is inhuman <Col N="323" /> and outrageous.  We, having made our bed, ought to lie on it and face the consequences.  I do not deny the existence of the evil, but the right way to remedy the evil is to ensure that in any land settlement, and in the division of land in this country in the future, the Land Commission and its experienced officers will be allowed to do their job and that if a Fianna Fáil T.D. is seen approaching one of them the dogs will be set on him.  I guarantee that if the experienced officers of the Land Commission are allowed to carry out their duties without political interference in the business of allocating the land of this country, there will not be .1 per cent. of complaint in the administration of the holdings they create.  It may take some time for this particular problem that the Minister has in mind to work itself out, but it would be better to let it work itself out, and let these unfortunate ne'er-do-wells alienate their holdings to other persons, and bring the land back gradually into cultivation rather than remedy it by the provision of Section 4, and put the further inroad on free sale represented by Section 6.</P>
    <P>I know full well that we are living in an age when principle and standards count for nothing.  The only rule that runs in this country is: can you get away with it?  There was a time when considerable numbers of persons, if given the opportunity to do wrong, would be ashamed to do wrong, and whether they were going to be found out or not would scorn to put their hands to work of that character. Now, as far as I can see, if you can get away with it anything goes.  If we are going to set that example in this House it is only too likely that it will be followed gladly by a great many people down the country.  Are we of opinion that, with a view to remedying not the mistakes but the deliberate, conscious, corrupt, misfeasance of Fianna Fáil during the last 15 years in connection with land division in this country, we should pass Section 4 which abrogates the fundamental rights of citizens to invoke the courts of law?  I do not think that we should, and mind you I think we are making a <Col N="324" /> mistake if on this side of the House, no matter what Party Deputies belong to, or whether they stand alone, we allow Fianna Fáil to stampede us by their misfeasance into expedients that commend themselves to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It has never been the practice of people on this side of the House to do the kind of thing that Fianna Fáil had thought itself justified in.  We never stooped on this side of the House to the shady transactions which Fianna Fáil has thought possible that they could get away with.  We never appropriated a Republican Loan and we never purchased the assent of people to the abandonment of fundamentals by holding out to them the bait of monetary advantage.  We never sought to purchase the mass of the people, nor stooped to corrupt and degrade them, and we should not allow ourselves to consent to the kind of remedies that commend themselves to men capable of that kind of activity.  I for one reject it.</P>
    <P>I believe that free sale, fixity of tenure and fair rent are still precious things in this country.  I think that everything done to undermine these three things will react disastrously not only on the land and the people who live on it, but on the whole community. I believe that Fianna Fáil does not believe in those things.  I believe they think they have discovered something new and that those three things were merely gags that were run by the Land League to embarrass the landlords.  I believe that they do not understand the kind of people who led the Land League, who, no matter how advantageous a gag was, if it was dishonest they would have scorned to use it.  They campaigned for these three things because they believed they were honestly and genuinely necessary.  They did not use them for the purpose of expropriating the landlords and of benefiting themselves and their supporters. They demanded them because, without them, they felt our people could have neither freedom, independence nor dignity.  They wanted to put our people in the position that if a landlord or Fianna Fáil T.D., or anybody else who claimed to be their master, threatened to cross their <Col N="325" /> threshold uninvited, they could put him out and have the law on their side.  If you pass Section 4 of the Bill, who dare put a Fianna Fáil T.D. out?  You remember the old days when the bailiff called.  Theoretically, he had no right to enter &mdash; only the agent of the landlord could &mdash; but who dare put him out? You dare not put him out because he had his agent there and if you did not submit to his most outrageous exactions you were liable summarily to be evicted by the agent, who was always on the bailiff's side.  The bailiff's certificate was sufficient.  There was no argument against it.  It was conclusive evidence that you had to go, and go you did.  There was no use pleading with the landlord or the agent that the bailiff was a blackguard, a liar and a fraud, because his certificate was sufficient.</P>
    <P>Are we going to create a situation now that if a tenant purchaser in this country is ordered by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party to toe the line, and refuses to do so, that member can go to the Minister and get the agent's warrant for eviction, and that when the tenant seeks the protection of the court he will be told, as his grandfather was told by the landlord: &ldquo;There is no argument; the bailiff's certificate is conclusive, and you have got to go. There is no court, there is no tribunal, there is no remedy of which you can avail.  Your only hope is to go back to the Fianna Fáil T.D. who got that certificate first signed; go down on your knees to him, recant all you said or did, and beg of him in his kindness to go back and undo his dirty work, and, if you prostitute yourself sufficiently you will have a fair chance of getting back your right to live?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do Deputies on this side of the House think that is a suitable remedy for the situation created by that Government? Do they want to put every tenant-farmer in this country in that position?  Do they want to feel that any day a certificate may be issued, the result of which is going to put them out on the road penniless and that they will have no remedy and that they will stand on the roadside, not an object of universal pity but <Col N="326" /> branded as incompetent, fraudulent, worthless, so much flotsam and jetsam to be thrown upon the tide?  Do they think that is right, or what has come over the Deputies on this side of the House?  Do they think they ought to approve that plan?  Do they think they ought to dirty themselves with the consequences of the situation which that Party admits they are responsible for?  How often have we told them on this side of the House that they were corruptly misusing the powers conferred upon the Land Commission, that they were interfering with the Land Commission, that the allocation of land was in many cases unjust and improper?  How often have I heard Deputy Hughes get up and quote cases where he said the allocations were unjust?  Now, when these birds have come home to roost, now, when they stand convicted before the country of the consequence of what they did &mdash; and remember when we charged them with doing it they denounced us; they said we were saboteurs; they said we were trying to denounce Fianna Fáil regardless of the justification of the allegations we made against them &mdash; are we going to say that they were right, that all our allegations during that period were unfounded and were false, or are we going to say: &ldquo;For 15 years we warned you that if you went on with your corrupt and rotten administration, this Bill would become an urgent necessity&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Is this the hour to fall upon their necks and tell them we do not blame them, that they are in a sad mess and that, God help them, it is as much our fault as theirs and that any steps they think necessary, any abrogation of the most fundamental principles that they recommended to the House, meets with our entire approval?  If that be so then I do not know the purpose of debate.  It is hard to bring home to the people the truth when the truth is bitter and when the truth is utterly amazing.  We have warned the people time and time again of the very abuses that have begot this Act. Are we now going to renege what we ourselves have been doing or are we going to say to the people: &ldquo;Here is <Col N="327" /> the consequence of the abuses we have warned you of but, foreseeing these consequences, we are not going to be stampeded into standing over, &ldquo;Where an agreement or undertaking to purchase a holding or parcel of land from the Land Commission whether entered into before, on or after the operative date, contains a condition whereby the purchaser agrees to work the holding or parcel in accordance with proper methods of husbandry to the satisfaction of the Land Commission, a certificate under the common seal of the Land Commission certifying that the purchaser has not so worked the holding or parcel shall be conclusive evidence for all purposes of the fact so certified'?&rdquo; Is the Fine Gael Party going to vote for that?  Is the Clann na Talmhan Party going to vote for that?  I will wait and see.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Dillon's speech and I think it will not deceive anybody in the country, not even those who are opposed to the Government.  He talks about the corruption of the Fianna Fáil Party. According to his speech one would think that Fianna Fáil had got complete control of the Land Commission. If Fianna Fáil has been able to have that influence in the Land Commission there must be something wrong with the officials in the Land Commission. The Opposition Party would try to have it that the officials of the Land Commission are all right, but if it has been possible for Fianna Fáil Deputies to have such influence in respect of the allotment of land as Opposition speakers suggest, the Land Commission officials must not be doing their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look back, Section 6 of the 1933 Land Act indicates clearly that it is impossible that there should be any political influence in the Land Commission.  I have always understood that even the Minister for Lands had no power to suggest to the Land Commission what land should be acquired, Where land should be acquired, or how land should be allotted.  On many occasions when estates were divided in my constituency <Col N="328" /> I had to stand up against the attack of my own supporters and their criticism of the manner in which estates were divided.</P>
    <P>It was shown to me in many cases that men who supported the national movement in the past, who suffered in the old Sinn Féin days, were not considered and their applications for land were turned down while others who never made any sacrifices in the national movement but who looked after their own private interests usually got first consideration.  That was natural because those who did not give attention to national affairs in the past but who looked after their own interest were usually the best people from the point of view of the Land Commission and usually got first consideration.</P>
    <P>Listening to Opposition speeches one might be led to believe that in regard to land acquired and allotted previous to the Fianna Fáil Government the Land Commission did not make any mistakes and that land was allotted only to very efficient people who could work it properly.  Anyone who knows the country must realise that previous to Fianna Fáil taking power and previous to 1931 the Land Commission made mistakes in their allotment of land also.  I do not deny that there may have been abuses in the Land Commission &mdash; they have not my approval &mdash; but we had abuses in the Land Commission previous to Fianna Fáil coming into power.  I know estates in my own constituency that were acquired by the Land Commission as far back as 1923, the allottees on which sold their holdings. In some cases they never occupied the houses and, at the first opportunity, they sold them.  I know of cases in my constituency in 1931, during the Cumann na nGaedheal period, where the Land Commission made presents of holdings to allottees.  I know one particular case where a holding of about 50 Irish acres was vested in a man who sold the holding afterwards. It was a free gift to him.  That also happened during the Cumann na nGaedheal period.</P>
    <P>It was stated here that 17 per cent. of the allottees were &ldquo;duds&rdquo;, that <Col N="329" /> they were unsuitable and that they were put there through political corruption. There are allottees in Kildare who should not have got land and who are not working the land.  There are not many of them.  That is not through any fault of their own.  There are certain parts of Kildare where there is a good tillage tradition, and a tradition of mixed farming.  These areas, in a great many cases, are adjacent to the bogs and the holdings are very small. In those areas the land available for acquisition is not very large, but where estates were divided in these areas we will not find any case to which this Bill will apply.  In part of North Kildare, where the most land was available for acquisition, the tradition of mixed farming and good husbandry was weakest.  It was there that it was most difficult to find suitable allottees.  The large farmer in those areas had not a very good knowledge of tillage.  Tillage was not practised very much eight or 10 years ago.  The tradition of tillage and mixed farming had practically died out in those areas.  I often heard Deputy Hughes refer to the difficulty these farmers had when compulsory tillage came in; that they had not the tradition and that they had not the machinery.  When the large farmers in the area lost the art of good husbandry, it was very difficult for the small holders to know much about it.  The small holder, to some extent, did what he should not do, he followed the example of the larger holder and set his land.  That was not the purpose for which the Land Acts were passed.</P>
    <P>It may be a hardship on some of these people to be dispossessed from their holdings.  But the Land Acts were not passed, and land was not divided solely in the interest of allottees.  The Land Acts were passed for the benefit of the community and in order to have the land worked.  It was not for his own personal advantage that land was allotted to a man.  Public money was expended to acquire this land and to improve it and put it into a condition for the man to work it and a house was provided for him.  It was for him to do his part on behalf of the community by cultivating the land and working it in accordance with what is <Col N="330" /> considered a good system of husbandry.</P>
    <P>I think is is very mean for Deputies like Deputy Dillon to talk about the corruption of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have often been criticised for not influencing the Land Commission, but I know that it would not be possible.  I know I could not do it if I tried.  There was one particular case in which I tried to use influence with the Land Commission. It was in connection with an uneconomic holder who was allotted a parcel of land to make his holding economic.  That was during the Cumann na nGaedheal régime, and before the annuities were halved.  The purchase price of the estate must have been very big, because the annuity was more than he was able to pay.  He felt that he would be better off if he could give the holding back to the Land Commission. He had gone into arrears with his annuities, and he asked me to get the Land Commission to take the holding back.  He was getting warrants for the arrears of annuities due and demands from the county council for arrears of rates.  I tried very hard to do something in the matter, and it was a long time before the Land Commission resumed the holding.  That was the only occasion on which I ever brought any pressure to bear on the Land Commission.  If an estate is being divided, and if a man asks a Deputy of any Party to make representation, he will submit his representation. Deputy Hughes I know does it. Deputy Hughes' keymen in Kildare will tell the people that he has more influence in the Land Commission than Deputy Harris, that Deputy Harris can do nothing with the Land Commission and that Deputy Hughes has far more influence with them.  I suppose the same thing was done in other constituencies where the Fine Gael Party or other Parties were looking for votes. If you want petrol from the Department of Supplies, the Fine Gael Deputy is the man who has the pull there.  He is the live wire.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies can do nothing.</P>

      <P>The speech of Deputy Dillon or the speeches of Fine Gael Deputies who say that Fianna Fáil <Col N="331" /> made a mess of land division will not deceive anybody down the country. There is no doubt that a lot of people thought that it was very difficult for the Land Commission to acquire and divide so much land in such a short period; that the pace was a little too fast.  That was the complaint that I heard responsible people make.  Intelligent and responsible people down the country were really surprised that the Land Commission made such a success of the job in such a short time, and carried out such a volume of work in so short a period.</P>
      <P>I hope no hardship will be inflicted under this Bill.  I know there are certain types of people &mdash; and not so many of them &mdash; who would like to get a bit of land and who will neglect it. In the country at present, there are good opportunities of making money in other ways, as we have factories with good wages.  There are some people inclined to set the land at a good price and work in factories for big wages.  That type of man should not be allowed to carry on.  I have no objection to his being active in other directions in connection with agriculture, but if he wants to devote himself to other work than that and if he feels that some occupation other than farming is more profitable, he should leave the land to someone who will work it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes adopted a reasonable attitude on this Bill and I only intervene in view of what Deputy Dillon thinks we all should think regarding the Bill.  I would like that both he and other Deputies would understand exactly how we regard it.  In any matter regarding land, I would not undertake to dictate to the mind of any man as to what his opinion should be; and any Deputy on this side of the House is free to vote in any way he wishes regarding this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own view of it, and I think the view of the majority of members of this Party, is somewhat like this.  Let me speak for myself.  I have been for many years of my life struggling to prevent the Fianna Fáil Party doing <Col N="332" /> damage to this country by mistakes. They have been making mistakes for the last 24 years and I have been working very hard against that.  My view is that, as long as they are there, they will be making mistakes, working injustice and doing damage to some party in the country.  When we find them admitting some of their mistakes and setting out plans to prevent themselves from making any further mistakes, and trying to undo some of those they have made, if we take up the attitude that we are going to stand in their way and try to prevent them from mending their hand, then we are only piling up more difficulty and more trouble for somebody else to clear up.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of my attitude to this Bill on its Second Reading.  If we are to take the attitude that the Land Commission, by <Col N="333" /> putting a man into a holding, vests that holding in him completely and gives him complete possession of it, with full security and full tenure, and without any control over him for a period to show he is able to work the land and make use of it, and to do what Parliament intended him to do when it gave him the land, I think we would be making a great mistake.  I see nothing unreasonable in there being a period of test, as it were, which might be four, five or six years, before the land were vested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ordinarily ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand the story, it is very often 20 and 30 years, according to the Land Commission. I understand there are many holdings which have not been vested for very many years.  One of the really big disgraces about the Land Commission is that the vesting has not been carried out.  Let us not be carried away with exaggerated ideas about what the Bill can do.  There is always this difficulty about Fianna Fáil mistakes. When they make them, and then take power to correct them, the hand goes wider and not only do they take control over the people whom they want to correct but they take power over the whole people of the country.  In that way, from the first day Fianna Fáil began to make mistakes, the hand and the grip have widened over the country, so that we are rapidly reaching the position of a socialist dictator-controlled State.</P>
      <P>There is an element of that in this Bill.  Nevertheless, Parliament would make a great mistake if we do not agree that it was reasonable that some Government should correct the mistakes. It is a good job that the Fianna Fáil Government have come to the conclusion that their mistakes are so big that they must turn and remedy them themselves.  We ought to feel a certain amount of gratitude to the forces in the country which are bringing them to that state of mind.  It would be absurd for us to rub their noses in their mistakes on an occasion like this, when they are trying to rectify some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the feelings of Deputy <Col N="334" /> Giles in facing the proposals in this Bill and their widespread possibilities. He is facing up to the question of what would happen even some of the mistakes of Fianna Fáil if they were pushed out under this Bill.  However, the fact that it would be possible to do grave injustices in this Bill would not justify anyone, who realised there was a position to be cleared up, in opposing the clearing up of it.  If injustices are going to take place under this Bill, then nothing but active public opinion can save this nation from these injustices. One of the reasons why it has been possible for the Fianna Fáil Government over so many years to commit mistake after mistake is that public opinion has been dead, that public opinion has been dormant, that men who ought to be active and outspoken in political life have refrained from stating their opinions and have refrained from endeavouring to be part of the active force forming public opinion.</P>
    <P>I think we have reached the day in which public opinion is beginning to assert itself and that, facing the new life which opens out before the world and before this country, after the passing of the great cloud of war, public opinion is going to be more active.  We should give the Government a chance to correct some of the mistakes they have made and, even though injustices may be performed under this Bill, we should give public opinion a chance to realise that it has to assert itself, that it must watch in every direction for injustices and mistakes and speak out quickly and readily to prevent them.</P>
    <P>That is my attitude to the Bill, and I believe it is the attitude of the greater part of my colleagues here on these benches.  I do not feel going down to the mud or degrading myself in any way when I say to the Government: &ldquo;You can try to mend your mistakes.  We are not going to stand in your way if you try to do it.  We only say you should try to mend your hand in a number of different directions.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Dillon in this matter.  The Government were told for a number of years &mdash; successive Fianna Fáil Ministers <Col N="335" /> for Lands were told &mdash; that the method of allocation of land was bound to have bad results, that the entire system on which they based the distribution of holdings &mdash; or almost the entire system &mdash; was founded on the recommendations of Fianna Fáil T.D.s, or if not Fianna Fáil T.D.s, of Fianna Fáil clubs.  Deputy Dillon mentioned that we have had successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Lands.  Why is it that the other Ministers for Lands did not hold an investigation, say a year or two after these allottees had taken possession?  Why is it they did not ascertain whether the holdings were being worked or not?  Why is it that after ten or 15 years an entirely new Minister for Lands, who has a different outlook to the previous Fianna Fáil holders of the office, adopts the most rigorous methods, methods which give no opportunity whatever to the aggrieved person to appeal against a certificate of a Land Commission official?</P>
      <P>Deputy Giles put his finger on a very important point in the whole matter of land distribution, and that is that during a period of ten or 15 years, occupants have been put in, and they have reared families in many cases.  Their responsibilities have grown, and the result is that these people, who were put in primarily on the recommendation of Fianna Fáil, are now to be turned out because they have not justified the confidence which Fianna Fáil reposed in them.  Surely we should have some better explanation than that there is a different Minister and he is adopting a different policy.  It is quite true to say, as Deputy Mulcahy said, that it is a good thing to see him rectifying the mistakes, but why did not previous Ministers do so, and why, if they were so remiss in this matter, do they still hold office?  It is just like previous Ministers for Justice.  Fianna Fáil now have a Minister for Justice who is ensuring that the law will be upheld, but because of remissness, because of the fact that his predecessors in office failed to do it, police officers were shot in this country.  That responsibility is on Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, but surely it is permissible to draw an analogy and show that a Minister has failed in carrying out his duties?  Surely that is a sound analogy in demonstrating that another Minister has taken over the faults which his predecessor was responsible for, and in showing that if one Minister fails to carry it out another Minister has to be appointed to rectify these mistakes?  I think Deputies should examine their consciences. As Deputy Dillon says, the sins of Fianna Fáil are now coming home to roost and, because that is the case, and because Fianna Fáil Ministers have failed to carry out their duties, they now come here and propose to evict &mdash; in Deputy Giles' pungent language, using the same method as Cromwell adopted in this country &mdash; the unfortunate people who should never have been put into these holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister has any reason for evicting these people, if he has any reason for finding as, of course, he has found, that they are not fit to hold the land that has been allotted to them, at least these people should have a right of appeal or, as Deputy Giles suggested, the holdings should be vested in them and they should be given permission to sell.  If you take a man in changed circumstances, out of the surroundings he is used to, and put him in a position in which he has neither the training, the qualifications, the knowledge nor the capital, as was done in these cases, surely you cannot, after leaving him for 10 or 15 years, throw him out on the road, as it were? At least we have some sense of proportion and, because mistakes have been made, some fair and equitable system should be adopted to see that they are rectified.  We should not just turn these people out as you would drive cattle from a field.  I endorse <Col N="337" /> the remarks made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Giles, and for that reason I will oppose this Bill.</P>

      <P>I look upon any Bill which relates to land as of very great importance.  I had no intention of rising to speak on this occasion, but the speeches made by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Cosgrave appealed to me and I decided to make a few observations.  I am convinced that on this question of land division and distribution by the Land Commission, I can speak with practical knowledge, following my short experience in public life.  Since 1939 I have seen several ranches divided in my constituency. In my constituency there are a number of ranches which were dealt with by the Land Commission.  At the same time, there are numerous ranches there which are still on the Land Commission list awaiting division.  Any time I rose to speak on the Minister's Estimate, I seldom failed to place before him the circumstances of successful applicants.  I have had experience since 1939 of various people coming to me for recommendations and asking me to write applications for them to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must not forget that very serious allegations were made here by Deputies on the Opposition Benches against the Government for using political influence in the allocation of land and giving it to certain applicants. I can speak with absolute authority, because I was for three years secretary of a Fianna Fáil cumann in my constituency.  I was warned by Fianna Fáil headquarters, and by a Fianna Fáil Deputy from the constituency, to send no name to the Land Commission other than that of a Fianna Fáil applicant or a strong member of the Fianna Fáil cumann. As I rose here to place those facts before the Minister for Lands when his Estimate was under discussion, I was faced with the severest of criticism from Government Deputies, simply because they know they are still following the path which I walked off. They have instructions from their organisation, from the Government, to see that the case of no applicant but <Col N="338" /> that of a Fianna Fáil tout in the area is examined.  I am speaking with knowledge because I am a man who once acted hand-in-hand with the Fianna Fáil Party in my constituency to keep many a decent man out of a farm, and I ask God's forgiveness for it.  I was associated with the Fianna Fáil Party for three long years and no man has more experience of the intrigue and treachery used by that organisation in efforts to deprive deserving applicants of land, simply because their political outlook was Fine Gael, Labour or some other Party not in accordance with the doctrine of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>This measure, as Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out, is introduced by the Government for the purpose of rectifying their mistakes.  They see now that there would be no need for this legislation if they had been more broadminded in selecting people for land, and if they had given it to those who were most deserving and who were well financed and equipped to work it.  I intend to oppose this Bill simply because I think that, if there had been a proper allocation of land by the Land Commission in years past, there would be no necessity for such legislation. There is no need whatever for drastic powers to evict smallholders simply because in a great many cases economic conditions will not allow them to live in decent comfort on their small holdings and will not allow them to marry and rear families.</P>
    <P>Small farmers and poor agricultural workers have been put into 25 and 30-acre holdings and probably a house has been erected for them, but they may not have had the price of a horse to work these holdings when going into them, and very little assistance, to my knowledge, was given by the Government to these poor people whom the Government put into these holdings, if you like, against their wishes.  I can say from knowledge of my own constituency that under this legislation there are people who got land who are bound to lose it simply because they have portion of it set.  They would not have set it if they could possibly have worked it themselves, but they cannot work it because of <Col N="339" /> lack of capital, lack of live stock and lack of farm implements, as well as lack of assistance or co-operation from the Government in putting them in a position to work it and to produce food for man and beast.</P>
    <P>I believe that instead of introducing legislation to evict these people from land given to them in return for their loyalty to Fianna Fáil, it would be a much greater recognition of their services if legislation were introduced to enable them to live on the land, to encourage them to live on the land and to assist them by giving them live stock and capital in order that they may be able to live and rear families on the land.  The moment the majority of these people acquired their land they sank themselves in debt with the banks and with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  They made applications for loans in order to be able to comply with the obligations attached to their securing of holdings of 30 or 35 acres. I know small farmers in the poorest circumstances who made application for financial accommodation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  They sent in their applications and got back a form on which the first question was: how much money have you in the bank?  That was the question asked of people applying for loans.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that this type of legislation will not get the Government anywhere.  Some Deputy spoke about activities in Crumlin.  The activities which will follow this Bill will be wholesale evictions, to which I have never been and never will be a party. I cannot subscribe to the Bill in any shape or form unless some clause giving the citizen a right of appeal is inserted. There is, as I say, no need whatever for a serious measure such as this and it would bring much greater advantage to the Government if, instead of taking the action they are taking, they helped these people. Deputy Mulcahy has said that when the Government make mistakes, they come in with legislation to rectify those mistakes, and, as he also pointed out, they always stretch their arms a little wider so as to include the innocent as well as the guilty, and this is <Col N="340" /> a Bill which is likely to give more dictatorial powers to the Government, and we have too much dictation at present.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill by which the allottee can appeal for proper consideration of the merits of his case.  It is a deplorable state of affairs that a civil servant from the Land Commission should be able to go into a poor man's holding and tell him whether his farm is being worked on a basis of good husbandry or not. Civil servants know nothing about whether land is worked properly or not beyond what they may have got at a university or from their reading. There should be some appeal tribunal set up so that local evidence as to the manner in which an allottee has worked his land and as to his circumstances could be completely gone into.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister this question: When he has got all these powers and he comes to exercise them, where will he put all the unfortunate people whom he will evict?  What provision does he propose to make for them? Are they to join the tramps and tinkers we have at present?  Are they to be compelled to go to Dun Laoghaire or Rosslare and await sailing tickets to emigrate to England or other countries?  Where will he put them if the doors of the various poorhouses are not opened to them?  I can see no provision for these people who are to be penalised, and, before accepting a Bill of this nature, I, as one Deputy, want to be satisfied as to the conditions which are likely to follow from it.</P>
    <P>I may add that when I learned that we were to have a Land Bill, I expected that much greater powers would be sought for, that the Government would seek powers of a helpful and not of a destructive nature.  The powers being sought here are powers which are likely to damage the citizen, but no powers are sought for of a kind suitable to deal with individuals in my constituency of the type of Mr. Davy Frame, who is already putting people on the roadside, grabbing any big farm he can get, and turning over oceans of money at the expense of the poor small farmers, Old I.R.A. men, and ex-Army men, who are prepared to work <Col N="341" /> the land if the Government will come to their assistance and give them portions of land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise the subject matter of question No. 18 on to-day's Order Paper on the adjournment this evening. This is a matter of grave principle.  It concerns a vital service in the country, the making and maintaining of the roads, a service which can give stable employment and can bring in its train a number of happy, comfortable homes throughout the country in which we could say that there was some chance for a man and his wife to rear a family in a state of Christian comfort and Christian contentment.  The Minister for Local Government has taken up the attitude that he will not allow the men working on the roads in South Tipperary to be paid more than 40/- a week.  Over a long period he has resisted the unanimous pressure of the members of the South Tipperary County Council.  They have pressed him time after time, even to the extent of half a dozen of them wanting to come to Dublin to make representations to the Minister himself on the subject.  The number of people involved will show that this is the kind of work that is vital and necessary, and that can give stable employment. In the period from January to October last, 406 men on the average were employed as ordinary road workers, 22 were employed as yard staff, 27 were employed as gangers, and 28 were employed as sub-gangers, and 80 were employed as carters.  On the 1st April, 1939, the labourers were paid 35/- a week.  Some time in 1940 their wages were raised to 38/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> In the beginning of 1945, following a discussion at a meeting of the South Tipperary County Council, the Manager made an order increasing the general road workers' wages by 4/- a week.  That would have the effect of bringing their wages from 38/- to 42/-, and increasing the carters' wages by 6/- a week.  The Minister for Local Government refused to give permission to the Manager in South Tipperary to add 4/- a week to the road workers' wages, and thus bring them up to 42/-. He graciously agreed to allow them 2/- a week, and from that time their wages were fixed at 40/- a week.  When I asked, on the 10th October last, why the Minister had taken that action he replied that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tipperary (S.R.) County is one of the counties where the rate paid to road workers had been higher than the agricultural rate, and in view of the national importance of agriculture it was laid down that the rates for agricultural labour should be preferential. To permit a higher rate for road works would only encourage the seeking of employment on road work to the disadvantage of agricultural work.  Accordingly, an additional temporary emergency bonus not exceeding 2/- a week was approved for road workers from the 1st April last when the proposal of the local authority to grant an increase of 4/- a week to road labourers and 6/- to certain other road employees had been received.  The road workers' wages had already been increased by emergency bonuses to 38/- so that the additional bonuses sanctioned brought their wages up to the agricultural level of 40/- a week.  In the case of carters, the bonus rate was sanctioned so as bring their pay to 12/6 per day, the maximum rate prevailing in other rural areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 30th, May the county council unanimously asked the Minister favourably to reconsider the matter, and determined that, on receipt of the Minister's reply they would come to a special meeting of the council to deal with the matter.  On the 11th July, they urged that a deputation consisting of six members of the council would be allowed to come to Dublin to meet the <Col N="343" /> Minister.  The Minister would not allow it.</P>
    <P>On the 22nd August they gave up all hope of influencing the Minister, and they unanimously called on the T.D.s for Tipperary to raise the question generally as to why the Minister had turned down the unanimous wishes of the Tipperary County Council.  They declared that, in their minds, the action taken was entirely contrary to democratic principles and was an actual infringement of the Constitution. They were driven to do that by reason of the fact that they could not continue to look at the conditions under which the road workers in South Tipperary were labouring in which a man and his wife and two children had to live on 40/- a week.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to-day if he realised that 40/- to-day was worth about 13/4 pre the 1914 war.  I asked him whether any consideration had been given, or any estimate made, that would enable him to say that it was possible for a man to maintain his wife and two children on that amount. His answer to that, although he has got an additional request from the South Tipperary Council urging that an additional 6/- be given, was that he had nothing to add to what he had said on the 10th October last.  Do we agree that a necessary service run by the public bodies in the various counties to provide good roads for transport, giving stable employment to a corps of workers, should have sufficient wages to enable them to settle down to make a living and to rear their families?  I want to get an answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that.  If we accept it that a service of that kind should enable men to provide homes in which to rear their families, then we ought to ask, what are the wages they are getting, and if these wages, by any kind of just examination, are such as will enable those men to rear their families.  I again put these two questions to the Parliamentary Secretary, and say that I am entitled to have an answer to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister fears that workers in agriculture might be drawn to work on the roads if the wages paid to road <Col N="344" /> workers were excessively high, but surely there are other occupations calling men to other countries from a vital service such as the maintenance of the roads.  I am not discussing to-day the idea of agricultural wages being down to 40/-.  I am talking of a vital permanent service that is there and that ought to be discussed on its own merits.  If those men, not able to tolerate looking at their wives and the misery of their families on 40/- a week, want to better themselves they can get 70/- a week at agricultural work in Great Britain.  If they want to join the British Army from the 1st July this year they can get 77/- per week.  A trained soldier with a wife can get 77/- a week, plus a soldier's feeding, with upkeep and clothing.</P>
    <P>What does that mean when we reduce it to terms of real wages?  In this country the cost of living has risen to 298, nearly three times what it was in 1914.  In Great Britain the cost is 203, twice what it was in 1914. So that, when we compare the wages that are paid to a road worker here with the wages paid to an agricultural worker in Great Britain or the wages that will be paid to a soldier in Great Britain as from the 1st July next, we find that for every 5/- the agricultural worker in Great Britain is getting the road worker here gets 2/- to live on&mdash;that is, instead of getting 70/- a week where the cost of living is only twice what it was in 1914, they are asked to live on 40/- a week where the cost of living is three times what it was in 1914&mdash;and if they join the British Army, on the new rates of pay, for every 5/- they get there, apart from their keep, including housing, clothing and food, they would get only 1/9 here.</P>
    <P>If the Minister feels that these men are so sensitive that they would transfer from agricultural work in Ireland to road work for the sake of 1/- or 2/- in the week, how does he think that they can be so insensitive as not to go and join the British Army on the one hand or to agricultural work in Great Britain on the other, where there is such a demand for workers and where it is felt that if <Col N="345" /> agricultural wages are not raised to £4 10s. a week there will be an exodus of workers from agriculture to manufacturing work?</P>
    <P>A road worker in South Tipperary who received 35/- a week before the war began is now asked to live on 40/- a week.  His wages have been increased by 5/- while the cost of living here has increased by seven times that figure.  Let us take the position with regard to workers in other industries in this country.  We have particulars only up to 1944.  Additional increases have been given in quite a number of other industries during 1945.  According to official returns, men working in the bacon industry had an average weekly earning in 1944 of 71/-, having got an increase of 9/- a week since the war began.  Those working on boots and shoes earned 70/10 a week, representing an increase of 13/11.  In the brewing industry, the average earnings in 1944 were 89/8, an increase of 13/6 over the pre-war rates.</P>
    <P>The comparative figures in distilling were 71/10 a week, representing an increase of 11/10; in leather work, 74/-, an increase of 21/10; housing 76/11, an increase of 22/9; linen and cotton, 61/- an increase of 15/5; malting, 62/1, an increase of 8/11; shirtmaking, 68/7, an increase of 9/7; sugar and sugar confectionery, 75/6, an increase of 13/6; woollens, 65/6, an increase of 21/-.  All down along there are increases of 21/-, 15/-, 27/4, 11/8, 16/11, 15/10, in respect of other industries in the country, by 1944, and other increases have been given since.  I think everybody knows that the conditions of workers rearing their families to-day on the wages quoted for these industries are not very happy, that most of them have run into debt and that very few of them are satisfied with the kind of living they are giving their families.</P>
    <P>With regard to the conditions in Tipperary, a recent report of the county medical officer for North Tipperary is to the effect that although farm labourers' wages have gone up and, to a smaller extent, the wages of county council workers have gone up, such increases are not sufficient to meet the increased cost of clothing, food and bedclothes, and he points out that there <Col N="346" /> are few houses in the county, of working class type, where bed clothes and equipment of that particular kind are not sadly wanted.  The condition of poverty in these people's homes has come under the notice of the county medical officer.</P>
    <P>We want good work done on the roads because the roads are a vital service. There is permanent employment there. That permanent employment should support comfortable homes.  What is probably happening to-day is that any men worth having on the roads are either gone away or will go away as soon as they can, and our road work will be badly done, and we will be left with the problem that it will take a very considerable amount of money to bring our roads back to a decent condition.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister for Local Government on this matter is almost impossible to understand in view of all the measures that are being taken at present for the prevention of disease, curing disease, setting up a big structure of hospitalisation, organisation of doctors, organisation of nurses in order to cure and prevent disease while, by his own Order, over the whole country, in relation to a corps of workers that we must have permanently there, he is preventing families from having an income that would enable them to feed and clothe themselves properly.  The question that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are up against is quite simple.  This is a vital service, giving permanent employment to a corps of men that, in South Tipperary, is nearly 600 strong.  Many of them work under difficult conditions.  Many of them have to go six, seven and eight miles to their work in varying kinds of weather.  The conditions in South Tipperary are typical of those all over the country.  These men are kept down to a wage that I ask the Minister to justify in terms of being able to keep a family on it.  If in a vital service, in respect of a corps that we must have permanently with us, we cannot say that it is possible to have families living in comfortable, permanent, Christian conditions, then I do not know what we are doing; I do not know what we have a Government for; <Col N="347" /> I do not know why we are making all the grand national declarations we make from time to time.</P>
    <P>That is a question that has to be answered and if we are going to sneer at people because they are leaving the country and not serving the country, I ask the Minister on what ground does he justify demanding of a man to stay at home, in the interests of his nation, and work for 2/- or 1/9 when he can get 5/- in Great Britain.  These are questions that the Minister must answer.  He must also answer this question: In a matter vitally concerning the well-being and the Christian life of our families, when the whole personnel of a county council make serious representations and show by their earnestness that they mean what they say, why should a Minister, simply by a stroke of his pen, say he is not going to allow them to do it, he is not going to see them, he is not going to give us any answer in this House except a few meaningless words that he spoke to us some months ago?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the question raised on the adjournment, I wish first of all to say that I have no intention of discussing here to-night the general question of what should be the ideal rate of basic minimum wages in this country.  The question we are discussing is one relating to the wages of South Tipperary road workers.  But I would say in passing, since Deputy Mulcahy has shown such heat, that I think this Government have demonstrated that they have done all they possibly could to overcome the difficulties arising during the emergency among the class of workers <Col N="348" /> who are the subject of this debate.  I think that the support we have received from the people, particularly in the last general election, demonstrates that we have no desire to crush any section of the community, but that we try to assist and promote the interests of every section of the community. Having made that general observation, I will now come to the question we have at hand.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Minister for Local Government is that road workers' wages must be related finally and emphatically to agricultural workers' wages; that there should be no departure from that general principle.  The type of work which is most comparative with road labourers' work is the unskilled agricultural labourers' work, the ordinary type of agricultural work. It is our policy not to cause competition for labour to arise by permitting the road workers' rate of wages to rise substantially above the rate of agricultural labourers' wages.  For this purpose, we must make the assumption that the men who make the decision on the Agricultural Wages Board do so with an earnest sympathy for both interests concerned; that the farmers and agricultural labourers who come to these meetings consider the general position, consider what can be paid to agricultural labourers.  If members of the Dáil consider that the board is not working efficiently and successfully, it is for them to raise the matter on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture. The Minister for Local Government feels very strongly that there must be a definite relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of South Tipperary, Deputy Mulcahy has given the actual figures in relation to the rise in wages since the emergency.  At the beginning of the emergency, the rate of wages for road workers in Tipperary was higher than in many other counties where there was as great prosperity. It was 35/-.  It has been raised to 40/-.  In February, 1945, there was a further demand for an increase which would bring the wage to 42/-.  At that time the manager pointed out that road workers were paid 9½d. per hour for a 48-hour week, whereas agricultural workers were paid 9d. per hour <Col N="349" /> for a 54-hour week and that he doubted whether the request would be granted.  The members of the county council moved an additional estimate for £4,100 for increases in wages.  The vote on that occasion was: 9 for the resolution, 4 against, and three not voting, indicating that there was not, even at that time, an absolute spirit of unanimity when it came to facing the fact of the imposition on the rates. On the 25th April, a bonus of 2/- a week was granted, the remainder being refused, and carters were granted a bonus of 3/- a week.  The deputation requested was refused on the ground that no special case could be made for County Tipperary as compared with other counties.</P>
    <P>The position is that at present in Dublin County 54/- a week is paid, and that in five counties 40/- a week is paid. As I said, they are basic wages.  In 11 counties 39/- is paid, and in the remainder 38/- or below.  The reason for the particular increase in Tipperary being granted was that in counties where workers were previously deprived of a bonus because the wages were already, comparatively speaking, close to the agricultural level, it was felt to be unfair that they should be deprived of some increase.  That is one of the reasons for the fact that in five counties the wages are 40/-.  The increase since 1939 in a great many counties has been as much as 30 per cent.  It has been round about 14 per cent. in cases where the rate was already at a substantially higher level; that is to say, that in the counties where the rate was 35/- in August, 1939, the increase has not been so noticeable as in the many counties where the wage was only 28/- to 30/- and was raised to 39/-.  It will be found that this increase compared to some degree with the increase offered for employment in other minor positions in connection with county council employees.</P>
    <P>The following facts should be borne in mind in connection with the Minister's decision.  As I said, there has been no recent proposal for an increase in agricultural workers' wages by the Agricultural Wages Board, except in regard to overtime, in which there has <Col N="350" /> been an increase to 1/1 for over 54 hours and 1/4 on Sunday.  As I said before, road workers work 48 hours approximately, as compared with 54 hours in the case of agricultural workers.  There has also been no noticeable demand for an increase in the rate of wages paid to turf workers &mdash;I speak of the basic rate paid to the ordinary adult turf worker, not to specialists&mdash;which at present averages round about 42/- per week.  In connection with the demand for increases in respect of road workers' wages, in the last four months we have had demands for increases from three counties, where the county manager made a preliminary order, and in four counties resolutions of a general character were passed, but were not subject to an order by the manager.  Therefore, there have been no substantial or noticeable demands from county authorities as a whole in respect of road workers.</P>
    <P>The average period of employment in South Tipperary County Council for the 402 regular workers was 45 weeks, and for the 340 part-time workers, 20 weeks.  As to the comparative position of road workers and agricultural workers, they are both liable to similar conditions.  Both agricultural workers and road workers, in many cases, have to go some distance to their work.  The road worker only workers 48 hours, whereas the agricultural worker works 54 hours.  In some cases, the agricultural workers live in, in others not. Both agricultural workers and road workers are subject to broken time.  In both cases the employers adopt varying principles in regard to the payment of broken time for days on which the weather does not permit of work.  There are equally varying conditions in regard to the general position.  Some of them have plots attached to their houses, some have not such plots.  They both benefit very largely from social services so greatly increased by the present Government.</P>

      <P>The Government's position is, now that the emergency is over and materials are coming into greater supply, we shall review continually this question.  It is not the desire of the Minister for Local Government or of the Government as a whole that workers should be paid anything but the highest wage the community can afford.  But, at the present time, we have to envisage an increase of expenditure on roads now that materials are available which will be reflected in an increase in the rates.  In County Clare, for example, rates have <Col N="352" /> already been increased by half a crown, largely owing to trying to get back to the amount of road work done in the normal way in 1938-39.  It would be quite possible for too hasty a decision to be taken in the matter of the Government's attitude towards road workers' wages and the stabilisation Order and might have the effect of causing disemployment in the agricultural community because of the increase of wages to those employed by farmers.  Therefore, the position will require careful and continual review.</P>
