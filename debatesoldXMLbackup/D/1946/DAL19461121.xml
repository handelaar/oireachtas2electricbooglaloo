    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Lynch Dr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if candidates for medical vacancies, under the Local Appointments Commission, are entitled to know: (a) the professional qualifications and experience taken into account by the commissioners; and (b) the system of marking adopted by the commission in filling such vacancies; and if not, if he will give the reasons why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations, etc., supplied by the Local Appointments Commissioners to candidates for medical appointments give them information both as to the qualifications and experience prescribed as essential for the particular position and (in general terms) the qualifications and experience which though not essential are regarded as very desirable and would be taken into account by the commissioners. To that extent candidates are informed of the professional qualifications and experience taken into account by the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commissioners regard it as of vital importance that the marking systems on which the merits of candidates are assessed should be treated as strictly confidential by the Local Appointments Commission and by the large number of professional men and others who give their services as members of interview boards.  If these marking systems were communicated to candidates the inevitable result would be a demand by them for particulars of assessments made in their <Col N="1250" /> regard under the various headings. Their professional fellows who had acted on the boards would consequently be exposed to criticism by the candidates and embarrassment.  It would be too much to hope that under such circumstances they would continue to be willing to act and the commissioners would almost certainly be deprived of the valuable services of many eminent professional men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, where in effect Irish is an indispensable qualification for a dispensary or medical appointment, does he not think that that should be stated plainly in the conditions so that men of comparative distinction in their professional field would not be recorded as presenting themselves for dispensary posts, and having persons of certainly no greater distinction preferred to them, not exclusively on professional grounds but substantially because the one professed to know Irish and the other did not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations, as far as Irish is concerned, have been read out by me on several occasions. The general conditions governing posts in which Irish is regarded as essential have been published and are well known, and I do not see why we should repeat them in a particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the case of certain dispensaries in the West of Ireland the importance attached to a knowledge of Irish seems to bulk larger than any other, with the result that there have been cases of doctors in pretty prominent positions offering themselves for dispensaries and of having men very much junior to them preferred, the explanation being that the junior spoke Irish better than the senior, thus creating the professional impression that the junior was more proficient than the senior man?  Is that fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to pass judgment on these cases.  What I do say is that the regulation with regard to Irish is well known <Col N="1251" /> generally.  It is known to the individual candidates who propose to present themselves, and is set out in the conditions governing the post which each candidate gets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Lynch Dr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that all candidates for medical appointments, under the Local Appointments Commission, must present themselves for interview by a selection board set up for that purpose; and whether, to obviate loss of time and expense, he will consider advising the commissioners to introduce a system, such as operates in the filling of similar vacancies elsewhere, whereby only a select list of candidates, who have some prospect of success, will be called for interview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that as stated by the Deputy the present practice is to call all candidates for interview. I am informed by the Local Appointments Commissioners, however, that they have at various times considered the possibility of adopting an alternative on the lines suggested by him; and that after careful consideration they have come to the conclusion that it would not be practicable to introduce a system of short-listing. Apart from certain administrative difficulties which would be involved it would be difficult to deny to any candidate claiming the required qualifications the opportunity of proving before the interview board the value of his qualifications and experience having regard to those of the other candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider that where Irish is an essential qualification for a medical post, it would be desirable to hold some kind of an eliminating test so that those who had no hope of qualifying on the language ground would be spared the experience of offering themselves for a professional competition and having to be under the obloquy of having someone preferred to them, as the public imagine, for professional reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent that the Deputy does not want to leave anything to the candidates themselves or to their own judgment in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach lays down a kind of general regulation with regard to the Local Appointments Commissioners.  There recently was at least one case where an engineering appointment was being made and the commissioners declined to allow a number of candidates to be interviewed.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the question as to why, in the cases of new appointments, certain arrangements could not be made that would obviate expense on the part of the people and the Taoiseach replies that they must all be allowed to go forward. Why are they not all allowed to go forward in the case of engineering appointments?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Local Appointments Commission.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Lynch Dr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that there is a certain amount of public criticism of the method by which vacancies are filled by the Local Appointments Commission; and whether, to allay such criticisms, he will consider the publication of the name, qualifications, marks, etc., of successful candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any public criticism of the kind referred to by the Deputy.  I will consider his suggestion that the names of successful candidates, together with a brief statement of the qualifications and experience of each of them should be supplied to the Press and I will ask the Local Appointments Commissioners to examine the matter in full.  It must be remembered, however, that the name of a successful candidate could not at any rate be published until the formal appointment has been made. This, as the Deputy knows, is done by the local authority and presumably in a great many cases publication actually takes place in the ordinary way at that stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the marks of candidates, this is a matter which it has always been the practice of the commissioners to treat as strictly confidential. As I have indicated in my reply to the Deputy's first question, the publication of marks would be embarrassing to the professional members of interview boards.  It must be remembered, also, that the candidates themselves are professional men and might consider it objectionable, from the point of view of their professional careers, to have publicity given to the marks awarded to them under detailed headings in respect of professional qualifications and experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is proposed to set up a commission of inquiry, as mentioned in his speech to the Dáil in July 11th, 1946, and <Col N="1254" /> reported in volume 102, column 749 of the Dáil Debates.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to move, in a week or two, for the setting up of a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad to inquire into the matters mentioned by me in the speech referred to by the Deputy.  The terms of reference of the committee will probably include the following matters:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to examine and report on the powers and privileges possessed by each House of the Oireachtas for the protection of itself and its members,</P>
      <P>(b) to advise as to what activities of members of each House, whether connected with their Parliamentary duties or otherwise, should be limited, and</P>
      <P>(c) to advise as to the procedure which should be adopted to bring to the notice of the House concerned alleged breaches of privilege or of the rules governing members' activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it seriously contended, Sir, by the Taoiseach that when members of his own Party become involved in questionable activities it is a suitable remedy to set up a commission to instruct the Opposition how to behave themselves?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention has been directed to the observations of Mr. Basil Henriques, at the East London Juvenile Court, on 11th November, 1946, in regard to two Irish girls, aged 15 and 16, found wandering in London with no means of subsistence; and whether he will investigate the circumstances in which these juveniles were permitted to go to England unprovided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the case referred to by the Deputy, and I have investigated the circumstances.</P>
      <P>These two girls applied for travel permits last August, and, the regulations being properly complied with, the applications were granted in the normal course.</P>
      <P>The making of proper provision for the material and moral welfare of minors applying for travel permits is fundamentally the responsibility of the parents, who are the natural guardians. Travel permit applications from minors are not granted unless they are accompanied by a written declaration by the parents stating that they know of and consent to the application.  In the two cases referred to in the question, the required declarations by the parents were furnished with the applications, the declaration in each case specifying the name of the person to whose employment the minor was going.</P>
      <P>The magistrate who heard the case is quoted as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Tell other girls in Ireland not to come over here and expect us to help them when they are on the rocks, as we have done with you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope that the facts of this case, and the observations of the magistrate, will serve as a warning and that parents whose children think of going to employment outside the country will bear them in mind before consenting to the applications for travel facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, would it not be well before granting travel facilities to children of 15 years of age to recommend very strongly to the parents of girls of that age that they should not send them to England unless they themselves are satisfied that there is in England a relative or intimate friend prepared to accept responsibility for their moral and material welfare while in England?  Does not the Taoiseach think that in future some more elaborate machinery should be laid down in order to bring home to parents in this country the grave dangers in sending children abroad unless there are friends or relatives to look after them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the formal obtaining of the consent of the parents to an application of that kind ought to be sufficient.  I agree that it is most undesirable that young girls should go over to positions in such circumstances.  I hope the publicity given to this case will act as a deterrent to the parents and lead them seriously to consider whether it is right to send young girls to a strange country in such circumstances.  From time to time I myself have got deplorable accounts of what has happened in cases of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Taoiseach think that it is of vital importance to ensure that Irish parents are fully alive to this aspect&mdash;that is, even where they are sending their children to group jobs, the children should be under the care of a relative or an intimate friend to whom they could have recourse in the event of their dismissal?  I think some suggestion along those lines ought to be made to the parents before they are permitted to send their children abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into the matter to see whether it is possible to have something done in that direction. These declarations in present circumstances are made before the Guards and it may be possible in future to have the Guards instructed to issue a warning when the declarations are being signed.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the purchase of pigs at Kanturk pig market did not commence until 10 a.m. on the 4th November and that wagons were ready for loading at mid-day. There were insufficient wagons in the southern district to provide for the Newmarket cattle fair held on the 9th November.  Arrangements were made to send wagons by special train from Dublin.  This train left at 8.55 p.m. on the previous evening but did not reach Mallow till 4.55 p.m. on the fair day owing to inferior fuel.  When Cork was notified that this train would be late, steps were taken immediately to clear and disinfect the wagons coming in during the night from other fairs. These wagons were despatched by special train which reached Newmarket at 5.30 p.m.  The company could not have avoided the inconvenience caused by the breakdown.

      <P>The facilities to which the Deputy refers are ordinarily granted up to about the middle of October.  I am aware of the considerations mentioned by the Deputy, and because of the bad weather this year petrol allowances for the haulage of turf to private individuals in the turf area were made available up to a much later date than usual.  In addition, however, to the transport difficulties which ordinarily occur about this time, the supply position in the greater part of the turf area requires that available turf supplies be marketed through fuel merchants and diverted to the areas where they are most required.  For these reasons, I am unable to restore petrol allowances for turf haulage to private domestic users in areas in which such allowances have now been withdrawn.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is prepared to introduce a scheme whereby business people will be licensed to stamp business correspondence, the amount of postage to be collected from the licensee, similar to the scheme which operates in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Licences are at present issued to business people to stamp outward correspondence by means of postage meter franking machines. The Deputy may, however, have in mind the introduction of a business <Col N="1278" /> reply service under which business firms or persons desiring to obtain replies from clients without putting them to the expense of paying postage would send out with their circulars, etc., unstamped reply cards or envelopes of a special pattern which could be returned unstamped, the postage being collected from the original sender by the Post Office.  The question of providing a service of this nature has been considered recently but the inquiries made by the Department indicated that the public support forthcoming would not be sufficient to warrant its introduction.  The matter is, however, being kept under review.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why John Clerkin was dismissed from his post as temporary postman at Cortubber, County Monaghan, and John Duffy appointed in his place; and whether he is satisfied that John Duffy fulfils the conditions attaching to this appointment, in respect of health, and knowledge of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>When a part-time postman vacancy arose some months ago at Cortubber, John Clerkin, a single man of 23 years of age, was employed temporarily pending recruitment through the local employment exchange. The only candidate nominated by the exchange was John Duffy, a married man with five young children, and he was, accordingly, employed in place of Mr. Clerkin.  Mr. Duffy's health has been satisfactory since the commencement of his employment. There is no medical examination for temporary postmen, but as he was a road worker with no unfavourable report as to his health, the question did not arise.</P>
      <P>As Cortubber is not scheduled as an Irish-speaking or even partly Irish-speaking district, a knowledge of Irish is not an essential qualification for employment in that office.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the application form prescribed for applicants for this office stipulated that the two requirements were good health and a knowledge of Irish?  Is he <Col N="1279" /> further aware that Mr. Clerkin, who was dismissed, has no other income, whereas Mr. Duffy lives in a house where there is coming in 12/6 to his grandfather, 12/6 to his grandmother, £2 to himself, national health insurance of 9/- to his wife, family allowances of 10/-, two sons on direct labour, £4 2s. 0d., making £8 6s. 0d. altogether?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this new measure which is in accord with a motion put down by the Party of which I am a member, the National Labour Party, as far back as 14th November, 1945, and again in January of this year. I was surprised by the attitude taken up yesterday by members of the Fine Gael and Clann na Talmhan Parties. One would think that the Bill had come as a complete surprise to them.  This Bill is long overdue.  Inside the House and throughout the country, there has been an agitation for better social services, and it is a great surprise to me that there should be any opposition to a Bill designed to benefit old age pensioners, widows and orphans, blind pensioners and national health insurance recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> When the motion I referred to was moved last November, the Taoiseach said he would bring a White Paper before the House.  He did so, and I am glad to see that the new Minister for Social Welfare will take full responsibility for these most deserving sections of the community.  I listened to Deputy Allen yesterday opposing the Bill, although he defended the managerial system in the Wexford County Council and when we bring up certain matters, he tells us that they are not matters for us to discuss.  He is beginning to worry now, having voted for the managerial Act, about the powers which members of local bodies have.</P>
    <P>The national health insurance system undoubtedly requires revision.  It is a system under which the sick get such low allowances as 15/- and 7/6, and if the Minister did no more than to improve that position and to improve the lot of the old age pensioners, the people who have no one to look after them, whose sons and daughters have probably emigrated and for whom the only place is the county home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They have been improved in Northern Ireland; they have been improved in Great Britain; and they have been improved in New Zealand.  Now that the emergency has passed, money is available which can be applied to the <Col N="1288" /> improvement of the plight of this deserving section.  I am interested in the people from whom I sprang, the poor and the downtrodden, and I do not mind if the House decides to appoint a second Taoiseach.  I want to see the position of these people improved and I should be happy to leave this House, if I were never to enter it again, if I saw the position of the old age pensioners, blind pensioners, widows and orphans and national health insurance recipients bettered.</P>

Deputy Dillon is always a bird alone, an independent man who can say what he likes.  I welcome the Bill if it is intended to appoint new Ministers with a definite assurance that this is the first step towards the establishment of social services inspired as by the Christian principle of justice to the poor.  After being here for so many years, I think it is about time that Deputies on all sides of the House should stop bickering.  If there is something to be done, let it be done for this section of the people.  Then you can say you have done a good day's work for the country and for those people who are in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons which Deputy O'Leary has given in support of the Bill are the very reasons which I am going to advance against the acceptance of the Bill.  I readily agree that Deputies are at a great disadvantage in discussing this Bill, because we do not know what the appointment of these two Ministers will lead to.  As I see this Bill, and after reading the Minister's speech very carefully, I think it is merely copying certain suggestions made by the Most Reverend Dr. Dignan without going into the details which he went into.  This Bill simply means, in effect, that the person who formerly occupied the position of Parliamentary Secretary is now to get the status of a Minister, with this difference, that possibly his salary will <Col N="1290" /> be somewhat increased, but without any guarantee that the work on which he has been engaged will be more efficiently carried out as a result of receiving more salary.  Of course, in the natural order, we may assume that those who occupy the position of Parliamentary Secretaries will in a very short space of time occupy the positions of Ministers.  I think that may be taken for granted.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what change, if any, so far as these services are concerned, will be effected.  We are a very funny type of people in this country.  We like changes simply for the sake of changing.  But changes may not always be profitable.  Deputy O'Leary referred to down-trodden people.  Although I am not a member of either of the Labour Parties, I think I can speak on behalf of the working classes, the decent hard-working classes who possibly were not born with a silver spoon in their mouths.  I resent this habit of always appealing to the State for everything.  It would be a poor country if we had to look to the State for everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, this Bill will do nothing more or less than give a new name, the name of Minister, to the two Parliamentary Secretaries.  The Minister has narrated the various services over which he has had control both in regard to public health and social services. It was a very formidable list. No matter what may be said to the contrary, I think that the Minister has carried out his duties fairly well during the past few years.  After all, is not the Minister just a figure-head in most cases, the real work being done by the men behind the scenes?  If we were to have enumerated on paper every little item, many people would say: &ldquo;How does that man get through all the work he gets through?&rdquo; But it is got through.  Consequently, I cannot see the necessity for this change. Could not the work be just as well done by a man calling himself Parliamentary Secretary as a man calling himself Minister?  A commander-in-chief may command an army of 10,000. He could just as easily command an army of 500,000.  He might have more officers under him when commanding <Col N="1291" /> an army of 500,000.  In the same way, a man doing a job costing £5,000 could carry out a job costing £50,000 or £100,000.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say that this Bill is not going to effect very much change so far as the running of these services is concerned because, with the means at their disposal, things have been done very well.  Of course, at times we get somewhat irritable at the delay in regard to the sanctioning of housing schemes, etc.  I do not want to go into that, although some Deputies have referred to it.  The fact is that we have not got the materials to build houses.  The only fault I have to find with the Government is that they have not the moral courage to admit that and to get away from this policy of self-sufficiency.  We have not as much timber in this country as would make a decent pig-trough. Why not admit that and then we would be satisfied?  My opinion with regard to these services is that we will not have any more efficiency.  So far as the means at the disposal of those in charge go, they are just efficient enough.  We cannot get things done overnight.  It will require time, money and patience to overcome the difficulties which confront us.  It will take years.</P>
    <P>We had a big drive here with regard to tuberculosis a year or two ago.  We have dropped it now like the proverbial hot spud.  At the moment, it is almost impossible to get a patient into a sanatorium because they are all overcrowded.  Because of the scare raised on that occasion, hospitals will not now take in patients suffering from any infectious disease.  Therefore, we have the position to-day that hundreds of people are unable to get into a hospital.  I do not say that it is the fault of the Minister for Local Government and his Department.  It is due to the fact that proper provision has not been made.  All that will take time. It is not a question of money.  It is because we have not got the materials in this country to proceed with the erection of the three regional hospitals which it has been decided to erect. Therefore at the moment I feel that the setting up of these two new <Col N="1292" /> Ministries will not affect the services or the people to whom Deputy O'Leary has referred.  The Minister, possibly, in introducing a later Bill, may give us an outline as to whether the proposed new Ministers will do all the grand things that Deputy O'Leary envisages. I know that the progress they will make will be pro rata to the resources of the country, no more and no less. For instance, I cannot see that Deputy Childers as Parliamentary Secretary would not be just as effective and efficient as Deputy Childers when he becomes a Minister, if he is appointed to fill one of these posts.  Except in the matter of remuneration, I cannot see any difference.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that, at the moment, I object to the appointment of these two new Ministers, especially in regard to social welfare.  The Minister referred to moneys provided out of national and local taxation.  In other words, the public bodies will have to subscribe and make up any difference. I do not know what the Minister means by that, and I should like to have some guidance from the Minister as to what burden the setting up of this new Ministry will place upon the local bodies, compared with the burden they have borne up to the present.  So far as I am concerned, I do not anticipate that any appreciable improvement will be achieved.  If it should take place I will be one of the first to admit it, but I feel that the work is being done as efficiently at the moment as it will be under the new Ministries.  There will be the same officials.  I cannot see any difference.  I am sure that they in their loyalty would work as well for a man calling himself Parliamentary Secretary as for a man enjoying the status of Minister.  That is the whole Bill, in a nutshell, simply a change from a Parliamentary Secretary to a Minister. We need not go into all the details and the Ceann Comhairle has ruled that we cannot go into them.  I do wish our friends of the Labour Party would give up the idea that legislation is going to make our people healthy and happy.  It is not.</P>

But there is no reason why the whole country should be shown up as being pauperised and down-trodden.  It is not.  We do the best we can for the people, especially for the people referred to by Deputy O'Leary, but let them get away from the idea that legislation is going to make this country prosperous or that legislation on the lines suggested here, even with the best intentions, is going to make our people healthy overnight. That will take time, patience and money and it is not going to be done through the medium of this Bill.</P>

      <P>There is one aspect of this question to which I have not heard any reference and I do not know whether this is an appropriate time to raise it or whether the Minister when replying will be able to deal with it. It seems to me that a natural corollary to the segregation of functions at the top is a somewhat similar segregation locally.  I am interested in the administrative problem in relation to these services in County Galway.  It is a very large county and one of the largest administrative units.  Apart altogether from what is now proposed, it has always seemed desirable that there should be some geographical subdivision or some apportionment of the administration in a functional way in County Galway.  There seems to be sufficient consensus of opinion in the Dáil for segregation at the top and I consider that more cogent reasons can be put forward for a corresponding division locally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, to the two Ministries, if you do not mind my using the different term.  They are Ministries that will be administering local government in all its aspects.  I do not want to tie the Minister down.  That would be unfair, because I have not seen any reference to this matter in his opening statement.  I know it is opening up a question that has not been referred to, so far as I know, but I do not think it is irrelevant or entirely novel.  I would ask the Minister, if he has considered the matter and if he thinks the time opportune, to let us have the benefit of his views when replying to this debate.  It seems to me to be a peculiar arrangement that you would have one manager in County Galway and that you would have the same arrangement applying to a much smaller administrative unit.  No matter how efficient a man may be, it is not possible for him to exercise efficiently the functions of a manager in respect of every service in a large unit such as County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore I think the question of having three separate functional bodies in, we will say, County Galway, corresponding to these three Ministries, ought to be considered.  The ordinary local government services which are to be retained under the Minister for Local Government could be retained, as at present, under the county council.  Then, I take it, the county council, as they do now in the election of committees of agriculture and vocational education and as they used to do in respect of the board of health, would set up bodies to deal with the social welfare services and the public health services and, in pursuance thereof, it would be necessary to find a good medical administrator for the public health services.  There is a scheme of organisation at the present time dealing with public health services but I do not think the present county medical officers of health exercise all the powers and functions that they ought to have if the Minister's <Col N="1295" /> intentions in respect of the reorganisation of the health services are to be effective.  I do not think I should labour the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate a good deal of criticism has been directed against the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I am not inclined to agree with the criticism that the Department has failed.  The Department of Local Government had to deal with problems from every county and was unable to cope with the situation that presented itself to it. I think that it was overburdened with work.  I am satisfied there is a need for the establishment of the new Ministries. That will mean that the local authorities will have more direct contact with the new Departments than they had with the Department of Local Government.  I can say from my experience, in dealing with the Department of Local Government, that I have never received anything but the greatest courtesy, as well as any information that I required from the officials there.  If the work got into arrears I am of opinion that was due to the fact that the Department was overburdened with work.  The Department of Local Government is different from any other State Department in this respect that it has to deal with local government administration in every county in the State.  I do not think the establishment of the new Ministries will mean any great increase in taxation.  At present we have two Parliamentary Secretaries to the Minister for Local Government, so that if they are made the heads of two new Departments they will be able to make direct contact with the local bodies, and I think that will be more satisfactory from every point of view.  If the new Departments, in their dealings with the local authorities, give more consideration to <Col N="1296" /> the opinions of the members of them, then I think the work will not get into arrears.</P>
      <P>We are inclined to grumble locally about housing and other matters, but Deputies must not forget that the present Department of Local Government had to deal with housing and all other questions, so far as these were concerned with the various local authorities throughout the country. I would like to know from the Minister whether, when the new Ministries are set up, it will mean that we will have to have a large county council and that in turn, it will select committees to function under the three different Departments that will then be dealing with local government, health and social services.  I take it that the Department of Local Government will continue to deal with roads.  I should also like to know whether the existing county managers will be able to deal with the three new Departments, or will it follow from the passing of this Bill that a local authority, will have to appoint three assistant managers in a county in order that the three Departments may function?  I have a good deal of experience in local administration, and I fail to see how the proposals in this Bill are going to work smoothly unless you have assistant managers or secretaries appointed under the county manager to deal with each Department&mdash;local government, public health, and social services.  If the county manager is expected to do all the work I am afraid he will not be able to cope with it.  I may not be in order in referring to this, but I am anxious to know if all that will mean a considerable increase in taxation, so far as the local authority is concerned.

      <P>I am afraid that will mean an increase, to a great extent, in local taxation.  On the one hand we have the Minister piloting a Bill through the House for the relief of rates, and on the other hand we have him piloting this Bill which may mean <Col N="1297" /> an increase in the rates.  I should like to have an explanation from the Minister as to the position so far as the local authorities are concerned. My personal opinion is that, if we had a Minister to deal with social services, it would be sufficient.  I think that every member of a local council will agree that at present the Department of Local Government and Public Health is overburdened with work.  For that reason, I would support the appointment of a Minister for Social Services because the local authorities would then have more direct contact with headquarters in Dublin.  I am in some doubt as to whether the local bodies will be able to function through the three Departments proposed and I should like to have an explanation from the Minister on that aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>When speaking on a measure of this sort there is a certain temptation to go wide of the mark. What is before us is the question as to the advisability of setting up two new Ministries.  I think it is within the scope of the debate to consider that question (a) with respect to the present situation, and (b) with respect to what is visualised for the future.  If one approaches it in that way, I think one can hardly avoid going back a little into the past in order to get the picture in perspective.  I think I am in order in drawing attention the fact that the growth of the services now catered for largely by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, has been a gradual one, though very much accelerated in the last decade. When, originally, that Department was set up under the previous Government certain duties and functions were assigned to it, but if we compare its duties and functions, as originally contemplated, with the duties and functions that have, so to speak, now grown on to it, we find that there is a marked expansion.  We have, in fact, during relatively recent years come to accept the idea that it is the State's responsibility to provide for a number of social services and to legislate in greater detail for public health, on a wider basis than in previous times.  Twenty years ago schemes like children's allowances, <Col N="1298" /> schemes of national health insurance and of unemployment assistance&mdash;these and other schemes that are catered for in the Department of Local Government and Public Health and by other Departments now&mdash;were regarded as something outside the ordinary functions of government.  The idea that these things are the proper function of government has been a relatively recent growth.</P>
      <P>Now, with the acceptance of that idea, the duties devolving on the Minister and on his Department have increased and have become consequentially heavy.  The natural tendency has been, and I think the proper tendency, that where we introduced new services they were catered for by the existing machinery which was expanded to deal with them.  All the services that have been set up have involved an expansion in the Department of the Minister catering for them, but the ultimate result was, and is, that the Minister for Local Government finds that his Department on the public health side is faced with the administration of schemes which were hitherto not thought of, and which now necessitate an expansion in his Department. The Department of Industry and Commerce also is catering for certain social services that were not initially contemplated as part of the functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce and that necessitated an expansion in the administrative machinery of that Department too.  There have been expansions along other lines in that. Department as well, expansions of its primary purpose which make it more difficult for the Minister in question to attend to the details of the social services in his Department.  Up to a point such expansions are all right.  As you increase your social services and as you increase your public health schemes, you rapidly reach the point where your machinery has to be reorganised to cope with the increased work.  Any administrator will tell you that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A previous speaker drew an analogy with the Army.  I do not agree with his concept that the one commander-in-chief will cater for 500,000 men as well as 100,000.  That is not the fundamental idea.  What has happened in <Col N="1299" /> the history of the organisation of armies is that units have expanded to the limits of their useful size; a stage is reached when one can no longer continue to add to such units indefinitely and so one has to split them up into additional units.  There is a limit to the workable size of a unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The sphere of activity of the commander-in-chief will change.  He will govern the theatre of operations rather than the number of troops.  It is a totally different concept. It is not quite germane to what I am trying to demonstrate here. Having expanded in these Departments, you come to a stage where reorganisation is necessary.  In the Departments of Local Government and Public Health and Industry and Commerce we have now reached the stage where a reshuffle is necessary in the interests of efficiency.  What, for instance, is the Minister in question to do?  Let us take, first of all, Local Government and Public Health.  As indicated by the very name of that Department, the primary function of the Minister is the local government of the country and that local government is an extensive machinery requiring very careful handling and control and, it must always be remembered, a very sensitive machinery. Tacked on to that there is the function of public health.  Originally in the old days that was a very minor function indeed.  For all practical purposes it amounted merely to the provision of isolation in the case of smallpox, or plague, or some wildly rampant epidemic.  As time went on, however, other functions developed with the development of medical science and public health itself.  More administrative responsibility fell upon the Department. This added responsibility was something for which the Minister himself could not cater and that situation was met by the provision of Parliamentary Secretaries to cope with the particular expansion.  But the Parliamentary Secretary was merely a Parliamentary <Col N="1300" /> Secretary to a Minister.  It was the Minister who had the responsibility and it was the Minister who, in the collective body that is called the Government, had to answer for these functions and had to take the responsibility for them and advise the Government on crucial decisions as to policy and so on.  Local government and public health became divergent functions.  As local government increased in importance and administrative complexity it has become impossible for one Minister to give the same attention to what were heretofore sidelines but have now increased to the same importance as the original functions themselves.</P>
      <P>The question then arises as to what is to be done.  Surely, the commonsense thing to do is to make somebody else responsible and to limit the responsibility of the Minister to his own primary functions.  Such important functions as public health and social services should not be tacked on to such a Minister.  I think that is the key to the problem relative to the status.  In other words, should the responsibility be put into the hands of a Minister or left as heretofore under the jurisdiction of a Parliamentary Secretary?  We are all agreed that the functions of public health, on the one hand, and social services on the other have now reached the stage where it is desirable to have one man in charge of each, one man who on his own initiative and responsibility as a Minister can answer to this House and to the country, not merely as the agent for another Minister, but as a responsible Minister himself.  That is the fundamental question at issue.  In military terms again it is the difference between appointing a responsible commanding officer or trying to operate with a virtually anonymous staff officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come now to the question of the administration involved in the Departments.  Again, we have to look at history.  Due to the growth of ideas in relation to public health, the section of the Department of Local Government and Public Health which dealt with social services has now expanded under the schemes that have developed in the past and will expand further under the schemes which will be inaugurated in the future.  It is an unfortunate physical fact of our social organisation that when you develop services you must have staff to administer them. The growth which has already taken place in social services within the Department of Local Government and Public Health has virtually made the section responsible for its administration a Department within a Department. Having reached that stature, we must ask ourselves is it a good thing to leave it under a combined Ministry merely as a sub-section?  I think the time has come when it should strike out on its own, having achieved an importance commensurable with the importance of its parent Department. It is easier to deal with the question of public health at the moment rather than social services, because you have a choice of expanding the present subdepartment and leaving it under its present control or taking it out altogether and setting up a new Ministerial Department involving consequential expansion.  Which is better in the interests of the community and of the administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, in view of the fact that we have accepted that function as such an important one in our social life, the decision at this stage, it having reached maturity, to take it out, is a wise one. But it is false to say&mdash;it has been suggested rather than said in the course of a previous debate&mdash;that the setting up of this new Ministry of Health is, so to speak, the building up of a new Department from nothing to cater for certain aspects, and to that extent that it represents increased expenditure.  The same increased expenditure would come to cater for <Col N="1302" /> the service if you left it in its own Department.  In the main, it is merely a question of transferring a thing from the dominion of the parent Department to an autonomous position.  The difference in the expense involved is likely, one way or the other, to be very little.  I have no figures to guide me there, but on the assumption that you will cater for public health, as we hope to do, you will either have to expand the existing service or take the section out and expand it.</P>
    <P>In the matter of economy, I do not see an awful lot of difference.  If it is put up on its own and its limits defined, there may be a better chance of exercising strict control and seeing that economies are effected.  That is too far beyond me at the moment and I have not the data on which to express an opinion, but I think I am warranted in going as far as I have gone.</P>
    <P>As regards social services, there is a somewhat similar position, but it is more complex, because you have some in one Department and some in another Department, as the Minister pointed out.  In other words, the function of social services is distributed over different Ministers, each Minister having a different primary function.  Surely the case for the establishment of a Minister for Social Welfare who will have a sole, limited responsibility there, and who will give all his time and energy to co-ordinating and developing and controlling that important function, is to be desired rather than continue the present position.  So, too, in the case of such a Ministry you will take portions from the various Departments where the services are spread and consolidate them into a distinct and efficient Department.  Surely that should be a move in the direction of efficiency and in the direction of progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing the Bill, put the question to us, is it desirable to set up these two new Ministries in view of the situation that is visualised now?  If that is the narrow question, there is a very strong case for setting up these two Ministries, a case in efficiency and a case in economy.  The setting up of the separate functions <Col N="1303" /> leads to order, it leads to somebody being definitely answerable for these functions, it leads to order in the organisation of the Department and consequently to efficiency and that should lead to an economic working of this Department.  To go on with the old method would mean a scattering of responsibility, distributing the administration necessary for these services over a number of Departments.  That cannot give efficiency and it is the type of thing that is very likely to be uneconomic in the sense that more money would be spent on administration than if the service were unified.</P>
    <P>There is a rather wider aspect in this matter and here I am slightly afraid of the Chair, because of the limits put on the debate.  With all respect to the Chair, I think I am in order in asking, is it desirable to set up a Department of Public Health and a Department of Social Welfare?  If we go back on other debates, the members of the Labour Party are crying out for increased social services.  They have made comparisons with other countries and with their desire, the desire of all well-thinking men.  Unfortunately, however, that desire, like the desire of the king in the <i>Gondoliers</i> who wished all men as rich as he, is impracticable. That desire is there and we would all be with the desirers if they would only answer one question&mdash;where will you find the money to set up schemes on the scale you visualise without damaging other portions of our economy and without inflicting undue hardship on others?  That is the rub.  I or any other member of the House could sit beside another Deputy and join with him in so far as he desires the betterment of all these classes that have been mentioned, but the point is, what positive scheme can you put up for financing it?  The unfortunate law of society is that what one person gets another person must pay for.  Where is the money to come from for these social services?</P>

      <P>What will the new Department administer?  Social services. I am not going to go into that at any great length.  I will content myself by saying that there should be a limit to expansion in regard to social services and that we have very nearly reached it, in my humble opinion. Perhaps I might qualify that by saying that we are almost at the limit by the method of getting money from central taxation.  There may be other ways of expanding; there may be other ways of raising the money, but in the sense of doling out from funds collected from the taxpayer, I think we are very near the limit.  In expressing that view I have in mind certain people in our towns and cities, to whom I referred on a previous Bill.  They are the people who have had to pay for benefits to others and those people have reached the limit of the burdens they can bear. I have mentioned civil servants, civic guards, teachers and others in Dublin City, but I do not intend to deal with them at this stage.  The main point in this debate is, does the advisability of setting up these Departments rest on an assumption of future expansion, or is it advisable to continue on the present basis?  That is the important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have submitted, I hope sufficiently clearly, that on the present basis, in order to cater for the existing social services and the existing schemes for public health, it is desirable to set up these two Departments.  It is desirable on the argument of Ministerial responsibility and on the argument of having a <Col N="1305" /> definite duty to administer these important functions.</P>
      <P>On the question of money, I doubt if it will make a lot of difference, though it may make some.  On that point, I want to put one thing clearly and I submit, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, that it has come into the debate. Right through this debate there has been obviously a confusion between the money which will have to be voted for the administrative expenses of these Departments and the moneys which will have to be voted for the reliefs and the various services themselves. Obviously, by far the more important item of expenditure is that on the services themselves.  The administrative expenses will be relatively small&mdash;I have no idea of the figure, but I imagine that 5 per cent. would be putting it high.  That is purely a guess on my part and I do not want to bind anyone else by it or be bound by it myself.  The point is that the important expense to the community in the future is not that which will arise from the setting up of these two Departments as Departments but that which will arise from the sums voted for the services.  To take a concrete example, the sum of money spent on the administration of children's allowances or old age pensions is quite small compared to the amount of money handed out under those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair has limited me and I cannot go into that on the services side, but I do say that it is a confusion&mdash;I am not going so far as to say &ldquo;a misrepresentation&rdquo;&mdash;to try to pretend that the big expense will arise in administration.  I doubt if there will be much difference between the expense of the machinery worked on the old basis and the expense of the machinery of the new Departments. Again I have no figure and cannot go nearer than that.  It is merely a personal opinion.  I think the case is clear for setting up these Departments, but as I have been limited by the Chair to that case, I would like to make it very clear that I myself, in voting for this measure, do so on the basis of the present administrative expense, with a reasonable anticipation for the future and not on the basis of a contemplated <Col N="1306" /> orgy of irresponsible spending.  I have put that rather strongly.  Why? Because when the Minister for Social Welfare finds he has to take a relatively conservative attitude, since it is unfortunately a matter of £ s. d., and the people who have to pay for it must be considered, and finds that he cannot give the grants and the services we would all theoretically require, there are people who will come along and say that a Department was set up to do these extravagant things.  The setting up of these Departments is necessary and desirable in the interests of efficiency, economy and good administration, but that will not make it possible to do all the very fine things the Labour Party would wish to have done, for the simple reason that neither they nor anyone else have been able to show how to do it, with the money and the resources available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the Deputy's own supporters will say the same, that they expect all that.  They are the worst offenders and we often have to check them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I look at it in a realistic way.  The money for these social services must be supplied by the people, by junior civil servants who are paying through the rates and taxes, by clerical workers in Dublin, by trade unionists and workers in Dublin who are paying through their rents and occasionally through incometax. The limit of their capacity to pay will be the limit of the social services available.  Let us be quite clear as to what we are doing in setting up these Departments.  It is being done in the interest of efficiency and economy and not with the Utopian idea of working miracles.  Neither the present Department nor the new Departments can do that.  I am making that clear, as it is very easy to say afterwards that we should give every child 10/- a week from birth, or do some wild thing like that; and when we say we cannot do so, it is easy to retort: &ldquo;Oh, you set up a Ministry of Social Welfare to do that.&rdquo;  Let us realise that such a Department will do an ordinary, everyday job of work&mdash;and do it efficiently, I hope&mdash;but it cannot work miracles. <Col N="1307" /> The same applies to the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>There are a few remarks I would like to make on the question of public health, but my fear and reverence for the Chair deters me.  Perhaps I would be in order in mentioning some guiding things and some things we hope for.  We hope for an improvement in public health schemes.  This Department is being set up in response to a far-reaching cry for such expansions. In approaching its new job, I think there is a change desirable in a certain outlook.  For instance, in the dangerous nature of public health control, I would like to see more safeguards introduced, in regard to the personal right of the citizen, than those provided in the Public Health Bill which now will come before us again.  I would like the new Minister to adopt the principle that where decisions, which in their nature are judicial ones, are given by a Minister, they would be given in a public forum. I am not arguing that all these things should go to the courts.  The lawyers have made the point about having such decisions tested and disagree with the idea that the Minister's decision shall be final.  When they made the point about a secret decision, it was not with a view to holding their own end up, so to speak.  I have no objection to the Minister in such circumstances exercising a judicial decision, but I would like to see him do it in a public way, in a way that the people as a whole can be conscious of and can question, and not merely by means of a short word in a letter.</P>
      <P>That is quite a small point.  I merely express it as a hope.  We shall, I trust, have more to do with it on a particular section of the Public Health Bill.  It would, I think, tend to smooth working on the part of the proposed new Department if it were to approach matters in that spirit rather than in the old spirit of the Department of Local Government, where everything is left in its finality&mdash;and very often a silent finality&mdash;to the sanction and decision of the Minister, which, in fact, is usually the sanction or decision of some officer of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> With your indulgence, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, I have wandered.  After all, the question here is whether we should set up those two Departments or not.  I have expressed the view that we should.  Expense is involved. Expense is inevitable if we are to have expanding social services.  The question of the expense of those services will arise on other occasions.  We have been debarred from discussing it.</P>
    <P>I think that we should make quite clear that this Bill is essentially an administrative measure and that it is to be justified or condemned on the issue as to whether it is desirable that those two important functions should be represented by one man, who will have responsibility for their direction, or whether they should continue on the existing basis, where they are a kind of part-time stepchildren of other Ministers.  The Bill should be judged on that basis.  It should also be judged on the basis whether these functions are sufficiently important to require a man's whole-time attention.  After all, a Minister is simply a human being, like the rest of us.  There are limits to the personal direction and attention which he can give to such matters. Although a Deputy on the opposite side said that a large amount of the work is done by the Department for the Minister, the Minister must direct the policy, he must take the crucial decisions and he must hold the reins in his hands all the time.  Therefore, the question here is whether these Departments are sufficiently important to have one man in charge of the reins rather than having a number of Ministers dealing with the services on a part-time basis.  That is from the Ministerial efficiency point of view.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there is the question whether it is in the interest of economy, good administration and in the interest of the services themselves that the subdepartment of Public Health should be constituted a separate Department and whether the scattered sections dealing with social services should be concentrated into a co-ordinated unit for dealing with social services as a whole. The three points which arise are&mdash; firstly, Ministerial responsibility, secondly, Ministerial efficiency and, thirdly, the efficiency of the Depart- <Col N="1309" /> ments involved, regard being had to their proper working and the proper working of the services for which they cater.  I think that we should support the Bill.  I see no reason to oppose it. Our present services have expanded so much during the past 20 years that some such reorganisation is necessary. The question of the expense of the services themselves does not arise and will have to be debated at another time.  How the money is to be found for the services themselves, how they are to be administered and so forth&mdash; these are wider questions which are outside the scope of the Bill.  The Bill itself deals only with the matters I have mentioned.  For that reason, I may finish by saying, without reflection on the other Deputies who spoke, that a great deal of the debate on this Bill was away from the point and that the speakers who confined themselves to looking at it from the point of view I have indicated were nearer the issue. There are two sides to this story as to every other story but I submit, on the grounds which I have adduced, that the balance is in favour of setting up those two Ministries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go into that.  I am merely saying that that was the Deputy's argument.  I feel that the same argument can be used against this measure.  Where are we going to stop in the building up of top-heavy, elaborate administration?  We must remember that, in the last analysis, whatever services are provided for our people must be so provided out of the productive capacity of the community.  If we compare production with expenditure in recent years, we find that the spiral of expenditure is continually rising, while the curve of production is falling.  At best, production is stagnant.  In those <Col N="1310" /> circumstances and having regard to the uncertainty of the future, it is suggested that we want much more elaborate administration of Governmental services, that our people can afford such administration and that it is essential in the public interest.  Let us be clear that we can take out of the national pool of production only what we put into it.  If we are not putting in enough to provide the services we deem desirable, we have got to go without them.  After all, State housekeeping is the same as domestic housekeeping. A man might think that it would be very desirable if he were to possess a motor car.  But if his income is not sufficient to maintain a car and he is a wise man, he will go without the motor car.</P>
      <P>I have been struck by the argument that these functions cannot be discharged by one Minister.  The administrative work of one Department in Great Britain would be far greater than that involved by the whole Governmental machine here.  Yet, one Minister in Britain has to give attention to such a Department and we know that the men appointed are capable of dealing with the matters that arise. Such a man is answerable to Parliament for the discharge of the duties appertaining to his Department. Deputy de Valera stresses the necessity of having a Minister answerable to Parliament for the services involved here.  He seemed to forget that the two Parliamentary Secretaries we had were answerable in Parliament&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not giving way to the Minister.  Quite recently, economists in the United States and in Great Britain were anticipating a depression during the next couple of years.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact a statement appeared in some of the daily papers to-day&mdash;I forget which&mdash;to the effect that while the present shortage of manufactured goods in the world exists, conditions will be all right for Great Britain, but the moment the world settles down to production, after the next couple of years, when markets may not be there, Britain will be up against a very serious economic and national difficulty.  The writer goes on to suggest that public men in Great Britain are envisaging a situation where they may have a coalition Government in the next few years between Labour and Conservatives to be a national Government of concentration. While they are concerned with that picture, we here ignoring the economic circumstances that may exist in the next couple of years are asked to build up an administrative machine here that is completely top-heavy for our economy and our capacity to carry such a machine.  The Minister may be very anxious to provide these grandiose services. It would be quite all right to have the three Ministers giving the personal attention to their Departments that has been stressed, if we could afford such an elaborate machine, but are we going to allow the administrative machine to grow out of all proportion to our capacity to carry it? That is the question I want to put to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there to be any regard for the people who have to foot the bill?  The spiral of taxation, local and general taxation, has reached something like £65,000,000.  That is a huge sum of money.  Is it suggested that two new Departments can make no difference? I suppose the argument is: &ldquo;Another couple of Departments may mean a million of money but what about it? <Col N="1312" /> It will look grand if we can claim to have the most up-to-date services in Europe.&rdquo;  I think that already we can claim to have the greatest number of paupers in proportion to our population in the world, the greatest number of people looking to the Government for charity. Is that what we desire&mdash;the creation of a community of mendicants who are no longer concerned with the stigma of pauperism?  We could not afford to put into operation Dr. Dignan's plan which would lift that stigma from the individual by the fact that he would realise that he was contributing to a social service and that he was entitled in time of need to claim benefits from it.  No, we are going to pour money into the building up of elaborate State institutions, more to satisfy the desire for self-aggrandisement of individual members of the Executive than to perform any real service for the community.</P>
    <P>If the Minister came in with proposals for further expenditure which would result in higher production, I should be 100 per cent. in favour of them but while our capacity to produce wealth is going down, we propose to provide a non-productive service of this kind, further to cripple production and to put a burden on the productive capacity of the country.  Someone has got to be realistic in this matter and it is time that the Minister should become realistic about it.  I am not reflecting on his concern for the health of the people or on his anxiety to provide houses and services of that sort but surely the solution of the problems with which we are faced lies in the creation of higher incomes, better housing, and better conditions generally for the people and less institutions, less hospitals and less social services, less public charity and more independence for the people as a whole.  A case has not been made for the creation of two new Ministries in this country. As I say, the Department in Great Britain, the administrative work of which would be far greater than that of the whole Governmental machine of this country to-day, is controlled and directed by one head who also answers to Parliament for it.  There is no reason why there could not be some <Col N="1313" /> little reorganisation in local government here.  A little co-ordination would effect a very great change in the Department over which the Minister presides.</P>
    <P>I merely rise to submit that it would be time enough dreaming of elaborate services of this sort when we can afford them and I believe that, when we can afford them, there will be less demand for them.  I want to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that there was recently prepared for the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash;and we have some able statisticians in that Department&mdash;a book of national income and expenditure.  That revealed a somewhat extraordinary condition of affairs in our country&mdash;that the vast majority of the people are on very low incomes, that only 290,000 of the people at present have incomes of £3 each a week and over.  When we consider the purchasing power of £3 a week, which is approximately 50 per cent. of what it was before the war, we can realise the incomes upon which many families in this country have to subsist.  In these circumstances we propose to add two new Ministers to the elaborate Government machine that is there.  Is it not preposterous and absurd?  Does the Dáil think that the country is going to stand for it?</P>
    <P>My advice to the Minister is to get after the real problem and let us have more production.  To achieve that, we have to take off our coats and work a lot harder.  Our people have got to be organised; we must have more technical devices and more capital equipment. The Minister is putting the car before the horse in providing a service which is unnecessary and in creating a burden that should not be placed on our people.  In view of the very pessimistic anticipations of public men and economists in Great Britain and the United States, we should be very careful before launching this little community into elaborate, top-heavy, expensive machinery of this sort.  I was amazed at the arguments of Deputy de Valera and his saying that we could not possibly afford to grant the demands coming from the Labour Party.  The approach of the Labour Party of trying to do something to <Col N="1314" /> increase incomes is sound.  No one can deny that, but incomes can be increased only by increasing production. Stepping up the total expenditure in this country still higher by introducing two new Ministries is not going to help.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies from the other side argue that these Ministers are not going to cost any more, but once you set up a Ministry you are going to set up the necessary staff and, mark my words, that staff will expand in a very short time.  It will be proved within the next two or three years that I am rather prophetic in this matter.  The Book of Estimates will indicate it.  I am quite satisfied that the moment these Ministries are set up the powerful Civil Service will justify a very considerable personnel for both Departments. Our case is that that can be done within the present Department, with reorientation, reorganisation and co-ordination of the different branches of the service and that it should be possible to do it under one administrative head.  I think it will lead to a certain amount of confusion if local authorities have to deal with three different Departments.  How these three Departments are to be co-ordinated, so far as local authorities are concerned, I am at a loss to know, and I am further at a loss to know how housing is to be divorced from public health and put under a Department which will not be dealing with public health at all.</P>
    <P>So far as public health is concerned, I am certain that there will be more interference with medical men in their professional capacities down the country and that they will be turned into a clerical staff for the making of returns and the filling up of forms rather than looking after the health of the community.  I am satisfied that this is a very unwise measure.  It will involve the country in expense which is not justified in providing a service which could very well be provided by the existing Department, if it were properly organised and co-ordinated.  I know that the Custom House is run in separate water-tight compartments and that there is not that co-ordination which is necessary.  Anyone with experience of local administration realises <Col N="1315" /> that.  There are difficulties which it ought to be possible to surmount without involving the country in the further expense which is inevitable under this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure has for its main object the creation of two new Ministries to deal with social services and public health.  There has been much discussion about the introduction of the Bill and many Deputies have given their ideas on whether these Ministries should or should not be set up.  My own attitude is that I cannot support in any way any Bill providing for the appointment of two new Ministries, no matter what services are involved or what they have to do.</P>
      <P>I agree that we would need a Minister for Public Health and a Minister for Social Services, if we could get a guarantee that the appointment of these Ministers would result in an improvement in public health and an increase, not in the doles, bounties and other gifts to the people, but in production, in the national pool of wealth from which the money for the administering of these services must come. Neither of these results can possibly materialise, and it is idle for the Labour Party or anybody else to expect an improvement in any of the services which will come under the jurisdiction of these two Ministers.  It is from the people that the money for the provision of staff and so on must come and the people are not wealthy enough or the country big enough to give encouragement to any such scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that it may be hard for the Minister for Local Government to keep an eagle eye on the three Departments, for two of which new Ministers are to be appointed, but what we want is simplification.  In this case, it can be done if the Government would agree to introduce legislation to grant the meagre 10/- per week to every old age pensioner.  How much saving in staff would that bring about and how much worry would be avoided for Deputies who have continually to be in touch with the Department in an effort to <Col N="1316" /> wring the miserable 10/- out of the Department?  If the Minister would agree to do that, he would automatically simplify the administration of old age pensions.</P>
    <P>I fail to see any great medical man arising who will give us better provision for the public health or will give us anything better in the matter of social services than we have.  All I see in this proposal is the creation of two new jobs, two nice soft posts for two lucky, or unlucky, men to be chosen from the Fianna Fáil Party.  In time, I suppose, there will be added to each of these Ministers&mdash;perhaps not next year but within the next two years&mdash;a Parliamentary Secretary, and there is no use in the Minister saying that there will be an economy in staff through the creation of these new Ministries.  There cannot be, because each will have to take on a separate section of the Civil Service and will have to have civil servants appointed to it in an effort to clear away a little of the fog of incompetence. In my view, they will succeed only in making it much thicker.</P>
    <P>We are to have schemes for hospitals under the guiding hand of the Minister for Public Health, and I will not disagree with the proposition that bigger and better hospitals are essential, but this country, with a declining population, emigration and so on, is not in a position to find the immense amount of money required to finance these proposals. I find it strange that the Department of Local Government and the proposed Department of Public Health should be cut adrift from one another because everyone knows that any man or woman who has a good, roomy, airy house, who can get three and maybe four substantial meals in the day and who can do an honest day's hard work is not as likely to contract disease as those who have to live under bad conditions, in circumstances in which they have no money and can get no work to enable them to provide the necessary food to build sound constitutions and healthy, virile and active bodies.  But, nevertheless, no step will be taken by the Government to provide those things.</P>
    <P>I may be going outside the scope of this Bill as many Deputies have gone, <Col N="1317" /> but I am only trying to point out that an improvement in public health can never be achieved by the creation of a new Ministry.  The same thing applies to social services.  Social services are no credit to any country.  No Government can make a boast of the fact that it has created a Minister for Social Services, a Minister to dish out free milk, free boots, free clothes to a people with a tradition of being the hardest working people in the world.  They are to look to the State for everything they want, to look for shoes for the child and sometimes for the husband or wife, to look for a certain amount of money to provide them with fuel and clothes and, not the least, for a form of assistance which does not come under this Bill, but which nevertheless should be regarded as a social service, the dole, which keeps them in a condition of living which is worse than the workhouses 50 or 60 years ago.  None of these Ministries will solve these problems.  I do not see how they can. If the money to be spent by the creation of these Ministries could be spent on something in the line of production which would give our youth employment, we would not be continually watching them going to Great Britain.  Questions would not have to be asked, as they were asked to-day, about the conditions of our people when they go to Britain.  If something could be done in that way, every Deputy would be glad to give it his support.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that the present Government have been moving steadily along the line of administration which we have had in this country for over 100 years.  They have not the courage to cut adrift from the old red tape and incompetence which has continued for so long.  The idea is to make State paupers of our people.  As the last speaker said, the more social services we have, the more State paupers we have.  All these people will automatically become Government servants who can be used at certain times to gain certain advantages.  I believe that is the reason for the creation of two new Ministries.  I think that the ten Ministers we have are quite sufficient.  They are as much as this country can afford. If we had 6,000,000 or 7,000,000 people <Col N="1318" /> here I would not object; I do not think it would be right to object to the appointment of a Minister to fill some post or other.  But we have a small and declining population.  The Minister told us that there was a decline in the population of Europe.  He knows well there has been a decline in the population here.  He knows just as well as I do what is the cause of it&mdash;that the average young man or woman is not willing to settle in this country and see nothing before them only a State bounty, a spoonful, if you like, from the State bowl.  It cannot be described in any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I not tell the Minister that, if he would guarantee that 10/- a week would be given to every old age pensioner, I would be in full agreement with him.  If he gives me that guarantee, irrespective of what the Party may do, I will walk into the Lobby and vote for this.  Will the Minister give me that guarantee? Another surprising thing is the withdrawal of the Public Health Bill.  This Party voted with the Government when that Bill was introduced because we believed it was absolutely necessary, even though at a later stage we backed up certain amendments and opposed the Bill at various stages.  But the general framework of it was essential. Where has it gone to?  Why is it taken away?  We were told that the Public Health Bill was to solve all the problems in connection with public health. Now we find that it will not do that, that a Ministry of Public Health is to solve them and look after the health of the country.  We have just to wait and see what these two Ministries, which will involve the expenditure of large sums of public money, will do. I candidly believe that we are just adding two more incompetents to the incompetents who were there before, because of the groove the Fianna Fáil Party have got into.  They cannot get out of the rut they have fallen into and into which their predecessors fell.  I should like to make it clear that we are opposing the creation of these two new Ministries because we regard them as nothing more than the creation of two <Col N="1319" /> jobs for two lucky individuals in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>In spite of what the previous speaker and Deputy Hughes stated, I think it should be evident to everybody that one Minister could not continue to cope with the immense duties which were the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  It would not be possible to keep abreast of advances in medicine and public health work generally if we had not a Minister and advisers who could give all their time to these problems.  The problems of tuberculosis, rheumatism, diphtheria, venereal disease, to mention but a few, are of vital importance to the community as a whole.  It is in the best interest of the nation that they should not be approached in a haphazard way, but that they should be tackled seriously and an honest effort made to eradicate them, so far as it is possible to do it.  I think the Government, through its new Minister for Public Health, should be given every encouragement to do this.  The medical profession, if given proper facilities, will do its part.  We can avail ourselves of the facilities at the universities and the teaching hospitals to improve our knowledge.  As the Minister said in his opening remarks, I am satisfied that the medical profession can produce men equal in brilliance and in capacity for research and for the alleviation of suffering to those in any other country in the world.  The facilities at the universities and hospitals should be availed of.  If necessary, the Government could increase these facilities by setting up a special research body for the advancement of medical science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to mention that I trust the medical profession will be consulted by the new Minister, so that the experience of the medical profession will be available to him when the new Public Health Bill is introduced.  The setting up of a Ministry of Social Welfare should be welcomed by everybody, especially by the poorer sections of the community. It should promote greater efficiency and avoid a good deal of the overlapping <Col N="1320" /> which is at present evident in the administration of some of the social service schemes.  Part of the functions of the new Ministry will be to cater for unemployment assistance. In that connection, I suggest that the question of dole cannot be permanently remedied but one of the things which this new Ministry should address itself to is the degree of congestion and poverty that exists on the western seaboard.  It should have special attention and I am satisfied that it can never be cured merely by handing out unemployment assistance.  There is a problem along our western seaboard which demands the special attention of the new Ministry of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I submit that the question of State responsibility for such cases as feebleminded people, imbeciles and permanent invalids should be fully investigated by this new Ministry of Social Welfare.  I quite appreciate that the question of cost will arise but, if we improve the health of the community and increase the earning capacity of our people, we will be able to increase output and so justify expenditure.  That is the right method.  We must start at the bottom.  We must see that the people are educated in preventive medicine and we must try to have every child brought up under the healthiest conditions possible.  If we do that, we will fit them for the struggle for existence in the world and they will be better able to earn.  By that means output will be increased and there will be a permanent benefit to the community.</P>

      <P>The Department of Local Government and Public Health is at present controlled by a Minister, assisted by two Parliamentary Secretaries. The Bill under discussion proposes to create two new Ministers and to abolish the Parliamentary Secretaries. I am wondering if the mere change from Parliamentary Secretary to Minister, with consequent increase in salary, will mean that the persons concerned will be more efficient.  It is a very debatable point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Public Health Bill had practically become law.  I have met numbers of medical men who approved <Col N="1321" /> of it.  It seemed to give very general satisfaction.  It is rather strange that it should have been scrapped at the eleventh hour.  I do not see that the appointment of two men instead of one will improve matters.  There is certainly a good deal to be made up.  We have the highest tuberculosis population, I suppose, in Europe, if not in the world.  Three tuberculosis hospitals are to be built.  I do not know if we are starting at the right end.  A short time ago a motion was moved here asking for the provision of a pure water supply for the country.  That was debated here for three hours and I think every member of the House, except the Government Party, voted in favour of it.  Members of all Parties spoke in favour of it.  If there were a pure water supply it would avoid the necessity for building those hospitals. The drinking of impure water has a good deal to do with tuberculosis.  I honestly believe that the sources of our water supply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the duties he has to perform.  I was merely alluding to what had occurred in the past.  The new Minister, whoever is appointed, should certainly do what was left undone in the past.  I suggest to whoever is appointed that this work requires to be carried out. I suggest that not one in 100 of our sources of water supply would stand an analytical test for pure water.  I suggest that that is the great cause of tuberculosis in the country.  The towns are well looked after; the villages are looked after to a certain extent but the rural supplies are definitely lacking. Lord Beaverbrook was so impressed by this matter that he took it up and in England, Scotland and Wales surveys are being made.  That should be a lesson for the future Minister to be appointed.  I suggest that this matter has a great bearing on the Bill.  This country compares in contour with Scotland. If the cost here were the same as in Scotland, <i>pro rata</i>, it would mean 10/- on each household in every rural area.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann on behalf of the Irish people places upon public record their detestation of the travesty of judicial process which culminated in the imprisonment of Monsignor Stepinac, Archbishop of Zagreb and Primate of Croatia; calls upon all Christian peoples and all those who do not actually hate Christendom to join in repudiating as fraudulent this pseudo-trial and in stigmatising it for what it is&mdash;a crude pantomime of justice, designed for the purpose of defaming Christianity <Col N="1323" /> in general and the Catholic Church in particular, so that the international Communist conspiracy against individual liberty everywhere may be relieved of its most formidable and uncompromising challenge, which must always come from Christianity; directs the Ceann Comhairle to communicate the terms of this resolution to the Presiding Officer of every sovereign Parliament sharing with us membership of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</P>
    <P>I put down that resolution, Sir, because this is the Parliament of as active and as free a democracy as there is in the world, and at the same time it is the Parliament of a people 95 per cent.  Catholic, and practising Catholic at that.  It is the Parliament which stands in the world to-day as the enduring refutation of the materialist totalitarian suggestion that where the Catholic Church is strong and vigorous there liberty withers and totalitarianism grows.  Ever since this beastly heresy of totalitarian materialism has appeared in the world it has sought to employ, as its most effective weapon, the destruction, not primarily of its opponents' persons and lives but of their reputations.</P>
    <P>Now, the totalitarian materialists hope always, and too often with success, that with the passage of time their individual crimes will be forgotten. They know too well how short the public memory is, and that as these individual crimes pass from the memory of men, there will remain a residuum of recollection calculated to persuade the people that those who are opposed to the tyrants are disreputable and untrustworthy.  I can turn to Marshal Tito, the Bolshevik dictator of Yugo-Slavia, for proof of that contention.  Speaking at Zagreb on August 31st and referring to the imprisonment of Monsignor Stepinac, Tito said of Christendom throughout the world:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They will shout to their hearts' content and then the storm will abate, because they will weary of it and we shall not weary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of this motion is <Col N="1324" /> to fix Marshal Tito and his kind in the world with this, that the day is past when Christian men and women will weary of remembering these individual crimes.  We will not weary, and so long as Monsignor Stepinac remains in prison we will not weary of reminding the world that injustice is enthroned in Yugo-Slavia, nor need he be deceived by our refusal to resort to the same type of language which he and his kind habitually employ.  Without rancour against individuals, without preaching the gospel of hatred as between men or classes, we shall continue resolutely to denounce injustice and to exhort our fellowmen in the world to combine with us in protesting against the prostitution of law.</P>
    <P>Now it is important, Sir, at the very outset to recall that it is not our purpose to stage in Dáil Éireann a retrial of the charges brought against Monsignor Stepinac.  It is not our function, much less our duty.  Our purpose should, however, be to stigmatise as fraudulent the totalitarian's use of the word &ldquo;trial.&rdquo;  The minds of men througout the world are by design being confused by a new and astute manoeuvre of these latter-day tyrants. The old method was a frontal attack upon the institutions of freedom and liberty.  To-day the method is to adopt the language of liberty but to attach to it a new and very different meaning.  We here in a free country, when we speak of a trial, think of an independent judge sitting on his bench; we think of a person charged with a specified crime, furnished with all particulars of the allegations to be made against him, afforded a full opportunity of calling such witnesses as he wants to call so that his side of the case can be heard; we think of an atmosphere obtaining in the court where the trial proceeds with judicial calm, where the prosecution's voice and that of the defence can both be clearly heard; and then we think of a decision taken on the merits and justice done according to the law.  That little word &ldquo;trial&rdquo; means all that to us.  When we read of a trial in Yugo-Slavia subconsciously that picture rises before us and we think of the Archbishop thus arraigned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> Let me, however, remind the House what trial has come to mean under the new democracy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been decreed on the 3rd February, 1945, in Yugo-Slavia to abolish all legal status based on law, regulations, orders which have been in force in Yugo-Slavia up to the 6th April, 1941, in so far as they are in contradiction with the achievements of a national liberation struggle, the declarations and decisions of the anti-fascist council of Yugo-Slavia, the local anti-fascist councils, as well as all the decisions taken by the anti-fascist council of Yugo-Slavia, its delegations and government and delegations of the local anti-fascist council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Free Dalmatia</i>, a communist paper, in its columns on December 31st, 1944, in an article entitled &ldquo;The development of the people's legal system&rdquo; says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The trials are carried out under the auspices of the National Liberation Committee on the basis of Article 10 of the Declaration adopted at Topusko on May 9th, 1944&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>and goes on to explain that instructions as to the work and organisation of the court were given by the anti-fascist council of Croatia.  According to those instructions&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;judgments hitherto enforced are not to be given by trained jurists under the complicated law hitherto in force but are to be made by the best sons of the people, not by the dead-letter of the written law but upon a proper, healthy conception of the people.  The judges are to be chosen from amongst the people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Here let me give the House a short description of how a trial is conducted under the exalted tribunal before which Monsignor Stepinac was brought to trial.  The newspaper <i>Politica</i> published on June 6th, 1944, gives a description of the first trial in Split for violation of the people's honour:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The accused were the brothers Bonachia but the people of fighting Split who for a full 11 hours followed the trial remember it all.  The courtroom thundered with &lsquo;forced labour for the speculators&rsquo;, we demand confiscation; <Col N="1326" /> long live the just people's court.  The crowd demanded the severest penalty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not a trial as we understand it in this country.  People condemned before such tribunals are not condemned in accordance with our conception of what justice is.  That is true not only for archbishops but also for the little insignificant individuals whose names may never be heard again.  It is true of all men because our conception of the law is that all men, great and small, archbishops and crossing-sweepers, are equal before it.  Just as we would demand with one voice justice for the crossing-sweeper for the same reason, and for none other, we demand it for an archbishop.</P>
    <P>The Vatican, in referring to what the totalitarians had described as a &ldquo;trial&rdquo; called to mind that the trial, so-called, began on September 30th within six days of the public accusation. The defence counsel was allowed one interview with the accused.  The preparation of the defence was greatly hindered by the fact that many of the defenders of the archbishop were either arrested or detained for long periods. The president of the tribunal withheld documents and witnesses from the defence.  Numerous documents produced against the archbishop had nothing to do with the so-called trial. The public prosecutor spoke every day and for hours on end whereas the defence, except for the final statement, were only granted rare and short intervals for speaking.</P>
    <P>Deputies of this House will remember the dramatic, but not as authoritative record of what passed at that so-called trial from an Irishman who was present there in his capacity as a Press photographer, and recorded in a letter to his parents, which was published in the Press of this country, that when the Archbishop sought to answer the questions that were addressed to him he was continually interrupted with the raucous outcry of a disorderly and unfriendly mob.</P>
    <P>I want to say this with due deliberation. The unjust imprisonment of Archbishop Stepinac is shocking but no more shocking than the unjust <Col N="1327" /> slaughter of the thousands who, all of us know, have died in Europe because they refused to forswear their conscience. But what it is immensely important to remember and to mark here, and to announce our resolution to mark and mark again ne'er wearying &mdash;as they hope we will weary&mdash;is the steadfast and unswerving resolve of the totalitarian materialists, Nazi and Bolshevik, to defame the Catholic Church by this old expedient of staging mock trials, hoping that even if convictions do not result, some of the mud that is thrown will stick in the memories of simple men.</P>
    <P>Do we in this House forget the Nazi trials of the Benedictines of South Germany?  Do we remember the charges that were made against the members of the Benedictine Order and the Order of Saint Francis, of gross and shameful sexual aberration in their own monasteries?  That was 14 years ago and I am submitting to this House that though to-day the charge is treason, it is the same conspiracy, it is the same method that inspired those to arraign the monks and friars of South Germany, not for treason, but for another loathsome crime, unnatural sex perversion, and those who make those charges think that their nature is so loathsome and the slander is so vile that we will recoil from the duty of calling them to mind again and again and again, and reiterating again and again and again that we know they were slanders, that we know the charges were false, that we know they trust, through the very foulness of their own minds, to impose silence upon us.  But we know that trick of old experience and we are not to be put off, because we can remember in this country the fraudulent trials; we know the method of the packed jury and the corrupt judge.</P>
    <P>I remember a picture hanging on the wall of my old home.  It was a photograph of Smith O'Brien and he sent it to my grandmother as a parting gift from Kilmainham, when he lay under sentence of death.  Beneath it he wrote the words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is treason to love her and it is death to defend.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> In those days, it was Ireland who was proud of her traitors and Ireland who so confidently depended on her children, if necessary, to die.  The people of Ireland did not believe the slanders that were uttered against them&mdash;the charge of being traitors. That word traitor grated sorely on the delicate honour of such a man as Smith O'Brien.  The charge of traitor was thrown back at those who made it, and those who pretended, by judicial process, to prove it and fix it upon the men who dared to love this country, by our friends all over the world who, by just such action as I ask Dáil Éireann to take now, said to these men in their darkest hour:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever the verdicts of these courts, whatever these judges call you, whatever crimes they try to fix upon you, we do not think it necessary to follow the merits of the cause, we know you are not traitors; we repudiate the judicial process as a travesty which found you traitors and remember that whatever they call you, all over the world there are men who love liberty and who will honour this new-styled traitor, this new felon, deserving of death.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Shall we, in our time, in defence of something infinitely more precious than Ireland can ever be, in defence of man's right to honour God according to his conscience, fail those who have been brought before the packed jury and the corrupt judge and deny to them the sustenance and the consolation that we, in our own experience, got when there was nothing else to sustain us in what then looked a much more hopeless cause than that in defence of which Monsignor Stepinac has gone to jail in Yugo-Slavia?  It is an illusion, Sir, to seek for common ground of compromise on which to meet the totalitarian materialists of our day.  Nazi and Bolshevik alike seek to establish a political philosophy in the world on the assumption that God is not in Heaven and there can be no peace, there can be no compromise, there can be no common ground between a political philosophy founded on that hypothesis and the various forms of government which men devise <Col N="1329" /> under the providence of a God Who has always been and shall for ever be in Heaven, superior to any law that any Parliament can make.</P>
    <P>Those well-intentioned agnostics and well-intentioned pagans who are for ever chasing the will-o'-the-wisp of some <i>modus vivendi</i> with the totalitarian materialists are like moths drawn towards a flame; the nearer they approach their objective, the more certain and inevitable will be their destruction.  The materialists are wise in their generation and they realise that there is only one thing left in the world which they can never hope to delude or absorb, and that is Christendom, and I like to think&mdash;and I daresay with justice&mdash;that poor, insignificant, small as we in Ireland may seem in many regards, in the van of Christendom we have the right to carry our standards as high as any nation in the world.</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of the House to these seeming truisms which are so often forgotten.  In a great part of the world, when the representatives of Bolshevik Governments, in Russia or elsewhere, elect to employ the word &ldquo;demokratiski&rdquo;, official interpreters translate that into English as &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;, but that is not the translation. It has been made abundantly clear that, though the word &ldquo;demokratiski&rdquo; in Russian may sound like &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;, it does not mean that. It means &ldquo;proletarian dictatorship&rdquo;; but because many people have not marked that subtle misrepresentation, a situation is developing in many parts of the world where, unless you are prepared to accept the doctrines of proletarian dictatorship, your democracy is called in question, you are put upon the defensive to prove that you are not a Fascist beast.  We know that the supreme tribunal instructed by Article 10 of the Declaration of the National Liberation Committee adopted at Topusko, which I have read for the House, is not what we mean by a court of law.  Yet, when it is called a court of law, there are many simple people who imagine that the proceedings resemble such courts as we are familiar with.  Have they forgotten how very like Marshal Goering's <Col N="1330" /> Courts of Honour in Germany these new national courts are?  Have they forgotten the instructions the Nazi courts received&mdash;to judge, not according to law but according to the honour of the German people?  So to-day the courts of the Bolshevik dictatorship are warned not to judge according to law but according to the conscience and the honour of the Bolshevik people.</P>
    <P>We know that, when we speak of &ldquo;elections&rdquo;, we think of any candidate who can find ten men to name him having the right to go before the people and the people's choice prevailing in the end, but when a Bolshevik talks about an &ldquo;election&rdquo; he means the submission of a list of candidates for which the people are invited to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; under the careful surveillance of a member of the OGPU, or the Cheka or the Gestapo, as the case may be.  We think of &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; as the one place where every man can speak his mind under the rule of absolute privilege and where one presides to ensure that the rights of the humblest member of the House, under the Standing Orders, shall be protected with the same zeal and care as those of the Prime Minister himself.  When they talk of Parliaments, they talk of groups of men assembled in rooms the walls of which are lined with armed members of the Gestapo.  It is because we know the difference, because we realise that Bolshevik Parliaments, Bolshevik elections, Bolshevik trials are not what we call Parliaments, elections or trials and that &ldquo;demokratiski&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, because we know that and because we shall never fear to proclaim it, the materialists must persecute Christianity or perish themselves.</P>
    <P>And so, Sir, I have asked Dáil Éireann to put these things on record. We understood that the Minister for External Affairs found himself, four weeks ago, when this matter was first raised in the House by way of Question, deterred from action.  It was not for the want of will, as I believe that the Prime Minister in this matter shares my views as a Catholic.  I know that his Catholicity is no more in question <Col N="1331" /> than my own and I doubt little that, if all were known about us both, of the two he is much the better Catholic in practice&mdash;and that is no great tribute.  That facet of the question is not at issue, but, understanding that diplomatic difficulties made it impossible for him to act, for diplomatic reasons, I ask Parliament to come in not as between diplomats but as between Parliaments.</P>
    <P>Experienced Deputies of this House will remember that we had a Parliamentary Union, where the Sovereign Parliaments of the world came together and where emphasis was always laid on the fact that, in that Union, no regard is had to the side of the House to which a delegate belongs. When he comes to represent Parliament at the Inter-Parliamentary Union, he may come from the Government Benches, the Opposition Benches or the middle benches, but he is there as a representative of Parliament, and Parliament meets Parliament without reference to the internal divisions of every free legislative Assembly.  With that in mind, I felt that, if the rules of diplomacy precluded action now by the Minister for External Affairs, no such rules harass the discretion of a Sovereign Parliament to speak to its sister Parliaments; and I ask this House to instruct the Ceann Comhairle to convey our message, on behalf of the Irish people, to every other free Parliament associated with it in that free association.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that the substance of what I have said here is acceptable to almost every Deputy of this House, though I ask none to adopt the style. However, I cannot conceal a certain measure of surprise that, while this motion was before the Government for three weeks, it was not until 11.30 on Tuesday night that the Minister for External Affairs elected to inform the Press that it was his intention to move an amendment.  Perhaps there was good reason for that.  All I have to say is that, so far as the motion is concerned, it stands.  I find nothing in the amendment to which a reasonable man could possibly demur and, if it appeared upon the Order Paper as a <Col N="1332" /> separate motion, I would gladly vote for both and would cheerfully commend both to the House.  Yet I am at a loss to understand&mdash;and I await the Taoiseach's intervention to learn&mdash;why he deems it expedient to move the obliteration of the motion I have set down.</P>
    <P>I have asked this Parliament to speak to other Parliaments in the confident hope and belief that Christian people and all those who are not blinded by hatred of Christendom will join with us in demanding that the name of justice will not be invoked to wreak injustice, that the hallowed forms of law will not be travestied to outrage law and that the rights of freedom won from tyrants down through the centuries by the blood of thousands of men, who willingly shed it to secure that priceless treasure of freedom for their children, will not be used by tyrants in our time&mdash;perhaps, the bloodiest tyrant the world has ever seen in its long history&mdash;to trample down the generation into which we were born.  Let nobody apprehend that, if we do what lies within our power to do in this House to-day, we shall act in vain.  Remember, that when we stood alone against what most prudent people declared to be unbeatably superior odds, it was the understanding, trust and faith of friends throughout the world that sustained and bore us up.  There are others in the world to-day who want that help from us and we can give it.  If we give it readily, I believe there are others in the world who will take courage and gather round us.  Let us make clear that, whatever the tyrants may hope, we give the assurance that we will not forget, we will not weary and that we will never desert the cause the tyrants hope to see betrayed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;Dáil Éireann, gravely concerned at the unjust trial and imprisonment of Archbishop Stepinac, and at the <Col N="1333" /> accumulating evidence of the existence of a campaign of religious persecution in certain parts of Europe, and convineed that recognition of the sovereignty of God and the moral law is the fundamental basis of any just and stable world order, and that freedom to worship God truly, in the manner that He Himself has ordained, is the inalienable right of man, respect for which is essential to the preservation of peace among the nations, calls upon all peoples who desire true liberty and lasting peace to use their combined influence to bring religious persecution everywhere to an end and to secure acceptance of liberty of conscience as one of the basic principles of a genuine world organisation, and urges the Minister for External Affairs to take steps to bring these views of Dáil Éireann to the attention of the States with which we have diplomatic relations and to take such other steps as may be proper to secure for them the adherence of freedom-loving peoples&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If there is no objection, I should prefer to defer the moving of my amendment until some other speakers have given their views.  I cannot formally move the amendment and reserve what I have to say.  I can speak only once and I should like to hear some of the views which might be expressed by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is asking the House to set aside the motion proposed by Deputy Dillon and, in the terms of the amendment to be proposed by himself, he asks the House to urge him to do certain things. What we are particularly anxious about, before carrying this debate any further, is to hear from the Taoiseach the reasons why the motion, in the terms in which he puts it before the House, should be passed and to obtain any information he has as to why the motion should be passed in his particular form and why the motion proposed by Deputy Dillon should be rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure the Taoiseach has requested is not <Col N="1334" /> without precedent.  The practice is for the mover of an amendment to move the amendment as soon as the main motion has been seconded but, owing to the nature of the matter for discussion and the special position of the Taoiseach, both as Taoiseach and as Minister for External Affairs, I am of opinion that that practice need not be followed on this occasion.  Deputies are really at no disadvantage as the terms of the motion, as well as the terms of the amendment, are on the Order Paper.  As I have said, it is not without precedent that an amendment should be moved at a later stage in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any Deputy would dispute your decision that the course proposed to be followed is not without precedent.  But precedents can be very dangerous things to follow at certain times.  Here we have an important motion&mdash;important nationally and of vital importance internationally&mdash;in a state of affairs in which the Christian and sentimental feelings of everybody in this country are outraged.  A motion has been on the Order Paper for some weeks giving expression&mdash;no matter how slight&mdash;to the outraged feelings not only of Catholics but of every Christian and of members of every creed in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After some time, the head of the Government&mdash;for some reason, at the moment, undisclosed to Parliament&mdash; thought it advisable to put down an amendment to delete every word in Deputy Dillon's motion.  I have no doubt that there are very good grounds for the motion to delete Deputy Dillon's motion but is it reasonable to leave the House leaderless on such an important occasion, that the leader of the House should refuse to lead and that he should want Deputies to discuss and to speculate on his reasons for not accepting that particular motion?  Politics can be very disreputable. Politics should not be played in association with this particular motion.  As one Opposition Deputy, I beseech the Leader of the House to lead the House&mdash;at least to take the House into his confidence as to why he objects to the motion that has been placed before the House and <Col N="1335" /> so eloquently expounded on behalf of the people of this State of ours.</P>

      <P>On the question of order, may I suggest that the motion, which is now called an amendment, in the name of the Minister for External Affairs bears no relation whatever to the amendment which may have created the precedent to which you referred?  May I express my surprise at the suggestion that, in relation to the Standing Orders of this House, the Taoiseach or anybody else occupies a special position?  I suggest that this is not an ordinary amendment.  It is an alternative motion and I suggest further that, if the amendment, or motion, in the name of the Minister for External Affairs is not moved at this stage, it cannot be moved at any stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>On a point of order, may I respectfully submit that, if my motion and an amendment to delete my motion are to be discussed simultaneously, I and other Deputies are at least entitled to know what we are discussing?  If you rule that both are to be discussed together, we cannot do that unless we first hear the Taoiseach's amendment expounded.</P>

      <P>I have now and again appealed to members of the Opposition to recognise that I have a special position here, particularly in regard to external affairs, and that if matters arise to which I would not be in a position to reply&mdash;having spoken once&mdash;I might be given an opportunity of doing so some time, either by speaking a second time or on other occasions by delaying my remarks until I had heard the Deputies on the Opposition side. I should have known now that courtesy of that kind is not likely to be accorded to me by certain members of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I was very foolish to ask it.  I do not propose to press it.  I therefore formally move the amendment.  In this matter I had hoped that we would be of one mind. I believe that everyone who is at all <Col N="1336" /> aware of the conditions in certain parts of Europe to-day must feel as I feel, and as Deputy Dillon feels, about the whole situation, that there is one thing that every one of us here should endeavour to do&mdash;to help.  It is a question of how best we can be helpful.  Can we be more helpful by denunciation or by some constructive method by which we shall keep with us people whose views fundamentally must be the same as our own?  Since this matter was first raised here, I have done my utmost to get information by private reports to check what I might regard as universal knowledge, namely, that Archbishop Stepinac had been submitted to a procedure which&mdash;I will accept Deputy Dillon's view of it&mdash;was really not entitled to be called a trial at all, that following this procedure he was sentenced to a period of imprisonment and forced labour, that he was not the only victim of the present régime in YugoSlavia but that in fact there was taking place there and in other parts of Europe an active religious persecution, adding to the miseries of the unfortunate people in that country, and the other parts of Europe which were occupied during the recent war.  The result of any information I have been able to get has been to confirm the view that information which Deputies are likely to have got, and the information which has come to the ordinary individual through the Press, is well-founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is: What can we do about it?  What can we do effectively about it?  Deputy Dillon is of the opinion that one thing that can be done is to bring comfort to the people who are suffering.  I am afraid that information of our action is not likely to reach these people, to be of comfort to them. He suggests that this Parliament should send our resolution to the other Parliaments in what was called the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  Unfortunately, the Inter-Parliamentary Union had to go out of existence during the war and it is only now being reorganised.  In any case, it is not a body that meets regularly.  I am not sure whether the procedure of the Parliaments that might be represented in it, when it is reorganised, would permit of any resolution of ours being brought before <Col N="1337" /> them.  It is not usual for Legislatures, as far as I know, to meet and pass a resolution in this particular way. Some do, I know, but if good is to be done in a case like this, it means constant and persistent effort.</P>
    <P>There is a recognised way in which States make representations to other States and that is through the channels of their Ministries of Foreign Affairs, or of External Affairs.  I believe that this is the proper channel by which any representation which this Parliament has to make to other States should be made.  For that reason, I have changed the proposal from one proposing that the resolution be communicated to Parliaments to one urging the Minister for External Affairs to make representations to the States, in the first instance, with which we have diplomatic relations.  That would not prevent the Minister, whoever he might be, from also using any other means he might have to bring these matters to the attention of other Governments. Consequently I think that the channel suggested by the Deputy is the wrong one, and the right one, in my opinion, is the channel which is recognised as the method by which one nation or one State communicates with another.</P>
    <P>The next difference is this.  No matter how strong any one of us may feel, my own opinion is that the language of denunciation is not the type of language that will get support, even from those who may feel that it is fundamentally justified.  It is not the sort of language to get the support and cooperation of other peoples.  I believe the resolution which I have suggested is more likely to get support from other people.  It is constructive in the sense that it asks other States to take combined action with us, and to use their combined influence, whatever it may be, to get the principle of religious liberty accepted.  It is not asking for something that is new.</P>
    <P>It is asking for the acceptance of a principle which, in the case of the old League of Nations, was suggested by President Wilson as a fundamental article.  Agreement was then not secured, and the article did not appear in the League Covenant afterwards, <Col N="1338" /> but it is a principle which appeals to all right-thinking people and a principle which will find acceptance, I am satisfied, in a very wide field indeed.</P>
    <P>The present organisation of the United Nations has already a commission on fundamental human rights. A number of the nations represented there hold very strongly that there should be an international agreement by which these fundamental rights will be guaranteed as a part of the domestic law of the several nations.  The difficulty, of course, is to get machinery by which such an agreement can be reasonably enforced.  It is not easy to do that.  The immediate barrier, of course, is the jealousy with which each nation regards its own sovereignty and the fact that these several nations are not willing to admit that there should be any super-national authority which would have the right to investigate the conduct of affairs in their own territory.</P>
    <P>Now, I think that most of the peoples represented in the United Nations Organisation are completely dissatisfied with the present position and that inevitably there will be a move forward towards the position in which all nations will realise that, if there is to be a proper foundation for peace, each of the nations joining that organisation will have to admit that there must be some means, some authority, by which the carrying out of agreements of this kind will be supervised.  I believe that if we move with that current, we shall be able to do some good and will not simply be voices crying out in the wilderness. For that reason I believe that it is very much better that we should indicate our own view with regard to these fundamental rights.  I do not think that the right of men to give homage to the Creator in the way in which He Himself has ordained is denied in principle.  Even in some of the States about which Deputy Dillon spoke, there is a formal admission of the right to practise one's religion.</P>
    <P>I admit that it is a formal admission, and that, although formal adherence is given to that principle, it is, in fact, denied in practice.  What it is necessary to secure is not merely that <Col N="1339" /> the principle shall be accepted but that the principle shall be observed in practice. If, then, we wish, and I am sure it is the wish of everybody, to be of the utmost help we can be in present circumstances, in my opinion the line indicated by the amendment I ask Dáil Éireann to accept will be far more effective.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, gravely concerned at the unjust trial and imprisonment of Archbishop Stepinac, and at the accumulating evidence of the existence of a campaign of religious persecution in certain parts of Europe, and convinced that recognition of the sovereignty of God and the moral law is the fundamental basis of any just and stable world order, and that freedom to worship God truly, in the manner that He Himself has ordained, is the inalienable right of man, respect for which is essential to the preservation of peace among the nations, calls upon all peoples who desire true liberty and lasting peace to use their combined influence to bring religious persecution everywhere to an end and to secure acceptance of liberty of conscience as one of the basic principles of a genuine world organisation, and urges the Minister for External Affairs to take steps to bring these views of Dáil Éireann to the attention of the States with which we have diplomatic relations and to take such other steps as may be proper to secure for them the adherence of freedom-loving peoples.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that, we have, in calm language, the assertion, first of all, of our concern at this unjust trial and imprisonment and at the campaign of religious persecution in certain parts of Europe.  I do not think Deputy Dillon has overdrawn the picture of that situation.  In all these countries there is intense human suffering.  I think there is nothing more horrible to think of than the position in which the unfortunate peoples in certain parts of Europe find themselves at present. After a war in which their country has been devastated, they are faced with the usual complement to the occupation of countries by a foreign foe&mdash;all the bitterness resulting from <Col N="1340" /> the difference of opinion among the people as to whether there should be active resistance to that foe or whether there should be only a sort of passive resistance until the weight of the pressure had passed over.  In these circumstances a small group has been able, by counting on aid from an outside Power and with the help of active and well equipped supporters, to impose&mdash;even though a small minority&mdash;its will by terroristic methods upon the down-trodden population.</P>
    <P>That is the picture which I have been able to gather from the reports which I have tried to collate and to examine.  Unfortunately, it does not apply to one place alone.  There is evidence that the same methods are being adopted in several parts of Europe.  There is no doubt in my mind&mdash;and I do not think any Deputy need have any doubt in his mind&mdash;in referring to the position in the terms in which I have referred to it&mdash;that there is accumulating evidence of the existence of a campaign of religious persecution in certain parts of Europe.</P>
    <P>Persecution of opinion in any form is one of the most grievous wrongs that can be done to a human being. But, when human beings are persecuted simply because they regard themselves as creatures who have been created by an all-powerful God, Who is the Ruler of the universe, and because they wish to worship that Creator in the manner in which He Himself has ordained, it becomes intolerable.  Unfortunately, this is not the first time in the world's history that there has been religious persecution. But, years ago when I was a younger man, I did not think that I would ever live to see religious persecution renewed on a large scale throughout the world.  Yet, that is the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is a vain attempt to try to prevent people from giving to God the worship which they feel to be due to Him.  It has not succeeded in the past and it will not succeed in the future.  But untold human suffering can be caused by the attempt, and I believe that there is not a single member of our community who does <Col N="1341" /> not feel that that is a situation in which everything we can do to help should be done.</P>
    <P>In asking you to agree to the second paragraph, I am asking you to register your conviction that recognition of the sovereignty of God and of the moral law is an essential foundation for peace in the world.  I have never been able to understand why political powers should try to persecute religion.  Everybody who has made any study of the question knows that religion, and the Catholic religion in particular, imposes an obligation to obey in all rightful ways the civil authority.  One would think that those who want peace and order in their territories would, from a purely human point of view, be inclined to foster religion.  As Voltaire or some other Frenchman said, it would be necessary to invent God if it was thought that He did not exist. It is well known that civil society is better organised and knit together when it is recognised that human beings are not mere brutes, that they have not merely bodies but souls, that they have not merely a life here but a life hereafter, and that the moral law has sanctions other than those of mere convention.  We believe, therefore, that if there is to be genuine peace in the world, we should have a recognition of the moral law and of the existence of the Ruler of the universe as a foundation for it; and the next paragraph goes on to call upon the peoples who think with us, who respect true liberty&mdash;and I do not think that anybody who has any regard for liberty will deny that liberty of conscience is the most fundamental of all liberties&mdash; to combine with us to secure that religious freedom is accepted as the basis of any true genuine world organisation.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not think it is necessary to use strong language when you have strong feelings.  The position in the world is sufficiently well known to all who are likely to listen to our appeals to excite in them the natural indignation which we ourselves feel and the desire, without any words from us, to see the principles stated in the amendment adopted generally.  It is for that reason that I think Dáil <Col N="1342" /> Eireann would do very much more good by adopting the amendment which I have deliberately suggested to Deputy Dillon's motion.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, our aim in this terrible situation ought to be to do everything that we can to help and to take the steps which we think are most likely to be of value.  If it were simply a question of giving voice to our indignation, that would be a different matter; but the task before us is something more than that, namely, to make a continuous effort over a considerable period, an effort which will not be finished when the knowledge of this resolution that we pass here is communicated to others, but an effort to be followed up, day in and day out, as being one of the most important matters to which we could give attention. I think that that can be best done by using the channels which are available.  This I do know, that in so far as we have been able to get reports from other countries&mdash;they are naturally confidential&mdash;the views which I have expressed here and the views which have been generally expressed this evening are shared elsewhere, and the desire to end the situation is there also.  It is a question of getting the backing of sufficient opinion to make that desire effective.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, the big difficulty at the moment is this question of intervention in what might be regarded as the internal affairs of a sovereign State.  That is the principal difficulty in connection with the States that would desire to help.  It is, therefore, a question of how to bring the necessary influence to bear.  My own belief is that if the principle of religious liberty is accepted and if there is any doubt of its being accepted in good faith&mdash;of course, if it is accepted in good faith, then all is right &mdash;there must be some means by which an opportunity will be given to the world organisation to satisfy itself that effect is being given in practice to the principle.  If that is an interference with sovereignty, then I think it will have to be faced.  If we cannot depend on the principle which we regard as vital being acted upon, there must be <Col N="1343" /> some recognised international authority by which the observance of the principle can be followed up and assured.  It is, in my opinion, a matter much more fundamental than the question of internal sovereignty.  It is not a matter affecting merely the individuals in a particular State.  It is a matter of world importance and of consequence to hundreds of millions of people throughout the world.  Because I believe that that is so, I believe that the pressure of public opinion upon the various Parliaments and the various Governments will be sufficient ultimately, if it is properly organised, to get agreement on the general principle, and to get some machinery by which the principle will not be allowed to become a dead letter.</P>
    <P>To my mind, therefore, this resolution is not to be regarded as an isolated act or as dealing with a particular momentary situation.  It is a thing that will require following up day by day over a considerable period of time.  There is only one machinery in the State which is capable of doing that, and that is the machinery by which contact is maintained with other nations and by which the views of our Government and our people are communicated to other peoples.  I accordingly think, from every point of view, that it is desirable that this amendment should be taken rather than Deputy Dillon's resolution.</P>

      <P>I would be particularly anxious in this debate that nothing that we should say here should appear abroad to detract from what I regard as the unanimity of feeling that there is here.  I do not think that Deputy Dillon's motion would be the correct type of motion to do the good that I hope can be done.  I may be wrong about the amount of good that can be done, but in any case, I feel it is our duty to do the utmost we can. No matter how much I appreciate, and I am sure all of us here appreciate, the indignation which has prompted the terms of Deputy Dillon's motion, I do <Col N="1344" /> not think that it would be desirable, in sending it to other countries, that we should use language which might be regarded in any way or by anybody as extravagant.  I therefore think the calm language will not detract in the slightest from the force of our feeling in the matter.  The use of calm language, indicating a certain principle for which we would try to secure adherence by persistent effort, is by far the wiser course.</P>
      <P>As to Deputy Dillon's direct question, I think it would not be desirable to have the two.  I think the first sentence of the amendment implies the condemnation that Deputy Dillon is anxious about.  We do agree that this has been an unjust trial and an unjust imprisonment and we agree that there is accumulating evidence that there is a campaign of persecution.  The question after that is, what effective steps can we take, and I am satisfied that the method I am suggesting is the best.</P>
      <P>I was asked why I left the putting down of the amendment so late.  The point was that it was decided that we should have this debate this week.  I was anxious to get as much information as I could to satisfy myself that, when we were taking action of this kind, we were absolutely sure of our ground.  I think it was my duty to do so.  I promised then that it would be taken this week and I gave notice to the Dáil of the amendment.  I think it was two days ago&mdash;whatever is the usual notice.</P>

      <P>Is there any reason in the world why the Taoiseach should not send his resolution and Deputy Dillon's resolution to the Inter-Parliamentary Union?

      <P>The amendment says &ldquo;to take such other steps&rdquo;.  If I found that one of these particular bodies were meeting, and if I found that it might suitably be done, then I would consider forwarding this resolution to it.  I could even, if necessary, come here to the Dáil and ask the Ceann <Col N="1345" /> Comhairle to do it.  It would take some time to go over the various Parliaments to find out what their procedure is.  The method of procedure that was indicated by Deputy Dillon would be quite unusual.  I do not want that a resolution solemnly passed in Dáil Éireann should be simply marked &ldquo;read&rdquo; or thrown into a waste-paper basket.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated that he is now convinced that a terrible situation exists, in Europe particularly, and that it concerns matters that are of vital importance to us, and that we must give them attention from day to day. That being so, I think we are dealing in a rather calamitous manner with that position.  Whether we wish to-day to raise our voices in such a way that it will reach the afflicted Catholics of Europe and their leaders and particularly the person who personifies those afflicted people to-day in people's imaginations, or whether we want to reason with the oppressors of the Catholics of Europe, or whether we want to gather our own strength and our own minds to meet any responsibility we may have in the matter, whether it is any one of these things that we are most concerned with, we are not doing it to-day. When we look at the problem that is put before this Irish Parliament to-night, I wonder whether we are fit to pay honour to the spirit that is standing up for the Catholic Faith in Europe against the oppression we have heard described here to-night. We are not able to do it.  Here in this Irish Parliament, with the unanimity the Taoiseach admits that there is in the country and here, we are unable to do it in a form of resolution which gives complete expression to that unity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Archbishop was arrested on the 18th September and before the Dáil met on the 23rd October he had been sentenced.  On the very first day that the Dáil met, after its long Recess, the feeling of the people throughout the country here was expressed by three questions put to the Taoiseach, and at that particular time he could offer us <Col N="1346" /> no information on the situation.  He could offer us no hope that he could get any information.  He said in the end, after he had been pressed as to why with all the Ambassadors and representatives that we have throughout the world, at the Vatican, in the United States and in Great Britain, he could not get the information.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think that I can secure for the Dáil information which would enable the Dáil to make an authoritative pronouncement either.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was following that attitude on the part of the Minister for External Affairs that Deputy Dillon put down his motion.  The Taoiseach now tells us that everything that was felt by our people, that everything that was suggested by our questions here on the 23rd October, and that everything that Deputy Dillon says here to-night is all true, and more than true, and yet he could not convey to me, or to the Leader of any other Party or to Deputy Dillon, the mover of the motion, that it was desirable, if there was to be any strength in our voice or any appreciation of our unity on the matter here, that a resolution should be framed that would express the mind of every Party in the House and of our people as a whole.  Surely, it would have been easy to do that.  Instead of our being presented by agreement with &mdash;of our being able to co-operate in framing&mdash;an adequate expression of our people's mind in the Parliament here, the House is being asked to divide and to repudiate the terms of Deputy Dillon's motion which has brought us to the point that we are discussing this resolution here to-night.</P>
    <P>As I say, I wonder if we are fit to speak on this matter at all for our people because I do not think that two votes here to-night, one against Deputy Dillon's motion and one of acceptance of the Taoiseach's motion, are going adequately to express our people's mind at all.  It is not the kind of expression of their minds that they would like to go, whether to the countries that are in the Inter-Parliamentary Union on the one hand, or to the countries that we are diplomatically associated with on the other, or to <Col N="1347" /> what is even more important, those nations which are sitting down in the United Nations Organisation trying to work out some adequate machinery to sustain the hopes of the peoples of the world.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, after some preliminary conflict of opinion on the matter of procedure here to-night and when pressed to speak after Deputy Dillon so as to let the House know what was in his mind, charged us all with this: &ldquo;I should have known by now that that courtesy is not likely to be granted by certain members of this House.&rdquo;  I think there is no courtesy that any of us are capable of that we are not prepared to show here to those who are the representatives of the people charged with executive authority in this Parliament, particularly in matters of difficulty and danger, and more particularly in matters in which we would be anxious to show to the people who despise and trample on the Catholic Faith in the world what the Catholic Faith means to us in the discharge of our public duties and responsibilities. We are asked here to raise our voices to condemn the persecution of the Catholic Faith in Europe.  That is practically what we are asked to do and we do so.  Even if Deputy Dillon's resolution uses strong language with regard to some of the countries that are involved in this persecution, I think it should have been the responsibility of the Minister for External Affairs to make representations in private to Deputy Dillon on that particular subject.  I think it would have been possible to get his point of view accepted in that matter, and that it would have been possible to get a unified and agreed resolution.</P>
    <P>At any rate, we are here and we do protest against the persecution that is going on in Europe.  We do protest against the unjust trial and against the imprisonment of the Archbishop.  We do protest against the general terrorism, the persecution and murder of which the persecution and imprisonment of the Archbishop are but the outward signs.  But if we are to gather our strength here, our political strength and our spiritual strength to deal with the threatening situation in Europe, <Col N="1348" /> then we will have to approach our joint consideration of these matters here in a different way from that in which we have approached it in the present instance.  We cannot show to the Archbishop in our discussion or in our resolution to-night any of the Christian composure that he has had to show in the midst of his difficulties, whether they were difficulties outside before he was arrested and imprisoned, or whether they are the difficulties that he is faced with now.  Surely, if we are going to carry any hope to any of the peoples that are being oppressed, then we have to see in what way we are going to show in our public consideration of these matters, as well as in our general public work, some of that Christian composure that we know the peoples who are suffering have to show in their sufferings.  We can hear the Voice that told Peter in Gethsemane to put up the sword ringing throughout the world: we can hear that Voice talking to the warring voices in the United Nations Organisation and the addition of corvettes or armaments is not going to be of any strength either to the people in the United Nations Organisation or to those in any other country in facing the difficulties that have been described here to-night and that we know exist.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has spoken of the countries that we are diplomatically associated with.  Let us tell them what we think, and let us tell every country in the world what we think.  The most effective way he can tell them what we think is by unanimity of voice, by unanimity of action and by unanimity of spirit.  I do not see why we, who are an applicant nation for membership of the United Nations Organisation and who want to be a member of that organisation simply because we believe that we can carry into it some of the strength and some of the spirit and some of the steadfastness which inspired Archbishop Stepinac, should not tell the nations of the United Nations Organisation what we think of this particular matter.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, it is all the more regrettable that a unanimously agreed motion has not been put before the House on the direction, or advice, or invitation of the Taoiseach.  The <Col N="1349" /> amendment before us asks us to urge the Minister for External Affairs to take steps.  The original questions tabled in this House on the 23rd October were sufficiently urging on the Minister to take steps and to take the initiative to express our national voice either through Parliament, or otherwise. I feel that the most eloquent testimony of our appreciation of the situation as it exists would be if we, instead of bringing this debate to-night to a conclusion and taking a division on this motion, would clearly define what our attitude ought to be both as regards expression and deed as a Catholic nation with a free Parliament of its own.  I think that the debate should be adjourned and that a common motion expressing the mind of all Parties in the House should be framed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody in the country was more than shocked when they learned from the Taoiseach's statement that the trial of Archbishop Stepinac was unjust and was carried out in anything but a judicial manner. I think that this is not an occasion on which we should mince our words in the condemnation of his trial.  We are a newly-born State with an intensely Catholic tradition behind us.  Our memories are not so short that we cannot ourselves revert to religious persecution in the days of our forefathers. I think it is only fitting and proper that we in this Parliament should unanimously condemn the unjust and unfair trial to which Archbishop Stepinac has been subjected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Taoiseach that the wording of Deputy Dillon's motion is either too violent or too outspoken. I think we could not be too outspoken in our condemnation of what has taken place.  We should make it perfectly clear to all the nations of the world what our stand is in this matter. There must be no shilly-shallying about it.  I do not think the wording of the amendment differs in any vital respect from the wording of Deputy Dillon's motion except in relation to the manner in which the message will be conveyed to the various States and Parliaments.  I think myself that the proper channel of conveyance should <Col N="1350" /> be through the Minister for External Affairs and not through the Ceann Comhairle.  I think it is to be deplored that the position might arise where the House would be asked to divide on this question.  Anybody who is in agreement with the amendment must definitely be in agreement also with the motion itself and we should not be asked to divide on a matter in which the fundamentals in each case are identical.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Taoiseach made no case for the amendment.  It is not an amendment; it is merely a repetition of Deputy Dillon's motion couched in milder language.  I think Deputy General Mulcahy made a very reasonable suggestion and one which I am sure both Deputy Dillon and the Taoiseach will agree with&mdash;that is, that the House should not be asked to divide on the amendment and that both the Taoiseach and Deputy Dillon should, if necessary, compromise on the wording.  The Taoiseach has told us, in effect, that his principal objection to the motion is the wording of the motion and that his amendment is worded much more mildly.  In my opinion his amendment is not an amendment.  It repeats practically word for word Deputy Dillon's motion. The only essential difference is the vehicle through which the motion will be conveyed to other States and Parliaments.  I do not think that in itself is a sufficient cause for dividing the House.  If there is to be a division then I think that a ridiculous situation will arise because every Deputy must vote both for the amendment and for the motion.</P>
    <P>We are the Parliament of an intensely Catholic nation and we would resent to the very utmost any intrusion or attempted intrusion of Communism into this country.  We have reached the stage now when the struggle is one of Communism versus Christianity, as has been illustrated in the case of Archbishop Stepinac.  I do not agree with the Taoiseach that the phraseology of Deputy Dillon's motion is too strong in voicing the opinion of this Parliament.  The Taoiseach, in the course of his speech, said that the motion of itself would be of very little <Col N="1351" /> comfort.  I think myself that 100 years ago the people of this nation would have been grateful to the Parliament of any other nation which would have condemned at that time some of the injustices done to us.  I am sure that our forefathers would not condemn such a Parliament if the language was perhaps a bit too strong.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would ask the Taoiseach and Deputy Dillon to reach some compromise and not to put this matter to a division.  I think it would be shameful to ask the House to divide on it.  It is not a subject on which the House should divide.  I would ask them to come together and agree on the wording and agree as to the correct vehicle through which the Parliaments of other nations will be informed of our action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, not merely our own people but the world generally was shocked to learn that at this stage of our civilisation a venerable dignitary of the Catholic Church should be selected for persecution, should be selected for public insult, should be selected for humiliation, should be selected for imprisonment and forced labour, and all this within a short period after the conclusion of a war which was ostensibly waged to advance the cause of human liberty and human progress throughout the world.  The character of the court which tried Archbishop Stepinac does not commend itself to those who regard a fair trial as one of the inalienable rights of every man and woman.  The character of that court obviously made the court a chamber for executing the previously arranged practices of those who manipulated the trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reported attitude of the prosecutor and of the trial judge has filled the world and all those who prize liberty, and particularly religious liberty, with a deep sense of horror that happenings of that kind should be possible in Europe to-day.  It is little wonder, then, that the conscience of the world has been shocked when it realises that a venerable Archbishop, noted for his adherence to his religion, to the principles of that religion, to the canons of that religion, has been <Col N="1352" /> selected apparently as the spear-point for an attack on the Catholic religion in Yugo-Slavia; and not merely has been selected for attack, but has been selected for public humiliation, for imprisonment, and many of his flock as well have been selected for similar persecutions.</P>
    <P>The Government of Yugo-Slavia, by its conduct in this matter, has earned for itself a very unenviable reputation among the freedom-loving peoples of the world and, indeed, Yugo-Slavia has a right to give evidence of a greater appreciation of its new-found liberty than to visit on others the persecution which she endured all too long. Indeed, to me and many others it is regrettable that a country which showed so much promise in the vanguard of democratic thought and human progress should have decided, by its persecution of Dr. Stepinac, to replace the yolk of Nazi thraldom by an equally detestable tyranny, the tyranny of religious persecution.</P>
    <P>I know, and others know, that efforts have been made to give the trial of Dr. Stepinac a political complexion and to make it appear that the Archbishop was the enemy of his country.  But in that matter I am satisfied to accept the viewpoint of the Vatican, that citadel of eternal truth, that so far as Dr. Stepinac was concerned he was guilty of no crimes against his country, no collaboration with his country's enemies.  His only offence in the eyes of his persecutor was that he lived his religion and was not prepared to be made a plaything of by those who disliked his religion and hope ultimately to extinguish it.</P>
    <P>Our voice in this matter will be added to the protests which, I feel sure, an outraged world will make against this attack on human liberty and religious freedom, and by adding our voice to the general world protests, we can thereby demonstrate that, as a people who love liberty and who extend religious liberty to all our own people, we want to make it clear that we do not for one moment stand apart from that informed and intelligent thought throughout the world which properly condemns the action of those <Col N="1353" /> who have manipulated the imprisonment of Dr. Stepinac.</P>
    <P>There is one very melancholy aspect about this whole business and there is, perhaps, one consoling aspect as well. The apparently incurable vanity of man is surely made manifest when mere mortals, the products of a political convulsion, can to-day fondle the illusion that nearly 2,000 years after the coming of Christ they can put out the light of religion in Europe.  That is the melancholy aspect of this matter, but there is a consoling aspect as well, and that is that the Church, to which over 90 per cent. of our people give adherence and unquestioning loyalty, may be persecuted, may be assailed, may reel under one blow after another, may suffer, and its adherents may suffer tyranny and persecution, but at least we have one consolation, the word of Almighty God, that the gates of hell shall not prevail against the Church.</P>
    <P>So far as protesting against the trial of Archbishop Stepinac is concerned, I think there will be general agreement amongst all Parties in this House at the principle of protesting against the travesty of a trial to which he was subjected. I regret, therefore, that it has not been possible to phrase a motion which would command general support in the Dáil.  I subscribe to the principle of the protest set out in Deputy Dillon's motion, just as I subscribe to the principle of the protest set out in the Taoiseach's amendment but, looking at the matter in a reasonable way, our view is that the amendment, in the circumstances in which it is moved and in view of the problem confronting us, is preferable to the motion itself.  We think the amendment is a more reasoned and more constructive and a more dignified approach to the problem, that it approaches the matter in a way in which only the Government of a State can approach that problem, and it is because of the fact that the amendment appears to us to be more reasoned and constructive than the motion proper&mdash;although we can support the sentiments enshrined in the motion&mdash;that the Labour Party have decided warmly to support the protest contained in the Taoiseach's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on behalf of the National Labour Party to support Deputy Dillon's motion for the reason that the motion is clear and every man in the country can understand what it means.  The Taoiseach's amendment is weak, because it tries to eliminate from Deputy Dillon's motion the real kernel of the situation in this country; it tries to remove the words &ldquo;Russia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Communism&rdquo;.  We in this Party recognise the power and the influence of the Communist Party in this country.  We are the ones who suffered and if the words we heard here to-night were spoken elsewhere by the Irish Labour Party, probably the Communists would never have such a power and grip as they have in this country to-day.  We have to put up with certain influences inside a Party; we have to fight the elements of Communism inside and we see the results of their actions throughout the country at the present time.  While the Minister for Justice maintains they are armchair men&mdash;they could only fit in an armchair&mdash;does he realise the power and influence they have, not alone in Dublin but in other parts of the country?  They are responsible for many of the disturbances that exist in the country to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a so-called band of men here in Dublin masquerading as Labour men, calling upon the Taoiseach and the Irish Government to recognise Russia and to recognise the Yugo-Slav Government.  After their propaganda in Dublin, they went down to a conference of Irish workers in Wexford and had a resolution there demanding the recognition of Soviet Russia, denouncing Franco because he stood up for Christianity, praising Stalin and Molotov because they stood up for slavery and dictatorship.  We had no words of condemnation from the men who should have condemned and who should not have allowed them to progress, as they are progressing in the country at the present time, under false names.  If we had unity outside and had our people to explain the position, it might be different, but the Press refused to give publicity to the statements made.  I say these men <Col N="1355" /> outside in Dublin were not representing the Irish workers, that 99 per cent. of the Irish workers stand against the recognition of Russia or of Communism, that 99 per cent. of the people would vote against even the Taoiseach's Government if he attempted to give recognition to Russia.</P>
    <P>Why are we afraid of Russia at the present time?  Why is the Taoiseach afraid?  I recognise his position as Minister for External Affairs, but I agree with Deputy Blowick that there is no use in playing up to Molotov, Stalin and those men who try to get into the United Nations Organisation. They are not going to support a Catholic country, but they will support the crowd here in this country that will denounce Franco and praise Stalin and Molotov.  We will support Deputy Dillon's motion, because it is clear and determined and represents the views of the common people of this country. It represents the views of the Irish working class, that they want no truck with or recognition of Russia.  We condemn the trial and unjust treatment of all sections of the people, both in Russia and Yugo-Slavia.  If we want to have any idea of what Russia is doing in other parts of the world, or if we have any idea of recognising Russia, let us read the articles published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> each day, showing the activities of the Russian agents, their M.P.'s and others in Canada at the present time and all the trouble they brought into that country.  When the recognition of Russia was demanded in this House by a member of the Irish Labour Party when there was a request that the Government should open up diplomatic negotiations, there was silence, there was no protest made. I know I am representing the people of this country when I say that we want no truck with Russia, we want no recognition of Russia, we want no diplomatic relations with her, good, bad or indifferent.  We are prepared to take the consequences and have them as our enemies since they will be our enemies, as we stand for Catholicity and Christianity.  No matter what diplomatic relations we may have with them, they will have their spy rings, <Col N="1356" /> as they had in Canada and other countries, and they have spy rings in Ireland to-day.  The Minister for Justice states they are only armchair Communists.  They have spread in a good many places in the Twenty-Six Counties.  When the Communist paper was banned in the Six Counties during the war, the Irish Government allowed it, when printed in England, to be circulated freely here in Ireland.  No wonder you have turmoil and trouble by a certain band, no wonder we have men in this House getting up, believing they represent certain people and demanding that the Taoiseach and the Government give recognition to Soviet Russia.  No wonder we are giving them encouragement in other parts of the country to denounce everything we stand for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon pointed out last week that the Irish people would hang them from the lamp posts, but they are so subtle and so clever that they will not come out in the open as such.  They will always play a game for something that is popular, without exposure, until the proper time comes; and then we will find these armchair Communists, as the Minister for Justice calls them, getting into the lead, when their cells have been organised throughout the country; and when they become the leaders and give the orders, perhaps the Minister for Justice may have his eyes opened to the position.  We have the Catholic paper, <i>The Standard,</i> attacked by men who should be giving it support, simply because it is trying to expose the intentions in this country, when other papers are closing their eyes to the serious position.</P>
    <P>We will support Deputy Dillon's motion for the reasons I have explained.  It gives us an opportunity to point out that we have suffered because we are fighting the enemies of Christianity, even those you have in this country masquerading as friends of the working class.  We believe ourselves that the time will come when the people who may not agree with us now will be our warm and whole-hearted supporters, when their eyes have been opened, as ours have been, to the serious menace in our ranks.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure, on behalf of <Col N="1357" /> the National Labour Party, in giving full support to Deputy Dillon's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this debate with a certain amount of timidity.  I am not timid indeed, because I am strong in the view that has been expressed both by the mover of the motion, Deputy Dillon, and the mover of the amendment, the Taoiseach, that we should register our strong protest against the injustice imposed upon not only His Grace of Zagreb but upon other ecclesiastics and on the Church in that country.  I am in agreement with the appeal made by the Leader of the Opposition, that to get the greatest amount of good and the greatest effect, we should have a unanimous resolution.</P>
      <P>Now, with all due respect to the Taoiseach, I wish first to protest most strongly against the assertion that there was no courtesy on these benches.  When principles that we all hold dear are challenged in this country or in any other country we could always be unanimous and there could always be courtesy between us.  It comes badly from the Minister for External Affairs to charge any members of this House with discourtesy upon a matter of this kind and of such grave importance.  Every one of us must remember two facts in the debate that is now taking place.  One is that the Leader of the Opposition, when the Dáil reassembled, asked the Taoiseach a question, to which he got certain replies and, as a result of those replies, it appeared to Deputy Dillon&mdash;I have not consulted Deputy Dillon, but that is the way it appears&mdash;to be incumbent upon him to put down that motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the motion is on the Order Paper for a considerable time.  Then the Taoiseach, out of the clear blue sky, moves this amendment. Apparently, the amendment would not be moved at all if Deputy Dillon had not put down the motion.  Therefore, we have this protest made, because of Deputy Dillon's action in putting down the motion.  Now, I suggest that the Taoiseach is half-hearted in his protest. If he were as strong as Deputy Dillon is, there would be no necessity for Deputy Dillon to have put down a motion at all.  He himself would have <Col N="1358" /> taken the lead in that case, as he has taken it in other cases.  There is no reason in the world why he should not have lived up to what people on the other side call chieftainship or leadership. I am not going to be controversial but I do feel strongly that it would appear as if there was some difference between us as to whether we should protest or not, whereas in reality a protest is agreed upon.  There is only one question at issue and that is what the wording of the protest is to be and what is the best method of giving effect to what we desire.  Deputy Dillon has suggested that we should ask the Speaker of the House to send this resolution to the Speakers or leaders of all free democratic Parliaments and, in particular, to those with whom we are in association in the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</P>
    <P>That is a step that, as a parliamentarian and a democrat, I feel is quite correct.  Deputy Dillon, being the democrat and parliamentarian that he is, believed that to be a correct step to take.  Therefore, I ask the Taoiseach could he not adopt that part of Deputy Dillon's motion as well as his own plan, which is that representations be made to the governments of countries with whom we have diplomatic relations. By agreeing to adopt the action part of Deputy Dillon's motion along with his own, the Taoiseach would show unity in this House in the steps we are taking.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach could have done all this previously but what I resent more than anything else is that, apparently, we are to be forced through the Lobby for or against an amendment and thereby give the impression that we are not at one in condemnation of this terrible conduct by would-be dictators. They are mere twopence-halfpenny-minded men who are prepared to inflict hardship and horrors upon others but who would not be able to stand up to such treatment themselves.  They would be like some of the dictators in Central Europe who cringed and were not able to stand up to their treatment.  I feel that the best interests of all concerned would be served by a unified resolution. I suggest to Deputy Dillon and to the Taoiseach, through you, An Ceann <Col N="1359" /> Comhairle, that this debate should be adjourned and that a joint resolution be put to this House and passed with all the solemnity and strength we can put into it.  When we were threatened with danger in the past six years, there was a council of defence to unify our defensive measures.  Things which we hold sacred&mdash;even more sacred than our country&mdash;are now threatened and attacked.  Surely it behoves us to act as a united nation in whatever step we take&mdash;a nation consisting not of Catholics only but of Protestants, Presbyterians and all other Christians. In that way, we would show that the freedom we fought for, the freedom of freemen to express their views in Parliament and to serve their God and their country was something for which we were prepared to die.  If we stand together, even as a small nation, and send out this message, it will be a cause of hope to those who are being persecuted.  The Irish people are scattered far and wide and we can ask them to associate themselves with us in this protest.  When we show that a united Ireland is taking this strong line, we shall have done something positive.  We will have shown that, where this principle is at stake, we, of all political Parties, are prepared to make any sacrifice.  Therefore, I appeal through the Chair for that unanimous condemnation which should come from the Irish people on this occasion.</P>

      <P>It appears that we are going to turn this motion and amendment into politics.  Could we not, for heaven's sake, forget politics on, at least, one motion.  If we cannot forget politics on this motion and amendment, we cannot forget politics on anything.  If some agreement is not come to and if there is a vote here, how will it look in the papers tomorrow? People outside the country will read of how we divided on a matter on which there is no material difference.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to do something so that this motion and amendment will be made one and there will be no vote.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin said that the amendment was half-hearted.  In my opinion, that is not so.  He said that the motion should have been brought up by the Taoiseach long before Deputy Dillon put it on the paper.  As was explained by the Taoiseach, he, as Minister for External Affairs, had to find exactly what the position was in other countries.  I believe that that was his reason for postponing the discussion of the motion from a week ago to the present.  I believe that Deputy Dillon fully appreciated that that was the reason.  The reason why I intervene in the debate is to ask the Taoiseach and Deputy Dillon if it is not possible for them to come together and let us have a united protest from this House regardless of the different Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the humblest member of this House to the Taoiseach, Deputies unanimously believe that no stone should be left unturned to do what we can in this matter whether through the United Nations Organisation, through the Inter-Parliamentary Union or through our representatives in different States throughout the world. That is, I know, what Deputy Dillon would like to have done and what the Taoiseach by his amendment would like to have done.  Is there any reason, therefore, why they cannot come together as between the motion and the amendment, and frame something to give effect to what we all want to have done&mdash; namely, to expose the tyranny and the <Col N="1361" /> religious persecution that are being carried on by Tito as exemplified in his treatment of the Archbishop?</P>

      <P>They are not there at the moment.  Some of them have been swallowed up; others have not joined.  In any case there is nothing inconsistent between the motion and the words at the end of the amendment&mdash;&ldquo;to take such other steps as may be proper to secure for them the adherence of freedom-loving peoples&rdquo;.  I suppose it is only natural that in a Parliament like this, different Parties should vie with one another to see who can express most fully the fervent faith of the Irish people.  I do not look upon the differences in this House as being very serious at all, even if the House decides to divide on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious thing is that the Government in power is the organ to approach other Powers throughout the world.  The effective organ is the Minister for External Affairs; his Department has full machinery, which is paid for out of the public purse, specially for the purpose of dealing exactly with a matter of this kind.  The authority and the responsibility are placed on their shoulders.  A very admirable suggestion having been made by a member <Col N="1362" /> of the Opposition in the motion, after careful preparation and after examining the reports which have come through the channel of the Department of External Affairs, the Minister for External Affairs put upon the Paper a proposition, which, though less adjectival in form than the motion, he believes to be the most practicable to enable him to carry out what he wants.  The amendment concentrates on certain essential principles which surround the question of religious persecution.</P>
    <P>It is purely from that practical point of view that I intervene in this debate. It is quite unnecessary for any of us to express our feelings upon the attack on our Faith.  We all have a tradition of having suffered greatly.  One speaker said that if 100 years ago some other country had expressed sympathy with us and condemned the treatment of Ireland, we would have been grateful. Undoubtedly we would have been grateful but we would have been infinitely more grateful if that country could have given us really effective help.  Now our Minister for External Affairs on previous occasions has intervened in international affairs and proved himself to be extremely realistic in his approach. On one occasion when Rome was menaced, he expressed an opinion which represented the views of fully 300,000,000 people and his intervention was recognised as having helped enormously to save the City of Rome.  I think that we can very well leave the matter in his hands on this occasion and accept the amendment which he has put forward as not being in any way inconsistent with the motion but as being the most practical proposal in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw that Deputy Dillon some weeks ago had tabled a motion of this character, I expected that it would be accepted unanimously by the House and especially by members of the Government. I was indeed very much alarmed to see that the Taoiseach thought fit to submit an amendment. I feel that the motion has been brought forward by Deputy Dillon in all sincerity.  I further believe that if the Taoiseach was as sincere in this <Col N="1363" /> matter as Deputy Dillon, as was pointed out in this House earlier to-night, it would not have been left to Deputy Dillon to table a motion of this kind.  The motion would have been brought forward immediately after the tragic incident when one of the greatest Princes of the Church was condemned by this reactionary tribunal.  It should have been the business of the Leader of the Irish people to protest in the strongest possible way against that attack on the liberty of a Prince of the Church, on behalf of this country and on behalf of Christianity on the whole.  He happens now to be a leader of a State that is one of the oldest in the world.  It has a proud tradition behind it of a noble defence of the Faith and Christianity in the past.</P>
      <P>If there is one country that has suffered for the faith and for upholding Christian principles it is our own nation.  If the Taoiseach only knew the feelings of the majority of our people on this question, he would have no hesitation in registering as strong a protest as possible against the mock trial of this Prince of the Church and against the circumstances under which the trial was conducted.  I honestly believe that the county councils, corporations and other local authorities that have registered their protest already in this matter believed that the Taoiseach would make a protest on behalf of the Irish nation. I am ready to believe that the strong protests which have been adopted by the county councils throughout the country are falling on deaf ears, when addressed to the Taoiseach, if he does not agree to withdraw his amendment in favour of Deputy Dillon's motion. That motion, in my opinion, is the ideal expression of the sentiments of the majority of our people, and I expected when that motion was placed on the Order Paper, that it would have received the unanimous approval of all Parties.  I for one will be very much ashamed if I have to go back to my constituency after a division on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To every Christian, be he Catholic, Protestant, or Presbyterian&mdash;no matter <Col N="1364" /> what his religion is&mdash;this is a matter of vital importance.  It is an attack on Christianity, and it is our duty to call on those nations with which we have diplomatic relations to protest in the strongest possible terms against that attack.  If there is any nation which has mighty influence with America, it is this nation, and I believe that if the American Government took this matter up seriously, good results would follow.  It is our duty to request our friends abroad, and the American Government more especially, in view of the co-operation which has existed at all times between us, to make a similar protest to that made by Deputy Dillon. It would have very much desired effects.  I appeal to the Government in all sincerity to be unanimous in this matter.  If we are to make a protest, let us make it, and I believe that a unanimous resolution of this House will have a far greater effect than a resolution passed by a majority.  It is most unwise of the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe the Taoiseach is sufficiently noble, courageous and big to accept the terms of the motion, and I believe that, if he does, he will be thought far more of by the majority of our people whose feelings have been outraged by this bitter attack on Christianity.  I strongly urge the House to agree that whatever action is taken will be unanimous, but, so far as I am personally concerned, I intend to record my vote in favour of the motion, which I regard as being stronger than the amendment, and, in doing so, I believe I shall be expressing exactly the desire of our own <Col N="1365" /> people to protest against this attack in the strongest possible terms.</P>
      <P>I believe the Taoiseach is altogether too mild in his attitude to this matter. We should be the first nation to show to the world that we are prepared to protest in the strongest manner against any attack on Christianity, and, furthermore, I believe that if the terms of Deputy Dillon's motion were communicated to the presiding officer of every sovereign Parliament which shares with us membership of the Inter-Parliamentary Union &mdash; and I regard that as the most important part of the motion&mdash;very good effects will be achieved, in view of our great stand at all times for Christianity.  Our country has sent priests and nuns into the mission fields, to the farthest and darkest parts of the world, to strengthen the true Faith, the Faith of Christ, and Ireland having sent such grand and noble people to defend Christian principles and to make known the teachings of Christ where they have never been heard of, I believe it is our duty to make this protest.  The only way in which we can make our protest is by accepting a motion on the lines of that moved by Deputy Dillon.  I hope and trust that the Government, and especially the Taoiseach, who is looked upon in this country as a man of very great knowledge, a far-seeing man and a man blessed with an abundance of wisdom, will see fit not to have a division on a matter of such vital importance, but that this protest will be a protest by the unanimous voices of the elected representatives of the people in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No one will disagree for a moment with the picture of conditions in Europe and of the general position facing the Catholic Church painted so vividly by Deputy Dillon. It requires no words of mine or of any other member to demonstrate the seriousness and the gravity of the situation, which Catholics appreciate more seriously than any other section of the community.  That being so, it behoves us in this House, as representing the people, to consider what means are best suited to give effect to the unanimity of viewpoint which finds <Col N="1366" /> spontaneous expression amongst all sections, classes and creeds in this country in condemnation of that position. Accordingly, we must consider, first, how we can best give expression to the views and opinions of the people represented here, and, secondly, having given expression to those views, how we can make effective those feelings of condemnation.</P>
      <P>It is only natural that this Parliament should decide unanimously what course of action it should adopt, but, unfortunately, that apparently is not to be the case.  Due to the fact that we have not had from the Government the kind of leadership we would expect in a situation of this kind, the greatest effect will not be given to the widespread convictions of all sections in this country.  If we had had, as we might have expected, an agreed motion on the Order Paper and if we had had, then, in the House, statements by the various leaders and by anyone else who felt obliged to speak, it would have been easier and more satisfactory from a national point of view and from the point of view of making our voice and our will effective in world affairs.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, when this question was first raised by Deputy Dillon and others on the resumption of the Dáil after the Recess, the Taoiseach was not in a position to give an authoritative statement on the position and on the conditions attending the trial of Dr. Stepinac.  Subsequently, he felt he had sufficient information at his disposal to enable him to table an amendment to Deputy Dillon's motion.  I think the proper procedure when the Taoiseach received that information would be to communicate privately with Deputy Dillon and suggest, in view of the particular circumstances attending this very serious incident, which was only a manifestation of the widespread Communist persecution of the Church in Europe, that it might be possible with Deputy Dillon and the various Opposition Parties to secure a motion which would find agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the Government are at a serious disadvantage. If Ministers would refrain from insolent interruptions, they might lessen the disadvantage at which they are already.  If we had a little courtesy from the Taoiseach and a little more co-operation in the functioning of Parliament, it might have been possible to get a motion which would commend itself to all sections of the House and which would effectively demonstrate the unanimity of purpose and the unanimity of determination which is reflected in all quarters of this country at the despicable persecution of religion, and the Catholic Church in particular, which has sprung up so vigorously since the cessation of hostilities in Central Europe; not indeed that that persecution <Col N="1368" /> was not rampant in many parts of Europe long before the termination of hostilities.  Unfortunately, possibly due to the anxiety amongst certain members of this House, including Ministers, there was some effort made on this occasion to vie with one another in their anxiety to show that one member of the House was better than another in attempting to give expression to our horror and our hatred of persecution and our anxiety to show that we detested, deplored, and protested against the persecution which is going on.</P>
      <P>I think it is regrettable that, on a matter of this kind which concerns religion and not politics, any attempt should be made even to make it appear that one Deputy, or one section, or one Party is better able to express the Catholic viewpoint or express an opinion on behalf of the community.  I think that however a person may practise his religion, it is a matter for himself and his Creator.  The Commandments and the precepts of the Catholic Church are laid down clearly and, within these, it is open to a person to practise his religion according to his lights and to his conscience.  However we may differ amongst ourselves here, I would hesitate to attempt for a moment to judge any other members of this House because they differ from me or from anyone on the Opposition benches politically.  I would deplore any attempt to suggest that we are superior to any other Deputy in the profession of our Faith or in our knowledge or demonstration of our religion.  That is not the question before us to-night.  It is one which we are not competent and which it is not within our province to judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is before us is that a persecution is rampant in Europe; that that persecution is at the instigation and at the hands of a number of dictators and their satellites and, primarily in this instance, at the hands of Tito, the dictator in Yugo-Slavia, who has unjustly tried, unjustly condemned, and is at the present time holding in unjust imprisonment Dr. Stepinac, the Primate of Croatia.  That being so, it behoves us here in this Parliament to give expression not merely to our views <Col N="1369" /> at the present time, but to the traditional adherence to and appreciation of the Catholic Faith, which has ever been demonstrated throughout our history; which has ever found people like Deputy Dillon and others to express clearly and convincingly, and which has produced martyrs throughout many generations prepared to sacrifice everything in order to show that the fundamental principles which they held dear and which were handed to Peter centuries ago express our beliefs and our hopes.</P>
    <P>But, unfortunately, on this occasion we find ourselves, in the words of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, &ldquo;with no fundamental conflict between the two motions and with differences which are not very serious even if they force Parties in the House to divide.&rdquo;  Surely any ordinary citizen of this country who is not well versed in the ordinary functioning of Parliament must feel astonishment if he finds that, when a motion like Deputy Dillon's and an amendment by the Taoiseach are tabled, not merely does the House not assent to both or either, but actually divides against one.  Surely ordinary persons down the country or in the City of Dublin or our kith and kin across the seas will express astonishment if they find that we divided against one motion merely because it differs in phraseology from another motion dealing with the same subject and the same set of circumstances. Surely they will wonder what is taking place in this Parliament.  Is it not natural that they will consider that we have been playing politics?</P>
    <P>This country has had too regrettable an experience of verbal quibbles to allow a verbal quibble to prevent this Parliament assenting to both motions. I certainly hope that Deputy Dillon will not withdraw his motion.  The Taoiseach says: &ldquo;Everything is grand if you agree with my motion.&rdquo;  That reminds me of Stalin and Molotov: &ldquo;Everything is grand if only other people will be reasonable with us.&rdquo; But there is no co-operation from them. It is all one-sided.  You cannot have co-operation unless two parties attempt to co-operate.  It is childish to suggest that we can accept the <Col N="1370" /> Taoiseach's motion and, at the same time, vote against Deputy Dillon's.  In view of the fact that Deputy Dillon has probably not available to him the sources of information which the Minister for External Affairs normally has, it is only natural that he should use strong words.</P>
    <P>Is it not only right that this country, which has never been afraid to take its stand for the principles it believed in, should use strong language?  Is it not a most regrettable situation that we find ourselves, when we have freedom, with leaders whose feet are of clay?  Is it not only regrettable that we cannot unite, to demonstrate clearly that our history, our experience, our hatred of persecution, primarily of the Catholic Church throughout the Penal times, is reflected in our determination, so far as is within our power, to show the world that we contemn the satanic barbarities of Tito and everyone connected with him?</P>

      <P>The entire Irish nation owes a very deep debt of gratitude to Deputy Dillon for having tabled this motion which enables the House and the Irish nation and the Irish race throughout the length and breadth of the world to voice their emphatic protest against the tyranny and injustice that is being inflicted within a small nation, at the instigation of a powerful, materialist dictatorship.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health asks who is Deputy Dillon? Without referring to Deputy Dillon's family associations with the Irish nation and the cause of Irish freedom, it is necessary to state here and now that Deputy Dillon is an elected representative of the people.  He is a member of Ireland's national Parliament and, as such, he is entitled to express his views clearly and plainly and to seek, as far as lies in his power, to mould public opinion in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a democratic nation.  Democracies depend for their existence and for their greatness upon their ability to produce men of independent thought, with independent minds, who are prepared to take a part in leading the people, who are prepared to give a lead to the plain people.  Deputy Dillon, <Col N="1371" /> like every other Deputy, has come in here as the elected representative of plain, simple, honest working people, people who cannot be expected to frame national policy but who look to their representatives for a lead in the right direction.  It will be admitted that great democracies throughout the world have failed and gone down in humiliation and defeat because they failed to throw up men who were independent enough to lead the people, particularly on questions of right and wrong.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that there should be a division in regard to this motion and amendment but it would be a greater pity if Deputy Dillon's motion had not been submitted to the House. Democracies may be clumsy, they may be awkward in their approach to big questions, they may not have the machine-gun efficiency of the dictatorship, but I think there is no man in any nation, no representative of the Press of any nation, who will not gather from the discussion that has taken place in this House that the Irish nation is solidly united in its condemnation of the tyranny and injustice that has been inflicted on a leader of the Catholic Church.  Since that has been made abundantly clear, is it not a deplorable and terrible tragedy that there is some difference of opinion as to the exact wording of the expression of our views?  It would be eminently desirable if the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition Party and the views expressed by the Leader of this Party were accepted and there could be an agreed motion passed unanimously by the House but, failing agreement, I have no hesitation in going into the Division Lobby, if necessary, and giving my support to Deputy Dillon's motion.</P>
    <P>That motion seeks to bring to the notice of the Parliaments of the free nations of the world our views on this important question.  The Taoiseach has said that only a Government can approach other Governments.  Is it not equally true that only a Parliament can approach other Parliaments, and why should not the Parliament of the Irish nation approach the freely <Col N="1372" /> elected Parliaments of other nations and make it clear that the Irish people will not tolerate tyranny and that, no matter how strong the forces may be that are mobilised behind the attack on religion in Yugo-Slavia, no matter how many millions of down-trodden human beings may be supposed, at least, to be behind the policy, we as Christians know that that policy must inevitably fail?  We know that the forces of materialism, of cruelty, oppression and injustice can never succeed against right, justice, morality and Christianity.</P>
    <P>This venerable and reverend Archbishop stands to-day as the symbol of resistance to cruelty, tyranny and injustice.  His example will be followed in every nation where it is sought to impose the will of the tyrant upon the plain, simple people.  He stands for the upholding of Christian teaching.  He stands for the upholding of the dignity of the human being and the doctrine of the immortality of the soul.  Standing thus, he cannot be overcome.  He may be imprisoned.  He may be tortured.  We do not know&mdash;it is not possible for us to know&mdash;how he may be treated at the moment but, whatever is done to him will be all in vain and, ultimately, right will triumph over might.</P>
    <P>We in our own small way, as a small weak nation, can lend our hand and support to the forces of right.  We as a free nation can rouse the free nations of the earth.  We, as a nation whose race extends throughout the length and breadth of the world, can exert a power and influence that can make the apparently all-powerful tyrants pause and consider whether the course they have adopted is wise or not.  I therefore commend the suggestion which has been made, that there should be an agreed resolution coming from all sections of the House but, whatever is done, we must be grateful to Deputy Dillon for having raised this matter.</P>

Now, I remember being present at a trade union congress which was then called the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress held in Derry nearly 30 years ago, when a double ex-Deputy of this House moved a resolution there hailing the Russian Revolution and hailing the work of Kerenski.  I remember myself challenging the contents of that resolution, and I ask my late colleague, Deputy Everett, in the most friendly way in the wide world, to read the official report at that particular congress and let us know at a later stage, if he speaks on a matter of this kind, how he voted, if he voted at all, on that resolution hailing the Russian Revolution, and expressing the hope that Irish workers would copy the activities of the Russian revolutionary workers at that particular time.</P>

      <P>I do deeply regret that there is such a difference of opinion as to the means by which the views of this House should be conveyed to the world on a matter of this kind.  I think that we are all in agreement on the issue. It is a question of what is the best means or who is the right person to convey the views of the members of this House.  I think that the Taoiseach as Minister for External Affairs is the proper person to convey to the Governments of the world the views of the members of this House on any matter relating to international affairs.  So far as I am personally concerned, although I differ from the Taoiseach and his colleagues on matters of internal economic policy, I believe&mdash; and in this I think I am speaking for the members of this Party&mdash;that the Taoiseach as Minister for External Affairs has handled matters of international concern in an able manner for a long number of years, and that he is quite capable of doing so in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the discussion this evening both on the resolution and on the amendment is the best indication we could have of the unanimous opinion of the House <Col N="1376" /> on this particular matter.  I do not think it is at all necessary for Deputies to stand up in this chamber and declare their loyalty to Christianity, and vehemently declare what should be done in the circumstances set out. That is not at all necessary.  We all understand each other to the extent that this is a Christian country and that any attempt in any part of the world to interfere with the principles of Christianity will inevitably and automatically find a reaction from the ordinary persons in this country that would be very strong, very firm and very determined.  That determination would carry their ordinary resentment a very long way.</P>
      <P>In discussing this matter the question is: What really can we do?  In this Parliament we can give expression to the view that we abhor the verdict, which we believe to be unjust, a verdict under which the Yugo-Slav Government have condemned Archbishop Stepinac to a very long period of imprisonment.  So far as I know, we have no representative in Yugo-Slavia. That probably places us at a disadvantage.  If we had a representative there, then our representations on this question would naturally have more direct and probably more effective results.  In the absence of that, I take it that our Government, or our Minister for External Affairs, has gone into the question involved under which the Archbishop was charged, tried by his country's courts and duly sentenced. Having fully examined as far as possible the charges and their justification, he feels entitled to come before this Assembly here and put forward an amendment to the resolution condemning the action of the Yugo-Slav Government.  I am sure the Minister for External Affairs has taken all the necessary steps to investigate the justice or injustice of that trial before he put forward his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that to continue the debate here along lines the discussion has followed this evening will not serve any useful purpose.  Outside of this country our voice will be a very tiny voice indeed.  Even then it will be subject to a great deal of censorship and every country will represent our decision <Col N="1377" /> largely according to their own particular viewpoint.  However unanimous we may be, either on the resolution or on the amendment, our voice will be very small.  If we give the opportunity to countries outside of representing our decision as a result of a division then the volume, the strength and the value of our protest is very seriously minimised.</P>
    <P>We all protest here our love of Christianity.  Our Christianity above all teaches humility.  Our object to-night is to defend Christianity with all the strength that we can.  Is it not possible for some of us to show our humility?  It is true that Deputy Dillon put forward this resolution.  It is true that he undoubtedly protested from the beginning against this outrage.  Finally, he tabled this resolution.  The Taoiseach put in his amendment.  If kudos are to be gained here to-night then, as far as precedence is concerned, Deputy Dillon's resolution was the first tabled in this House.  Is it because that resolution was the first that we are to have a division here this evening?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who is also Minister for External Affairs, speaks for the whole people of Eire and a resolution or an amendment proposed by him will carry more weight than a resolution or an amendment proposed by any other member.  I think that the best way in which we can make our protest known to the world is for the Taoiseach to speak for the whole House and to have his resolution unanimously adopted.  I am sure that the Taoiseach has examined all the merits and demerits of this matter.  As the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs indicated it took the Taoiseach a longer time to examine into this matter and to make up his mind than it took Deputy Dillon.  I hope the Taoiseach will make as careful an examination in similar cases in the future rather than deal with members of his own Party in a hostile way without giving their case the long and serious consideration which he has given to this.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the amendment proposed by the Taoiseach because I believe that it will carry more weight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very fully <Col N="1378" /> the difficulties which the Minister for External Affairs has in the particular matter now before the House.  In the first instance, we have to realise that we are not ourselves members of the United Nations Organisation.  We have also to realise that whatever we may do now, and the way in which we do it, may have certain effects internationally upon our efforts to gain membership of the United Nations Organisation. Whether or not the Minister for External Affairs had that particular situation before his mind I want to say at the outset that the attitude we should adopt here should not be in any way supine.  It should not be in any way calculated to pander to the anti-Christian forces now dominating the greater part of Europe.</P>
      <P>I think it is immaterial whether we use the phraseology of Deputy Dillon or the phraseology adopted by the Taoiseach.  We represent in this Parliament a country which has known centuries of political and religious persecution and it is only right and fitting that we&mdash;the representatives of the Irish people, elected under a Constitution which pays tribute to Catholic principles and, in particular, to the application of Catholic principles in international relations&mdash;should voice in the most vigorous manner possible our strong abhorrence of the state of affairs which exists in Yugo-Slavia and which, incidentally, exists in all the territory of Eastern Europe to-day.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last speaker's argument in favour of the amendment, I want to say quite frankly that I disagree with him entirely.  The Taoiseach's amendment is calculated to limit the sphere of our activity to diplomatic activity with the countries where we have diplomatic representatives. At the moment, out of all the nations of the world, we have diplomatic relations only with some ten countries.  The Taoiseach visualises, however, steps that may be proper to secure for them the adherence of freedom-loving peoples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say the proper steps are the steps indicated by Deputy Dillon, because, by reason of the fact that our representation abroad is so limited, it is essential that we take the added <Col N="1379" /> action visualised by Deputy Dillon of directly approaching the Parliaments of the nations of Europe affected by this scourge of persecution.  To my mind the amendment and the motion are not in any sense mutually exclusive; they are complementary.  I put it to the Taoiseach that no question of phraseology, no question of finding an appropriate formula, should prevent this House from voicing its feelings in this matter in the most vigorous form we can adopt.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties which at present confront any Minister for External Affairs situated as our Minister is.  We are seeking membership of an organisation which does pay in its charter a certain amount of lip sympathy to religion.  Amongst the purposes and principles which are written into the charter we find that purpose No. 3 is to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.  Coupled with that you have the four freedoms advocated by the late President Roosevelt and subscribed to by Winston Churchill on a famous occasion.  One of these four freedoms was the freedom of every man to worship his God in his own way, according to his own conscience.</P>
    <P>If we are to seek admission to the United Nations Organisation, our main function as a Catholic nation is to raise our voice in the Assembly to bring Catholic principles to bear upon the councils of the nations in the hope that the word &ldquo;God&rdquo; will be written into the charter of the United Nations of the world.  The word &ldquo;God&rdquo; does not appear in the charter of the United Nations of the world because, at San Francisco, the nations of the world had to kow-tow to Joseph Stalin, Molotov and the others.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a country which at all times, even in the darkest age, took a militant place in the fight for <Col N="1380" /> Christian principles.  There is a darker cloud over Europe to-day than ever fell on Europe before.  When Attila the Hun stormed the gates of Rome, Christian missionaries from this country went to the darkest parts of Europe to spread Christianity.  The lights of Christianity are gone out in Europe to-day and it is up to us, as the representatives of a Catholic nation, to take all steps in our power, as a small people, to raise our voice and to take the necessary action that will enable the lamps of religion to be relit in Soviet-dominated Europe.</P>
    <P>I regret that anything in the nature of personalities, anything in the nature of disagreements, anything in the nature of discord, should have been introduced into this debate.  I think we are all agreed on this matter; we all abhor the terrible persecution that is taking place and I appeal to the Taoiseach not to divide the House on his amendment.  I appeal to him to reconcile with Deputy Dillon whatever little difference in formula or phraseology may exist in the motion and the amendment and let it not appear to the peoples of the world that we have some difference here in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of establishing fundamental freedoms; it is not a question of bringing something new into the lives of the peoples of Europe. It is a question of restoring fundamental freedoms; it is a question of restoring, if you like, the Ten Commandments in Europe.  Down through the ages we have stood for Christian principles, for the right of the moral law to prevail over the municipal or domestic law.  International law has broken down.  The Holy Roman Empire was set aside by the personal greed of the Princes of Europe and, in turn, the authority of Christendom, as represented in the Vatican, was set aside by the same Princes.  Later, we had the Reformation and, following on the Reformation, nations could go their own way independently of any central moral authority.  Coming to later years, we had the French revolutionary principles of liberty, equality and fraternity, and following on that we got the deplorable development of <Col N="1381" /> Bolshevism from the libertarian principles preached through the centuries. We find ourselves in this sorry plight to-day because the peoples of Europe, abandoning the unity of Christendom, abandoning the central moral authority by, in the Middle Ages, going their own way, rely on expediency and force to solve their problems, domestic and international.</P>
    <P>We are, as the last Deputy said, but a poor, small nation, but we are a nation which, through the centuries, has survived political and religious persecution. We are, incidentally, a nation which, in spite of that persecution, sent its missionaries to all the countries of the world.  Missionaries are there to-day as they were there centuries ago.  It is not a mere question of a small people trying to raise its voice in a world wilderness.  It is a question of a small country, a mother country, appealing to its children in Australia, in South Africa, in New Zealand, in the United States of America and in Canada to use every means at their disposal, governmental and otherwise, to raise their voices through their various Governments and Parliaments, to bring pressure to bear so that this terrible tyranny will be brought to an end as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are other considerations that I do not want to go into.  It is not entirely the fault, if you like, of Joseph Stalin, that Yugo-Slavia finds itself in the sorry plight in which it is to-day. There are other circumstances that existed not so many years ago. Perhaps for reasons of diplomacy, perhaps under pressure from the Soviet, these circumstances have been altered now, but whatever the cause may be, these circumstances that now exist are so deplorable that we at least can raise our voice and ask our people throughout the world to raise their voices to bring this thing to an end.  I ask the Taoiseach, apart altogether from diplomatic channels, apart altogether from diplomatic relations with these countries, to appeal to our people, wherever they may be, to use their voices with their Governments and Parliaments to bring pressure to bear upon the United Nations to end this persecutior</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> I do not at all agree that the limited measure of activity envisaged by the Taoiseach's amendment will bring the desired results.  I think it is essential that every possible avenue be explored in this matter and I am going to ask him to try to reconcile the motion and the amendment and not to put the House to a division and in doing so place us in a false position before the world.  There is no question of politics in this matter, as far as I can see. There is no question of Party advantage and I, for one, condemn any suggestion of Party advantage by any side of the House.  I want to see this approached with national unanimity.</P>
    <P>There are many matters I would like to raise, but I refrain from doing so. There will be another occasion for it, but as I see the position now it is a mere matter of reconciling phraseology and the formula of the two motions before us; and I am sure Deputy Dillon would be the first to amend his motion in any way to meet the suggestion I have put forward.</P>

      <P>I think we can all agree that this is a matter on which there should be unanimity. Any appearance of division in this House would misrepresent the position of the country everywhere.  It appears to me, therefore, that the problem to which we should address ourselves at this moment is as to why we cannot have that unanimity.  I can see no reason why we should not have it, except one.  If we do not have it to-night, it will be because those who do not enjoy the confidence of the country, those who have not the support of the majority in this House, are proposing to divide the House and to create that appearance of disunity in regard to these vital questions.

      <P>May I be permitted to continue?  I am in possession.  The Deputy has spoken and I listened to <Col N="1383" /> him.  I think he ought to address himself to what appears to me to be the really critical issue dividing the House. Here there is no division of opinion whatever as to the events which are happening now in certain parts of Europe, events which are dealt with in a much more effective way, a much more far-reaching way, in the amendment than in the resolution.  I think we can say that emphatically and we can say it in the fullest conviction that it is the unquestionable truth.  We are not divided here and the country is not divided in relation to these matters, but by their action certain fractional Parties in this House are going&mdash;if I understand aright what they have been saying&mdash;to divide the House and to create the impression abroad that the country which this Parliament represents is equally divided in regard to these matters.  Why is that appearance of disunity going to be created?  Because of certain differences in phraseology&mdash;so Deputy Coogan has told us&mdash; because of a point of chronology, because the motion was down before the amendment, and because, apparently, of punctilio of procedure.</P>
      <P>Now I would like to examine the latter reason first.  Apparently, the amendment which has been put down by the Taoiseach and Minister for External Affairs is not acceptable to the Opposition because, forsooth, the Taoiseach did not consult Deputy Dillon.  When Deputy Cosgrave was making that point, I asked the Deputy, with no offensive intention, &ldquo;Who is Deputy Dillon?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the views of the majority are made known in relation to matters which, we are told, are merely issues of phraseology&mdash;only points of time and methods of procedure, then the opinion of the majority <Col N="1386" /> ought to prevail.  But how does Deputy Cogan and his Party interpret democratic rule in relation to this motion? Because&mdash;let me repeat&mdash;the Taoiseach did not consult Deputy Dillon in relation to the drafting of the amendment, which, it is now clear, commands the support of the majority in this House&mdash; there is no question of doubt as to which of these two proposals has the support of the representatives of the majority of the Irish people&mdash;Deputy Cogan proposes, so far as his vote and the votes of those associated with him can encompass it, to ram, cram and jam Deputy Dillon's words down the throats of the majority of Deputies here.  And this is being done by Deputy Cogan in the name of democratic principle. Deputies who constitute the majority of this Assembly, who carry responsibility for the government of this country and for the conduct of its external affairs, by mere weight of numbers alone and by reason of the support which their views command in the country&mdash;they are entitled, in a matter in which there may be doubt as to what is the best course to pursue, to have their opinions accepted by the minority.</P>
      <P>Deputies who sit on these benches, having read Deputy Dillon's motion, might, in my view, have very serious doubts to to whether a motion couched in its terms would not do more harm than good.  They might feel that the florid and unrestrained phraseology in which the motion is expressed travesties its purpose&mdash;if that purpose is to make an effective protest.  They know now, from the statement of the Taoiseach, that the course of action which it proposes would be futile and ineffective.  I have no doubt that Deputy Dillon feels, like all of us, real and deep concern at the events which are taking place in Yugo-Slavia and at the sufferings and indignities which are being heaped upon the Primate of Croatia.  But we may also feel that under the stress of emotion and in the labour of expressing that concern in a Parliamentary way, Deputy Dillon lost sight of his original purpose.  The motion no longer concerns itself with the fate of the Archbishop but with other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> So far as I am concerned&mdash;and no person knowing my public record can have any doubt as to where I stand in regard to certain issues&mdash;the motion by Deputy Dillon reminds me too much of the beating of the big drum to be acceptable.  I have never been able to associate the noise of that instrument with the principles of civil or religious liberty.  Therefore, if there were no difference between the motion and the amendment other than the terms in which that motion is couched, I should prefer&mdash;and I am sure all the other Deputies in the House who have any concern for the dignity of the House or of the country would prefer&mdash;the amendment to the motion.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to consider one phrase in it.  Deputy Dillon refers to the procedure to which the Archbishop was subjected and he asks the Dáil to record their &ldquo;detestation of the travesty of the judicial process&rdquo;. There is a smack of the hustings about that phraseology&mdash;a touch of the soap-box about it.</P>

I do not think that the Parliament of this country should descend to the level of the cross-road orator, even though Deputy Dillon or Deputy Morrissey may think so.</P>

      <P>On the one hand, we have in the motion the phrase that the House is asked publicly to record &ldquo;detestation of the travesty of judicial process.&rdquo;  On the other hand you have in the amendment the statement that the House &ldquo;is gravely concerned at the unjust trial.&rdquo;  Now weigh these two expressions whichever way you like and ask yourselves which of them appeals the more to you?  Which of them do you think is more dignified?  Which of them do you think is the more emphatic in its restraint?  Which of them would carry the greater conviction abroad?  Which of them would better carry conviction abroad, if we are earnest in this matter and not merely indulging in a public exhibition of craw-thumping?  Opposition Deputies may prefer Deputy Dillon's florid manner of expressing himself. Other Deputies may prefer the restraint with which the Taoiseach in this amendment, as habitually, expresses himself.  It is a matter of opinion, a matter of taste.  It is no more than a matter of opinion or a matter of taste, and yet upon this matter of opinion, in relation to a question of literary style, the House is going to be divided this evening by the members apparently of the Fine Gael Party, by Deputy Dillon, by Deputy Cogan and, I am sorry to say, by Deputy Everett.  What impression is going to be created abroad by that division?  It is going to be made to appear by the deliberate action of certain Deputies in this House, a division exists in the country.  And for what?  For a question of mere literary style.  So we have in this way, that because Deputy Dillon was not consulted by the Head of the Government, by the Minister for External Affairs, as to the exact phraseology of an amendment or a motion which would command the acceptance of this House, and because <Col N="1389" /> some people prefer Deputy Dillon's literary style to the Taoiseach's literary style, we are to have that division in this House, which every member who has got up here to declare he is going to vote for the motion, professed to deplore.</P>

      <P>I understand what is due to Deputy Dillon.  I would rather there was no further discussion.  I am an old Parliamentary hand and I know that these interruptions are meant to fritter away time.  I am coming to a point to which the Taoiseach has already directed the attention of the House.  The usual channel for communication between Governments is through the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister who is responsible for the conduct of foreign relations between <Col N="1390" /> this State and other States. This motion of Deputy Dillon's is in effect a vote of censure, a cleverly conceived vote of censure, because it proposes to go over the head of the Minister for External Affairs, to depart from the accepted channels of diplomatic communication in order to pass on to nebulous bodies of whose existence we have no proof, for the Inter-Parliamentary Union might be said, in fact, to be moribund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is doubtful if we could say at this moment what Parliaments are associated in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, but, Sir, that is the clever tactic that is behind this motion.  It is not only a question of punctilio as to whether Deputy Dillon was consulted or not, it is not only a question of phraseology that divides us, but it is an attempt by a side-wind by a subterfuge, by a trick, to get this House to pass a vote of censure upon the Government and in particular upon the Minister for External Affairs. For Parliaments only go over the heads of their Governments, only disregard and turn away from the accepted channels of diplomatic communication, when they have reason to believe that their Government is no longer willing to give effect to the policy of Parliament or when they may have some reason to fear that the Minister for External Affairs is either functioning in opposition to the will of Parliament or is functioning incompetently. This motion, in whatever form it may be disguised, is not a motion really concerned so much with the fate of the Archbishop but is a motion designed to bring odium upon the Government, to make capital out of a serious situation and for that reason this House must be divided by the deliberate act of the Opposition, if the views of the majority are going <Col N="1391" /> to be challenged in this House, in relation to four things: These are first of all, the conduct of the Minister for External Affairs in relation to the responsibilities of his office, then a point of chronology as to whether the motion which appeared first should get precedence over the motion of the Government, next a point of punctilio as to whether the head of the Government and the Minister for External Affairs should have consulted Deputy Dillon as to the form in which the motion was to be adopted by the majority of the House, and, last of all, a difference of judgment as to whether the literary style of Deputy Dillon or the restrained and dignified protest of the Taoiseach better appeals to the sensibilities of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall content myself by saying that I consider the speech which has just been made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to be both wicked and vicious.  I trust the House will not suffer itself to forget that the Taoiseach's amendment consists of two parts.  The first part is designed to expunge from the Order Paper the motion I have submitted to the House, and the second, to substitute the admirable words which the Taoiseach has incorporated in his amendment.  There is no one in this House that I have heard who has asked the House to reject the Taoiseach's amendment.  In opening, I was most scrupulous to emphasise that, in my view, these two motions were complementary and that the House would in no sense stultify itself if it adopted both.</P>
      <P>I put my motion down because the Minister for External Affairs, answering questions put by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Coogan and myself a month ago, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not know what the Deputy thinks I can get, or formal steps I can take, to get information on that matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a long answer, reported at columns 3 and 4 of the Official Reports, the Taoiseach expressed his dismay and distress at the situation obtaining in Yugo-Slavia generally and pointed <Col N="1392" /> out, or seemed to indicate to those of us who listened, that we had no diplomatic relations with Yugo-Slavia and asked what diplomatic action he could take.  I felt there was a certain force in that.  If a Minister for External Affairs enters into diplomatic relations with the diplomats of all the world, and if he himself is to be treated in accordance with the rules of the profession, he must submit himself to be bound by them, and, recognising that there are certain principles of diplomacy within which a Foreign Minister can act and outside of which he would invite rebuff and isolation, I put down the motion asking the Ceann Comhairle, speaking on behalf of Parliament, to speak to our fellow Parliaments as we have repeatedly done. Deputy Kissane, I believe, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle accompanied me to Paris to a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and at that body we spoke not as Government Deputies or as Opposition Deputies but as democrats who believed in Parliaments and thought it good to meet from time to time and renew confidence in the way of life for which we stood.  Was there anything queer in that course of conduct?</P>
    <P>I, accepting the Minister's assurance that he could make no <i>démarche</i> in existing circumstances, knew that Parliament could and could make it as a Parliament, and so offered them that opportunity.  I am not making allegations against the Taoiseach that he is in a dark conspiracy with Communism, or that he is reluctant to declare his views on liberty.  Whence has all this heat been engendered? There is not a line in what I said in introducing this motion which, by the most reckless fool, could be interpreted as a reflection upon the Taoiseach.  All I cavilled at was that it was odd that he should wait until midnight on last Tuesday before setting down this amendment, but I said that doubtless when he came to speak he would tell us why.</P>

      <P>In any case, here is a matter of discretion joined between us, and, when there is a division to-night, there is no need to look upon it in such a tragic light as the Minister for Local Government would have us look on it. If there is a division, it is merely a competition between two sides of this House to find the most effective way to serve our common end.  I am not concerned for a moment to criticise the style of, or the language employed in, the Taoiseach's amendment&mdash;far from it.  If it is put to this House as a resolution, I shall vote for it, but I shall also vote for my own motion, and I want to tell the House briefly why. I did not ask this House to send our resolution to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  I asked this House to instruct the Ceann Comhairle to send it to the presiding officer of every free Parliament in the world, which was associated with us in that Union.</P>

      <P>I am going to deal with that.  The Taoiseach dwelt on his anxiety on that score.  He said he did not care to think of our resolution being marked &ldquo;read&rdquo; or thrown into the basket.  I should not mind very much if some of them did, provided some of them did not, and am I an incurable optimist if I believe there are still free and independent Parliaments in this world who are prepared to accept the proposition that, gravely as it offends the ear of the Minister for Local Government, the proceedings I describe of riotous mobs roaring for a prisoner's blood are properly described as a travesty of the judicial process? It may not be the language of a pseudopoet, but it is the language of a full heart.  I think not only of archbishops undergoing trials of that kind.  I think of others having to face trials of that kind.  I think of little men hearing the <Col N="1394" /> mob howling for their blood with the knowledge that sooner or later they will be given up to that mob and that no one will ever hear their names again.  There have been many such throughout Croatia.</P>
      <P>I am not going to hang my head in shame because, when thinking of those things, my literary style has failed to please the ear of the fastidious little Minister for Local Government.  As we saw him mincing in his place making his vicious, wicked little speech, how hard it was to believe that a man of his mature years should so disgrace himself when a man like Dr. Stepinac was rotting in a Bolshevik jail.  No, I am not as much dismayed by the prospect of indignity as is the Taoiseach.  He was also troubled lest to adopt my resolution would mean being a voice crying in the wilderness. Does that dismay him, too?  If his is the only voice left to describe those proceedings as a travesty of the judicial process, if his is the only voice left to repeat again and again that this is a conspiracy to defame Christianity in general and the Catholic Church in particular, if his is the only voice left to say that this is a Communist conspiracy to destroy individual liberty everywhere, will his heart fail him because his is a voice crying in the wilderness?  I do not think so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  But when the Taoiseach speaks of the utterance of such sentiments being merely a voice crying in the wilderness I do not think he objects to a repetition of these things.  Remember what Marshal Tito is hoping for:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They will shout to their hearts' content, and then the storm will abate because they will weary of it but we shall not weary.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there not some purpose to be served by going on repeating before the world that we know that these men who are called traitors are not traitors; that we know that these men who are arraigned for high crimes and misdemeanours are so arraigned simply because they love the Faith?  Is it <Col N="1395" /> not necessary to say those things in the maelstrom that is around Europe? I do not doubt the Taoiseach's readiness to say them if he believed they served a useful purpose.  I remember, as the Taoiseach remembers, incidents in our history, some that we saw ourselves, some that we heard from our fathers and those who went before us, not at all unlike the situation with which the people of Croatia stand confronted in our time.  When I heard the Taoiseach commend the calm language of his amendment prepared with a violence of mind, I seemed to remember the time when the Taoiseach might have been proud to be stirred to violence and to anger in the presence of injustice and cruelty and wrong.</P>
    <P>When I heard him go on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Then there arises the question of interfering in the domestic affairs of a foreign State&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>did his mind turn back to the last time he heard that excuse vouchsafed for silence?  Does he remember when he urged public men in the United States of America to approach President Harding for a sympathetic reference to Ireland and when, from California, the President sent him an answer, when he did not even deign to address him, but told a Press conference that people might as well get it into their heads that he had no intention of interfering in the domestic affairs of another State?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Taoiseach to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Then there is the difficulty of this question of interfering in the domestic affairs of a sovereign State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because other States, unfortunately, try to keep rigidly to that rule.  I thought I made that clear.  As it is a matter of importance, perhaps I might intervene for a moment.  I said that the difficulty in getting other States to bring the <Col N="1396" /> necessary influence to bear was that they held to that principle.  I may not have put it clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that I have vouchsafed the Taoiseach an opportunity of clearing up what seemed to me to be an observation open to the widest misunderstanding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of it, if I was misunderstood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I stand for the principle that you should not interfere in the domestic affairs of other States.  I believe that Russia ought to be allowed to run her country in her own way and that Spain, Italy, France, England and Ireland ought to be allowed to do it&mdash;with one qualification, that persecution of faith is the domestic affair of no nation.  It touches every Christian in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find that he will probably have to widen that a bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is wide enough for me for the present.  I welcome the declaration of the Taoiseach that he shares that view.  I want no evasion; I want no misunderstanding.  I still think the House would be glad to accede to a request from the Taoiseach for permission to put his amendment forward as a substantive and additional motion.  If that course is adopted, I shall most happily stand in my place to support his motion as well as mine. But even the humblest Deputy is entitled to put his view upon the Order Paper of this House and ask his fellow Deputies to agree with him or to dissent.  That seems to me no presumption; that seems to me no justification for that silly, wicked speech.  I stand on every word and every line of that motion.  I do not want to alter a word, a syllable or a comma.  I do not think it says a word too much about the things we ought to be thinking about.  I think it is vital to make it clear that our solicitude in this country is stirred not only for a Catholic archbishop but it is stirred for justice, for Christianity, for freedom, and that we merely fastened upon this latest crime of the <Col N="1397" /> international Communist conspiracy against these things for the purpose of directing the world, for the first time as a united Parliament, to the nature of the conspiracy, with a guarantee that again and again and again we will return to it, that every facet of their plan to defame the Catholic Church, to destroy Christianity, will be exposed by us and kept in the light of day, that they will be notified here and now that we shall not weary and that, so certain are we of the ultimate inevitable success of the things we stand for, that we are confident that all that is necessary to win this day is to draw into open light the things they do and the things that they believe in, in the certainty that when the light of Heaven plays upon them for all eyes to see, the errors they maintain and the crimes by which they sustain themselves will wither in the light of truth.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Taoiseach imagined I have in mind as a crusade against this horror.  I know our weakness in arms; I know our weakness in resources but, I dare to say, I know our strength as well.  I invoke against this loathsome horror no more formidable weapon than the light of day.  I believe that, given that light, if the people are let see the true nature of the vile conspiracy of materialist totalitarianism in the world, it will die. Just as a blackmailer collapses under the light of day, so with the Bolshevik tyrant.  I like to think that we have none of their type in this country.  I will surrender, however, to no specious confidence in that regard but, whether we deal with them in our own midst or whether it is necessary to deal with them in the vast orbit of the world, there is one weapon they cannot withstand and it is one which we are in a position to wield as mightily as any other nation in the world, and that is the light of truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bring that light to bear upon the presiding officer of every free Parliament in the world so that, reflected therefrom, free peoples may come to realise the dangers that threaten all men who value liberty and, in that way, to do our part in mobilising, against what can be a great horror in our own time, the latent <Col N="1398" /> force that is in humanity and simply awaits to be called to action in defence of liberty and decency and the things for which Christians stand.</P>

The terms of my resolution were couched in terms chosen with a considerable amount of care, and if I am going to continue to carry out the view of this House generally and to act as its Minister for External Affairs, I think that in a matter of that kind it is the words which I have carefully considered from the point of view of their effect, that ought to carry.

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, gravely concerned at the unjust trial and imprisonment of Archbishop Stepinac, and at the accumulating evidence of the existence of a campaign of religious persecution in certain parts of Europe, and convinced that recognition of the sovereignty of God and the moral law is the fundamental basis of any just and stable world order, and that freedom to worship God truly, in the manner that He Himself has ordained, is the inalienable right of man, respect for which is essential to the preservation of peace among the nations, calls upon all peoples who desire true liberty <Col N="1402" /> and lasting peace to use their combined influence to bring religious persecution everywhere to an end and to secure acceptance of liberty of conscience as one of the basic principles of a genuine world organisation, and urges the Minister for External Affairs to take steps to bring these views of Dáil Éireann to the attention of the States with which we have diplomatic relations and to take such other steps as may be proper to secure for them the adherence of freedom-loving peoples.&rdquo;</P>
