      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will consider the harnessing of Furness Lake, near Newport, County Mayo, for electricity output; if he will state whether a survey of the lake and district has been made, and what is the height of the lake above sea level and the height of water-fall just below the lake.</P>

      <P>The investigation of the possibilities of the hydro-electrification of rivers and lakes is a duty of the Electricity Supply Board, and a survey of the water power resources of the country has been in progress by that body for some years.</P>
      <P>I am informed that a detailed survey of Furness Lake and district has not been made.  From certain information which is available, however, it appears that there is a head of approximately 32 feet between Lough Feeagh and Lough Furness, County Mayo.  The maximum output from a development on this site would give 1,400,000 units per annum in an average flow year assuming all water available could be utilised.  It would be very expensive to secure the full storage to give this output, and the development of the site cannot be included in the board's programme at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person claims and is eligible for an old age pension the rate of pension is determined by reference to the person's means.  If he or she is one of a married couple living together in the same house the means are by law taken to be half the total means of the couple. In this case a pension of 2/- was determined on appeal as the appropriate rate, the claimant's means being reckoned at one half the means of her husband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that this woman's husband is a casual labourer and that she is bed-ridden.  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if that is the report received from the investigation officer regarding the means test.  The husband is casually employed as a fisherman and work has not been profitable during the past few months.  I think there should be a little further investigation into this case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the fact that the recent flour extraction order will operate to reduce the quantity of offals for animal feeding, he will now take effective steps to arrange that sufficient supplies of bran and pollard will be available at a reasonable price for live stock and poultry producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is no present prospect of importing wheaten offals, the only supplies of bran and pollard that will be available for feeding to live stock and poultry are those produced in the country.  No increase is contemplated in the prices at present being charged.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that certain big firms are getting a big <Col N="1088" /> percentage of the pollard and bran and mixing some other materials with it and calling it pig meal?  I am sure the Minister knows that in order to encourage pig breeding supplies of bran and pollard are required.  For young pigs there is no alternative ration to bran and pollard.  I expect the Minister knows that last year about 75 per cent. of the young turkeys in County Wexford died for want of a proper mixture with which to feed them.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission have recently had an inspection made of the holdings at Fenit Island on the estate of J.C.D. Hurly, Record No. S. 2685, to which it is presumed the question refers.  They are satisfied that any flooding which might occur thereon would be of a temporary nature only and that the area affected would not be extensive.  In the circumstances, the Land Commission are of opinion that the expenditure involved in the construction of additional protective works on the Island would not at present be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state why permission to sell the holding of Mary Molloy, of Gneeve, County Mayo, Collection Number 3986, was refused; why the holding was not vested in above tenant since 1919; and also the nature of the report, if any, of the Land Commission officer in Castlebar on the question for or against resumption of the holding.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 22, to insert after the word &ldquo;place&rdquo; the words &ldquo;which may be the person's home&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section would then read: &ldquo;... such medical officer may order in writing the detention and isolation of such person in a specified hospital or other place, which may be the person's home, until such medical officer gives a certificate...&rdquo; The diseases that it is proposed to deal with under Section 29 include, among other things, such diseases as scarlet fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, certain aspects of venereal disease, syphilis, and it is quite clear that there are very many cases which, with no prejudice to the public health and with much greater chance of rest and proper isolation and treatment, might be dealt with in the person's home where the nature of the isolation would be satisfactory to the medical practitioner and to the responsible chief medical officer of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The machinery for the control of infectious diseases embraces provision for isolation in the home. <Col N="1092" /> Anybody with practical experience of these problems will at once agree that under certain circumstances and conditions, that would satisfy the responsible medical officer of health, it is possible to have persons treated for quite a number of infectious diseases by adequate and proper isolation in the home.  Isolation in the home under such circumstances as I am trying to envisage would be provided for by regulations under Section 20.  It may be desirable, and I rather think it would, in addition to the other matters that are provided for in the Second Schedule&mdash;matters for which provision may be made in regulations for the prevention of the spread of infectious disease&mdash;to incorporate, as a matter in respect of which specific regulations could be made, isolation in the home.  It is not absolutely necessary; it could be done under the regulations and in fact is done at the present time under instructions&mdash; verbal instructions, in fact&mdash;and professional understanding between the responsible medical officer of health and the medical attendant on the patient, but it would draw specific and particular attention to the possibility of such isolation if we provide for it in the manner suggested in the Schedule.  Detention is a somewhat different matter.  It does not seem possible to provide for the detention of a person in the home.  Section 29 is intended, as Deputies will see, to deal with the position where the responsible chief medical officer of the area deems it necessary to detain and isolate.  It envisages the set of circumstances within which it would not be possible to deal with the situation in the patient's home, but I think the object that Deputy Mulcahy has in mind can be properly achieved in the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to urge the Parliamentary Secretary to go as far as he possibly can to meet the intention behind this amendment and I do so from the point of view of getting the co-operation of the people in dealing with infectious diseases, particularly regarding children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> It is one problem here in the city; it is a different problem in the rural areas, because in many cases where a child gets diphtheria or measles or any of the other diseases that may entail isolation and detention and has to be sent to a hospital or institution ten, 20, 30 or 40 miles away from its home, the mother is, perhaps naturally, reluctant to let the child go.  I am afraid that the consequence is that there is a temptation to cloak the disease so that the child will not be sent away.  Having regard to the ordinary safeguards that must be taken and as far as it can be done without injury to public health and without danger of infection to other people, we ought as far as possible to have the isolation and the detention in the patient's home.  I urge this because I believe that if the local medical officers make it a practice, as I think they are inclined to do &mdash;perhaps because of the circumstances of the home they are compelled to do it &mdash;of sending these children to institutions 20 or 30 or, perhaps, 40 miles away you will only increase the temptation to cloak the disease rather than to have them sent away.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge that on the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have some experience of this.  I know that in one part of my county the institution which deals with diseases such as those is situated anything from ten to 30 miles from the homes of a lot of the patients and we have rather painful evidence of the fact that the mothers of children are very reluctant&mdash;some of them make no secret of the fact&mdash;to allow their children to be sent there, particularly if they are very young.  I appreciate, of course, that in many cases, having regard to the size of the house and, perhaps, to the size of the family, it is not possible to have a child suffering from any infectious disease isolated from the other members of the family. But where the medical officer is satisfied that it can be done without danger to others, I think it ought to be done. We ought to stress that as far as we can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we will meet that in the manner I have suggested by making specific provision for isolation <Col N="1094" /> in the home by the making of regulations providing for isolation in the home, but, at the same time, to give the chief medical officer discretion in the matter.  It is always well to bear in mind that Section 29 will only operate where the chief medical officer is satisfied that he cannot otherwise secure proper isolation of the patient for the safety of the community.</P>

      <P>I do not want to cast any reflection on county medical officers of health; quite the contrary. Perhaps my views may be somewhat coloured by some unfortunate experiences of my own.  I am not urging this point with that in mind.  I am urging it solely from the point of view of getting the fullest co-operation from the parents of the children.  I am not so much concerned in this matter with adults, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree from his own knowledge of the country and of country towns that where children have to be sent some distance away from their homes which will make it difficult if not impossible for mothers to visit them, there will be an inclination to cloak the disease.</P>

      <P>The amending of the Schedule is advisable.  Even when we come to discuss amendment No. 82 in the name of Deputy Hughes I think that is also advisable.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to give the chief medical officer the outlook suggested in this amendment.  In dealing with difficult people there might be cases where the thing that would dictate itself is that the person should be kept at home.  The chief medical officer, as a preliminary at any rate, in order to help to remove some small attitude of rebellion on the part of the person concerned might order the isolation of the person in his home, even though there might be unwillingness on the part of the person so ordered at that particular time to react to all the restrictions put on him. Nevertheless, a day or two might allow that spirit of rebellion to pass and the chief medical officer might find the case satisfactorily dealt with by suitable isolation in the home.  If the chief medical officer finds that there is such a rebellious spirit that the only solution for him is to order the removal of the person from his home and isolation in an institution, he might find himself up against difficulties that he ought not to be pressed up against.  I feel that the wording of the section as it stands might press him up against difficulties that a day or two might remove if he were in a position to order detention and isolation in the person's home.  The question arises as to whether the words &ldquo;other place&rdquo; as they stand would not include a patient's home.</P>

      <P>I think it would be better to make it clear so that there would be no lingering doubt in any person's mind that the chief medical officer could step in and take an authoritative attitude and issue an order in relation to a person who has been isolated.  I would press on the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment in order to make the sub-section read that a person could be detained under these compulsory powers in his home.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Mulcahy himself has just mentioned, in fact the words &ldquo;other place&rdquo; are not limited and could include a patient's home if the medical officer decided that the person could be properly isolated and detained in his home.  It was not the intention to detain people in their homes, because it did not appear to be feasible.  Even following what Deputy Mulcahy has said, it is not clear how a person could be detained in his home, because detention is holding a person who is unwilling to accept isolation.  Isolation in the home is a different matter because in that case you have the co-operation of the patient and of his family.  I think my suggested method of meeting the situation is the best, and if we are driven back to the possible contingency where, in some extraordinary or exceptional set of circumstances, the chief medical officer desires to detain a patient for a couple of days to see if he would become more co-operative, as Deputy Mulcahy suggests, it could be done, because &ldquo;other place&rdquo; would include the home.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No such order in writing referred to in the foregoing sub-section shall be made unless the person so infected has refused the request of a medical practitioner to enter a specified hospital for the purpose of isolation and treatment or has refused to be isolated and treated in his own home or other place considered suitable for such purpose by the medical practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the rather penal nature of the section, it is desirable to put in such a sub-section as this to make it perfectly clear that the powers to be used under this section will be used <Col N="1097" /> only in cases of absolute non-co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of this amendment would seem to involve acceptance of the implication that the county medical officer of health would not act in a fully responsible way.  The chief medical officer will not operate this section, unless he is satisfied that the isolation is necessary in the interests of public health.  Deputy Mulcahy asks us to put a specific statutory obligation upon the chief medical officer not to make a detention order unless the patient has refused all co-operation in any shape or form.  I do not think we should assume that the chief medical officer of a county or city would in fact detain anyone unless he were satisfied &mdash;under the statute, he must in fact be satisfied&mdash;that such detention was necessary.</P>
      <P>There is also the other point&mdash;perhaps not very important and perhaps of some importance&mdash;that no payment for maintenance can be claimed by the local authority from the patients who are detained under Section 29.  That point may be worthy of some consideration. It is not of corresponding importance to the maintenance payments which might fall to be collected in an ordinary general hospital because local authorities are not encouraged to press for maintenance fees in fever and isolation hospitals, for the sound reason that people are isolated in these institutions as much in the interests of the community as in their own interests. At the same time, people who can afford to pay are expected to pay and it is open to the local authority to recover the cost of maintenance and treatment.  There is that advantage, anyhow, whatever it is worth, in compulsory detention that no claim can be made for payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary, and I do not think it is a good thing at the outset to imply that we are not prepared to trust to the good judgment of our chief medical officers in a matter such as this.  They have serious and weighty statutory responsibilities placed upon them.  In my own experience, I am not aware of <Col N="1098" /> any such irresponsible conduct as this amendment would appear to foreshadow. I do not know whether Deputy Hughes, if he were here, would be impressed by the arguments against his amendment, but I do very seriously think it would not be an improvement of the measure to incorporate this amendment.</P>

      <P>With all respect to Deputy Allen, I am afraid he has not grasped the meaning of this amendment. If objection is taken to the wording at the end, regarding &ldquo;in his own home&rdquo;, in view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said in relation to an earlier amendment, if he accepts the principle we are trying to convey he could bring in a form of words of his own to cover that, without in any way taking from the powers of the medical officer.  I think we should make some differentiation between the person who is prepared to co-operate fully with the medical authorities and the person who says obstinately: &ldquo;I will not do anything at all&rdquo;.  You will <Col N="1101" /> have to use the law against him.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to bring in a form of words of his own to meet the point, I would be quite satisfied.</P>

      <P>On the general principle, my feeling is that there would be a fresh bright spot introduced into this rather sombre section if there were a sub-section there clearly stating that no order would be issued under this section except in the case of a person utterly unwilling to co-operate in every way.  The Parliamentary Secretary has complained about the misunderstandings and the misrepresentations that have arisen around and been made about this measure.  Even to help to do something to clear away some of this, from his own point of view, he ought to consider whether a sub-section like that should not go in. It seems wrong to think you are protecting the prestige and position of a county medical officer of health by leaving out a reference to the effect that no order would be issued except in the case of an unwilling person.  It would clear away some of the suspicions from the personality of the officer, if it is clearly shown in the statute that it is only in the case of a person unwilling, whose detention is necessary in the interest of public health, that the chief medical officer can act.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>There shall be established an appeal board consisting of three registered medical practitioners appointed by the Minister to consider appeals under this section.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to get some information on the question of a person who is detained and wishes to appeal against it.  I notice that the Minister has a later amendment, No. 129, which makes provision where a patient is detained for more than six months.  We had a discussion on this last night, but I am not altogether satisfied.  In the case of a person who has been detained as a probable source of infection and who appeals to the Minister, I take it the Minister would consult the district or the county medical officer of health who ordered the detention.  Presumably there is nobody else he could consult, unless he appointed an independent medical person to examine the patient.  A patient should have a right of independent appeal, particularly in the event of a dispute.  While amendment No. 129, if accepted, would give the patient liberty to appeal at the end of six months, where a person is detained in an institution or even in his own home it is very desirable that he should have a right of appeal.  Where his personal liberty is concerned, in the event of a dispute he should have power to have the opinion on the question of infection of an independent medical adviser.  I would like to hear what the proposed machinery is under this section.</P>

      <P>I would like to support <Col N="1103" /> the proposal to provide a right of appeal, as is suggested by Deputy Blowick's amendment No. 84.  On an earlier stage of the Bill I was keen on having a wider appeal board, to deal with not only matters arising under this particular section but any issue arising under any of the Public Health Acts.  However, as the poor man said: &ldquo;Something is better than nothing.&rdquo; It would be very desirable to have an appeal in this case.  There is in the section an appeal to the Minister, but I am not satisfied it would provide adequate security to the patient.  One of the things which we dread most at the present time is the growing power of heads of Departments over all aspects of life.  There are now very few people really independent.  The independence of the citizen is being restricted and circumscribed to a greater extent every day.</P>
      <P>In this amendment it is sought to bring in three independent members of the medical profession to adjudicate upon a case which may be put up by the person who feels he is aggrieved by being interned or isolated.  There is a variety of ways in which a person might be aggrieved or unjustly treated. It might arise from the fact that the disease from which he was alleged to be suffering might not be in its infectious stage, or it might arise from the fact that there might be a wrong diagnosis of the disease.  It might also happen that the person being detained in an institution might be detained in one which he considers unsuitable.  He might desire to be isolated in some alternative institution.  There is also the point about isolation in an institution and isolation in a home. The patient might feel that public health interests, the safety of the public, would be met by isolation in his own home and he might have a case there to be argued, a case which could only be decided by an impartial board such as is envisaged here.  I think there is a reasonable case for the amendment and the Parliamentary Secretary ought to accept it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(k)  the patient (or the parent of the patient, where the patient is under 16 years of age) may at any time appeal to the Minister in writing to direct the release of the patient ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(m)  if at any time the Minister directs the release ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like some information on this. It may be covered somewhere else in the Bill, where I have not seen it but, so far as I can see, there is nothing in the section indicating that the Minister shall decide the appeal, much less that he shall decide it within any given time.  Nowhere in this section, or elsewhere so far as I can see in relation to the point we are discussing, is there set out the sort of machinery which the Minister will use or will set up to determine an appeal.</P>
      <P>I raise the matter at this point so that when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying to Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Coogan he may enlarge a little with regard to the form of appeal suggested in the Bill.  It seems to me to be very loose in the Bill.  There is nothing there to indicate that the Minister shall determine a case submitted to him, there is no indication that it should be done within any specified time, nor is there any indication of the sort of machinery which the Minister will use to resolve a case submitted to him.</P>

      <P>I do not think the appeal tribunal suggested by Deputy Cosgrave is necessary and I do not think it would be an easily workable type of machinery.  It might be possible, and I suppose it would be possible, to make such machinery operative, but it is cumbersome and it is entirely unprecedented. All down the years people have been detained in institutions, but the question of the need for a special appeal tribunal such as is envisaged here has never been raised.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that the Minister should set out in the statute detailed particulars as to how he is going to discharge his Ministerial functions.  I think that is an unreasonable request to make.  The Minister, under various Acts of Parliament, has certain statutory obligations.  He is responsible to the House for the proper discharge of these obligations and, through the Government and the House, he is responsible to the people.  It would be utterly impossible, and indeed improper, to set out in detail the manner in which the Minister should set about discharging his obligations. If he does not properly and adequately discharge his obligations, I have no doubt he will hear about it.</P>
      <P>The machinery suggested here provides, under paragraph (k), that the patient or the parent of the patient, where the patient is under 16 years of age, may at any time appeal in writing to the Minister.  That is clear enough.  Then, under paragraph (1), the person having control of such hospital or other place shall afford all reasonable facilities for the purposes of any appeal under paragraph (k). The person in control of the hospital, the person in charge, will be under a statutory obligation to facilitate the patient in every way in forwarding his appeal to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would happen in the ordinary course when such an appeal comes to the Minister?  The Minister would call for a report from the chief medical officer and, having got that report and submitted it to his professional advisers, he would arrange to send a medical inspector who would have special qualifications and special knowledge and experience of infectious <Col N="1106" /> diseases to examine the patient himself in consultation with the officers in charge there, and report.  The Minister would then have before him the report of the medical officer in charge, the report of the chief medical officer of the area and the report of his own medical inspector whom he had sent down to make a special investigation and report.  With all that evidence before him, he would decide whether the patient should be released.  I think that is almost fool-proof.  I think it guarantees to the patient beyond any reasonable doubt that he will not be detained for one day longer than is deemed necessary in the interests of the health of the community to detain him.</P>
    <P>On the question of limitation of the period within which the Minister should come to his findings, it would be very difficult to fix a minimum time and I hope I will satisfy the House as to the reason therefore.  It would be possible to fix a maximum time but, as I see the position developing, I think we may take it these cases will not frequently occur. When a case does occur, it may be assumed that there will be a pathological, bacteriological or biochemical examination, and tests will have to be carried out in order to establish to the Minister's satisfaction that the patient should be released or that the patient should be detained.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I do not think it would be possible to enable the Minister to come to a proper decision in one of these cases within the time limit prescribed by the amendment.  We will come to that later on.  I want to say again that the machinery envisaged is a satisfactory type of machinery, and I do not think it is necessary to set out in the statute in detail the manner in which the Minister is to set about doing this.</P>

      <P>The Minister is providing specific machinery to deal with one side of the problem.  He is not inclined at all to be as specific when dealing with the rights of the person who is detained and isolated. I do not question the <i>bona fides</i> of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The assumption of the Parliamentary Secretary if set down in legislation will have subsequently to be determined by the courts.  If the matter comes before the courts, it will not be determined on the Official Reports of what happened in Dáil Eireann or on what the Parliamentary Secretary said.  It will be determined by what is set down in the section.  That is what we are concerned about.  There is nothing in this section to say that the Minister shall, at any time, determine whether a person should or should not be released.  There is no obligation on the Minister to come to a determination at any time.  That omission should be met.  What the Parliamentary Secretary said makes the case made by Deputy Cosgrave stronger.  If it has demonstrated anything, it has demonstrated that the section as it stands, from the point of view of the right of effective appeal by a person who is detained, is ineffective, and that some safeguard should be inserted.  I do not agree that the proposal in the amendment is unwieldy, that it is unworkable or would cause any trouble.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" />&ldquo;the patient (or the parent of the patient, where the patient is under 16 years of age) may at any time appeal to the Minister in writing to direct the release of the patient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (n) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;if at any time the Minister directs the release of the patient he shall be released by the person having control of such hospital or other place in accordance with the direction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think there should be some statutory obligation to convey a decision say within 14 days, or some specified period, whether the decision is in the patient's favour or in favour of detention for a further period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the attention of the House to the corresponding provision in the Mental Treatment Act, Section 226 (1) where provision is made for periodical inspection and examination by an inspector of mental hospitals? It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the Inspector of mental hospitals makes a visit and inspection required by this Act of an approved institution he shall examine every person who is detained as a temporary patient therein and who has been received since he made his last visit and inspection required by this Act of the institution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A further provision is made that he shall report to the Minister.  Section 227 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Upon receipt of a report under sub-section (4) of Section 226 of this Act, the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, by Order direct the person in charge of the relevant institution either to discharge the person to whom the report relates or to take the appropriate steps to have him received into a mental institution as a person of unsound mind, and the person in charge of the institution shall comply with such direction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There when dealing with persons of unsound mind we did not put any time limit on the Minister.  We did not set up any special tribunal, but depended on the Minister, acting on the advice of his inspector of mental hospitals, to administer justice to the best of his <Col N="1109" /> ability.  We can similarly depend on him in this regard.  In fact, it would in the circumstances be a more serious matter.  On the last point that Deputy Cosgrave raised, as to a maximum period within which the Minister would come to a final decision, I would like to meet the Deputy on that.  It is theoretically possible that the Minister might postpone coming to a decision over a long period.  Personally I should not like that to happen.  I think when an appeal goes to the Minister it ought to be dealt with with the greatest possible expedition.  As to difficulty in coming to a decision any guarantee or statutory obligation that I would impose on the Minister could not interfere or restrict him in the proper discharge of his functions. I will look into the suggested period of 14 days that Deputy Cosgrave suggested. We may have to have it fully investigated before coming to a decision.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Murphy I move amendment No. 85:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  No Order shall be made under sub-section (1) of this section unless there is available a hospital or other institution specially adapted for the detention of persons suffering from infectious disease the subject of the Order mentioned in the said sub-section, and there are reasonable grounds for believing that persons detained in such hospital or institution will not be exposed to the risk of contracting some other infectious disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say exactly what motive Deputy Murphy had in putting down the amendment, except that it has relation to the words &ldquo;in a specified hospital or other place&rdquo;.  Possibly his anxiety was aroused because a person might be detained in a hospital not <Col N="1110" /> properly equipped for the treatment of infectious disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The section sets out that no order shall be made unless there is available a hospital or other institution specially adapted for the detention of persons.  I think again we have to assume that a county medical officer of health or a city medical officer of health would not make an order for the detention of a person unless he was satisfied that the place of detention was the most suitable place that was available for him.  That may be a hospital that is specially equipped or, in certain circumstances, it might not be a hospital at all, for the reason that people may be detained for a period who are contacts and it may not necessarily be a hospital in the sense of a fully-equipped fever hospital.  They may have to be detained or isolated for a period as contacts and the same high degree of structural facility and equipment of the institution as would be necessary in a fully-established hospital would not be necessary.  I do not know what the latter part of the amendment is intended to cover.  I think it expresses a fear rather than anything else that cross-infection might take place in the institution in which patients might be isolated under this section.  If it is a properly and fully-equipped hospital there will not be any danger of cross-infection.  If it is some kind of temporary accommodation for the segregation of contacts there would only be the one type of infection about in the institution. It is only in a hospital where various types of infectious disease would be accommodated that the risk of possibility of other infection through loose management would arise.  Deputy Murphy probably had some local circumstance in mind that he could probably explain if he were here but I do not think there is any big principle in the amendment that we may concern ourselves much about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very real fear in connection with a district certainly far removed from Deputy Murphy's area, with which I happen to be very familiar, and in connection with an institution which has <Col N="1111" /> to deal with fever cases from a very wide area.  I think it is true to say that it has been found almost impossible to have the different sorts of disease so isolated one from the other that there was not a very definite danger of cross-infection. I know that people are inclined sometimes to talk very loosely about these matters but there have been in the particular case I have in mind very general allegations of people being sent to a particular institution, supposed to be suffering from a particular infectious disease and, having arrived there, developing, or being infected with, a completely different disease.  I think it is quite true to say that there are fever institutions in this country at the moment that are not at all adequate to meet the present requirements much less the requirements which may arise when this Bill becomes fully operative.  I think that is one of the difficulties that we are up against.  The Parliamentary Secretary says, of course, that the chief medical officer will not issue the order unless he is satisfied that he has a suitable place in which to detain the person.  He may have no choice in the matter.  If the person is suffering from an infectious disease, under this section he is bound to issue the order and he may not have any choice as to where the person shall be isolated. There may be only one such institution for the county or the greater part of the county.  That is the position to-day in certain counties.  Even under present circumstances the accommodation is fully taxed and there is a definite danger and I presume that was the reason why Deputy Murphy put down this amendment because, of course, the whole point of the amendment is contained in the last two lines.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that allegations in regard to cross-infection do not come only from individuals who are not closely associated with local government administration.  Very recently very serious allegations were made in regard to the danger of cross-infection in a fever hospital with which I am familiar.  Those allegations were made by a county manager and that official, <Col N="1112" /> at any rate, should have a close knowledge of the requirements of fever hospitals and of the dangers which might arise from cross-infection.  Therefore, I think there is something very important in the latter part of the amendment which the Parliamentary Secretary ought to look into.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the amendment of Deputy Murphy from the point of view of protecting local authorities.  There is always the danger, as Deputy O'Sullivan points out, of cross-infection.  I have heard the suggestion made that the local authority might be made amenable in law where cross-infection takes place.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should consider that aspect of the matter, especially in a case where detention takes place under an order. It might lead to a case in court because, with all possible precautions, medical science cannot prevent cross-infection. It might lead to difficulties for local authorities&mdash;such things have been threatened in the past&mdash;where cross-infection took place.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Larkin, I move amendment No. 86:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  No order shall be made under sub-section (1) of this section by any medical officer unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the person in relation to whom the order is made has refused to isolate himself in a suitable manner; and</P>
      <P>(b)  a doctor selected by such person certifies that detention is necessary in the public interest.</P>
      <P>I think the point Deputy Larkin had in mind in connection with this amendment was to try to avoid the necessity for, shall I say, almost the apprehension of the individual&mdash;taking him away from his home.  He felt the necessity should not arise in the incipient stage of the disease and that it would arise only when he refused to take the necessary local precautions of isolation in his home.  In connection with the second point, here again the question arises of some recognition of the individual rights of the citizen, that is, that he may have doubts regarding the <i>bona fides</i> of the action to be taken against him and he may probably feel he had the right to rely on his own medical practitioner to ensure that his rights in respect of apprehension were safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed the principle embodied in this amendment at some length on previous amendments.  Paragraph (b) of the proposed sub-section is a variation of <Col N="1114" /> the proposals that have already been discussed by the House.  Paragraph (b) suggests that no order should be made under sub-section (1) unless a doctor selected by such person certifies that detention is necessary in the public interest.  The acceptance of that principle would completely nullify the purpose of the section, or at least it might have that effect.  It would simply mean that an order could not be made by the chief medical officer, even although he deemed it was necessary in the interest of public health, unless the doctor selected by the person himself certified that detention was necessary in the public interest.  That opens up a pretty wide field.  Notwithstanding what the chief medical officer thought as regards the degree of risk to the community, this private doctor, who perhaps had no qualifications whatever in the diagnosis or in the treatment or in the control of infectious diseases, could come along and say: &ldquo;I am satisfied and, whether you are satisfied or not, so long as I am satisfied, you cannot interfere.&rdquo;  Between Deputy Mulcahy's Government and the present Government it took quite a long time to build up, by a joint and continuing effort, the present public health machinery. Having got the distance of having county medical officers of health in all the counties and assistant medical officers of health in most and chief medical officers in the cities, I do not think that we, by an amendment to this Bill, should give statutory powers in respect to the control of diseases to private doctors who have no particular responsibility either to the local authority or to the State over the control of infectious disease.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 29 gives power to order the detention and isolation of a person whom the county medical officer of health considers should be isolated and detained.  Sub-section (2) goes to provide all the <Col N="1115" /> necessary powers for taking that person and handing him over to some institution for control and treatment in every possible way.  It completely cuts out the wish or the desire of the person concerned to be treated in a particular institution or in a particular way or by a medical officer of his own selection.  I suggest that it is one thing to order detention and isolation, but it is another thing, when an order for detention and isolation has been made for public health reasons, that every scrap of right that an individual would have as to the kind of institution in which he would be detained, the treatment he would get, or the people who would treat him either medically or disciplinarily, is taken away from him under sub-section (2).  I want to know if that is the Parliamentary Secretary's reading of the sub-section and, if so, what are the reasons why such drastic powers are required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This sub-section, in my view, contains the most objectionable features of this entire Bill.  Under the provisions of this sub-section power is given to use force if necessary to achieve the end which is desired.  That force is in no way limited to reasonable force or to anything else.  There is no appeal, except in one instance, and that is in the case of a child under 16 years, from anything that is done in reference to the unfortunate patient suffering from an infectious disease.  I do not know whether we have lost altogether the sense of the dignity of the human person.  I do not know whether that is to be subordinated to the view of the medical profession, that whatever they think is necessary for the prevention of the spread of disease should be done to a particular afflicted individual.  I think a person afflicted with disease has still some rights left. Under the sub-section he will have none.  I made a strong protest against the powers in this sub-section on the Second Reading of the Bill.  They appear to me to contravene the rights of the individual to an extent which is entirely unjustified by the moral law and, I think, possibly unjustified by the <Col N="1116" /> provisions of the Constitution, if there are any such provisions left.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has given any indication of his intention in any way to soften down or ameliorate the drastic provisions of this sub-section. In paragraph (h) of the sub-section power is given to a registered medical practitioner having charge of a patient in a hospital to do anything or to cause anything to be done in relation to the patient which in his opinion is necessary or expedient to prevent the spread of infection from the patient. He can do anything.  Under the clause as it stands, he can cause him to be put into a gas or a lethal chamber. There is nothing in the section to prevent him from doing that.  I challenge any Deputies who are laughing at this to point out where the flaw is in what I have said.  &ldquo;Anything to be done in relation to the patient which in his opinion is necessary or expedient to prevent the spread of infection from the patient.&rdquo;  That gives him legal authority to do anything he likes and the three or four matters which are particularised in no way cut down the generality of the powers conferred upon him.  He can do anything he likes.  He can cut pieces out of him.  He can perform an operation and take out any vital parts of his anatomy which contain any germ of infection or are the focal point of the carrier's infection.  There is nothing to prevent him legally from doing it, and if that were not enough, under paragraph (n), force may, if necessary, be used for carrying out any provision of this section, so that under paragraph (h) he may do anything he likes, anything which in his opinion is necessary to prevent the spread of infection and may use force, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in blinking the issue. Those powers are as extensive as the draftsman's art could make them.  It is no answer to say that a registered medical practitioner will act reasonably. He generally may, but, when giving powers of a kind so drastic as, in my view, to be unjustifiable, this House must take care that they know what they are doing and do it with their eyes open.  Any Deputy who votes <Col N="1117" /> for this section is voting for absolute power in any registered medical practitioner to do anything he likes with the living body of an unfortunate afflicted person, and to use any degree of force he may think fit to use, and there is no authority in the country, either the courts or the ecclesiastical authorities, to whom any appeal can be made on behalf of that afflicted person.</P>

I do not think it is necessary to do that. Deputies can refer to the Official Report and I think they will find the case for this section has been fairly fully made.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) of Section 29, as I have stated on a number of occasions already, provision is made within which the chief medical officer may make a detention order, if, in his opinion, it is necessary or expedient in the interests of public health.  Sub-section (2) follows, and it sets out the detailed machinery necessary for the proper and efficient operation of sub-section (1).  When Deputy Costello comes back to all this nonsense about infringing the rights of the subject, we must either bear patiently with him or keep repeating the case, the unanswerable case, in so far as infectious disease is concerned, for the complete and absolute control of individuals who, by reason of their <Col N="1118" /> infectious state, have been constituted a danger to the community.  Deputy Costello knows as well as anybody in the House, and probably better than most, that the rights of the community must get prior consideration to the rights of the individual in cases such as these.  If the individual is not allowed to assault his neighbour, to slander his neighbour or to endanger his neighbour's life in the physical sense, why should the individual, in the name of the liberty of the subject, be allowed to endanger the lives not only of his family and his immediate neighbours but of the entire community, when he comes to suffer from a dangerous infectious disease?</P>
      <P>At an earlier stage of this debate, I had to remind the House that under the existing regulations the Minister has unlimited power.  It has never been argued that it is unconstitutional nor has it ever been suggested that these powers have been abused.  The existing law provides that the Minister may make such regulations as to him seem fit for the control of infectious diseases, and, as I have repeatedly told the House, there was no statutory obligation even to place these regulation on the Table of the House.</P>

      <P>Section 141 of that Act says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where any suitable hospital or place for the reception of the sick is provided within the district of a sanitary authority, or within a convenient distance of such district, any person who is suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, and is without proper lodging or accommodation, or lodged in a room occupied by other persons not so suffering, or is on board any ship or vessel, may, on a certificate signed by a legally qualified medical practitioner, and with the consent of the superintending body of such hospital or place, be removed, by order of any justice, to such hospital or place at the cost of the sanitary authority; and any person so suffering, who is lodged in any common lodging-house, may, with the like consent and on a like certificate, be so removed by order of the sanitary authority.&rdquo;</P>

Any order so to be made by any such justice may be limited to some specific time, but with full power to any justice to enlarge such time as often as may appear to him to be necessary.  It shall be lawful for any officer of the local authority or inspector of police acting in the district, or for any officer of the hospital, on any such order being made to take all necessary measures and do all necessary acts for enforcing the execution thereof.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to Sections 61 and 65 of the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1907.  I also referred to the 1919 regulations.  I do not know if Deputy Costello's attention has been directed to them.  I think they are very relevant to the amendment before the House at the moment. Article 19 (2) of those regulations is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where any suitable hospital or place for the reception of the sick is provided within the district of a sanitary authority or within a convenient distance of such district any person who is suffering from malaria, dysentery, trench fever and is without proper lodging or accommodation or is lodged in a room occupied by more than one family or is on board any ship, vessel or boat or is lodged in any common lodging house or is in any place where such person cannot be effectively isolated so as to prevent the spread of the disease may on a certificate signed by the medical officer of health and with the consent of the superintending body of such hospital or place be removed to such hospital or place at the cost of the sanitary authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> There is no court of appeal, no appeal to the Minister, no special tribunal set up to provide for the discharge of the patient, if he succeeded in establishing a claim that he was not in an infectious state and consequently should not be detained.  Deputy Costello makes some debating play of the terms of the section as they stand. I suppose I ought not expect him to advert to the Ministerial amendments that have been circulated.  Notwithstanding the powers that we have at the present time and the powers we could continue to enjoy if we had not tried to co-ordinate the law, I thought there would be some appreciation of the effort I have made in these amendments to meet the line of criticism directed against the Bill.  Deputy Costello reminds us of the power we took under paragraph (h) of this sub-section (2), in the Bill as drafted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The registered medical practitioner having charge of the patient in such hospital or other place may cause anything to be done in relation to the patient which, in his opinion, is necessary or expedient....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a Ministerial amendment, amendment No. 112, proposing to delete the words &ldquo;anything to be done in relation to the patient which, in his opinion is&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;any precautions to be taken in relation to the patient which in his opinion are&rdquo;.  It may have been of some debating value before&mdash;though I do not think it caused any real anxiety to anybody&mdash;but, at any rate, we can no longer be accused of giving the registered medical practitioner the fullest freedom to do anything he could wish to do in the way of treatment.  He will now be required, by this amendment which is to come before the House, to take precautions in relation to the patient which are necessary in his opinon to prevent the spread of infection.</P>
    <P>Anxiety has been expressed as to the danger of major operations.  Deputies expressed the fear that, under this section, we are going to remove organs wholesale.  I think amendment No. 122 will satisfy anybody who had any particular anxiety concerning his organs. <Col N="1122" /> Amendment No. 122 sets out that medical or surgical treatment shall not be given to the patient in such hospital or other place without the consent of the appropriate person.  However, we might as well not have circulated these amendments at all.  Deputy Costello comes back to the charge fresh as paint and tells us we are about to deprive people of their liberty and infringe their constitutional rights.  As Deputy Allen now reminds me, we are also charged with infringing the rights of freedom of worship.  I think we will survive all the charges Deputy Costello may make against us.  Intelligent people, inside and outside this House, realise there is not much substance in the charges levelled against us in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about that article and have not the remotest idea as to who wrote it. Every word of criticism I uttered was pale and insignificant compared to the criticism that appeared outside.  Mud-slinging is no answer to argument. The more mud that is slung, the more it is apparent that there is no answer to argument.  The Parliamentary Secretary is an adept at mud-slinging; I am not.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary started his alleged answer to my criticisms of sub-section (2) by stating that he could not repeat to absent audiences what he had already repeated.  I spent a considerable portion of yesterday on this measure.  I left a little over half an hour before the conclusion of the debate.  I venture to say that in the half hour, or the 35 minutes before the close of this debate the Parliamentary Secretary never made one reference, in the whole course of whatever observations he made, to the criticisms I made.  I challenge him to produce, when the Official Debates are available, anything in the smallest degree relevant to sub-section (2) or anything I said on that sub-section.  He quoted a number of sections of the Public Health Act of 1878 and the Infectious Diseases Act of 1890, but he never made the smallest effort to relate them to the provisions of sub-section (2) or to show that the present proposal, to which we object, has the smallest relation to the provisions of those Acts, the sections of which he read out in such a mumbling fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it was not the desire of the Parliamentary Secretary to co-ordinate the law they could still, to use his own expression, enjoy the powers conferred on him by the sections of the Acts to which he referred.  Are we to assume, again, something similiar to what he said when he mis-referred to Section 63 of the Act of 1878 yesterday evening, when he was exposed in his efforts to mislead the House?  Is the House to assume from what the Parliamentary Secretary said that all that <Col N="1124" /> has been done in sub-section (2) is merely to codify the provisions of the existing law?  If he is trying to persuade the House that that is the effect of the sub-section, there is no ground for that suggestion; there is no relationship whatever.  Anybody reading sub-section (2) of Section 29 and relating it to the provisions of the existing law could find no comparison or recognition between them.</P>
    <P>He then fell back on the Ministerial amendments and, out of almost 700 amendments, all he was able to produce were two amendments to meet the criticisms made from this side of the House on the Second Reading.  Because of the fact that the criticisms which were made and the invasion, not of constitutional liberty, but of the personal rights of the individual, irrespective of the Constitution, because those personal rights of the individual were being invaded unjustifiably according to the moral law, we drew attention to, and strongly denounced, the provisions of sub-section (2), providing that the body of the human person could be the plaything of a registered medical practitioner, as it could under the powers as they stood when the Bill was introduced and as they will stand with the Ministerial amendments.  The Parliamentary Secretary was able to produce only two amendments softening down the harshness of the provision in the original Bill, which he was not able to get away with.</P>
    <P>The only amendments that in any way endeavoured to meet the criticisms made were amendments Nos. 112 and 122 and, from the point of view of legal interpretation, they leave the situation exactly as it was before.  Instead of saying the registered medical practitioner may do anything which, in his opinion, is necessary, in order that the public may be hood-winked, the phrase is used that the resident medical practitioner may take any precaution which he thinks fit.  What is the difference between doing anything you like and taking any precautions you like?  It is merely a difference of words.</P>
    <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary should endeavour to do, if I may respectfully say so, is to meet argument <Col N="1125" /> with argument and not with invective or interruption.  I state here categorically that there is no distinction in substance between the provision which enables the resident medical practitioner to do anything he likes and the provision which enables him to take any precaution he likes.  I want to know the difference.  From the point of view of legal interpretation, I say there is none.  The Parliamentary Secretary, rather than interrupt Deputies, should try to keep his mind to the one point.  He will not affect my argument by trying to divert the attention of the House to other points.  I am dealing with his amendment and I will stay here until I make it clear to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I proceed with the debate?  The Parliamentary Secretary is unable to answer the arguments I have put forward, that where the provision in the Bill is to the effect that a registered medical practitioner may do anything he likes with an individual suffering from an infectious disease, the amendment to that particular provision, merely stating that the registered medical practitioner may take such precautions as he thinks fit, makes no difference in substance.  I want to know if the Parliamentary Secretary has any answer to that.  The next point he makes is that he has another amendment providing that, although he still retains the provision in paragraph (n)&mdash;that force may, if necessary, be used for carrying out any of the provisions of this sub-section&mdash; that a provision put in now by way of amendment, that medical or surgical treatment shall not be given to the patient in such hospital or such other place without the consent of the appropriate person, takes away the right <Col N="1127" /> of the registered medical practitioner to perform by force a variety of operations. I say it does not.  Precautions which the individual registered medical practitioner may take and which he may put into effect by force, would not amount to medical or surgical treatment. Treatment is the only thing that requires the consent of the patient.  Precautions that may be administered by force are not such treatment, and, accordingly, the amendments are just in the nature of eyewash, in order to endeavour to mislead the public into thinking that criticisms of this Bill have been in any way met.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered the point I made.  He quoted certain sections of the Acts of 1878, 1890 and 1907.  I ask him in respect of each of these Acts what they have to do with sub-section (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted sections where he had power to detain and to isolate people.  When dealing with Deputy Murphy's amendment No. 85 where it was sought that no Order should be made unless there is an available hospital adaptable for the detention of persons suffering from infectious disease the Parliamentary Secretary brushed that point aside. Section 41 specifically provides that where a suitable hospital or place for the reception of the sick is provided detention or isolation can be carried out.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not disclose to Deputy O'Sullivan that he was advancing from the precious 1878 position, and was acquiring powers of compulsory isolation and detention.  My point is that sub-section (2) apparently goes completely beyond any power the Minister has been able to dig up from the Acts and regulations he quoted.  In a most penal way it provides that when a person is isolated or detained he is handed over completely to some group of medical practitioners that he may not want to have anything to do with, either in connection with his treatment, medical or surgical.  I ask the Parliamentary <Col N="1128" /> Secretary to say why these powers are necessary, and why no provision is made for that person to be attended by a medical attendant that he knows. The only answer of the Parliamentary Secretary was that when a patient is taken into one of these institutions the cost of dealing with him either from the point of view of maintenance or treatment, is going to be borne by the local authority.  That is no answer to my question, why the Parliamentary Secretary is now taking what is apparently completely new power, and that when an Order is issued, detaining or isolating a person, he is taken full control of by the medical machine that he need not necessarily want to have anything to do with, and is deprived of having the assistance of his own medical attendant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Your eloquence was not sufficient.  All the arguments you adduced to condemn the Parliamentary Secretary and the provisions of the Bill were not sufficient without going outside the lay authorities.  It is an old gag that does not work any longer. <Col N="1129" /> It was tried out by the Deputy and his Party at one time.  If they ever come into power again&mdash;which is not likely&mdash; it will not work.  That is certain. They tried it on for years and we all know with what effect.  It is time to leave that aspect aside.  Section 29 gives the chief medical officer of health in an area power to control and detain persons who he suspects are suffering from infectious disease.  It also gives power to treat persons, suspected of being affected, when in hospital.  That is all the section does.  Deputy Costello challenges the right of this House or of the chief medical officer of health to order treatment for a person in an institution or fever hospital.  Listening to him, it strikes me that he or those in his Party must have only heard now that in the past there were sections in the community suffering from types of infectious disease that never went into fever hospitals or public institutions for treatment.  They were treated by private practitioners.  The objection would seem to be that they have in future to go into public places for treatment, and be treated by the medical officer of institutions.  Deputy Costello strenuously objects, because these people have not the right to bring private practitioners to the institutions to treat them.</P>

I want to say that the arguments put up by Deputy Costello and Deputy Mulcahy seem to an ordinary person absolutely ridiculous. They are trying to make some political capital out of this section.  They tried it on the Second Stage; they failed; it fell very flat.  They called to their aid other groups of persons outside this House altogether to try to help to make political capital for them and I want to say that their efforts on the present occasion will fail as they did in the past.</P>

      <P>May I suggest, with all respect, that if there is any admonition to be addressed by the Chair it ought to be addressed to the interrupter, not the person who is in possession at the moment.  I want to put this to Deputy Allen and to other Deputies on the opposite side: this section as it stands gives power to remove by force a child against the wishes of the child, against the wishes of the parent, to take that child to any institution wherever it may be situate, determined on by the medical officer, and to perform any act which the medical officer thinks is necessary, even under the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment, to take any precaution he deems necessary, even to the point of making blood tests on that child against the child's wishes, by force, and against the wishes of the parent or guardian.  Deputy Allen sees nothing out of the ordinary in that and the Parliamentary Secretary wants to convey that he is looking for no power here other than the power that was in the original Acts.  Deputy Allen is too experienced, not only as a member of this House but as a member of a local authority, not to know that this is a revolutionary departure.  I agree with the Deputy in one thing anyway and with the Parliamentary Secretary: so far as the Church authorities are concerned, they can look after their own business.  I cannot see them turning anybody away from the church door, whether this Bill is passed or not. The fact is, of course, as Deputy Costello said, that no attempt has been made, either on this amendment or on the section or any section of the Bill, so far, to meet argument with argument. The Parliamentary Secretary, in order to avoid argument, in order to avoid dealing with the particular section that may be under discussion, <Col N="1133" /> in order to avoid dealing with the amendment, quotes sections of Acts from 1878 to 1907 and in most cases the sections which he quotes or to which he refers have no bearing on and no resemblance to the particular section or amendment of this Bill which is under discussion.  It is because we realise what can be done under legislation such as this that we are taking those precautions, and we have reason for it.  The Parliamentary Secretary asks us to assume that such-and-such a thing will not be done, to envisage what will be done, but some of us have very clear recollection, on the eve of the outbreak of the war, of being asked to give this Government extraordinary powers, of getting categorical assurance from the Taoiseach himself that those powers would not be abused and, of course, we lived to see them abused in the most disgraceful way, once the powers were granted.  We have lived to see the Emergency Powers Act used to bring in under its operation matters that this House never dreamt would be brought in and used under its operation. It is because not only that this is bad in itself, as set out in print, but because we have had painful experience of the mentality behind this type of legislation that we have to try to take every step we can to safeguard the rights of the people.</P>

      <P>Could I get any reply at all from the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the points I raised that here he is taking completely new powers outside anything that he has been able to quote for us in the past, that under this section, as well as continuing the powers to detain and to isolate people and to put them into institutions, he is taking complete power to isolate them entirely from any medical attendant they might like to have and to put them into the hands of a medical machine in which they might not wish to be?</P>

      <P>I want the House to understand and the public to appreciate that in accordance with the list of infectious diseases to which various sections of the Bill are to apply that has been circulated to us by the Parliamentary Secretary, tuberculosis is <Col N="1134" /> one of the diseases to which Section 29 of the Bill is to apply.  Any unfortunate person who is suffering at any stage from tuberculosis may be arrested and detained at the instance of any registered medical practitioner who may take any precautions he in his absolute discretion thinks fit, any force that is necessary or unnecessary may be used against him and he may be detained and isolated from his friends, relations and parents.  I want the public to appreciate the power that is taken in this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary has refused to give any answer to the objections which have been made or to make any case in justification of the powers sought in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary put forward two propositions which might well have emanated from the Continent of Europe.  The first was that the rights of the community are prior to the rights of the individual.  That doctrine was very widespread a few years ago.  The second proposition that he laid down was what he called the incontestable case for the complete and absolute control of an afflicted individual.  Is there any difference between these two points on which the Parliamentary Secretary endeavours to base the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section and some of the doctrines which were so widespread on the Continent of Europe a few years ago?  We recognise that the community have rights.  This Bill does not recognise that the individual has any rights as against the community.  We strongly object to that and, for that reason, we insist that this section shall be properly appreciated and understood. If necessary, we shall drag the Parliamentary Secretary to his feet to try to justify, if he can, the provisions of this particular sub-section which, in his reply on the Second Reading debate or in any of the speeches he has so far made on the section, he has failed to justify in any single particular. I want to know can the Parliamentary Secretary give any reason why it is necessary to retain a person suffering from the initial stages of tuberculosis; why it is necessary that a registered medical practitioner should be entitled to take any precautions <Col N="1135" /> that he thinks fit in reference to an unfortunate individual; why force should be necessary in reference to that particular individual; why the rights of the community should be extended to such an extent as to submerge the entire rights of the individual.</P>

I have heard no single reason given by the Parliamentary Secretary for sub-section (2) of this section, nor is it to be found in the Official Reports.  I challenge him to produce one line from the Official Reports justifying any provision in sub-section (2) of Section 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has agreed to give the Parliamentary Secretary the power which he seeks in sub-section (1) of this section.  That provides for the isolation and detention of any person suffering from an infectious disease, or who is a probable cause of infection. But, in sub-section (2), very drastic further powers are sought, powers which appear to me on the face of them to be unnecessary and undesirable. Why should the Parliamentary Secretary seek the powers contained in paragraph (h), such as &ldquo;the cleansing, disinfection, or disinfestation of the patient&rdquo;?  Why should he seek the right to use force if necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which strikes me on reading this sub-section. In paragraph (e) there is power to isolate a patient until the medical officer certifies that he is no longer a probable source of infection.  I think we already got an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that he would favour and approve of visiting committees in connection with institutions of this kind.  I am rather doubtful as to whether a visiting committee could insist upon seeing a patient in the face of this particular paragraph. So far as I can see, the authorities in <Col N="1136" /> charge of the institution could refuse permission to a visiting committee to have any contact with a patient in such an institution.  They could justify their refusal by quoting this particular paragraph.  That is a very serious position for a citizen of this country to be placed in&mdash;to be completely isolated in an institution and to be cut off completely from any contact with anybody independent of that institution or of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I think this sub-section, if it is not deleted, ought to be very drastically amended.  It ought to be made perfectly clear that an independent visiting committee should have the right to go into an institution at any time, see the patients there, hear whatever grievances they have, or whatever complaints they wish to make, and bring them to the notice of the proper authorities.  That is the very least that should be provided for, but I think it is not provided for in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This sub-section is a very large one and the powers which it seeks are very widespread.  I do not want to travel over the whole of the ground covered by this sub-section. But I should like to point out what I think is an outrageous power to give to any doctor, Minister of State, or any other person over an individual. That is the power contained in sub-section (2) (h) (iii): &ldquo;the medical examination of the patient and the taking from him of blood or other specimens for bacteriological or protozoological examination or test&rdquo;.  If that is taken in connection with paragraph (a), namely, that force, if necessary, may be used, I think this House is being asked to give powers to medical officers which they will not want, and which, in any case, should not be given.  It seems to me that these two paragraphs, taken in relation to each other, turn an individual who is being detained in a hospital into something no better than a laboratory subject. As I read that, if a man, woman or child is taken to a hospital, the medical authorities have power to use that individual for the purpose of a laboratory experiment.  That is a power <Col N="1137" /> which this House should not give to any individual or group of individuals. It is one thing to use powers for the protection of the community, to use powers to put a person in hospital for his own good or for the good of the community.  In that connection, we on this side of the House have handed over certain powers to the Parliamentary Secretary which we were very loath to hand over to him.  But I consider it an entirely different thing to hand over the powers to the Parliamentary Secretary to allow any medical persons to use a patient as the subject of a laboratory experiment, because that is the way I read sub-section (h) in relation to paragraph (n). I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary on that subject.  I hope I am mistaken in my reading of it, but I certainly will oppose with all the inadequate force at my command the handing over of these powers to any person in the State and I do not care what medical degrees he holds.  The rights of the individual transcend everything else in that connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I came into the House I have learned that the phrase has been used in this connection that the Government demand the complete and absolute control of the individual, and that they think the rights of the community are prior to the rights of the individual.  That is the doctrine upon which the whole system covered by the term of Nazism was founded, and it was their use of the phrase and the summary measures which developed from it which led to the greater horrors which have recently been exposed through the system of concentration camps, sterilisation chambers, gas chambers and all the other horrible paraphernalia of that régime.  Apart from all that, the use of this phrase has led to quite an awakening of the Christian sense in opposition to that particular doctrine, and one can hardly take up any ordinary newspaper, one certainly cannot take up any newspaper which pretends to deal with faith or morals, without finding that doctrine placed in sharp contrast with the opposing doctrine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opposing doctrine is the doctrine <Col N="1138" /> to which I adhere.  That opposing doctrine has been put in these terms that there are rights which not merely Catholics have but which Christians have, which Christians arrogate to themselves as part of their very definite rights founded upon the human personality and the dignity which is supposed to attach to it.  I stress this Christian doctrine&mdash;not merely the one which is backed by the tenets of a particular religion.  It is supposed to be the heritage of old-time classical and more recent Christian tradition that there are individual rights which no State can take away and which no State can destroy, even though they make their claim on the basis of the greater good of the community, and involved in these rights are certain other matters which are here being contested.</P>
    <P>I have always understood from recent reading that there are now two sharp divisions of view in this connection. One is the view of those who develop a particularly strong State attitude, that the State can do anything and that no rights are sacred in relation to the rights which the State claims to possess over the community.  That claim is arrogantly made and is all the more dangerous when it is founded upon this matter of making people good, of making people clean, of making people healthy, whether they like it or not.  It is stated of an old-time principal of one of the public schools who used to address his classes at the beginning of the term that he said he would flog them if they were not pure of heart. That has always been held up to scorn and ridicule as indicating how little fitted that man was to be an educator.</P>
    <P>The same phrase is emerging apparently as current coin in this debate. People here are to be punished and may be punished in very different and very gross ways, if they are not, apart from being pure of heart, clean in body. In opposition to that, there is another view that there are certain things about the individual which may not be touched without his consent, irrespective entirely of what the background may be.  The phrase used here that we require the complete and absolute control <Col N="1139" /> of the individual is, of course, a complete heresy of the Nazi system. One might have expected that three or four years ago to have been taken in its stride by people who thought very little about the matter, but it is surprising that it should arise at this stage, when, as I have said, the horrors to which that particular type of phrase gave rise have been thoroughly exposed and the dangers in the phrase very definitely paraded before people's eyes.</P>
    <P>We are, however, faced with the view that the rights of the community are to be given complete and entire superiority over the rights of the individual.  In opposition to that, I want to state very definitely that there are certain individual rights which cannot be submerged by any claim made on behalf of the community, no matter how strongly it is made.  One of these rights is the extent to which the individual may be subjected to certain treatment against his will. When the Nazi system got going properly, there were excesses with regard to the emasculation of people, the sterilisation of other people and the destruction of people who were considered to be unfit and to be a source of infection and disease.  The phrase has recently been used in the course of the trial which is occupying public attention that even a certain racial group of the community were to be regarded as if they were so many tubercle bacilli and to be destroyed in the same ruthless way as if they were such germs.  That apparently is the aim which lies before the people who have framed this measure.</P>
    <P>A very concrete argument has been put up here to paragraph (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 29 and I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary's defence of it is based on two amendments of his.  I want to find out how far these amendments go.  It is quite clear from paragraph (h) as it stood that anything could be done which a particular individual, a registered medical practitioner having charge of a patient, thought to be necessary.  Deputies should not be misled by the Parliamentary phrasing of the paragraphs numbered (i), (ii) <Col N="1140" /> and (iii), because these are only things which, in particular, are to be included.  The general sweep of paragraph (h) of sub-section (2), however, gives power to do anything which, in that man's opinion, is either necessary or even expedient for certain purposes, but it includes in particular&mdash;and here the curtain is lifted a little&mdash;that there may be a medical examination and the taking of certain blood specimens. Later, in paragraph (n), it is ordained that force may be used for any of the provisions of the sub-section, so that we are faced with the situation that force may be used in so far as a medical practitioner thinks that force is required, and the whole pivot of paragraph (h) is something which, in a certain person's opinion, is expedient or necessary.</P>
    <P>We have an example close to our eyes of the danger of that phrase.  At the start of the war, as has already been indicated by another Deputy, the Government asked the Dáil to give them powers for the purpose of preserving the State, and the way in which they were provided eventually was that the Emergency Powers Act was passed which indicated that certain things could be done if they were considered necessary, or that, if it was considered that certain things which were mentioned, were required for the purpose of preserving the State, these things could be done.  When that piece of legislation came for analysis before the courts, they found they had no right to say whether, in their opinion, the matters were necessary or not. Once the Act itself said that the State could do whatever it thought necessary, you had all this flood of Emergency Powers Orders, each with the preamble that one, two or three Ministers thought certain things necessary, and then the courts were precluded from considering whether they thought these things necessary or not.</P>
    <P>We have the recurrence of that phrase.  The pivot of what may be done is where the registered medical practitioner, in his opinion, thinks certain things necessary or expedient.  If the matter came for trial before a court, the court would find itself faced with the same barrier as it has <Col N="1141" /> been in connection with Emergency Powers Orders.  The practitioner has certified that, in his opinion, certain things are necessary and so the courts are without power.  The matter that he certifies as being expedient or necessary is regarded as being so and the court will turn to this section, where the Legislature in its wisdom decided to give that power.  Hereafter, all a Minister defending a particular activity would have to prove would be simply that the practitioner certified that, in his opinion, certain things were necessary or expedient.  Then the matter has to be performed and there is no safeguard to the citizen.</P>
    <P>We may be asked to say that people will behave reasonably.  If people are always supposed to behave reasonably, there is no need at all for this mass of legislation.  A Bill with three or four paragraphs could be brought in, empowering the Government, in relation to this matter, to do whatever it thought reasonable.  The purpose of legislation, however, is to inquire into the various things proposed and to see whether the necessary safeguards will be established in legislation, so that, hereafter, people will have their rights before independent judges, to say whether they are right or a registered medical practitioner is right in what he decides to enforce.</P>
    <P>One of the things he can enforce is: &ldquo;the medical examination of the patient and the taking from him of blood or other specimens for bacteriological or protozoological examination or test&rdquo;.  He may require force in that direction.  That is only a particular of what he may require.  It has been put here that he may call for an operation and, as far as paragraph (h) of the section is concerned, he may&mdash; I do not think there is any denial&mdash;if he called for an operation, remove some organ or diseased portion of an organ.  As long as he certified that, in his opinion, it was necessary, the matter is finished as far as the court is concerned and human rights are in abeyance.  If that is not right, I ask someone to say where it is wrong.  It is my reading of the sub-section.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 112 has been referred to, but there the pivot words are <Col N="1142" /> retained&mdash;he may cause any precautions to be taken in relation to a patient which, in his opinion, are necessary or expedient.  Once the practitioner is able to certify that, in his opinion, certain things are either necessary or expedient, the matter is at an end and the courts are without power.  I understand the Parliamentary Secretary relied a great deal upon amendment No. 122, but there is a conflict here under paragraph (h)&mdash; anything which is described as a precautionary measure may be done as long as that individual has a particular view.</P>
    <P>We come to another thing called &ldquo;treatment&rdquo;.  I would like to know if the word &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; in amendment No. 122 overrides the word &ldquo;precaution&rdquo;, or if &ldquo;precaution&rdquo; overrides &ldquo;treatment&rdquo;?  In other words, is the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment No. 122 to be read as if it were: &ldquo;No precautionary measure involving medical or surgical treatment shall be given to a patient without the consent of the appropriate person&rdquo;?  If that were the case, the difficulty arising here would be met to some extent.  However, that is not stated in so many words.  If a court were faced with a case in which a registered medical practitioner decided that a particular operation was necessary then, under this section, even taking the amendments as having been passed, if the practitioner certified that what he required was a precautionary measure which he thought necessary or expedient, the courts would be without resort and could not come to the help of the patient.</P>
    <P>I do not see why there should be difficulty in meeting this.  If it is decided that there cannot be an operation upon a person unless that person agrees, it should be possible to state that in simple terms; but it must be stated in order to get rid of the objection. Whether it is classed as a &ldquo;precautionary measure&rdquo; or as &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; the person's consent should be obtained before an operation can be performed.  Until that particular amendment has been made, the matter is still in doubt.  If that matter afterwards came before the courts, I <Col N="1143" /> suggest that the courts would say: &ldquo;Here is something that is ambiguous. It may be precaution: in that event, the certificate of the registered medical practitioner is the last authority.  It may be not precaution but treatment, in which case the will of the patient must be obtained.  But we do not know which it is; we do know that through this whole section the thing that is made superior to any opinion the courts may have is a certificate of the practitioner.&rdquo;  With that particular dilemma before them, they will be forced back upon this: &ldquo;Does the practitioner in this case say not merely that something is required or is expedient but that he calls for that as a precaution?&rdquo;  The courts would then say: &ldquo;If so, our view would possibly be that this is treatment and therefore should be carried by the new paragraph (j) but we have an authority stating something to the contrary and that authority is given supremacy right through Section 29.&rdquo;  In that case the judges would probably have to fold their arms and say it was a matter where, if they were allowed to give a decision, they would not allow human rights, rights pertaining to the dignity of the human person, to be overridden. But the Legislature is the body that decides those things and counsel would be told that, in this case, these arguments would be much better addressed to the Legislative Assembly rather than to the court, as the court is tied by the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take this calmly and to understand that, when this measure passes out of this House, nobody hereafter will be entitled to go before the court and tell the court what happened here.  The court takes a piece of legislation as it finds it and, except on rare occasions, the court does not resort to Dáil reports of speeches to find out the intention. They look at what is before them, and if they see a very precise clause saying that the registered medical practitioner is set up as the authority in all these matters, it is his opinion which has to count.  The Legislative Assembly says that, if the practitioner has a view, that view can <Col N="1144" /> not be upset in any court.  On that point, the courts are without any resort, they have to apply the law and do not interpret it according to what was said here.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose it is intended that a man should be forced to undergo a serious or radical operation unless he consents to it, but are we here giving powers which somebody hereafter may use, contrary to a person's will, to enforce upon him an operation, on the view stated by a practitioner that it is a precautionary measure which that practitioner considers either necessary or expedient?  In that event, we have put the unfortunate patient into the position that he has simply to go into revolt.  He has to fall back upon human rights and say: &ldquo;I do not agree with what was said in Dáil Éireann that my rights as an individual are subservient to the rights of the community. Surely I have certain rights as a human person, which no group of any community can take from me and I will pursue the matter to the bitter end&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are going to have a new system. We all remember the scenes that took place before the public eye when people in this country in olden days were forcibly fed, and we know the scenes that occurred when some people forcibly fed died under the application of that force.  Is it suggested that that should be repeated?  Is it even suggested that we should give ground for any belief that, with equanimity, we looked forward to the possibility of that being repeated?  It is quite possible that people here might be accused of letting this thing pass unnoticed if, hereafter, force was used on an unwilling patient, simply because some registered medical practitioner thought something was required as a precaution and you might have a man resisting as well as he could and, therefore, making his best endeavour to see that whatever operation was proposed to him would be a failure. Supposing he passes out under such forcible treatment, would people here like it to be said that, with the warning given to them that a mere change of words could have put the situation right, they sat idly by and allowed the <Col N="1145" /> phrase to be carried through the Dáil? I suggest that that could lead to public exposure and public scandal.</P>
    <P>The answer may be made that that is not going to happen.  Who knows? It is when this piece of legislation has passed, as such, that the interpretation and the application and the enforcement of it occur.  It may not be the people who are sitting here who will enforce it.  They may not be here either to bemoan the fact that they took no part in trying to change it, or to pride themselves that they did take part fruitlessly in an effort to change it.  It may be that a generation hence some enforcement of a particularly hideous type will take place upon an unwilling patient, with the result that life will be lost.  It will be no good to say that we had a good intention when we passed this legislation, that we gave the good of the community as the overriding reason, and that we thought the powers would be reasonably used.</P>
    <P>Once you pass this legislation, you pass it out for unreasonable use.  If, every time the courts exercise their authority, it is made clear to them that these powers should be reasonably used, then you might rely on the courts using them reasonably; but once you pass this legislation out, the courts have no such standard to apply.  They simply take what is done here; they take the dry words of some Act which they have to interpret and apply.  If it is decided that a patient is not to be subject to an operation without his consent, it is the easiest thing to say that.</P>
    <P>At the moment I suggest there is a conflict.  As long as a thing is classed as precautionary, it is the authority of the registered medical practitioner which is supreme.  It is only when the registered medical practitioner carries out the treatment at the wish of the patient that it should be permitted.  As long as he keeps what he proposes to do on the grounds that it is a precautionary measure, then I suggest, on a clear reading of the section, that he can enforce his will under paragraph (n) and the consequences are that it will be related back to this Dáil and the debate here, but unfortunately this <Col N="1146" /> debate will not be possible of quotation.</P>
    <P>If the Parliametary Secretary wants to clear this point, he can say that amendment No. 122 has the meaning that no medical or surgical treatment, whether it is precautionary or otherwise, shall be given, or that no precautionary measure involving medical or surgical treatment shall be given, without the consent of the appropriate person.</P>

      <P>The draftsman is not going to be the judge.  He is not going to be paraded before the court to tell what he meant.  The words in the Act will be taken.  There is the possibility, the probability, and I might say the certainty, of a conflict as to what may be done in the guise of precaution and what is prohibited, against the will of the patient, under the heading of treatment.  Let us make it clear that precautionary measure does not override the impediment put in amendment No. 122.  As long as that impediment is not made clear, I suggest the situation Deputy Costello described is an obvious result.  The person may have a radical, a serious, a bad operation performed against his will, simply because some registered medical practitioner says in his opinion it is necessary or expedient as a precautionary measure.  Nobody in the House wants that.  Put it out in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go over the ground again.  There are, however, some small points that arise, particularly out of Deputy McGilligan's interesting speech.  The precautionary measures that may be taken under paragraph (h), assuming that the Ministerial amendment will be accepted, are intended to relate solely to the precautionary measures that may be necessary for the prevention of the spread of disease.  As the House is aware, we are deleting the words &ldquo;may cause anything to be done&rdquo; and we are substituting the words &ldquo;that precautionary measures may be taken&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In amendment No. 122 we specifically set out that medical and surgical treatment shall not be given to the patient in such hospital or other place without the consent of the appropriate <Col N="1148" /> person.  Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan say that does not clearly exclude the possibility of surgical procedure as a precautionary measure.  I will not take it upon myself to question their legal interpretation, but my legal advisers advise me that we have ensured against the possibility of medical or surgical treatment by the amendment we have circulated&mdash;medical or surgical treatment without the consent of the patient.  If there is any doubt about that, I have no hesitation whatever in undertaking to have that doubt cleared up, none at all, because the policy very definitely is that treatment will not be carried out, either of a medical or a surgical nature, without the consent of the patient.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty, as Deputy McGilligan realises, in the matter of what constituted an operation.  We must have power, as a precautionary measure, to do at least two things that occur to me.  We must have power to immunise as a precautionary measure in order to prevent the spread of disease.  But we do not regard immunisation as constituting treatment.  We regard it as a preventive measure, as a precaution.  I should like to hear Deputy McGilligan, who apparently has given a good deal of thought to this, relate the views he has expressed in his interesting contribution to the debate this evening to paragraph 10 of the regulations of 1929, issued by Deputy Mulcahy, when he was Minister. Paragraph 10 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Upon the receipt of a notification under these regulations, or on becoming aware in any other way of a case or suspected case of acute primary pneumonia, or acute influenzal pneumonia or malaria or dysentery, in his district, the medical officer of health, or an officer of the sanitary authority acting under the instructions of the medical officer of health, shall make such inquiries and take such steps as are necessary or desirable for investigating the source of infection, for preventing the spread of infection, and for removing conditions favourable to infection, and if no medical practitioner <Col N="1149" /> is in attendance on the patient, the medical officer of health shall also take such steps as are necessary or desirable for ascertaining the nature of the case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that paragraph 10, if analysed with the proposals before the House, is identical.  I submit that all the power, and with equal force, that could be sought here is in paragraph 10.  The regulation states: &ldquo;to take such steps as are necessary or desirable&rdquo;. It differs in a very small degree, if at all, from saying &ldquo;or may cause anything to be done&rdquo;.  The words of the regulation are: &ldquo;take such steps as are necessary or desirable for investigating the source of infection, for preventing the spread of infection and for removing conditions favourable to infection&rdquo;.  That is a pretty wide field.  I suppose it is a matter on which lawyers could argue for a long time. The commonsense interpretation of the terms of Section 10 seems to bring it into very close harmony with the provision we are making in this Bill that has been described as being unconstitutional and depriving citizens of rights.</P>
    <P>I have been asked: &ldquo;why should we acquire power to take specimens of blood&rdquo;?  Deputy Dockrell objected very strongly to that.  The Deputy probably knows that if a probable source of infection is detained under Section 29, we are absolutely impotent to determine that he is undoubtedly suffering from a particular disease unless we are free to take a blood specimen and have it examined.  What are we to do?  Are we to take him in and keep him there?  We do not examine him.  We do not apply any scientific tests to confirm the provisional diagnosis.  We keep him there for the rest of his life at the expense of the rating authority.  I do not think that makes sense.  I do not think it is unreasonable to take statutory powers entitling us to take a sample of blood for the purpose of determining whether, in fact, a person is suffering from a particular infectious disease, whether typhus, typhoid or venereal disease or whatever it may be.  I think we require the necessary statutory power to determine the diagnosis, and <Col N="1150" /> to determine whether, in fact, a person should be detained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got some distance in this matter.  I am not impressed by the quotation from the 1929 regulations.  If the Parliamentary Secretary went back further he would find a time when something was considered to be the best treatment against the number of diseases.  We have got away from that.  Have we not got away from it?  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that in 1929 we decided something.  I do not think that the last advance of human wisdom was made in 1929.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy.  What about the constitutionality of the regulations of 1929 as related to the constitutionality of the matter before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any question of constitutionality arises. This is something beyond any constitution. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary has not in view that constitution. That gave certain liberty.  We had that before any constitution was written.  They had that away back at the time signified by the term B.C. There was a clear statement, possibly in documents, from time to time, but it was not from the French Revolution, the American Revolution, the Constitution of 1922 or 1937 that people in this country got their rights.  They had these rights.  If the Constitutions of 1922 or 1937 took any rights away then the Constitutions so developed were bad.  It is not a question of constitutionality.  I am talking of human rights, rights given to people by Christianity.  It is a Christian tradition that people, having a certain destiny, are put beyond animals.  They are not to be subjected to treatment which might be all right for animals. The human race is distinct by the particular destiny held out to it.  It was given certain rights as well as certain liabilities.  But to say that a thing was right in 1929 is not an answer.  It is a complete <i>non sequitur.</i>  Since 1929 we have had the experience of what happened in those countries that have gone in for State worship, countries that have demanded the complete <Col N="1151" /> and absolute control of the individuals in contrast to the community good; we have had the example of what has happened in them and people's minds are much more sharpened to the dangers and their anxieties are very much more keen than they used to be because, in the interim, we have seen how this easy phrase that may be in the 1929 regulations works out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are completely wrong to put in a piece of legislation now.  May I take one test: If the courts get this piece of legislation to interpret and somebody draws their attention to the fact that there were regulations made in 1929, supposing even somebody was able to bring before the court that the 1929 regulations were brought into discussion in this House, the courts will be made at ease, they will say, &ldquo;Then the whole matter was disclosed and argued and even although dangers were propounded to the Dáil Deputies who discussed this matter they said, that is all right, we will take those in our stride.&rdquo;  You cannot just forget history and the courts do not forget history and the courts will be alive to the fact that after certain abuses were revealed on a big historical canvas, notwithstanding this, this particular collection of Deputies decided to give this amazing power to a registered medical practitioner. In 1929, I doubt if the regulations were discussed with the same apprehension of danger that there is now and that does not mean that the Dáil of 1929 was any less devoted to its duty than the present Dáil could be.  It is only by practical experience that one learns the dangers.  We have had a heap of practical experience of the dangers in between and I am not at all swayed by any argument that is founded upon the fact that, before people's eyes were opened to what can be done under these regulations, in the past there was a piece of legislation which gave somebody the power to make regulations of that type.  We are dealing with an entirely different <Col N="1152" /> atmosphere.  We cannot forget history; we cannot call back time; we cannot call back or forget the things that have happened before our eyes and, if the courts come to interpret this afterwards and even look at the date&mdash;1946 &mdash;and all the various trials that are taking place before the eyes of the world and all the excesses that have been revealed and all that has been written about philosophic doctrines, and all the abuses that flow from one phrase&mdash;&ldquo;the complete and absolute control of the individual&rdquo;&mdash;when the good of the community is at stake, then they will say, &ldquo;the Dáil did all this with their eyes open but with warning; they gave these powers and we will say, &lsquo;Very good, if that is the legislative mind of the country, we have nothing to say except to allow the registered medical practitioner to have his say, to give his certificate, and we will apply the law.&rsquo;&rdquo;  So that, I am not concerned whatever with regard to the 1929 regulations.  If I was asked now to pass the 1929 regulations I think I could bring a volume of argument, derived from immediate experience, revealing dangers in the 1929 regulations which may not have been thought of by anybody when that piece of legislation was passed.</P>
      <P>I take much more anxiety from a phrase the Parliamentary Secretary used.  He said: &ldquo;We do not regard immunisation as treatment&rdquo;.  That is to say, the minds behind this piece of legislation do not regard immunisation as treatment.  Do they regard operation as treatment?  Is there anything in the legislation that says they do not regard operation as treatment?</P>

I do not think this Dáil wants to give any registered medical practitioner the power to impose an operation on a patient against that patient's consent, and I do not care whether the operation is called precautionary or not.  May I take the minor thing&mdash;the taking of blood specimens? What is the necessity for saying that that ought to be done?  The Parliamentary Secretary's defence of that is: &ldquo;We must know whether the patient is suffering from a particular infectious disease before we make up our minds to release him&rdquo;, but until the registered medical practitioner does make up his mind, has not he power still to isolate and detail the person?  Has not he?</P>

      <P>I object to this section altogether, but I am taking the section as it stands.  It starts off with:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the chief medical officer is of opinion that a certain person is a probable source of infection&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is all he has to do.  He has to have an opinion.  From that minute the person is detained and isolated until such time as he gets it clear that it is a wrong opinion.  If that is the case, is not the authority and the control and the power always with the detaining authority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without using force, he can get his view in the end by the persuasion of detention put upon the man who is detained.  Surely that is big enough power.  Certainly, there is no reason based upon anxiety for the public health that should make the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary ask for an enforcing authority because he keeps the man there until he is satisfied and the only appeal is to the Minister.  The Minister can easily say: &ldquo;There is an easy proposition&mdash;a prick of the needle and you are out if the result is satisfactory.&rdquo; I object even in that small matter.  With regard to inoculation or immunisation we advance a step. There is a number of inoculations or schemes of inoculation which certain <Col N="1156" /> people favour and which certain other people of scientific advancement and attainment do not favour.  What we are up against here is that the registered medical practitioner is to be the authority.  He may desire to enforce a particular type of immunisation or inoculation upon a patient. Why should he be given power to do that?  Supposing that patient has a medical practitioner of his own who disagrees with the immunisation theory or the immunisation treatment that is going to be given to the patient, why should the registered medical practitioner's treatment be enforced upon him?  I do not think it should be.  I think we surely ought to have something in this which would enable an opposition viewpoint to be put forward&mdash;I mean a medical viewpoint of an opposition type and another type of inoculation or immunisation suggested.  But once this measure leaves this House, it is the registered medical practitioner who has charge of the patient, it will not be his own medical practitioner, and he will say: &ldquo;I think you are a source of infection and that you ought to subject yourself to a particular immunisation scheme, and I am going to inflict it on you whether you like it or not, and whether or not your doctor advises that it is dangerous.&rdquo; I do not think that is right.  Whatever may be said in connection with the making of a blood test, there is nothing to be said for enforcing against another doctor's view, or against the patient's view, which he founds upon his own medical practitioner's advice, some type of inoculation to which he objects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Custom House has sent around circulars to medical officers in the country telling them that they are to impose a particular type of immunisation in respect of certain diseases, or possibly in respect of a certain disease.  I know that quite a body of medical opinion is against the particular inoculation suggested and believe it to be wrong, believe it, in fact, to be bad for health, and yet that is being enforced.  We are giving power in this to officers of the Department to make up their minds <Col N="1157" /> as to what particular treatment will be given and to enforce it.  I do not think that is right.  I think we ought to have sufficient respect for the ordinary person's dignity not to subject him to medical treatment to which he objects, particularly if he objects to it on good medical grounds.</P>
    <P>That leaves out of consideration so far this matter of operation.  I still think, and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to believe I am sincere in saying, that amendment No. 122 does not meet the difficulty from the court point of view.  Supposing what I call an operation, that is to say the cutting open of a person and the removal of some organ or part of an organ which is diseased, is proposed by a registered medical authority and he says: &ldquo;It is, in my opinion, expedient to prevent the spread of infection of a certain type from the patient&rdquo;, under paragraph (h) of sub-section (2) that is the last word in the matter.  You do not go on to paragraph (k) and (j). It is only if the medical practitioner agrees that it is something which is described as surgical treatment that the patient's desire is sought and the practitioner is to refrain from imposing treatment upon him unless he agrees to it.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary, with his better experience of medical matters, can easily see the conditions in which what is called surgical treatment can be expressed to be a precautionary measure against infection.  If there is a situation in which an operation is proposed, does he want to have it that it may be surgical treatment or it may be a precaution, but that in that event the registered medical authority who says that it will be a necessary precautionary measure shall have his will?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even admitting paragraph (j) into this piece of legislation, the matter is not clear.  The courts will find something called a precaution entirely under the authority of the registered medical practitioner and they will find something called treatment which is supposed not to take place until a patient agrees to it.  But <Col N="1158" /> if the matter may be one or the other, or may be classified as both, the court is entitled to say they must consider that the Legislative Assembly has its own point of view, its own standards, and its own methods of finding out what is right and wrong, and that they passed that section which gives the registered medical authority complete and entire control as long as precaution is taken.</P>
      <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at what happened under the Emergency Powers Act.  The Title of that Act was a copy of the words of the Constitution, Article 28,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where necessary for the preservation of the State in time of war&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Act was passed with that Preamble. Emergency Powers Orders were made, sometimes repeating that Preamble.  The main one repeated it, but others simply referred to that main one.  The attitude of the courts was that, once that phrase was used, they could not say whether whatever was proposed to be done was in fact required for the preservation of the State.  It went to the point in this country in the last five or six years that we had an emergency Order enabling, I think it was, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church to be regulated in a particular way. That was done under an Emergency Powers Order which recited that it was necessary for the preservation of the State.  Of course, the court's attitude would be that it was ludicrous and had nothing to do with the preservation of the State, but the State said it had, and that finished it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here you have this provision: &ldquo;If, in his opinion, the thing is necessary and expedient&rdquo;.  So far as I know, that only requires a certificate from a registered medical authority that it is, in his opinion, necessary and expedient that a particular operation shall be performed as being necessary to prevent the spread of infection from a particular patient.  Once that is given, the operation can be done.  I do not think we want that.  I gather from the views of the Parliamentary Secretary and others that nobody wants it, but that is possible under the measure.  I <Col N="1159" /> am only asking to have that doubt cleared up and that possibility entirely and completely removed.  I personally object to the immunisation matter being there, with possible compulsory enforcement.  I might even argue against the taking of blood specimens. That is a smaller matter.  But, so far as this means that something can be enforced upon the human person against that person's desire, I think, on principle, it ought to be objected to.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Deputy McGilligan, but I do not intend to follow him into all his arguments.  He made a point about a person who is ill and who might be a probable source of infection.  Nobody wants to see any person taken away. On the other hand, a healthy person also has his rights.  If we were to accept all that Deputy McGilligan said, we would not detain anybody who was a probable source of infection, but just say to him: &ldquo;If you do not want to submit to treatment, you need not be asked to do it.&rdquo;  I feel that every healthy person in this country has his rights.  Something must be done to protect him from infection, if an infected person is living in the community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with crime during my statement.  The Estimates show an increase in each of the Votes, varying from an increase of £140,000 in the case of the Estimate for the Gárda Síochána to an increase of a little over £100 in the case of the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests. There is one factor common to all these increases&mdash;the increase in remuneration which came into operation on 1st January last when the emergency bonus was raised from 11/- a week to 15/- a week, and was extended to the <Col N="1161" /> more highly paid classes of civil servants and to the higher ranks of the Gárda Síochána.  Thus, in the case of the Gárda Síochána, the comparatively few high officers who had not until then received any emergency bonus received an addition of 15/- a week and the great majority who had been getting 11/- a week received 15/- a week. In the case of the Gárda Síochána, this means an increase averaging rather more than £10 a year for each of about 7,500 individuals&mdash;a total increase of £75,000 for a full year.</P>
      <P>The remaining items of increase may be summarised as follows: (a) renewal of uniforms, an increase of £30,000&mdash;it was pointed out last year that the general condition of uniforms deteriorated during the past six years, it being impossible to issue renewals as frequently as was desirable; (b) replacement of transport, an increase of £25,000&mdash;the same applies here; replacement of transport had to be deferred during the emergency; (c) rent allowance, an increase of £5,700; (d) locomotion expenses, an increase of £4,000&mdash;travelling by officers on inspection duty will increase as more petrol becomes available; (e) barrack maintenance, an increase of £4,300&mdash;outside the Dublin Metropolitan Division the public rooms in all Gárda stations were until last year cleaned at the expense of the station parties; they are now being cleaned at the State expense.  A number of additional inspectors and station sergeants have also been appointed under the powers conferred by the Act passed last year for that purpose.  On the other hand, there has been a decrease of £25,800 due to the disbandment of the Local Security Force.  There is also a fall of £5,300 in the amount provided for compensation. Last year abnormal provision was necessary under this head to provide for additional compensation under the Gárda Síochána (Compensation) Act, 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I gave the House some figures relating to crime for the year 1944, and I shall now give the corresponding figures for 1945.  I should explain that they are provisional figures furnished in an interim report prepared by the Gárda Síochána and <Col N="1162" /> they are, accordingly, subject to correction when the final report on crime for the year is prepared.  The figures which I gave last year for 1944 were, similarly, provisional figures and the figures which I now give for that year are the final figures and these, naturally, vary somewhat from the provisional figures.</P>
    <P>The total number of indictable offences reported to the police in 1945 was 16,940, representing an increase of 1,077 over the figure for 1944.  For convenient reference, and in order that they may be on record, I will give the figures for indictable crime for each year since 1939.  They are:&mdash; 1939, 8,202; 1940, 9,014; 1941, 13,180; 1942, 17,213; 1943, 17,305; 1944, 15,863; 1945, 16,940.  The figures for 1945 are somewhat less than those for 1942 and 1943, but, I regret to have to say, show an increase of about 1,000 over the 1944 figures.</P>
    <P>Again, for purposes of record, I give a table classifying the indictable offences reported to the police during 1945 and I give the corresponding figures for the years 1939 and 1944:&mdash;</P>

      <P>We do not intend to bring it back at all.  In one aspect of the crime situation, which has been very troublesome, viz., housebreaking and burglary in the Dublin district, there are welcome signs of an improvement, notwithstanding an article I saw in the paper the other day.  I made special inquiries on that point.  The figures for the first three months of the present year are 263.  Apparently the dark months are the worst for that particular type of crime.  The corresponding figures in recent years were: for the first three months of 1945, 340; for 1944, 360; for 1943, 388.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that figure here now, but will try to give it later.  If the Deputy had given me any idea that he wanted it, I would have had it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to Vote 34&mdash;Prisons &mdash;in which there is a net increase of £7,406 as compared with last year's Estimate.  The two largest items contributing to this increase are £3,852 in the sub-head for the pay and allowances of staff and £1,110 in the cost of victualling.  As regards the pay and allowances of staff, there is no increase in personnel and the increased provision under this sub-head is due to additional charges by way of annual increments and the increase in the rate of emergency bonus.  Provision is made for an estimated daily average of 780 <Col N="1165" /> prisoners as compared with 730 provided for last year.  Since last September there has been a tendency for the number of prisoners in custody to increase, the number at present being about 70 higher than in February, 1945. The increase of £1,110 in the sub-head for victualling is due to the provision being made for a larger number of prisoners.</P>
    <P>As regards the courts, the question of the employment of temporary district justices was raised last year.  I agree&mdash;everybody agrees&mdash;that the employment of temporary justices is in general undesirable, but there are two instances in which it is unavoidable and in which the statute expressly provides for it as a proper procedure, viz., a temporary increase in the work and an unusually heavy incidence of illness amongst the ordinary justices. The main difficulty has been that, throughout the emergency, the three assistant justices who were originally earmarked to provide a service of reliefs for country justices who might be absent on vacation or through illness, have been pinned down in Dublin to relieve the pressure in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, and, in addition, two, and sometimes three, additional temporary justices have been necessary in Dublin, making a total of eight, and sometimes nine, justices assigned to the Dublin court. In addition, throughout the past year three of the permanent justices have been absent at the same time for long periods through illness, with the result that it has been found necessary to provide three reliefs for their districts alone, in addition to making provision for vacations in the other districts.  So far as our difficulties are due to an abnormal amount of illness, I see no alternative to the employment of temporary justices.  So far, however, as the difficulty arises from the pressure in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, the position is different.  Here our problem is to determine to what extent the present pressure is likely to continue. At the moment there are only three justices permanently assigned to the Dublin court, though for some years no less than eight, and sometimes nine, justices have been needed to keep <Col N="1166" /> abreast of the work.  All things considered, I have come to the conclusion that we must resign ourselves to the fact that we shall have to provide at least six justices in Dublin permanently. I have been authorised to proceed with the preparation of the requisite legislation to enable the number of permanent justices to be increased accordingly.</P>
    <P>These are all the points with which I think it necessary to detain the House at the moment.  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I shall do the best I can to deal with any other point that may be raised by Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The brief statement which the Minister has given us shows the shocking condition of things.  I remember that a couple of years ago he expressed himself as being happy that he had stabilised crime and I pointed out then that, if he had, he had stabilised it at about 100 per cent. advance on pre-war years.  That, I suppose, would be more or less his boast to-day.  I take it that the pre-war figure which he has given us would be an acceptable standard to him and it showed indictable crime in 1939 at 8,000 cases.  Are these cases, or are they matters reported to the police whether anybody is brought to justice or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They are cases reported to the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then they are all good for the purpose of comparison. We have a figure of 8,000 odd for 1939, 9,014 for 1940; then a sudden swoop to 13,000 within two years, and then 17,000 and 17,000.  We are down now to 16,900, a little below 17,000, but still more than double the 1939 figure.  We are worse than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather remarkable that when you come to offences against the <Col N="1167" /> person they do not show that doubling up.  The figure has gone only from 439 to 657, taking 1939 as compared with 1945.  The offences against property have almost doubled, making a jump from 1,400 to 2,700.  In regard to offences against property without violence, the figure has gone up from 6,000 to 13,000, so there is pretty nearly a doubling again.  When we come to the non-indictable matters we find 152,867 cases reported.  I did not get the 1939 comparison, but the figure is 24,000 up on last year.  I do not suppose there is any greater standard used by the Guards.  That means that we have, even in the non-indictable offences, an amazing jump, from last year to this, of 24,000 reports.  I agree that quite a number of these things should not be counted.  In so far as the Minister put down this matter of boys playing footfall in the streets, I think that should be regarded as something that the Minister could pass on to his colleagues and say: &ldquo;That is a crime of yours, not of these lads.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These come through the reports from the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister ever been in court when half a dozen of those boys are brought up for kicking football in streets where there is not a window within the power of the youngsters to kick the ball through&mdash; in streets where there is no real traffic, no danger to property or to the young gentlemen themselves?  These young fellows are paraded in court and fined 2/6 or 5/- &mdash;and that is a non-indictable offence.  In this matter I think the police might be given some other instructions and asked not to get those young people familiar with the courts, under the guise of being even potential criminals, by being brought up for kicking a ball about a street where there is no possibility of property being injured and where there is no traffic.  I agree that one has to protect panes of glass, but I have been present in court, knowing the areas concerned, when young people were paraded, and it really looked as if the police had nothing else to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> Of course, that could be quickly dispelled when one sees the list of real crime.  There is an amazing increase in crime.  Has the Minister given any thought to this matter other than looking mournfully at the statistics and reciting them in a lugubrious fashion in the House?  What is the cause of this crime?  Has the Minister any views in that connection?  Is it that people are getting more out of hand, or is it that more things have slipped over the region into the criminal sphere and out of the civil sphere of activity and, therefore, we might expect an increase in the normal way; or is it a development of evil in our midst?  Can the Minister segregate, in connection with indictable matters, anything which depended on the emergency?  Could we segregate from those so that we might see what, of the normal increase in the number of offences, we may look to see an improvement in once the emergency has gone, and the emergency Acts, and the particular crimes that have been prevented under them, have disappeared?</P>
    <P>It is a serious situation.  It has been the subject of comment by any number of judges who have presided at criminal sessions.  It has been definitely the heartbreak of the judges who have had to spend so much of their time in criminal courts.  I saw a statement from a judge recently.  He said that they felt that they had at least caught up on the arrears of criminal cases.  They did it with the assistance of three extra judicial persons in the city.  They had to get that assistance in order to get rid of arrears in one section of the courts. I am not sure that the position is as cleared as that judge said it was. There is an amazing increase in crime, and there has been no explanation offered to enable Deputies to discuss the matter and see whether there is any help they could give, by suggestion or otherwise, with the view of reducing this amazing and disturbing increase.  I suggest there is too much attention being paid to the mere apprehending of criminals and getting them sentenced and put away and far too little attention to the betterment of life which might ease the situation <Col N="1169" /> and bring about conditions which might not attract so many people into the paths of criminality if they could get themselves satisfied by innocent activities.</P>
    <P>As regards offences against the person, although the increase has not shown the 100 per cent. addition that crimes in general have shown, the figure is still a very significant one. I suppose that and offences against property accompanied by violence are the two matters that the Minister's attention might be focused on in order to see if there could be some improvement brought about.</P>
    <P>Could we get one other statistic in this debate?  People in this country are getting more and more annoyed and disturbed at the use made of what are called the special criminal courts. It was well understood, when those courts were set up, that they were expressed to be at the time for the purpose of dealing with one special type of crime and with that only.  They were set up as an aid to the civil courts.  It was recognised that the civil courts, in cases where there was violence, were rather defenceless.  No person connected with the judicial bench likes to think of himself, when he is walking around the streets or staying at home or taking his leisure in any way, that he has to be under guard.  It was always understood, it was the point of view in respect of the judges&mdash;not that anything was expressed, but it was an understanding here&mdash;that the judges ought to be saved from that particular type of thing.  Hence it was always believed that the special court, composed as it is of military people, was the proper way of dealing with crimes in which there was any element of violence, threatened or actual, and as long as the special court was used for that particular type of crime, violence, either threatened or actual, against judges, court officers, jurymen or others, as long as anything in the nature of violence, threatened or used, was concerned, then there was a legitimate resort to those extraordinary courts.</P>
    <P>But we should remember that these special courts are a complete denial of <Col N="1170" /> the citizen's rights under the Constitution. Under the Constitution, save in minor offences, every citizen brought for trial on a criminal charge is supposed to have the advantage of a judge, aided by a jury, and there is a special purpose in the jury.  It is to put a brake on the judicial point of view and to have that element of the ordinary man's common sense brought to bear upon judicial investigations&mdash; an element not present when the judge sits alone.  It has always been regarded as a great safeguard.  It is a point on which the judicial bench would be unanimous, that the jury was a great safeguard, particularly in connection with crime.  As long as you have special courts and as long as it is possible to bring men for any type of crime before special courts there is the certainty of doing away with trial by jury.</P>
    <P>It is quite definitely recognised under the Constitution that the special courts are not to be presided over by persons of judicial standing as ordinarily understood here.  The ordinary view taken is that you provide for a better type of adjudication if you have a judge appointed under special conditions, who is guaranteed his independence and who may not be swayed at any time by reason of his emoluments or by bringing his judicial career to a close.  You put people in a position in which they should be, and are expected to be, independent and always have been independent.  On the other hand, when you come to the special courts you have it clearly recognised in the Constitution that these special courts need not be presided over by judges appointed under the Constitution.  That being the case, when one looks at the Offences Against the State Act, under which these courts are set up, one finds that the Government have these people entirely under their power&mdash;I do not say they exercise that power. They may appoint men to courts and dismiss them after a certain action, giving them whatever emoluments they like and putting the emoluments up or down in any way they like, and the public could not be expected to have the same confidence with regard to the independence, the guaranteed independence, <Col N="1171" /> of these tribunals as they have with regard to the ordinary courts. There is public disquiet over this, that in recent years there has been a very definite practice of sending people before special criminal courts in cases in which there is not the slightest hint of violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister brought in Orders in connection with certain matters before the House.  I want to speak in connection with the salaries of people who come under this Vote.  The Minister stated that the main increase in the Vote was caused by increased emoluments.  On looking at the Gárda Síochána Vote there is a bulk sum of £2,107,000 for salaries and wages.  The increase is less than £100,000 on a Vote of over £2,000,000.  I say that the increase is not sufficient.  I say that right through the Vote, no matter where it may be, in connection with officers attached to the various courts, and the whole Gárda body, it is ludicrous at this stage in the economic condition in which we have got into in this country, to ask this House to vote an increase of merely £100,000 on salaries and wages of a force of over 7,000 men, as far as Guards are concerned, and about 100 people by way of officers and other staff.  That amount represents a very small average increase for these people.  It must be remembered that we are paying people with pounds that have now a purchasing power of something like a half guinea or 12/-.  I think it is ludicrous to contend that that is giving them anything like the emoluments they deserve, when the amount of the subheads of the Vote has increased from £2,416,282 to £2,557,770.  It is not an adequate return to these people for the <Col N="1173" /> services they render, taking into account the purchasing power that £2,000,000 would give now, compared with 1939, irrespective of any comparison with 1932 or 1936.  The situation now is that the purchasing power of £2,000,000 is something slightly over £1,000,000.  We are asking these people and other sections of the community that are salaried to bear that inordinate share of inflation which the Government has allowed to develop.  I consider that comment a proper one to make in regard to every sub-head that occurs in the Votes over which the Minister has control. It would apply also to the Supreme Court and High Court judges and right down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it is not a Vote for which the Minister is responsible, it is ludicrous to expect that judges could comport themselves on present salaries when we look at what the old purchasing power of salaries was.  We are getting into a position now when it is quite clear that it will be difficult to get the lower courts manned, if the salaries are not increased.  They should be increased to an amount adequate to the decreased purchasing value of money.  There is one special scandal in connection with the court system. As far as the ordinary people in the country are concerned I think the courts which do the main work, certainly in Dublin, are the District and Circuit Courts.  The views of the majority of people in Ireland would be that the Dublin District and Circuit Courts represent justice.  Very few of the people in them move into the High Courts or the Supreme Courts.  Taking the number of cases brought before the courts, justice is administered through the District Courts in Dublin and in the country.  It is administered by two Dublin Circuit Courts presided over by Dublin judges.  It is my experience that cases taken in the District Courts are attended by people from the Chief State Solicitor's office, whose salaries are borne on one of these Votes.  They are the people who make justice, as far as the criminal courts are concerned, for the vast bulk of the population of Ireland, and certainly for the bulk of the population <Col N="1174" /> of Dublin.  They are nearly all qualified solicitors who appear in these courts.  One looks with amazement on the work they do.  It you go into the District Court you find one of these officials from the Chief State Solicitor's office with an attaché case full of files in connection with such cases. They are not merely there at the early stages when the justice will be asked if the cases are to be sent on for trial or not.  It is amazing to see these highly skilled professional men there with attaché cases full of files.  How it is expected that they get through the work that they have to do in amazingly difficult cases is more than I understand. When one looks back at the salaries paid to these people, and realises that the foundation of justice on the criminal side depends on them, one begins to appreciate how great the scandal is.  These people, I understand, are being paid clerks' wages, not the wages of professional people at all.</P>

I am taking these apart altogether from the general remarks I have made about the inadequacy of the salaries having regard to the decreased purchasing power of the moneys.  I take them as special cases. I say if there is going to be any justice or fair play done to these people then their salaries in particular should get <Col N="1175" /> a very substantial increase.  With regard to what the Minister has said about the District Court, that he has now become conscious of the fact that there must be legislation to enable an increase in the permanent staff in the District Courts of the district justices in Dublin, of course, it has been notorious to anybody taking even a sidelook at a District Court that they have been completely understaffed for years past.  The excuse has always been the same as the Minister gave to-day, that he could not deal as on a permanent basis with something which might have been called for by a temporary increase in work.  In that connection, does the Minister expect that what is presented as an abnormal situation with regard to crime is going to better itself and is it going to better itself soon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the hope, but surely the Minister must take into consideration that the population of this area has very vastly increased, and when the Minister is thinking in terms of crime&mdash;and the statistics he gave to-day refer only to crime&mdash;surely he must realise that in the past six or seven years when you had this big increase of crime there was an almost complete absence of another type of work which the District Courts ordinarily do.  For five or six years the District Courts have had very little to do in connection with prosecutions or activities of any type arising out of motor vehicles on the roads.  Their work in that respect has been almost in abeyance.  Certainly one justice can do what would require three or four working as they used to, dividing so many days to each, in the years prior to 1939.  That is coming back now.  If the Minister had been in the District Court on a recent occasion and seen the number of people paraded there for criminal offences in connection with parking, he would have seen the tremendous upsurge there is in that type of work.  We are getting nearer to the stage when accidents are again going to happen and when people are <Col N="1176" /> going to be paraded before the District Court for various matters arising out of the Road Traffic Act and on the preliminary stages of prosecutions which may go along more serious lines than offences against the Road Traffic Act. That is going to be definitely on the increase.  If the Minister weighs these in the balance, he will certainly find that they will off-set to a considerable degree what he may hope for in the way of a decrease in criminal proceedings. In any event, I think he will find that, so far from its being possible to regard what is happening in the District Courts as temporary increase in work, he is faced with a situation in which the work of the District Courts is going to remain, whether it will be divided, as it is now, in the special proportions between crime of the indictable type and other activities or whether it is divided more between the civil work or the offences under the Road Traffic Act or the indictable offence matters.  He is going to find that there is no hope that the bulked work is going to lessen to any degree whatever from the point it has reached in the last five or six years.  In that connection, I felt very glad to hear his announcement that he is going to take steps to increase the number of district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not go back into ancient history but one of the matters that the Minister himself was very vocal about years ago was this business of temporary justices.  The Minister was very loud in his denunciations of that and said that it, of course, gave the authorities a control which was not a desirable element, over justices who were of a temporary type and that that should be done away with as quickly as possible.  I hope he is going to do away with it completely.  There may be some necessity to have some one or two people floating around to enable vacations to be taken but in that particular situation the one or two individuals who happen to be interlocked into that can easily be segregated. Apart from that, I hope the Minister will make his way clear to the appointment of fully established district justices and I hope when that matter is being attended to the length <Col N="1177" /> of service of some of them will be very specially attended to, that there will not be any more of this matter of appointing people with very junior service over the heads of people who have established themselves as good district justices by their experience over very many years and by their record over very many years.</P>
    <P>In a recent debate Deputy Costello and I had a motion down to refer back an Emergency Powers Order which made the courts take judicial note of certain Emergency Powers Orders.  In that connection I referred to what I called the disturbing feature that prosecutions were apparently becoming more inefficient than they had been and in that connection I was rather surprised to receive a highly impudent letter from the Attorney-General commenting upon what I said in the House.</P>

      <P>I am coming back to the point that the Minister did say that if that Order had not been passed, a considerable number of people who had been jailed would have had to be released.  I think he used the phrase, &ldquo;the whole scheme&rdquo;.  The Minister said that there would be chaos with regard to people who had been jailed under Emergency Powers Orders.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

If the situation is such that the Minister's words are applicable to the situation or reasonably applicable to the situation, that if that Order had not been passed, the resulting situation was one of chaos, I take that as complete justification for any remarks I made about inefficiency in prosecutions.  If the Minister would like me to go into it any further, I can get the same statistics from him as another Deputy got here recently with regard to the expenses that had been incurred in connection with prosecutions.</P>

A calculation was asked for&mdash;and I think it was the Minister who gave the figures&mdash;as to the cost imposed upon the State by reason of these ineffective prosecutions. I can, as I say, raise this on another Estimate but I think I should raise this matter of an intervention of an individual of that type in opposition to a Deputy's constitutional rights in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In connection with that whole matter I would propose to have the House understand that it is a view that I hold to very strongly that there has been very definite inefficiency in connection with those matters.  I do not know whether the Minister thinks that the Guards are in any way involved.  I do not.  I think that they have been acting entirely under the advice of certain people who were put to advise them in connection with the way prosecutions are brought but, if it should happen that a case showed that something had been done wrongly or incorrectly by a Gárda or by a superior officer of the Guards or any of the detective officials, then I think I would be entitled to question that here and to use the same sort of terminology with regard to those people.  I do not think it is open to anybody holding an appointment depending on the will and pleasure of the Government to try to intervene with criticism of that type <Col N="1180" /> upon a Deputy, speaking as I did on that particular matter.</P>
      <P>The matter that I have spoken of in connection with the increase to be given to those connected with the courts in this country is one which I will have to raise on another Vote.  I ask the Minister to take any of these Votes.  Let him take the bulk Vote for the Gárda Síochána.  Does the Minister think it is right that he should continue to pay the Guards in the depreciated currency he is handing out to them at present?  I have often used this particular example before.  I use it again as one way of putting the matter.  Supposing that in 1940, it had been suggested to the Minister that he should come to this House with, say, a Vote for the Gárda Síochána cut down by one-half.  I wonder would he have accepted the situation?  Would he have got his own Party to back that Vote boldly indicating that the Guards' pay was to be cut by one-half?  If he would have hesitated to bring in such a Vote, and I think he would, how comes he to be so complacent about this very same thing happening in another form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will admit that, on the statistical information given to this House recently, the purchasing power of the £ has been very sharply decreased since 1939.  How can he think that it is fair to pay the Guards nominally in pounds, but, in fact, only in half sovereigns and expect them to carry on the lives they have been accustomed to live when their pay has been reduced by one-half?  The Minister may wave this aside and say that is not his business, that he is not responsible.  He is.  He is certainly responsible for trying to see that the effects of the inflation which has occurred will not bear heavily upon people who are asked to perform very onerous duties in the State.  I ask the Minister to answer, if he has any answer to give, as to why he now thinks it right to pay people in half sovereigns when they used to be paid in pounds.  The Minister cannot say that there is not enough money to go around.  One of the things we have seen from that piece of statistical information is that <Col N="1181" /> one of the reasons why money has gone down in value is because there is too much of it going round.  We have been told that the wealth of the country has increased by about £120,000,000, but that that is a mere monetary phenomenon.  It is because there is such an increase that what one buys with the £ has so seriously changed. The Minister knows well, if he has given any study to these matters, that if the £250,000,000 which is in circulation in the country was redistributed it would not increase any inflationary tendency there is.  Merely redistributing the amount of money in circulation can have no effect in increasing prices.  The difficulty that occurs is that prices have increased, that it is easy for some people who have got more than their share of the increased money in circulation to bear the increased prices, because they have got more money with which to do it. But people like the Guards are the people who suffer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for 7,000 men who are now being reduced to half pay.  I want to know how he justifies that.  Let the Minister not try to get away with the argument that he cannot increase the money because it means bringing in a new wave of inflation into the country.  It does not.  As long as the amount of money in circulation is kept at the stable point it has now reached, we do not increase prices any more.  The Minister is asking people to bear the impact of these increased prices with the same amount of money they used to get.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take any class of people in the Civil Service, say, the clerks in the District Courts, or any other class, and justify in relation to any one of them putting them on half pay, because that is what is being done.  How does the Minister expect that people are going to be able to give the same services that they used to give when they had not the same worries and when they had a particular type of salary, now that their salary is reduced?  How does he expect to get the same service from them?  How does he expect them to cope with the vast increase of crime? <Col N="1182" /> If the Minister looks into this matter, I suggest that he will find that the two things go together; that one of the reasons for the increase in crime is that so many people have been depressed by the subsistence policy which the Minister and his colleagues have allowed to come into operation. The Minister possibly shirks the reason for that increase in crime because he knows that it would lead to condemnation of the particular monetary policy which has brought that about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding this question of crime, I should like to know from the Minister whether he is satisfied that the encroachment from other Departments upon the duties of the Gárda is not in some degree responsible for the increase of crime. Undoubtedly, the emergency period would naturally lead us to expect an increase in crime, particularly in offences relating to black-marketeering, Emergency Powers Act offences, and all that kind of thing.  But, year after year, measures are introduced into this House&mdash;at the present time we are discussing a very vast measure, the Public Health Bill&mdash;and in every one of these measures new duties are being imposed on the Gárda Síochána.  Under the Public Health Bill they will be constituted into some sort of medical constabulary.  Whether or not a section of the Gárda will have to be specially trained for these new duties, I cannot say.  But there is one thing clear to my mind, that every time a Bill is introduced imposing extra police duties on the Gárda Síochána, to that extent they cease to be an effective force for the prevention of crime and, subsequently, for the detection of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I venture to make a safe bet that if a Deputy goes into the average rural station or, for that matter, the average city station, he will find the services of the personnel there are dissipated on multifarious duties which have no bearing on police work.  The beats in Dublin have been so stripped of men that the Minister had to increase the strength of the force in Dublin.  The reason for that was that the Metropolitan <Col N="1183" /> Division was permanently placed upon special post duty.  I want to harp on this because I believe it has a very definite effect on crime and because I believe it is entirely wrong. Under this Public Health Bill the Gárda will have to become medical constabulary.  Under the School Attendance Act they have to enforce school attendance.  They have to collect agricultural statistics.  They have to revise the franchise.  They have to look after unemployment assistance.  I have seen something between 400 and 600 men lined up at a Gárda station in Donegal waiting to have their unemployment cards dealt with, with the entire staff of the Gárda station doing nothing else.</P>
    <P>That is one aspect of police administration which we will have to face up to.  I believe that we are loading the Gárda too heavily with duties which have no bearing upon police work and that, to the extent we are overloading the Gárda, we are rendering them an ineffective force for the prevention of crime.  A police force is primarily for the prevention of crime and we have increases in crime to-day and have had these increases right back to 1939 which are not in any sense due to emergency conditions, but, to my mind, to the fact that the police are not there to prevent these offences. The police were definitely not there and I do not believe they are now in Dublin to man the beats to prevent burglars and housebreakers from operating. They are not there in the country to deal with offences against property with which they should be dealing.  They are exhausted in doing duties for other Departments.  I cannot emphasise this matter too much, and I believe it has a definite bearing on our crime position.  The sooner the Minister makes up his mind to resist any further encroachment upon the Gárda organisation for duties of this kind, the sooner we will have a better crime situation and a more effective police force.</P>
    <P>Another point which I believe is affecting our situation in the matter of crime and the police situation generally &mdash;it may be due to the emergency&mdash;is <Col N="1184" /> that there is a definite falling off in supervision from the top.  The explanation for that up to now has been that the transport was not available during the emergency.  Headquarters inspections are not effective and are not sufficient, and while that, as I have said, may be due to emergency conditions, I think it is now essential that these inspections should be resumed and that, as a beginning, they should take the form of surprise inspections.  The informed inspection has its uses and its good results, but the surprise inspection has definitely better results.</P>
    <P>Not only has there been a dropping off in supervision from the top, but district officers and divisional officers were released from their regular inspections of their districts and divisions, and the sooner they are restored to the normal routine of monthly and quarterly inspections the better, because Deputies on many sides have received complaints as to a certain amount of slackness in various districts. I think it is essential that these inspections be restored to the full, in order that whatever slackness may have grown up during the emergency will be effectively dealt with.  I say again that if there is a certain amount of slackness in police work proper, it is again due to the extraordinary position we have in which the policeman is a policeman for perhaps one hour and for the other 23 hours is working for other Departments of the State.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the position of the Gárda Síochána in the matter of salaries is to be improved, as Deputy McGilligan has suggested, unless there is a definite change of system.  At the moment, the police force is costing us as much as we can afford and if we are to give these better conditions the system will have to be changed.  We all agree they should get them; we all agree that the police officer above every other class of servant should be put above the level of corruption or bribery, and given a salary which will not only render him independent in the community in which he moves of the people with whom he has to deal in the enforcement of the law but to give him a certain social status.  On his <Col N="1185" /> present pay, he cannot attempt to meet his expenses.  His pay is inadequate. The average Guard has roughly the equivalent of a pre-war wage of £2 and how he is to preserve his integrity and independence on £2 per week, I leave to the Minister and his advisers to conceive.  I cannot see how a married man with a family can carry on in present conditions.  At the same time, expenditure on the police has gone from something like £1,820,000 in 1939 to an estimated figure this year of £2,557,000, an increase of £737,000 odd.</P>
    <P>These are stubborn facts to face.  I said last year on the Estimate that we would have to face up sooner or later to reorganising our police force to suit peculiarly Irish conditions.  The present system, as I have said before, is based on the old R.I.C. system, which was a military and political establishment, and some features of that organisation still remain.  We have still retained the old barrack orderly system which they adopted and which was primarily intended for the safe custody of arms, and so on.  There is none of that in the rural parts of Britain, Scotland, Wales or the Isle of man.  I have suggested before that the Minister would be well advised to select a group of his most efficient officers to go across and study how, in populations of 30,000 and 40,000, a small body of men can manage where we cannot manage with perhaps five and ten times that body of men.</P>
    <P>One can go into the large towns and villages in these places and find that the community is looked after by the village constable and his wife.  The station is his residence, his office and his bridewell all in one and one man does the job.  We cannot do that under a personnel of one and three, a sergeant and three men.  I should like to know how they manage to do it over there and how efficiently they do it, whether the community is more law-abiding there than here and whether they are not able to get after all reported offences just as efficiently as we do.  If a change of system is adopted here, it will be possible to give officers and men better conditions and we could work within a reasonable <Col N="1186" /> figure for police.  I consider a sum of over £2,500,000 at the moment an excessive figure for this small country for police.  When the figure was something like £1,000,000, or a little over, the people on the opposite benches thought the country was being beggared and starved because of the excessive police service it was getting. Now there is no check whatever on the expenditure.</P>
    <P>Every Estimate in the Minister's charge shows an increase.  Not only that, but the increase over the 1939 figure amounts to £923,912 and if one takes each Estimate in turn and examines it year by year, one will find that every Estimate without exception shows an increase.  There may be a perfect explanation for it. Undoubtedy, increments and bonuses are responsible for a good deal of the increase, and I am not suggesting that the strength of the force has not been increased, but that is the situation. We have jumped by £1,000,000 since 1939 and I think it is time we called a halt to this extraordinary expenditure.</P>
    <P>I notice in this year's Estimate that there is a proposal to spend £25,000 or £30,000 on new transport.  I would like to be satisfied that that transport is to be provided for police purposes, and does not comprise post-war models for the Ministers.  If transport is needed for police work, by all means let them have it.  In these Estimates, we are providing about £25,000 extra for new transport.  It may be that new cars were not bought during the emergency and that they are needed now.  However, the Gárda Vote is saddled with that, and every Minister is riding round in a Gárda car driven by a Gárda driver, and some of them are protected by members of the Gárdaí.  I do not think it is fair that the Gárda Vote should be saddled with that extraordinary procedure year after year.  This matter may have been decided before my time in this House and by the Public Accounts Committee, but where they are rendering service to another Department, the Gárda should get an appropriation-in-aid, just as the Post Office and other Departments make sure they get such appropriations-in-aid <Col N="1187" /> for work rendered to other Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has mentioned the Gárda officer conditions, and I quite agree with him.  The present-day value of money is so low that it is almost impossible for the married Guard to subsist on his present salary. I find it difficult to see how there can be an increase of pay without a change of system.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the rent allowances.  He was good enough to revise them some years ago, and that revision undoubtedly gave considerable relief. The maximum scale at present for the city of £40, having regard to the rents Guards have to pay in cities, is altogether inadequate.  Despite the control which the Minister may claim has been exercised over rents under the Rent Restrictions Acts, any Guard I have met who is looking for a new house or a new flat is faced with paying anything from £70 to £100, or upwards. In consideration of that rent, he receives the inadequate rent allowance of £40.  That rent allowance only applies to the cities and excludes a city like Waterford, where housing conditions are just as acute as in Dublin, and where it is just as difficult to get a house at £80 or £100 rent.  In the larger towns outside the cities and Waterford, a rent allowance of £30 is paid.  Again you have towns like Naas and others I could name, where there is such a shortage of houses that the Guards are faced with having to pay most exorbitant rents.  I would ask the Minister to look into that question again, to see if anything can be done to improve the position.  Of any public servant you have in the State, the Guard is the one whom you should have in a happy, contented position and the one above all who should be put, by way of salary or emoluments, above temptation.  He is in a peculiar position in contact with the public.  He has to exercise an independent line; very often he has to keep aloof from the society in which he has to live and bring up his family.  That man should be given enough to keep himself and his family in reasonable comfort, and put him above the level of temptation.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go over the ground <Col N="1188" /> I covered last year, but would like to draw the Minister's attention to two classes of servants which are very badly treated by the State to-day&mdash;the clerks employed in the Circuit Court offices and the District Court clerks.  The matter of these officials' salaries has been under review, both by the Minister and by the Minister for Finance, for a considerable number of years.  I want to impress on the Minister that many of the officials in those offices are growing old.  Many of them will be going out shortly on pension or no pension.  Many of them rendered very good national service here in the troublesome years, and took risks out of the ordinary.  These men are now facing retirement, but many of them have no pension to look forward to. The Minister is aware of the peculiar legal position obtaining since the Treaty as it affects these servants, particularly Circuit Court officers.  I would ask him to try to expedite the scheme of superannuation, so that those who are about to retire will be able to look forward to retirement in reasonable comfort.</P>
    <P>As regards the District Court clerks, many of them are in a deplorable position. They find themselves legally in the peculiar position that they are not allowed to engage in other occupations, professions or trades.  They are prohibited by law, where they are whole-time, from improving themselves by any other trade or calling.  Some of them are on very miserable salaries, while their confreres in Northern Ireland are in receipt of salaries almost double what they are receiving down here.  However, I do not want to particularise in this matter.  Many of these men who came into the service from the Old I.R.A., the National Army or the old Sinn Féin movement have served long terms of imprisonment. There are two in my own constituency who are in a shocking plight.  One of them, who is in the county home, is a man who served a long term of years in jail, a man who took a prominent part in the national movement, but who to-day is in the county home by reason of the fact that he has not been given a superannuation from the State.  There is another man, <Col N="1189" /> who will shortly be in the county home with him, unless something is done to compensate him for his services. These are old men, over 70 years of age, and a small pension would put them above that position.  Both of these men were prominent in the national movement.  I do not wish to give their names here, but can give particulars to the Minister.  It is disgraceful that they have not been dealt with before now.  I can candidly say that many of these men feel that, because they took a prominent part in the movement, officialdom&mdash;I do not say the Minister, but officialdom&mdash;somewhere is biassed against them, when it comes to finding one of these men, who took a very proud and leading part in the national movement, now in the county home.  I would ask the Minister to expedite this scheme so that justice at least can be done to these men.</P>
    <P>I would again impress on the Minister the feeling I have from police experience&mdash;and I am sure the force has it, too&mdash;that with every demand made upon their services for duties of a non-police nature, you must cease to expect results either in the prevention or detection of crime.  We have overloaded the force now to such an extent that, instead of adding new duties, the Minister should be looking about to see what duties he can unload from them.  These men should be put back upon their beats and patrols, so that they can carry out their proper duty, the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to touch on any question of policy because, as far as I can see, in the circumstances around us, the force as a whole does its work exceedingly well.  There are a number of administrative details I would like to refer to. I would direct the Minister's attention to the time when the Gárda Síochána Bill of 1945 was going through the House.  That Bill made provision for an increased number of station-sergeants and inspectors.  I think the Minister rather envisaged a general reorganisation of various stations in the city.  At least, he instanced, to my knowledge, three or <Col N="1190" /> four.  I feel compelled to refer to this matter because I happen to live in an area within 300 or 400 yards of Whitehall Barracks and, should anything untoward happen within that area, strange though it may seem, it would be necessary for me to get in touch with Santry, practically two miles away.</P>
      <P>I mention that as an illustration of the necessity for a further reorganisation, if the reorganisation to which the Minister referred has taken place. I mention it also as an instance of what is, perhaps, obtaining in other districts in the city, as well as the district of which I have personal knowledge.  Last year the Minister made provision for a maximum number of station-sergeants and inspectors and he said at that particular stage that the number would be increased to a certain figure.  I would like to have an assurance that, in the light of the deputation which he received from the Dublin Corporation, he is satisfied that the personnel of the force in the city is adequate to meet all requirements.</P>
      <P>On the question of housing, which was referred to here last year&mdash;in fact, I think it has been referred to on the Vote for several years&mdash;the Minister held out the hope that he would regard this as a sort of major question in his post-war plan.  He admitted the necessity for housing.  Apart altogether from the hardship which is being inflicted on Guards going on transfer from one town to another, there is the question of the administrative difficulty arising out of the lack of accommodation in connection with these transfers.  It is true to say that the position has not very greatly improved, though it has improved somewhat.  It has not improved to the extent that the Minister could embark on the plan he then had in mind.  I would like to know if the Gárda authorities have taken the necessary steps to ensure that in the near future, when conditions will have eased in the building world, adequate housing accommodation will be provided for the personnel of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alongside that I would like to add my appeal to that expressed by Deputy Coogan in so far as rent allowances <Col N="1191" /> are concerned.  When these rent allowances were introduced they bore some relation, perhaps, to the conditions existing at the time.  No one is better aware of the position in Dublin than the Minister, more especially having regard to his experiences of the Rent Restrictions Act.  He knows that £40 in the city is totally inadequate to provide accommodation for a Gárda and his family at the present time.  As Deputy Coogan pointed out, the same applies in lesser amounts elsewhere, extending to £30 in the case of Waterford. I understand the Departmental viewpoint in that respect is that the Rent Restrictions Act keeps the position static, but the Minister knows that is not so.  If a Gárda moves on transfer, he is confronted with having to pay anything up to £100 a year to get decent accommodation.  It is obvious that the figure of £40, as maximum, decreasing to £18 in certain centres, is totally inadequate to meet the requirements of the Gárdaí.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Estimate an interesting item providing £437 for four policewomen and the rates of pay go from 35/- by 1/- to 42/-, inclusive.  I think the House will be rather surprised to find that State servants of that description should be remunerated in that way.  I presume there is a cost-of-living figure as well in the amount provided, but, even so, and although the number of individuals concerned is exceedingly small, it is no reason why State services should be run on what appear to be cheap lines.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister made arrangements in a matter in which I was personally interested, that is, rewards for gallantry, and he advanced a considerable portion of the way by setting up a committee.  We had a recent case in the Dublin Corporation which indicated that the position had not gone as far as we thought.  Perhaps the Minister will explain what is the position of that particular organisation?  Is it firmly constituted and are they taking steps to do what they were intended to do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the committee expressed a wish to be put <Col N="1192" /> on a statutory basis.  They did not want the Minister to interfere.  For that reason I undertook to prepare a Bill and present it to the Government.  In that Bill they would be put on a statutory basis.  In due course I hope to present a short Bill, putting them in a statutory position.  That was the reason for the delay.</P>

      <P>I notice in the Estimate also a contribution to the Gárda Síochána Reward Fund, the contribution being £415.  I am not familiar with the details, but I presume here again that it might be for something in connection with outstanding acts of devotion so far as the Gárdaí are concerned.  It would appear that the amount which, incidentally, is a fixed figure, being the same as last year, is exceedingly small.  I did hear on one occasion of a particularly courageous act being rewarded by a comparatively small amount.</P>

      <P>I raised a question here before with reference to legal aid for the poor in our courts. I called the attention of the Minister to the position which operates in England in this respect and I rather gathered that he was not disposed to follow a similar course here.  I think the Minister will agree that while the atmosphere of a court may not be correctly described as intimidating, it is of such a character that one needs to have legal defence.  I think we can take it that those who have legal defence somehow fare better than those who do not.  As I understand, such a position is provided for in England, where there is legal aid for <Col N="1193" /> the poor.  There are voluntary institutions doing it here, notably the St Vincent de Paul Society, but I think a matter of that kind should be done through the agency of the State. I mentioned it before, but I rather gathered from the Minister that he was not favourable to a course of that kind.</P>
      <P>I also raised a question about probation officers before.  The Minister has his mind firmly fixed that juvenile delinquency might best be served through a system of voluntary organisations. I think that was the line of his argument last year.  My only interest is to ensure that proper attention will be directed towards the juvenile delinquents at the stage when they need it most.  All I am concerned with is to know what is the experience of the Minister in respect of the voluntary organisation with whom, apparently, he has been in touch.  I happened quite casually to hear of another matter recently which is indicative of what sometimes happens in Government Departments, where there can be extreme parsimony in its administration. It is a small matter, but it reflects the official mind in its worst form.  It concerns the provision of flash-lamps for Guards when on duty at night.  These flash-lamps are considered to be a great aid in the detection of crime at night, and I understand that in a number of barracks in the city the supply of these indispensable articles is very small.  I believe it is totally inadequate.  I would be glad if the Minister would look into it.</P>

      <P>I have had a communication with regard to the Borstal Institute from Clonmel Corporation. That institute was established 15 or 20 years ago, but owing to the emergency it was taken over by the military authorities and the boys were transferred to Cork.  I put down a question last week asking about the future of the institute, and the reply was that the Clonmel premises were not considered to be quite suitable for the purpose.  The object of the Borstal Institute is to train and reclaim youths <Col N="1194" /> by giving them some form of trade so that they could become good citizens. I do not exactly know how the work is carried on but I understand that those who are sent there are taught trades. In a place like Clonmel, with a population of 10,000 people, there is a lack of tradesmen, and also a lack of agricultural workers in the country areas. If boys in the Borstal Institute were trained for agricultural employment they could be made useful citizens. The only places that I know of in Éire in which there were Borstal Institutes were at Cork and Clonmel.  I suggest that many of the boys who are in the Borstal Institute come from cities and big towns.  I do not know of any youths who were sent there from parishes in the districts I know.  Boys from the institute who went in for agricultural employment in County Tipperary have done remarkably well. I suggest to the Minister that if the Borstal Institute were transferred back to Clonmel a number of the youths might be trained as agricultural workers.  Some of them might be put on parole and allowed out to work for farmers living within a mile of the town.  During the busy season they could help with the harvest or could thin turnips or beet.  After a time they might be allowed out to work for three or six months.  I think that would be a good way towards the reclamation of the boys.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the housing of the Guards and to the need for providing married quarters.  I think money could be usefully spent in building married quarters in different towns.  At present if a Guard gets permission to get married to a girl in the neighbourhood in which he is stationed, he is transferred to another district.  It is a great strain on men with families, when they are transferred to a strange town, to get accommodation, especially if they have four or five children.  The problem could be solved, as Deputy O'Sullivan suggested, by providing married quarters for Guards.</P>

      <P>Many things can be said on this Vote but I am glad to say that political crime has disappeared in this State for a number of years.  There <Col N="1195" /> is now plenty of room for the political activities of people who hold republican views.  However, I am sorry to say that there is some petty crime throughout the country, such as larceny.  We expected that that would prevail during a war period and hope that now that peace has come it will decline.  One of the big troubles of our police force is that they are overburdened with duties.  They cannot devote sufficient time to their ordinary duties when they have to act as civil servants, tax collectors and in other capacities.  More than half the duties that they are called upon to do now should be taken from them.  In the country districts they have too many duties other than police duties to perform. The housing of the Guards is a matter of concern to them.  It is deplorable to find that Guards have to take thatched houses in lanes and alleys and have almost to beg the owners to let such houses.  The surroundings in which they have to live are not always the proper surroundings for Guards.  Guards should have a good social standing.  It is not fair that they should have to live amongst an undesirable class.  The time has come when proper houses should be built adjacent to the Gárda barracks.  There is no reason why three or four houses could not be built convenient to local barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of a district where Guards have to travel three or four miles to their houses.  If anything happened in that district at night-time how could the Guard in charge of the barracks get in touch with these men? He could not do it.  The place to have our policemen is right beside their duties where a telephone call or the ringing of a bell could bring all the Guards together, when required.  At the present moment, if the Gárda on duty in the barracks had urgent necessity to call the other Guards it would take the whole night to get them.  That is not good.  It is time that we should face up to the position of building proper houses for our Gárda, attached to the barracks.  It may cost money but it would be money well spent and we would thereby keep the Gárda in <Col N="1196" /> the social surroundings in which we want them, not have them having a second or third-rate social position, mixing up with everyone.  The Gárda must be above that sort of thing. While the pay of the Gárda may seem fairly good and is not too bad in ordinary times, he is not now able to keep his family decently at the present time.  Living in the country is very hard on the Gárda and his family.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that will have to be stopped.  I find the Gárda has to go away from his ordinary activities and go into private competition.  I have known Guards to engage in cattle dealing and taking grass land.  I have known Guards cutting vast amounts of turf and selling it, as a huckster would.  That is a terrible state of affairs and should certainly be stopped. I do not object to a Gárda cutting turf for his family but I strongly object to a Gárda making himself a merchant and entering into activities, even bordering on black market activities.  Many Guards throughout the country spend a vast amount of time ferreting rabbits and killing them for sale, shooting pigeons, night and day.  I see them myself, with lamps, practically all night.  They sell them to help to meet the family budget. That is a terrible state of affairs and will have to be stopped.  The only way in which it can be stopped is by giving the Guard an adequate wage to rear his family in decent surroundings. This Department is doing its duty fairly well.  It has succeeded in keeping political crime in abeyance and, if it adopts stricter measures in dealing with ordinary crime, it should be able to bring it to heel.  We should be able with the passage of time to keep control of these matters, in this Christian country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the group of Estimates for which the Minister is responsible there has been a very substantial increase in cost over the last six or seven years.  I think the increase amounted to close on £900,000. That is a very substantial increase when we remember that these Departments are all of a non-productive character, they add nothing to the wealth of the community.  If we were a perfect community, these Departments would be unnecessary, even the Minister would be unnecessary.  It is unfortunate that such a substantial amount of the national revenue should have to be diverted to the purpose of keeping us <Col N="1198" /> on the straight and narrow path and the question, of course, naturally arises, as to whether, in planning for the future, we can find some means of reducing this cost and whether by some reorganisation of the various Departments, particularly the main Department, the Gárda Síochána, we can bring about economies.  This is a very difficult question.  It has been dealt with by a number of Deputies. The viewpoint has been expressed that the Gárda should be relieved of all duties other than the prevention and detection of crime, which are its main function.  I cannot entirely agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prevention and detection of crime involves a long period of waiting for something unpleasant to happen. If it does not happen, so much the better. In any case, even the waiting is unpleasant. If we are to consider a police force confined to the duty of the prevention and detection of crime, we would be condemning a section of our people to a very unhappy mode of existence.  With decent remuneration, and having to perform other duties which fit in with the prevention and detection of crime, the life of a member of the police force and his efficiency can be improved.  During the present year the Gárda Síochána will be called upon to undertake the onerous and difficult task of carrying out a census of the population.  This will involve a big lot of work which is, I think, far removed from the prevention and detection of crime, unless we regard the population as the source of all crime.  I feel that this particular duty of finding out who lives in each street and laneway and in each isolated rural dwellinghouse is a duty which adds to the efficiency of our police force.  It enables them to collect a considerable amount of very useful information.  I should like to know in this connection whether it would be possible to improve the statistical information which the Gárda are called upon to collect. In addition to the census of the population, the Garda are called upon to carry out annually a census of production and a census in regard to agriculture. These particular statistics have been frequently condemned in this House as being unreliable.  I think <Col N="1199" /> there is need for introducing a system in regard to the preparation of such statistics somewhat on the same lines as the system adopted for the census of population, that is, that each individual is called upon to answer a number of questions and to be responsible for the answers.</P>
    <P>In regard to agricultural statistics the person giving the information is not, as a rule, held responsible.  The Guards are supposed to collect the information as well as they can, but frequently it is difficult to fix the responsibility on anyone, if the information is inaccurate.  Generally speaking, I think that the census of population has been found to be fairly accurate, if not very accurate.  If a similar system was introduced in regard to the collection of other statistics, I think it would make for greater accuracy.</P>
    <P>I have heard the question raised in this House frequently of the disparity between the number of police required in Great Britain to maintain order and the number required here in proportion to the population.  I have not any figures before me as to what the disparity really is.  But we were told by Deputy Coogan to-day that one policeman and his wife are able to maintain order in a town of over 5,000 population in Great Britain.  It is my opinion that the same number of police would maintain order so far as our rural areas are concerned.  It may be necessary to increase the number in the towns and cities.  But you cannot contemplate a reduction in the personnel of our police force without reducing very drastically the number of stations. That, again, would raise a very serious problem, because I do not think there is any town or village which would like to be deprived of its Gárda station.  Therefore, viewing the matter from every angle, I am of the opinion that the addition of duties other than the ordinary prevention and detection of crime is not undesirable. If the Gárdaí are given adequate and decent remuneration and are properly equipped for the work they are called upon to do, I think they will not object to carrying out other duties, such as the collection of statistics and assisting in the <Col N="1200" /> various administrative schemes in their localities.  I think there is no serious objection to that.  A Guard who is called upon to carry out administrative duties is brought into close contact with various people whom he might find it rather difficult to contact in his ordinary patrol duty. People living in isolated country places frequently do not come into contact with the Guards unless the Guards come to their houses to collect statistics or on some duty of that kind. On the whole, I think it is desirable that the police force in this country should have duties other than the prevention and detection of crime.  I think it would increase the efficiency of the police force, provided the duties are not excessive and that they are not such as would take a number of the police force completely away from contact with the people in each subdistrict.</P>
    <P>In connection with the census to be taken this year, I want to raise a matter which is a cause of considerable concern in rural areas.  I refer to itinerants.  I wonder if the Gárdaí, in carrying out the census of population, are able accurately to estimate the number of itinerants who frequent our roads.  There is a general feeling in the country that the numbers are under-estimated by the police authorities. I do not know how true that is, but it is quite possible that they are. I suppose it is not easy to carry out a census of people who are moving frequently from one district to another. It is desirable, however, that the numbers should be recorded and that steps should be taken to ensure that these people do not interfere as much as they are at present interfering with the rural population in isolated areas.  There is considerable trespass by such people, particularly those who deal extensively in horses and other live stock.  They frequently take the liberty of utilising farmers' lands and crops for their own use.  By moving from district to district, they succeed in completely evading the law and have made themselves to a great extent immune from the law.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has arisen in the discussion on the Public Health Bill is that it has been alleged that these <Col N="1201" /> itinerants are carriers of infectious diseases from one place to another.  The same allegation was made in connection with the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease a few years ago.  On the whole, I think the section of our population who are prepared to live in fixed places of abode and who try to work patches of land and to eke out an honest living at least should be protected from such people.</P>
    <P>Another matter which requires some explanation from the Minister is the system by which county registrars are appointed.  I raised this matter by way of question in the House some time ago and the Minister defended the present system on the ground that it was the established practice.  I think the system by which these appointments are made is altogether wrong.  Appointments to positions of this kind which are of a semi-judicial nature and of a very responsible type should not be made on Party lines.  Some system should be devised by which the ablest and best members of the legal profession will be promoted to such important positions.</P>
    <P>I am always puzzled in regard to these Estimates to know why it is the Minister for Justice is not answerable and responsible for the Estimate for Law Charges and the Attorney-General's Department.  It seems to me that the Attorney-General's Office fits into and is to a great extent part and parcel of the general system of administering justice, and that it should be accounted for by the Minister for Justice as are the courts.  It is very difficult to understand why this Department is excluded from the Minister's control, so to speak.</P>
    <P>The question of providing legal defence in court for people who are unable to afford it has been raised and it is a question which should be very seriously considered.  The courts, we are told, are open to all citizens, but they are open in just the same way as the Shelbourne Hotel, or some of the bigger places of entertainment, are open in that they can enter provided they have the necessary finance, but if they have not got the necessary finance, they may find themselves left completely out in the cold.  Not alone <Col N="1202" /> should a person charged with a serious offence be provided with legal aid, but something should also be done to reduce the cost of bringing proceedings in the High Court.  It might be said that the best advice to the ordinary citizen is that he should keep out of the higher courts altogether, but very often cases regarding title to property &mdash;it may be a farm or a business&mdash;arise and title cannot be established except by going into the High Court.  Very frequently it happens that people who are aggrieved have no means of redress simply because they have not got the necessary finance to go into the higher courts.  It is a very undesirable state of affairs.  With regard to the person charged with a serious offence, there is no answer to the case that he should be given legal assistance at the expense of the State if he cannot afford it himself.</P>
    <P>I want to deal, in conclusion, with the duty that lies ahead of the Minister with regard to reorganising our police force.  As we all know, members of the Gárda all joined the force practically at the same time and they will all be retiring in a short time.  There is, therefore, a duty and an obligation upon the Minister and upon this House to see that in future we will aim not only at maintaining the high standard set when the force was established but at raising it still higher.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the efficiency and effectiveness of our police force, particularly in view of the circumstances in which it was established, have surprised not only people in this country but people outside this country. It has been a source of surprise, particularly to people outside this country, that we who were regarded as such a lawless race, particularly at the time when the State was established, could settle down to become at least comparatively orderly.  In great measure, the change over to normal conditions when the State was established was due to the Gárda, who, though they never claimed to be a perfect police force, were certainly a very human police force.  They got to know the people, to know their weaknesses and their virtues, and by not being too drastic or rigid but by maintaining a certain standard of commonsense <Col N="1203" /> in the administration of justice, they succeeded in maintaining order much better than the enemies of this country expected.</P>
    <P>In planning for the future, we must aim at getting into our police force the ablest and best men available.  We must offer decent remuneration and security and we must offer, above all, decent housing.  One of the serious blots in regard to the general establishment of our police force has been the very inadequate and undesirable housing provided.  Not only in the City of Dublin but even in the most remote rural areas, Guards have to seek accommodation from private landlords and pay for it at the very highest price and in many cases they have secured only the very poorest of accommodation. One of the first duties of the Minister is to provide housing. Now that the emergency is over, it should be possible to get this work under way.  During the emergency nothing could be done, but now that the emergency is over plans should be laid for the building of such accommodation as is required and as will be helpful, not only to the comfort but to the efficiency of the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only three matters I wish to speak about.  I do not think that anybody dealing with the Estimate for the Department of Justice and hearing the figures given by the Minister, showing, as I think they do, in practically every respect, a rather serious increase in crime, could pass over that situation in silence.  I have no doubt that that increase in crime is in no way due to the activities of the Department of Justice.  In so far as the Guards are concerned, they have been vigilant and zealous&mdash;perhaps one might occasionally criticise them for being a bit over-zealous.  It is disqueting that at this period we should be faced again this year with the review the Minister has given, showing a rather grave increase in criminal statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, I ventured to suggest that that increase was not due basically to the conditions created by the war and the emergency, that the uses had to be found deeper in our <Col N="1204" /> own characteristics and in our own mode of life.  I was somewhat severely criticised for making that observation, even by my own leader, Deputy Cosgrave, as he then was.  I think I am entitled now to say that I was, to a great extent, correct in my diagnosis then.  I think this increase in crime is due not so much to war conditions and emergency conditions as to the peculiar circumstances which exist in our country at the present time.  We have to face the fact that our people have suffered a moral deterioration to some extent.  We have to face also the fact that economic conditions have forced some of our growing people, almost against their own will, into the paths of crime.  One of the greatest problems that have to be solved is the problem of finding work for the young people leaving school at from 14 to 18 years.  It is at that time that the real criminal is formed and that is the period of greatest danger from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that it is a matter of extreme difficulty to place the young people who are coming out of school between 14 and 18.  I think it is fair and proper to say that practically all those children leaving school have one desire only&mdash;to get remunerative employment, to get some job which will enable them to bring some money into their homes and enable them to earn their livelihood decently.  When they find themselves faced with the impossibility of getting any sort of job, or getting merely a blind alley occupation, faced with the frustration of their efforts, they come up against the alluring prospect that there is money to be made in directions other than the ways which appear to be barred to them. You have in the country at present the extraordinary contrast between extreme poverty and a small select few who have made extreme wealth in the last six or seven years.  Money is being splashed by certain sections of the community here, in lavish displays by apparently wealthy people who do not mind what they spend on luxuries or on their own amusement.  Side by side with that, there are people who are unable to live on the salaries and wages they are able or permitted to earn.  We have the problem of these <Col N="1205" /> young people unable to get jobs, and prohibited in some cases from going to England in search of work.  This problem of increasing crime is one that requires more careful and detailed treatment and consideration than it has yet received.  It is not proper, in the public interest, that it should be cast aside merely as a matter of statistics, that some airy explanation should be given based upon the war and emergency conditions.</P>
    <P>There is one minor matter, before I refer to the other two major matters I wish to speak about to-night.  Some years ago, I asked from the Minister's predecessor whether the promotion of a Guard depended on his efficiency or was measured by the number of prosecutions he brought and the success of those prosecutions.  The Minister's predecessor gave me a definite assurance that the promotion in no way depended on the prosecutions.  I, and a number of people who are engaged in the law, have got the impression that there is a new attitude, which was not existent, in theory at least, in criminal courts, that the prosecution in the conduct of criminal cases at present have the attitude that they must win the case, as if they were acting for a private client, as if it were essential that the case should be&mdash;to use a phrase that is out of use in a criminal court&mdash;won by the prosecution.  I have heard the phrase used&mdash;and I am sure other Deputies have heard it too&mdash;&ldquo;it was a very successful prosecution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The duty of the State prosecutor, the duty of all people assisting him, the duty of the courts and of all people in charge of the preparation of the case in the courts, ought to be to bring the facts in fairness before the court, all the facts and not merely facts which appear to support the case for the prosecution.  They should bring forward those facts which may in any way be of assistance to accused persons.  There are some prosecutors, some superintendents, Gárda sergeants and detective officers in charge of cases who faithfully conform to those standards: and there are some&mdash; in our view, at all events, whether we be right or wrong&mdash;who do not conform to those standards.  For that <Col N="1206" /> reason, I seek an assurance from the Minister that the assurance given by his predecessor will be maintained.  I wish to be assured that the efficiency of the Guards is not measured by the number of prosecutions and that promotion does not depend upon success in those prosecutions, that the efficiency of a Guard is measured by other and higher standards than those.</P>
    <P>I may for a moment digress into a note of levity and cite an actual case that occurred to two citizens, well known to the Minister, in a remote part of Ireland a short time ago.  The weather had been extremely inclement for days, and, finally forced out late at night for a walk in search of air, they came upon a guardian of the peace, who informed them that he wished to take their names.  On their assuring him they were merely out for a walk, he said he did not mind that; he wanted their names all the same, as he had been out for hours and nothing had happened, and he wanted to get something before he went back to barracks. I know there is a very real explanation of that occurrence, and I am sure neither the Minister nor the Commissioner will take steps to find out who the particular individual was. However, there may be some slight germ of truth in that, that this particular individual, who perhaps paid a visit to a local hostelry in search of protection against the inclement weather, and having found that he got nothing as a result, availed of the presence of these two well-known citizens to bring something back to show his efforts for the night.  I am sure the Minister will give me the same assurance as his predecessor gave some years ago.</P>
    <P>Last year I got from the Minister what I regarded as a satisfactory assurance on the subject of the employment of temporary district justices.  It appears that the Minister and I were in complete agreement on the undesirability of employing legal gentlemen as temporary district justices.</P>
    <P>I think the employment of temporary district justices for long periods borders on the unconstitutional.  The Minister agreed with me that that was a practice that should be kept within the narrowest possible ambit.  I have <Col N="1207" /> watched the situation rather carefully for the last 12 months and I would like the Minister to give me some information as to the practice which he has followed in the administration of this branch of his Department during that 12 months.  I have got the impression &mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that there have been more temporary appointments of district justices last year than there were before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  There were three district justices rather ill during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Then my impression was not far wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was quite correct.</P>

      <P>The position in the City of Dublin is a very strange and somewhat anomalous position.  The statute provides for the carrying out of the work in Dublin by three permanent justices.  I think it is many years since the Dublin work was carried out by three permanent justices.  So far as we can see, there appears to be an army of assistants and temporary justices carrying on the work in the Dublin District Courts.  I think there are something like three assistant district justices who are quite permanent in their appointments, and there are two, three and four, and sometimes more, temporary justices carrying on the work there.  In the City of Dublin it would probably be true to say that the work has been carried on by eight or nine people for the last seven or eight years, whereas the statute provides for only three individuals.  It appears to me there is something wrong there requiring radical treatment from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Cogan who spoke about a change in the system of appointment of county registrars.  He was, perhaps, not strictly happy in the phrase he used about change in the mode of appointment.  Possibly the correct description would have been change in the mode of selection for appointment.  Every appointment is regulated by statute, but the Minister can select from the applicants the best person for the post.  Deputy Cogan <Col N="1208" /> wished to emphasise the desirability of appointing on non-Party grounds. I think the Minister has long ago nailed his colours to the mast on that point.  He has cheerfully explained that he is going to make appointments on political grounds.  I think I am not unfair to the Minister if I say that he stated that again and again.  We have to face that and to realise that is the method that is being adopted, not merely from the point of view of county registrars, but I am afraid also for temporary district justices.</P>
    <P>The appointment of temporary justices is vicious to the point of being unconstitutional.  It has been stated in legal circles, and I would like the Minister's view on this as to whether the statements that are current are correct or not, that it has been laid down as a practice to be adhered to henceforth in the appointment of permanent district justices that no person will be appointed to a permanent post as district justice unless he has first served a term as a temporary justice. If that practice prevails, it is very wrong.  It has all the vice of the practice which the Minister agreed with me was a wrong practice, namely, appointing an over-plus of temporary district justices.  The practice which is alleged, in legal circles at all events, to have been laid down now, for guidance in future in reference to future appointments, that no person will be appointed to a permanent post in the District Court unless he has first served a term as temporary district justice, is, in my view, quite wrong.</P>
    <P>The appointment will be made, in existing circumstances, for political reasons and on political grounds and largely as a result of political pressure. That person will be put upon a period of probation.  If it is believed, or thought, that in the exercise of what ought to be judicial functions he does not respond in the way in which he is expected to respond from the point of view of the State, then his chances of appointment may be somewhat minimised or diminished.  Whether that may be the attitude of the Minister's Department or not, it is only human to expect that a person who has a temporary appointment, and who is looking <Col N="1209" /> for a permanent appointment will make up&mdash;I nearly used the phrase well known to Dubliners, very near the word make, will suck up&mdash;to the powers that be, and that is entirely contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>I raised on another occasion the question of the appointment of assistant district justices to the position of permanent justices.  A number of these assistants have been there for years. Young men have been appointed to the District Court, first as temporary justices and then as permanent justices. Young men of little experience but with great political pull have been appointed direct to the District Court bench, but these men who have served for years as assistant district justices, at smallish salaries, have been left to carry on in the same position that they had before, doing the same duties of district justices without ever getting the necessary step-up from assistant to permanent justices.  I think that the Minister agreed that those positions as assistant district justices would be abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will allow me to clear that up?  I would like to say that these three were offered permanent posts.  They were offered vacancies that occurred in the country. I think it is well to let the Deputy know that.  He is probably not aware of it.  They would not accept the offer. They were hoping to get placed here, as I hope they will when I can get a Bill through.  It is very important that that should be made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for that.  It was to get that assurance that I raised the point.  I cannot be going around, as the Minister will appreciate, asking for information from the district justices, because it would put them in a very invidious position.  They would say I was asking for information out of which to make political bricks to throw at the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They were offered that and they would not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  Then my recollection is correct that the Minister had the intention of doing <Col N="1210" /> away with this grade of assistant district justice and having only one permanent bench?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of great satisfaction to me.  The last point I want to refer to relates to a matter I raised yesterday in the House by way of question.  In the course of a recent case a very efficient detective officer gave evidence, which I am sure and believe was accurate; in fact, the accuracy has been confirmed by the Minister's reply to my question yesterday. The point is that a person arrested and detained under the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, during the period of his lawful detention is not allowed to seek the assistance of his legal adviser, nor is he allowed, when he is being interrogated under the powers provided in one of the sections of that Act, to seek the assistance of that legal adviser.  He is kept apart from his friends and apart from legal advice.  I do not know whether the Minister can give reasons to justify that practice in existing circumstances, particularly for types of offences which are not of the category which were envisaged as being the types that would be tried by the tribunal set up in 1939. The decision of the courts recently has been to the effect that where a person detained under the Act of 1939 is interrogated he is bound to answer any questions put to him by the officer who is interrogating, under a penalty of six months' imprisonment for failure to answer.  If he answers the question the answer can subsequently be given in other legal proceedings against him, proceedings other than those dealt with at the time he was interrogated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a matter on which the Minister should take advice and should consider in existing circumstances. Those powers are being used in cases under the Emergency Powers Acts which are brought before the Special Military Tribunal.  The Minister agreed with me last year, and I believe that he has faithfully kept the undertaking, if I can call it such, that he was not <Col N="1211" /> going to allow, as far as it was in his power, these particular types of cases to be brought before that tribunal. Notwithstanding that, and without any fault of the Minister, cases are still being brought there.</P>
    <P>This is not the Estimate on which to raise the matter.  I mention it merely for the purpose of impressing upon the Minister the necessity of reconsidering the practice which exists, of excluding legal aid from persons detained in the closest custody, apart from all friends and all relations, and under the terror and coercion of the penalties imposed under these Acts for failure to reply to questions put to them by an interrogating officer.  I want him to see whether that practice ought to be reviewed in the light of the circumstances now existing, when political crime has been reduced to a very small compass, and where these courts ought not to be used for any purposes or any function other than that which is popularly known as &ldquo;political crime.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I look upon this Estimate, dealing with the Department of Justice, as one of the most important discussed during the year.  It is an Estimate which should be the subject of honest criticism from all sides of the House, in order to assist the Minister, so that if there have been any irregularities the criticisms offered here might be helpful for the future.  The first thing I want to do is to pay a tribute in the highest possible terms to the officers of the Department of Justice for the manner in which they carry out their duties.  Like other Deputies who have had occasion to make representation to the Civil Service staff attached to the Minister's Department, I can say that that staff has always carried out its duties in an efficient manner.  If all sections of the Department of Justice were administered in the same manner as the Civil Service staff carry out their duties little difficulty would be experienced throughout the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have called the Minister's attention to the need for providing houses for members of the Gárda Síochána.  I think the time has <Col N="1212" /> come when the Government should give the question favourable consideration. The Minister should formulate a scheme without delay, where by members of the Gárda Síochána would be provided with houses convenient to Gárda barracks. It is a disgraceful state of affairs to find that members of the force cannot find suitable housing accommodation in most of our towns. Strong representations should be made to the Commissioner so that when Guards are being transferred from one centre to another, consideration would be given to the position of men with families.  They should be sent to districts where there would be educational facilities available for their children. It is all right to send single men to country districts, but married Guards should be sent to towns where their children would have educational facilities provided for them.  I have known cases of married Guards whose children, on leaving primary schools, attended technical schools and had then to travel from five to nine miles. Single members of the Gárda would be able to do duty in such districts as well as married men.  The latter should be given preference for big towns in which schools were available.</P>
    <P>I believe that the uniform provided for the Guards should be altered.  In warm weather a Guard is almost cooked in his uniform.  We have young men in the force now and a smarter and more up-to-date uniform should be provided.  It should have an open neck and there should be either a blue or a dark shirt, as well as a tie to suit the uniform.  I believe our police force would look smarter if it had a uniform something like that provided for the Canadian Mounted Police.  The present uniform could be altered without any great inconvenience.  I believe the change would be welcomed by the young men who are now going into the force.  The Minister should also consider a change of uniform for winter and summer.  At present the uniform is the same all the year round.  A majority of the Guards would welcome a change in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles dealt with the numerous duties that the Guards have to discharge. Deputy Coogan pointed out <Col N="1213" /> that the Guards are now responsible for taking the census.  That should not be the duty of the Guards.  They are also acting as school attendance officers and as food and drug inspectors.  The county councils should have independent officers to look after food and drugs.  A good deal of the time of the Guards is also taken up when acting as inspectors of weights and measures.  I do believe that they could be relieved of an enormous amount of this additional work that has been piled on to them and which could provide employment for others as drug inspectors, school attendance officers, census takers, and in carrying out other duties that the Gárda Síochána perform at present.  The Gárda Síochána are kept very busy in all cities.  I know a case where a citizen lost clothing to the value of £30 or £35, which he alleges was stolen.  The matter was reported to the Gárda and they made investigations, which failed.  The same citizen left his car in a street in the city and a Gárda was able to tell him that his car had been parked there for 2½ hours and that that was in excess of the waiting period in that particular street. Surely a Guard would have something to do besides standing at a car that was parked for 2½ hours, yet that citizen could discover that the Guards were unable to secure information as to his £35 worth of clothing.  It has been stated that the Guards throughout the country are trafficking in turf, attending markets and dealing in live stock. I can bear out every word that Deputy Giles said in that respect.  I have known a Guard who had more turf cut for sale than any small farmer could afford to cut for sale, or any other person who was producing turf as a means of livelihood.  I have known Guards to deal in cattle and live stock. I have known cases where smallholders and landless men who were very anxious to secure portions of land in order to comply with the appeal for the production of food and to maintain a small amount of live stock, were deprived of conacre in areas and I have known members of the Gárda Síochána to secure it.</P>
    <P>The Gárda Síochána should be in a more independent position than to be <Col N="1214" /> driven, as Deputy Giles pointed out, to trapping rabbits, or to deal in live stock or turf.  The Gárda has a certain amount of dignity to maintain and a very important office to uphold.  It is the bounden duty of the State to put that man in an independent way of living.  Deputy Norton and my colleague, Deputy Davin, addressed a very important meeting near the town of Athy recently.  Numerous members of the Gárda Síochána were present at the meeting.  Local gossip says that the local band was due to attend the meeting but that the local sergeant of the Gárda Síochána issued instructions that the local band was not to attend that meeting and the local people go on to say that the reason why he gave those instructions was simply because the farmer whose land was the subject of agitation for division had presented him with two trees for himself.  I honestly believe that, members of the Gárda Síochána should not be left in a position to be subject to that sort of criticism.  They should be in receipt of a salary that would enable them to live independently and decently, as far as possible.  I strongly recommend that every step should be taken to see that, as far as possible, the Gárda Síochána will not be allowed to deprive anybody else of conacre, turf banks or to deal in live stock.  Certainly every member of this House has sympathy with the Gárdaí. They have to live, and require every assistance that can be given them to live.  At the same time it is the duty of the State to see that sufficient remuneration is given to them so that they may live in comfort without depriving any smallholder or cottage tenant of his turf bank or acre of land. I trust the Minister will see into that matter and that that state of affairs will not obtain in future.</P>
    <P>I spoke last year on the Vote for the Department of Justice.  Shortly afterwards I received a very impudent letter from no less a person than the Attorney-General, reprimanding me for the statement I made in this House.

      <P>Deputy Martin O'Sullivan made an appeal in this House, <Col N="1216" /> and very wisely, that provision should be made for legal advice for citizens, who are supposed to have all the force of the courts behind them but who are unable to pay solicitors to have their cases properly presented in court. There should be some assistance for the poorer sections of the community to have professional advice on matters relating to cases which they desire to present in court.  I hope the Minister will give that matter his most sympathetic consideration.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of talk for some time past about prison conditions. I have read the Book of Estimates and I have been very interested in that portion of it that deals with prisons.  I live about five miles from Portlaoighise convict prison and I have heard several complaints and several charges being made which had very grave reference to the treatment that was being given to prisoners in that prison.  On numerous occasions the Minister's attention has been drawn to that fact.  The Minister himself on one occasion made an appeal in this House for investigation into the treatment of prisoners in Mountjoy prison and in other prisons, but the Minister is inclined, not only to give the blind eye to correspondence addressed to his Department on the subject, but to give two deaf ears to the matter in the House.  I believe the appeal the Minister made in this House on one occasion for an investigation was necessary at the time, but I submit that it is equally necessary now. When a Deputy rises in this House and asks for an investigation into prison conditions, he is asking for nothing more than the Minister asked for himself on one occasion.  Now that the Minister is in a position to investigate prison conditions, what objection has he to an investigation being held into the conditions, as to which we have had very serious allegations made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Deputy representing the constituency, I wrote to the Minister and asked him for permission to walk around the prison grounds at Portlaoighise, to look at the cells to see if they were clean, and to see for myself the conditions that existed in that <Col N="1217" /> prison.  I have had numerous complaints as to the conditions there, and I said that before I raised the matter in the Dáil I should like to satisfy myself that these complaints were absolutely genuine.  Therefore, I wrote to the Minister and asked him to be good enough to permit me, as a Deputy representing the constituency, to go into the prison and see for myself the conditions that existed there and whether the complaints that were being made to me had any foundation or not.  The Minister replied that he would not allow me to visit the prison in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>When a prison is financed by State funds Deputies should be allowed to see how the State funds are being administered.  If a citizen is being badly treated, it is our job to investigate the treatment of such a citizen.  I think that was a very dictatorial attitude on the part of the Minister.  It certainly gave me to understand that the grave suspicions about Portlaoighise prison were well founded when the Minister tried to hide what was going on there.  I should like to know from the Minister if it is the governor of the prison who is anxious to hide the conditions existing in that prison, or if it is the Minister who is responsible for seeing that a Deputy representing the constituency will not be allowed to visit the prison.  As a Deputy who headed the poll in that constituency, I believed that I was entitled to go into that prison and see if there was any ground for these complaints. Another Deputy who lives miles away from that constituency asked for permission to visit that prison and received it without any delay.  I do not see why a Deputy from outside the constituency should be permitted to visit the prison and to have his visit referred to in a book which was afterwards written.  I hope and trust that the Minister has read every page of that book, <i>I Did Penal Servitude</i>, because it would enlighten the Minister. I am sure he has already got it. Although the Minister and I are not on very friendly terms, I will have no hesitation in lending him that book if he has not already had the time to digest it properly.  I cannot see why a <Col N="1218" /> Deputy should be deprived of his right to go into a prison and endeavour to satisfy himself as to the conditions there.</P>
    <P>I know that the conditions in Portlaoighise prison are very bad because I have first-hand information about them.  The Minister knows very well that the conditions in Portlaoighise prison are of such a character that they could not be described.  They are inhuman and unChristian.  The Minister saw fit to allow Irishmen who were charged with political crimes, probably high treason to the dictionary republic of Ireland, or something of that sort, to exist in the awful conditions that they are enduring at present in that prison.  I have before me a statement duly signed by a person who did a term of penal servitude in Portlaoighise prison.</P>
    <P>I am sure that in that statement this person has given a true account of his sad and bitter experience in that prison.  He says that he was charged with refusing to answer a question as to where he obtained the sum of £50, money which was paid to him by a friend at Fenit, County Kerry, and he was found guilty by the Military Tribunal and sentenced to five years' penal servitude.  The day after he was sentenced another citizen was charged with being in possession of a revolver and he also was sentenced to five years' penal servitude.  The statement of that former prisoner goes on to say that, after trial and conviction, both of them were sent to Mountjoy and were put in with political prisoners.  After five days or a week in Mountjoy they were transferred to Portlaoighise.  The statement goes on to say that on his arrival at the prison he was placed in a cell and ordered to take off his clothes.  He was ordered to don the garb of a convict which he refused to do, and probably rightly so.  The statement goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was then kept in solitary confinement clad only in blankets for two-and-a-half years.  During this period I left my cell to be escorted to the bathroom once every week. For part of the time I was barefooted. I was deprived of any means <Col N="1219" /> of communicating, by letter or otherwise, with my wife and five children. One of my children died while I was in prison.  I was not allowed to go to Mass or the Sacraments unless in prison clothes.  I was two years and nine months in the prison before I went to Mass.  I went after a conversation with Rev.  Father O'Sullivan, S.J., who undertook to inform the Minister for Justice that it was to be understood we were not compromising our principles.  I repeatedly asked the Governor and the visiting justices for political treatment, especially a letter and newspaper, and was as often refused.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I received it since the Minister's Estimate last year.  I did not get it last year.  Certainly it came in time for his Estimate this year.  If I had it last year, I would have dealt with it then.  Such conditions should not exist in any prison in Catholic Ireland. I think it is something we ought to be ashamed of.  It is certainly something about which the Fianna Fáil Government ought to hang their heads in shame.  A political prisoner was refused permission even to receive a letter from his friends or a newspaper to occupy his mind while in that prison.  All requests for permission to receive a letter or a newspaper were refused.  The statement goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Governor brought Mr. Connolly, Department of Justice, to see me.  I asked him for political treatment. He said I was not conforming with the rules of the prison so I could not be granted the things I asked.  They were privileges I would have to earn.  I then asked why I was transferred from Mountjoy to Portlaoighise.  He told me it was by a decision of the Government.  I asked him was this the decision of the Government as a body.  He said &lsquo;No, it was Mr. Boland's decision.&rsquo; I said I thought I was victimised. He then left the cell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" />&ldquo;A month later he returned and told me that Mr. Boland, the Minister for Justice, had consented to allow me a letter monthly and a newspaper weekly.  I asked whether the other lads were getting it and he replied yes.  Three months later I was informed by the governor that he was allowing us two hours free association every day&mdash;one hour in the morning and one in the afternoon. The association was allowed inside the prison only and always in the same room.  Its measurement is 45 feet by 15 feet and much of the space is taken up by a long table.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Imagine that&mdash;those men associating there for an hour twice a day under such awful conditions.  I am told that there was no air allowed into the room and that no sunshine whatever entered it, that while they were associating there they had to sit on the table or stand around, that they were driven into it and out of it like cattle and that when they made any attempt to ask for an improvement, they were told that if they were not satisfied with the conditions they were enduring, they would not be allowed to associate with each other at all.</P>
    <P>The statement goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At no time during the period I was there were we allowed into the open air.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then we have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government warning us against tuberculosis when&mdash;I can say it without fear of contradiction&mdash;the best part of those in Portlaoighise Prison, as a result of the sanitary conditions and of lack of air, are suffering from tuberculosis. Is it not a deplorable state of affairs that Dáil Eireann should remain silent while fellow Irishmen have to live in such conditions?  It does not matter for what reason they were sentenced to imprisonment&mdash;it is our duty to look after their health and to see that they have decent conditions while in a prison, the running of which is financed by the State.</P>
    <P>The statement continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All the time we wore blankets, from which we made ourselves <Col N="1221" /> smocks.  Resulting from the close confinement, the boys and I, myself, became very worried.  I found myself shouting in the cell on several occasions. A prisoner by the name of Joe Callaghan on one occasion when he had been shouting as a result of a nervous breakdown and making noise &mdash;it had been termed abusive by the warders&mdash;was taken out of his cell and brought to the underground punishment cell which is known as &lsquo;The Digger&rsquo;, and there was subjected to a very severe beating. Months afterwards we were together and he told us he was struck in the face with a bunch of keys and that everything went black.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a true statement by a prisoner. Are these not grand conditions for any Minister for Justice to stand over in 1946?  Then we are told we have a Government which is democratic and that there are equal rights and opportunities for all, and that kindliness is shown to all sections of the people.  If I were Minister for Justice, I would hang my head in shame for such conditions.</P>
    <P>The statement goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I never saw J. O'Sullivan, now in Grangegorman, but I understand it was he I heard screaming one evening. I know from others that he was after getting a severe beating in the prison.  Afterwards he was removed insane to Grangegorman.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it not deplorable that a prisoner should be beaten insane in a Catholic and Christian country?  Ought not the Minister for Justice to be very ashamed of these conditions, and ought he not be ashamed of the Department of which he is head when such accusations can be made against it, accusations which he is anxious to keep in the dark and which he will not allow public representatives elected by the people to investigate?  The statement goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It seems to me that McCaughy was suffering from delusions.  Liam Rice was in such a state of mind that he saw horses in his cell.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He concludes by stating:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If some change is not made very soon the conditions in Portlaoighise <Col N="1222" /> will produce most serious results to the health of the prisoners, some of whom are now in their fifth year in the prison.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that statement was written by a man from his own bitter experience and I am very sorry that the Minister has not denied that the statement is true.  Furthermore, I want to say that when a Deputy asked to be allowed into the prison to see if the statement were right or wrong, he was denied the right to go into the prison.</P>
    <P>Only quite recently a Corkman named Hartnett was sentenced by the Military Court for possession of ammunition and refusing to give an account of his movements.  He made a speech in Irish from the dock in which he declared himself a republican&mdash;not one of the Fianna Fáil republicans but one of the true republicans, the followers of Wolfe Tone and the men of Easter Week.  That is the type of republican he declared himself to be. He had a sound national outlook and his republican outlook was based on 32 counties and not the 26 counties of Ireland.  He was inspired by the proclamation of Easter Week and certainly was not inspired by the Oxford dictionary, the Cambridge dictionary or any encyclopaedia.  He drew his inspiration from the men of Easter Week and remained true and loyal to them. As a result, he finds himself denied political treatment to-day.</P>
    <P>A constituent of mine has written to me to say that it has come to his knowledge that political treatment is being denied to Hartnett and that he is in solitary confinement in Mountjoy Prison and has been refused parcels and visits.  He adds: &ldquo;This situation is outrageous.  We hear a lot of Belsen and other places of detention on the Continent, but when the same thing occurs in our own country every one is silent&rdquo;, and then he says: &ldquo;I ask you as our representative to raise this matter by way of question in the Dáil and also the matter of recent arrests which you may have noticed&rdquo;.  I submit that these conditions are not conditions which any citizen should have to endure.  Political prisoners are, in other words, being done to death, and now that the best part of the Continental <Col N="1223" /> prisons are freed, there is no reason why we here should continue to vent our political spite any longer and no reason why we should not release from the prisons those who are in there for political crimes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons yesterday said he was astonished to hear it was a political crime to shout &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; or to be a Republican.  I must say that times have changed very much since the Minister himself was a Republican. I am sorry that he should see fit to remove to a place of solitary confinement and to treat in a manner in which one would not treat a dumb animal those who are now walking the path which he himself once walked.  I ask him to give consideration to those who are suffering under such horrid conditions and I trust he will see fit to have a commission set up, representative of all Parties in the House, with power to send for persons, papers and records, to investigate these conditions. I believe all Parties would welcome such an inquiry, in view of the very severe criticism of prisons and in view of the fact that persons like my friend who sent this statement are willing to come forward and give evidence.</P>
    <P>There is a growing practice to which I have great objection.  A constituent of mine, anxious to go to England, made representations to a certain department, and that department was under the jurisdiction of the British Government, as the result of which the official of the British Government told him that he had his police record in the office of His Majesty the King, and that he secured that police record from the Department of Justice.  I have an objection to any Irish Government supplying the British Government with any information concerning any citizen.  Let us have for ourselves what information about our citizens we so desire.  I object very strongly to the Government of Northern Ireland being supplied with information by the Government here which leads to the arrest of those citizens in the North.  I think every true Irishman would be bitterly opposed to our police force being turned into informers for His Majesty the King.  If the British want information <Col N="1224" /> about Irish citizens, they should provide the ways and means.  I am sure the Minister cannot deny that that occurred and that files were placed at the disposal of His Majesty the King concerning any citizen about whom the British Government desired to get information.</P>
    <P>Regarding a prosecution in the military court of a hold-up at a bank in 1936, the prosecution took place in 1945.  I think the hold-up was at the National Bank in O'Connell Street. Two I.R.A. men, interned since 1939 and released in 1945, were arrested and charged.  It was within the knowledge of certain members of the police that the man who did the job on that occasion left the country in 1938 or 1939 and was killed in a bank stick-up in Canada in 1944.  In other words, the police knew the man who carried out the deed.  If the Minister looks up the records, he will find that the two men charged with this crime were interned from 1939 to 1945, and that the police knew that the man who carried out the hold-up was killed in Canada in 1944.  It is most unfair that any citizens should be victimised in that respect for their political views.  As Deputy Giles very wisely said, the time has come when illegal organisations are disappearing and when those who cater for such organisations are willing to come out in public and place their plans, programmes and policy before the people.  I believe, as a young man who is only starting a political career, that there is a very wide field for such organisations, as you have the Fianna Fáil Party drawing their last and dying breath.</P>
    <P>There are young men who are conscientious and are anxious to remain loyal to illegal organisations.  I honestly believe that the time has come when such organisations should be able to come out in public and I am sure the people would be willing to welcome them and see them in the political field. Then, as is often repeated in this House, if the people want duds they have a free right to have duds, but if they want sensible men they have an equally free right to choose sensible men.  I believe these men are willing to come out in the political field, but I <Col N="1225" /> am afraid the Government is not treating them in a manner which would encourage them to do so.  The Minister for Justice himself said on one occasion that he was convinced the continual hunting down of those men was giving them the reason for carrying on.  Those were the words of the Minister for Justice.  He used those words in the Dáil on the 23rd March, 1928 and when he was elected to power he was concerned in hunting those people down himself.</P>

      <P>If the Government are anxious to punish these illegal organisations and prevent them being an annoyance or a nuisance, the best thing is to ignore them completely.  They will die if they fail to get the support of the people, so it will be a matter for the people whether they are to die or to flourish.  I regret very much having to speak in the tone I have used in regard to the prison conditions, but I really believe it was my duty to speak, as I have an active interest in the prison conditions in my constituency and I have first-hand information.  It is very necessary for a Deputy with first-hand information&mdash;it is not necessary to disclose where he gets it or does not get it&mdash;to let those in authority see that he is in a position to secure first-hand information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister has nothing to hide behind the walls of Portlaoighise prison, he can see his way to give any Deputy who so desires an opportunity of going in.  If everything is all right and the conditions are perfect in regard to public health and sanitation and are in accordance with the wishes <Col N="1226" /> of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, if tuberculosis has not got a root there, the Minister should not care who goes in, as they will have nothing to criticise when they come out.  If there is something there for them to criticise, then it is the duty of the Minister to hide his face in shame and prevent any public representative from carrying out his duty as an elected representative of the people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I trust the Minister will see fit, if there is nothing wrong with the conditions I have referred to, to allow anybody who so desires, anybody in a public position who is anxious to look after the health of those who are interned and who is also anxious to protect the health of every citizen and to look after the expenditure of public funds in the prison, to visit these places.  I think he cannot have any objection to a public representative discharging his duties in a straightforward, conscientious manner and in an endeavour to help the Minister.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is inclined to imagine that I am more of a destructive Deputy than a constructive one. I am very anxious to assist the Minister as far as possible, to help him in every way possible.  I believe it is my duty, as it is the duty of all Deputies, when I see the Minister going wrong, to endeavour to lead him on the right lines again.  Instead of depriving a Deputy of his rights, I think the Minister should, as a matter of courtesy, permit a Deputy who so desires to visit such institutions, accompanied by the governor, or by a suitable person appointed by the governor.  If you wish to converse with any of the prisoners, we all know you cannot speak without one of the attendants listening.  Probably there is a lot to be said for that.  I do not object to it.</P>
    <P>I think parcels and letters should not be prohibited.  A citizen, while he is interned, should not be deprived of his correspondence.  He should be given an opportunity to keep his mind occupied at some suitable work.  We should have the prisoners associating <Col N="1227" /> with each other, talking together and discussing topics of various sorts, and the newspapers should be allowed in order that they may see what is going on in the outside world.</P>
    <P>I protest against the awful treatment that is being imposed on these men.  I trust that every citizen who has a keen interest in their welfare will protest in the strongest terms.  I believe, if the Minister is not prepared now to extend his sympathy towards these men, public opinion will eventually force him to take a sympathetic view.  Such a view should have been taken long ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that strikes me is the awful increase in expenditure in this Estimate since 1937-38.  It is really amazing.  In every section expenditure has gone up, in some cases to almost double the amount.  How long will the people in this little island be able to bear such a burden?  How long will it be until they put their feet down and say that this expenditure must stop?  The fact that we have had increases in expenditure every year since the present Government took office is a sure indication that in the years to come we will have further increases.  I say the time will come, there can be no doubt about it, when the people will insist that this heavy expenditure should stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear quite a lot about the Gárda Síochána.  In that department there is an immense increase.  There can be a lot said for and against the Guards. There are Deputies who will say they are not receiving sufficient remuneration. On the other hand, when you compare them with thousands of other citizens who have not such security or remuneration, there is no doubt their lot is not so bad as it has been painted. Anybody fortunate enough to be in the employment of the Government, to be a State official no matter how small the position may be, has a sense of security. He has State security behind him. The State contributes to the upkeep of his home and family and he has various little privileges that the average citizen does not possess.  For that reason, I for one will not be in favour <Col N="1228" /> of any further increases to any member of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Another thing that has caused a lot of talk for over 25 years is the judiciary, the court system in this country. The time was, 22 or 23 years ago, when people were encouraged to back up the Republican Courts and the Arbitration Courts.  Even though at that time the courts were cumbersome and awkward to a certain degree, there is no doubt that for at least a year or a year and a half they dispensed justice in a fair and equitable manner without any necessity for big salaries for the different judges.  I was surprised, until I spent a few months here, that the people who went out in those days with ideas of cutting down the system that was handed over to us by England, did not carry out their intentions.  What is the position to-day?  We find ourselves with a judicial system which, from the point of view of expenditure, is far in excess of what the people can pay.</P>
    <P>I think a police inspector or superintendent would be quite capable of dealing with the various little crimes that are committed throughout the country and that are brought into the District Courts.  There are such offences as having an unlighted bicycle or being absent from school and there ought not to be any necessity for having highly-paid officials going from court area to court area looking after petty things like these.  It means a big expenditure of the people's money.  That condition of affairs cannot be altered until the whole system is uprooted.  I expect that will not occur until we have a more or less enlightened Party in power.  If it can be achieved, it will save the taxpayers a lot of money.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have spoken of the housing conditions of the Gárda Síochána.  There is no doubt that when Guards, especially married men, are shifted from one locality to another, they find great difficulty in securing houses.  It is very often the case when one Guard swaps a position with another, they even swap their houses, but when the change is taking place the landlord decides that he will squeeze a few shillings more out of the incoming tenant and there is a consequent increase in the rent.  Perhaps <Col N="1229" /> some system could be devised whereby accommodation would be provided in close proximity to the barracks in order to facilitate Guards and their families when they are being transferred.  That would make things much easier for those men who are changed around from station to station.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan talked for quite a while on the conditions existing in the country.  It is time that a certain type of prisoner should be treated as a citizen and not as a criminal.  I refer to the unfortunate&mdash;if we may call him such&mdash;young Irishman who went out and shouted &ldquo;We want the 32 counties of Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; and, as a result of his enthusiasm, he found himself behind bars.  There are not many internees left, as the Minister told us yesterday.  Two wrongs have never made a right.  I do not want to criticise what has happened in the past four or five years, but I appeal to the Minister, now that we are approaching Easter, with its memories of Easter Week, that he should release these men and give them a chance.  If they are released we will see whether they are the lawless citizens they were supposed to be in times gone by.</P>
    <P>Every Irishman knows that while there are six counties of Ireland under British authority, you will find Irishmen prepared to stand up and use a gun, no matter against whom, in an effort to get the British out of there. We have all been taught that.  If we and our predecessors had not been taught in that way we might not have this Parliament. While these men may be wrong in taking that view, nevertheless they were sincere in their ideals, and they proved that by the various forms of death they suffered.  Any men who will die on hunger strike rather than give up their ideals definitely believe in what they preach.  Men who give up good jobs and are prepared to face 20 years behind prison bars definitely believe in what they preach.  Now that there has been a general amnesty for political prisoners in England, and that camps on the Continent are being emptied slowly, I think it is wrong for the Government to detain any longer <Col N="1230" /> anybody who has been sentenced to penal servitude.  It is all very well to talk, but while some of us are here we will make every effort to try to have political prisoners released.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan read a statement about conditions in some prisons.  I have first-hand information about some things that happened at the internment camp at the Curragh.  It is certainly not to the credit of any Government. I have known instances of men who were released after nine months or a year, and they were in such a nervous condition that they could not sleep at night, owing to the fact that while interned they were awakened every few hours, and the electric light was kept on continuously.  I know one case where a man who was arrested in 1932, and came out in 1934, was almost blind as a result of having to sleep while a high-powered electric light was kept on.  All that is past history now.  It would have been much better if it never happened.  I do not think it can have given any satisfaction to the Minister to have to intern these men. I honestly believe that, although he may have thought that one thing or another necessitated their internment.  I appeal to him now to release these men before Easter.  Some of them were sentenced to terms of 20 years' imprisonment.  Release them and give them a chance to prove that they will be good, honest Irish citizens like other internees who have been released are proving themselves to be.</P>
    <P>I look with great concern at the increased expenditure under this Estimate. It is one of many Estimates in which there is an increase.  While a good case could be made for an increase under different headings, I think it is time we got rid of some of the cumbersome methods and laws we still have, even though they may be the fairest in the world.  I think the law could be administered by good, honest men at much less expense than is at present necessary.  Look at what happens on the Continent.  We know that in France, which is the most republican, and the most democratic country in the world, justice in minor cases is administered by the mayors of the towns.  I am sure that the ordinary inspector or <Col N="1231" /> superintendent of the Gárdaí would be quite capable of doing such work here, thereby dispensing with the necessity of having district justices and, to a certain extent, Circuit Court judges.  It may be said that justices should be placed in a position where they would be above bribery or anything like that, but individuals could be got, who received only £100 yearly, to dispense justice, simply and solely for justice's sake.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we have in Ireland good men with legal knowledge who are prepared to do such work.  In that way there would be a definite saving if the matter was tackled in the right way.  In next year's Estimate I hope we will not have any further increases in this Vote.  The Fianna Fáil Party can blame themselves for losing the confidence of the people, for the simple reason that there has been an increase in expenditure in every Estimate.  The increase is going far beyond the people's power to meet it.  Finally, I appeal to the Minister for Justice, if he can, to release some of those who have spent seven or eight years in internment camps and prisons.</P>

      <P>My only reason for intervening in this debate is to express my strong disagreement with the views expressed by Deputy Commons, as far as they relate to our judicial system and to our courts.  We have a judicial system here that has proved to be eminently suitable to our requirements.  I think our courts are manned by judges and justices, from the Supreme Court to the District Courts, who command the complete confidence of the people.  Our courts and the system which surrounds them have proved to be one of the most successful experiments of this new State. <Col N="1232" /> I do not know anything about the system of dispensing justice in France, beyond what I read from time to time. It is not my function to criticise what happens there, beyond saying that I prefer our own system.  The system we have can compare with that of any other country, not only favourably but more than favourably with some countries with systems far longer established than ours.</P>
      <P>I venture to say that it would be nearly impossible to find judges who administer justice in as intelligent and as impartial a way as is the case here or administer justice at a lower cost.  I do not doubt what Deputy Commons said, that a number of honest men could be got, who would be prepared, to the best of their ability, to administer justice for perhaps £100 a year, but while not questioning their honesty, I certainly would question their competence. On reflection, I think the Deputy will agree that, in order to be able to interpret the laws passed by this Parliament, and to hand out evenhanded justice, we want not only men who are honest, but men who are trained in the ways of the law, and who have had long practical experience of dealing with law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago I had the honour to preside at a courts of justice commission which sat for nearly 12 months dealing with certain aspects of our judiciary and our judicial system.  We had the advantage of receiving evidence from all sections of the community, legal and non-legal.  A very searching inquiry was made by that commission which, speaking from recollection, consisted of 14 members drawn from all Parties in this House and about half of whom were trained lawyers.  They produced a report.  I simply want to say that as a result of my experience as chairman of that commission and as a result of my observation as an ordinary layman, I think the system we have here is particularly suited to our requirements.  I do not think a more effective, a cheaper or a more efficient system of administering what I call local justice than the district justices could be conceived. They have worked admirably.  Our judges from the lowest to the highest <Col N="1233" /> grade are above and beyond suspicion and we have fortunately placed them in the position that they are completely and absolutely independent.  I hope that position will never be touched.</P>

      <P>Several important matters have been dealt with on this Estimate.  The first Deputy to raise the question of the undesirability of having temporary district justices was Deputy McGilligan.  That was taken up by Deputy Costello and others.  I thoroughly agree but I still maintain that there is such a special set of circumstances here as make it not easy to decide how many extra permanent district justices we will require to have.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out in my opening statement, there were three district justices very ill for long periods at the same time.  In addition, we had to get district justices for holiday duty.  That meant that we had at least three more than we had this time last year.  As I have already told the House, I have authority to bring in a Bill providing for a permanent addition in the Dublin courts and, as far as I can devise, I will do anything in my power to see that we have as few temporary justices as possible.  It will not be always possible to avoid appointing temporary district justices.  People will get ill no matter what you do and there may be circumstances which may require extra help when it simply must be got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of crime generally, everyone can have his own opinion. Deputy Costello may be right.  There may be moral deterioration here or perhaps through the world generally, but I still believe, as I said on the last occasion when we dealt with that matter that the increase in crime was very largely due to the scarcity of articles of common use, that people were in the habit of having and simply would not do without.  People who ordinarily would never come under the notice of the police, simply yielded to temptation when they were deprived of something they were in the habit of having.  I think that had a lot to do with it.  I will be very interested, for instance, to see how many bicycles have been stolen this year as compared with <Col N="1234" /> the number that was stolen a year ago.  I would be very surprised if there has not been a very great reduction.  I am still of the opinion that the war and emergency conditions were responsible very largely for the increase in crime.  There is the other point about Dublin City.  Undoubtedly, the population has increased enormously and, naturally, the work of the courts has increased.  For that reason alone, if there were no special circumstances, we would require more justices in this city and more police.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan raised the matter about the depreciation of the pound.  I do not propose to follow him.  That would be for the Minister for Finance. I should like to remind the Deputy, however, that everyone has had the value of his money reduced, from the judge down to the lowest-paid person. I do not know what is going to be done or at what point prices are going to stabilise, or what the pound will be worth ultimately.  We will have to wait and see, but I do not think that in that matter the Guards are any worse off than anybody else.  I do not want to bring in any discordant note, because the debate was very welcome, but I think it is remarkable that one Deputy on the opposite side quoted figures showing the increase in costs while others were saying we are not paying enough and that the money is only worth half its pre-war value.  That would be an explanation.  Even if our general costs and general taxation were doubled, according to Deputy McGilligan, at any rate it would only have the same purchasing value as it had a few years ago.  I do not intend to go into that.  That is not my particular line.  I merely want to say that the Guards are not worse off than any other section of the community.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any question about morale.  As far as the question that was raised about <Col N="1235" /> Guards cutting turf is concerned, I think it is quite a good thing.  A Guard is not supposed to be working all the time on duty.  Surely he has some time off, and I think it is a very creditable thing that Guards should use that time in cutting turf.  I know that in the City of Dublin any amount of them when they are off duty go to the mountain and cut their turf.  Surely there is nothing wrong in that.  There may be some other case referred to by some Deputy.  If there are cases where abuses have occurred, if such abuses are reported to the Commissioner, he will deal with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that in the country we often see a Guard hanging around doing nothing, but people forget that he is not expected to be on duty for 24 hours in the day and people forget than an eight-hour day is the general run.  The Guard is not expected to be working for the State all the time.  He is available all the time, certainly, and that has to be borne in mind.  Deputy Cogan referred to the extra duties.  I agree with Deputy Cogan on that matter.  I said the same last year.  I think it is quite a good thing to give the Guards, especially in country places, more work of the kind they are doing and I think the tendency will be in that direction.  The collection of statistics and all sorts of new Acts certainly are putting more work on the Guards, but if they could get more pay I think that would be a cheaper and more efficient service than getting civil servants to do it, and much better.  I think it would be done much better and, as far as I am concerned, I would be all in favour of extending rather than reducing it in the country places.  In the city I do not think it is done to such an extent. There are certain duties that might not be altogether regarded as police duties but, generally speaking, in cities they are doing more police duties proper, traffic duties and things of that kind. I do not agree with Deputy Coogan at all.  I think Deputy Cogan was on far sounder lines.  That is my view at any <Col N="1236" /> rate.  Last year Deputy Coogan dealt with mechanisation.  That was inquired into.  I am not sure, but I think he was on that commission himself.  That commission went into the question very thoroughly.  I raised that question when I was much younger.  I thought it was a good idea that there should be more mobile units but, on reflection and experience, I do not think I was right.  I think the present tendency is much better.  I dare say there is a case for more supervision and inspections and the Commissioner is aware of it.  Emergency conditions and the petrol position militated against inspections but I am sure the Commissioner will see to it that there will be more inspections in future than there have been for some years past.</P>
      <P>With reference to the question of rent allowance, I thought the Guards were very pleased when they got the new scale.  Naturally, everybody wants more if he can get it.  I thought they got a fair enough allowance when they got £40.  That is not supposed to pay the full rent, but certainly £40 goes a long way towards meeting the rent of a house.  No matter what anyone may say, the Rent Restrictions Act has stabilised rents anyway at the 1941 figure.  It was only about then that any attempt was made to raise rents. I thought they were all right in 1939 or 1940 and when this rent allowance was increased they certainly should have been all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the housing of the Guards generally, I said that our policy is to build houses for the Guards through the country whenever we are able to do so.  The emergency conditions still operate so far as supplies of materials are concerned.  We hope to have that matter dealt with as soon as possible.  It certainly will be proceeded with.  We have to try to get as early a priority as possible.  Everybody is aware that the materials are not available yet.  We are well aware of the necessity for it.  Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about reorganisation of the Dublin areas.  I do not know what the position is in regard to that, but I will take it up with the Commissioner.  I thought there had been reorganisation. <Col N="1237" /> I will bring that matter to the Commissioner's attention.</P>
    <P>As to the question of legal aid for poor persons, that is a matter that I did not altogether turn down.  It is not such an easy thing to deal with.  It is a matter for the Rule-making Committee to consider and make suggestions. That was contemplated in Section 75 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  I got a reply from the secretary of the Superior Court Rule-Making Committee saying that the committee were of opinion that legal aid should be provided, but they did not tell us how it should be done.  I am asking them to give us more information as to how it should be done.  I would not be inclined to agree that people should be financed in connection with ordinary civil actions.  It is a different matter when the State is taking an action against them.  Surely if a person thinks he has a legal case against somebody else there is no need for such aid.  I hope to get a reply from the committee on the matter and I may have something to say about it next year.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice has agreed to act as chairman of the Legal Reform Committee, and we probably will get a report from that committee in regard to that question.  There has been a slight increase in probation officers in Dublin. I think two appointments have been made.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the help we were getting from the voluntary organisations.  I am afraid it was not as satisfactory as we would like.  I should like to see more organisations taking up that work.</P>
    <P>Deputy O Briain raised the matter of examinations for the Guards, and thought all applicants should be admitted to the examination.  He spoke in Irish when raising the matter, and I have to apologise to him because I am not sufficiently fluent in Irish to reply to him in that language.  The Commissioner is the person who recruits people for the Guards.  It is necessary to have an examination.  All the applications are considered by the Commissioner, and he only calls the people for examination who he thinks would be the most likely to succeed or who would make the most suitable Guards.  He also tries to allocate a <Col N="1238" /> certain percentage to each county. Deputies would have more complaints if every applicant was allowed to sit for the examination.  It is not a competitive examination.  Of course, the physical qualifications of the applicants are more important in the case of the Guards than other qualifications. You would have more objections if all the applicants passed the qualifying examination and only 100 of them were called up.  On the whole, I think the present system is the best one.  As to sending Irish-speaking Guards to the Gaeltacht, there is a special system under which Guards are paid extra if they are Irish speakers.  I will ask the Commissioner what he thinks about the Deputy's proposal to have some of the younger men who know Irish sent to the Gaeltacht for a period to relieve others there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into that; I do not know anything about that.  Deputy Cogan raised the question of itinerants, as to which I shall have inquiries made.  I imagine that the Guards are doing their best to get the correct figures.  Deputy Costello raised the matter of temporary district justices.  He asked was it a fact that the position was that no one would be appointed a permanent district justice unless he had served in a temporary capacity.  All I have to say about that is that when there is a temporary district justice required it is not easy to get one, as practising barristers or solicitors are not always prepared to throw up their practice to take the position of temporary district justice. If you have somebody who agrees to serve as a temporary district justice and you find him satisfactory, it is only natural to say: &ldquo;This man has been with us 12 or 18 months and has proved satisfactory, and it is only fair that he should get the preference&rdquo;. To that extent what Deputy Costello said is correct, but only to that extent. I think anyone would give a man a preference who proved satisfactory <Col N="1239" /> when acting in a temporary capacity. That is not essential, however.  If we found that temporary men were not satisfactory we would not appoint them permanently.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan complained that he was not allowed to visit Portlaoighise prison.  The only thing I can say about that is that he is rather young.  If he were older, I would not have any objection. I think he was the only Deputy to whom I refused permission, and I did it deliberately.  When he is somewhat more mature, I am sure I will have no objection to his going there.  I think anybody listening to his speech would say that he has a lot to learn yet.  There are some people in that prison who are having a hard time of it, but it is all their own fault.  The question is: are we going to allow these people to run the prison or is the Governor to run it?  They will not conform to the prison rules.  They want to be treated as other than criminals. They are as much criminals as a man who shoots a Guard or commits a robbery, or shoots with intent to kill. Surely such a man is a criminal.  He is no better than others who are committed to prison for some crime.  These other people obey the rules.  Unless I am prepared to have the whole prison system smashed by eight or nine people, then I will have to insist that the rules will be carried out, and while I am Minister I am going to do that.</P>

It was done for propaganda purposes.  Still I did not enjoy doing it, because I did not think it was justified.  I took what was coming to me, however, and I did not whine.</P>
