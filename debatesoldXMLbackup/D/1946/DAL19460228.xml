    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether it is the general policy of the Government and of Ministers to make statements of national importance over the radio in the first instance, and, if so, if he will consider changing this policy and arranging for all such statements by Ministers to be made first of all in Dáil Eireann in order that Deputies may have an opportunity of discussing such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Statements of national importance are made by Ministers when and where, and by such means as, they judge to be appropriate and best in the public interest.  It is quite wrong to assume, as the Deputy appears to do, that such statements ought necessarily be made in the first instance in Dáil Eireann.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there are occasions when it is the duty of Ministers to make important statements with the least possible delay and to the largest possible audience.  The procedure of the Dáil and the arrangements for its meetings do not lend themselves readily to the making of such statements without delay.  Furthermore, there are occasions such as public gatherings and functions when it is proper and necessary that if Ministers are to speak at all they should feel themselves at liberty to address themselves to subjects of importance of a nature suitable to the particular occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as was indicated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on a <Col N="1682" /> previous occasion in the Seanad, Ministers have a function other than that of leading the Oireachtas.  They are concerned to see that the public are informed about matters that affect the interests of the public and to guide opinion so that the course of action which is deemed best in the national interest may be taken by members of the public.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution the Government is the executive body.  It is at the same time responsible to the Dáil and collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by its members.  The actions of the Government or its policies wherever stated can always be brought to the attention of the Dáil.  If the Dáil disapproves of any such action or policy there is an obvious remedy.  I must, of course, assume that the Deputy is aware that when statements are made by Ministers of intentions which can only be carried into effect by legislation or by the expenditure of public moneys these matters must inevitably in due course come before the Dáil for full discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach does he now lay down the proposition that where there are important new developments in matters of policy by the Government that they may be announced to the public on the radio over the head of Parliament?  Does he declare it as a matter of policy that at his own sweet will he will ignore Parliament whenever it suits and use it when he wants to do so or is he prepared to agree?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of the gravest Constitutional importance.  I am putting the alternative.  Am I to take it that the Taoiseach agrees that ordinarily if an acute emergency exists requiring the utmost dispatch in communicating vital information that he will take it as his duty to communicate new policy or an important matter of policy to Dáil Eireann first and then, having taken that precaution, resume his and his Minister's complete liberty to address the people directly on the matter as he may think fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I put in full, in reply to the question, the principle which I think should govern action in these matters.  Everything will depend on the particular case.  On occasions I have asked special leave to come to the Dáil to make statements, because I thought it was the proper place to make them, but there are other occasions when I made statements elsewhere.  I could not say in advance what particular type of statement should be made here or what particular type could be made elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that Dáil Eireann would be the most representative Assembly for Ministers to make statements of national importance?  Is he not aware that a statement, something like the recent one on tillage, should have been made in Dáil Eireann in order to give the elected representatives of the people an opportunity of discussing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take a particular case we can argue about it. It is not my view that the Dáil was the most appropriate place even if it were sitting when there was a statement about tillage to be made such as that statement was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this matter arose as a result of a question I asked last week when I referred the Taoiseach to a statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce over the radio about our food supplies.  When I asked about our food supply and the radio announcement I was referred to the Taoiseach.  What opportunity have we of getting reliable statements if there is no White Paper available? How can we as Dáil representatives get sufficient information from the Government as to food supplies being right?</P>

      <P>While the development of coal mines is, in general, primarily a matter for private enterprise, the development of mineral deposits which, though promising, do not attract private enterprise, has been entrusted to Mianraí Teóranta, which company fulfils the functions of the board envisaged by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention was directed to the provisions of Section 63 (which provides for the making of certain reciprocal agreements) of the British National Insurance Bill (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6); whether he has considered if that section will authorise the making of agreements with this country concerning the payment of sickness, unemployment, retirement and other benefits to persons residing in this country who have contributions to their credit in the British National Insurance Fund, and whether he will avail himself of the enactment of the measure in question to negotiate an agreement designed to remove the hardship inflicted on a number of people who, although having contributions to their credit in British National Insurance Funds, are deprived of benefit from such funds on their return to their homes in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan  Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Flanagan</b> asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether he has now considered the report submitted to him by the local authority relative to the housing scheme at Clara, Offaly; whether he is prepared to make public the terms of the report; and whether he proposes to have the scheme examined by an engineering officer of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  In the housing scheme in Clara to which the question refers there are 144 labourers' cottages.  These were erected in the early years of the war and tenancies were allocated in the year 1942.  The all-in cost of the scheme was approximately £62,000, or £430 per cottage. The cottages are of a type similar to that which has been erected in many other towns in Offaly, concerning which no complaints have been received from the tenants.  They have water and sewerage.  The economic rent is 11/- a week.  The State subsidy contributes 3/10 to this, the rates 4/2 and the rent paid by the tenant is 3/-.  The tenants of the Clara scheme have made a number of demands which, if acceded to, would raise the economic rent to 13/- a week.  A number of works which have been demanded by the tenants were deferred in emergency conditions both because of scarcity of materials and in order to keep the rents charged to the tenants at a low figure.</P>
      <P>The report submitted to me indicates that the main demands made by the tenants in this regard were for:&mdash;(a) the provision of two extra fireplaces in each house; (b) the provision of a turf-shed for each house; (c) the fencing of plots, repair of roadway and the provision of electric light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also indicates that the tenants' representatives refused to <Col N="1688" /> accept an arrangement whereby part of the cost of the extra works would be borne by way of an increase in the rents; that the fencing of the plots had to be deferred owing to the supply situation but is at present in hands and will be completed within the next few months; that the repair of the roadway had to be deferred owing to a shortage of tar; that the Electricity Supply Board had intimated that owing to the prevailing supply conditions they are not in a position to extend their lines to this scheme at present.</P>
    <P>Other demands, such as the removal of the ranges which had been installed in the houses, and the provision, free, of garbage bins, were made by the tenants.  The report I have received indicates that the tenants were informed that garbage bins would not be supplied free by the county council, but the tenants were given the option of buying these articles at the contract price to the council; and that the tenants were not unanimous about having the ranges removed: some of them would not hear of such action being taken.  It will be appreciated that houses provided by local authorities, heavily subsidised as they are from the rates and by the Exchequer, must be of standard design and provided with standard equipment; they cannot be provided with special amenities to suit all the individual requirements of particular tenants.</P>
    <P>The matter, at this stage, is essentially one for the local authority, who I am informed have it under active consideration.  No immediate action on my part is called for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the scheme is in a deplorable state and will he state if he is prepared to make public the full text of the report which he received from the county manager and, if so, if he would forward a copy of the report he received from the county manager to the county council for their observations and recommendations, and whether he is prepared to send down his Department's engineer to investigate and to find out if the scheme has been completed in accordance with the <Col N="1689" /> specifications laid down in the contract?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that these particular tenants are very lucky to be in occupation of houses which have been built during the war at such high cost to the community and that there are many other people who are without houses who are very envious of their condition.

      <P>As stated in my reply to a question by Deputy Everett on the 5th December last the provisions of Part VIII of the Mental Treatment Act cannot be applied until the whole Act is brought into operation.

    <P>Mr. Donovan submitted an application under the Army Pensions Acts, 1927 and 1943, claiming that he suffered from a disability attributable to service during the emergency period.

Such a man may not have been exactly up to the standard, but in emergency times he must have been passed as physically fit.  We must take it for granted that he was medically fit when he passed the doctors and was allowed to join the Army.  In the case of a man who has been passed as medically fit and, after being some time in the Army, is discharged as medically unfit as a result of Army service, are we to understand that he will not get any gratuity or pension or money whatever to compensate him in some way for the break-down in his health?

      <P>It is a fact that portion of a consignment of Miles &ldquo;Magister&rdquo; aircraft which was recently purchased for the Air Corps has arrived at Baldonnel. My attention has been drawn to a report in a Dublin morning newspaper of the 19th instant on this matter.  The statement in the report that the &ldquo;Magister&rdquo; has been replaced by the &ldquo;Harvard&rdquo; is not correct.  The &ldquo;Magister&rdquo; is an elementary trainer while the &ldquo;Harvard&rdquo; is an advanced trainer.  I am informed that the &ldquo;Harvard&rdquo; was tried as an initial training aircraft but was not found suitable for the purpose.  I am advised that the &ldquo;Magisters&rdquo; do not suffer from disadvantages and that they are, in fact, eminently suitable.  As regards the question of intercommunication, it can be stated that the aeroplanes which have been purchased are fitted with the latest type of electrical intercommunication. The expression &ldquo;visual intercommunication&rdquo; is unknown to air authorities in this connection.  I may mention that, before this type of aircraft was purchased, my Department was aware that numerous other countries were buying and using this aircraft as elementary trainers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1946, for Transport and Meteorological Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, this Estimate arises out of the invitation which was extended to us by the Interim Council of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation to convene a meeting of States directly interested in air navigation in the North Atlantic area, to discuss the provisions needed <Col N="1704" /> to protect and support civil air operations in that area.  That request from the Interim Council was accepted by the Government and the conference, entitled the North Atlantic Route Service Conference, will meet in Dublin next week.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the duration of the conference will be from two to three weeks and it is expected that the delegates, observers and others attending will number approximately 200.  The main problems before the conference will be the organisation into a coordinated system of all the air navigational facilities at present available for civil use in the North Atlantic area, the question of the provision of such civil facilities as may be required to ensure speedy and safe air transport in that area and to prescribe standardised procedure for the operation of air transport facilities.  Each State will bear the cost of its own delegates and this Government will bear the cost of the secretariat.  Certain expenditure is involved in connection with the preparation of the rooms in Dublin Castle for the conference and it is proposed to offer official entertainment to persons attending the conference.</P>
    <P>So far as can be estimated, in the light of present information as to the duration of the conference and the probable number of persons attending, the total expenditure falling upon the Transport and Meteorological Services Vote is approximately £2,600.  Of that amount, approximately £1,500 will fall for payment in this year.  In the main, that expenditure will be offset by savings on other sub-heads of the Vote; and because it is a form of expenditure not contemplated when the Vote was originally being passed by the Dáil, it is necessary to have a Supplementary Estimate.  The amount which the Dáil is asked to vote is, as will be noted, only £10.</P>

I would like to suggest to the Minister that copies of <Col N="1705" /> the agenda, which I understand has been prepared, and of the documentation which has been prepared in connection with the agenda, should be placed in the Library and that such day-to-day documentation as will go on while the conference is in session should be similarly available to Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this Supplementary Estimate to have a very great deal more significance and importance than its size would suggest.  I rarely find myself called upon to congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but on this occasion I think he has done the country a real service in accommodating this conference in Dublin.  I believe the assembling of an international conference of this character, of a purely business kind, is a desirable thing and it is a good thing that we should be in a position to provide it with hospitality, accommodation and facilities for the discharge of its international business.  However, I dare to say to the Minister that this must be one of the first conferences of this character that has gathered here and I would urge him to say to those officers of the various Departments on whose services he will rely for the accommodation of the various delegates who <Col N="1706" /> come here that, on this first occasion when we are constructing the organisation to deal with an assembly which is not only international but polyglot, questions of expense should not be allowed to stand in their way in building up an organisation which will really deal with the conference problems that arise for a host of a convention of that character.</P>
      <P>One is so accustomed to the ways of one's own city, one is so accustomed, if one fails to find the amenity one requires in one street, to know in what other streets one may reasonably find it, one is so accustomed, if one fails to get luncheon in one hotel, to know instinctively where one can find provision somewhere else in our city, that one is liable to forget that a Spaniard in Dublin is as completely at sea as one of us in St. Petersburg, and we know how hopelessly and foolishly at sea one may find oneself in a foreign city, particularly if one does not know the language.  I have attended a good many international gatherings, sometimes under the distinguished leadership of the Ceann Comhairle himself, and, I think, in the company of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, and it has been of immense assistance to delegates at gatherings of that kind to know of the existence of some central point where one can go to get information about everything.</P>
      <P>I know the officers of the Department are probably better informed of these particular difficulties and troubles than I am, as they have much wider experience.  What I am concerned about is to sound a note here to-day, for the officers of the various Departments charged with the extending of that hospitality and the provision of accommodation, to get them to realise that, if they find themselves in conflict with the Department of Finance, they ought to appeal to their Minister and that their Minister ought to know that the feeling of the House would be that we would wish to err on the side of extravagance rather than on parsimony on this initial occasion when it is desired to do things as they should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second point I wish to <Col N="1707" /> make.  I have found that if you prepare hospitality for an ascertained number of persons, if you have laid an elaborate table which depends on their all turning up, 17 of them do not come and your table looks like nothing on earth.  On the other hand, if you have cooked a certain quantity of desirable food, their aunts, uncles, cousins and nephews all come and the victuals run short.  I have no doubt the Minister has taken every precaution to ascertain accurately the hotel accommodation that will be required for the various delegations arriving.  I dare to prophesy that, just because at this moment the hotels of Dublin are strained to the limit of their capacity, 15 delegates will arrive whom nobody expects, or some influential delegate will discover that his lady has not been looking so well lately and, as he is going to give himself a holiday in Ireland, he will bring her.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important, therefore, that the Department should hold in hand a certain reserve of hotel accommodation over and above what they are advised is actually necessary, so that if a development of that kind arises provision can be made for the unexpected and these people will not be required to go, let us say, to Mullingar in order to get a bed to sleep in, or else be housed in some very unsuitable lodging in a city back street.  I do not know if the Minister's attention has been directed to that aspect, but I think he will agree with me that it is one of considerable importance.  I believe every person who has travelled will agree on that point.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  When you get out to Collinstown and leave by aeroplane for London, you may find yourself in possession of a good deal of Irish currency.  Irish notes can be changed at a discount in any bank in London, but will an English bank change Irish silver and copper?  I suppose international delegates should not worry too much about 15/11.  My experience, however, has been that a pocket full of centimes or nickels such as I brought with me from America&mdash; I brought the centimes from France&mdash; have been a source of irritation to me. <Col N="1708" /> I had the feeling that I had lost something irretrievable and got so much rubbish instead.  These things can be like razor blades from the point of view of disposing of them.  Would it be unreasonable to suggest that we should establish a <i>Bureau de Change</i> where persons coming by aeroplane will hand in their Irish currency and get British or other currency instead?  It is a very simple service and it could be operated in connection with the restaurant, but it is the type of service that would be very much appreciated by strangers and it is the kind of gesture which would cause visitors to feel: &ldquo;These fellows have thought of everything.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regret that I must raise here in a preliminary canter, to which I propose to return on a wider occasion, a matter which, I think, sooner or later, must engage the attention of the Tánaiste.  Our delegation to this conference will be led by the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce. I am constrained to say that I want it perfectly clearly understood that nothing I am about to say is to be interpreted as any sort of reflection on that distinguished public servant, for whose abilities and energy I have the profoundest respect.  Deputies interested in the business of the Department of Industry and Commerce cannot but have observed that the Secretary of that Department now represents his Minister on the boards of about nine important companies. He is now one of the most occupied company directors acting on behalf of his Minister in this country.  He is the executive head of an immense Department, one of the largest Departments of State, in which there is a greater volume of detailed work than probably in any other Department in Dublin.  It is natural he must be expected to be at the disposal of his Minister continually for consultation and advice.  He must be available for the proper co-ordination of the activities of the myriad State servants under his jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I feel bound to put this point to the Tánaiste.  This official is about to lead our delegation at a very important international conference.  Frankly, I think that for any of the individual <Col N="1709" /> tasks that have been assigned to him probably no man is better fitted than he, if natural ability alone and industry and loyalty are the criteria by which a man is to be judged.  But no man, the most willing servant in the world, can do three men's work properly and I do not think it is right to resort to the expedient of leaving a man in a nominal office and requiring another public servant to discharge all the ordinary duties of that office, but to deny another public servant the honour and emoluments of the first place.  We have an excellent precedent in many other Governments, where the volume of work has exceeded the capacity of any man.</P>
    <P>An additional and new office can be created.  In this case perhaps the individual might be regarded as commercial adviser to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any name one may care to put to it, leaving the present secretary free to carry out the special works that the Minister has thought it prudent to assign to him and allow a civil servant to administer the Department as secretary at the same time.  If the Minister is resolved to continue in what is to me the detestable and obnoxious policy of establishing semi-State companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are considering an Estimate to enable Mr. Seán Leydon, Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, to lead an Irish delegation at an international conference.  The leader of the Opposition questioned the Tánaiste, who replied: &ldquo;We shall bear the expenses of our own delegation.&rdquo;  Did I hear him wrongly?  I think not.  If so, this money is being in part provided to meet the expenses of our own delegation. That delegation is being led by the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  My representation to the House is that there is being placed on that officer an accumulation of burdens ancillary to the ordinary duties of the executive head of a Department which no individual can be expected to bear and discharge his task to the best of his capacity.  I raise it in regard to this matter because I desire to notify the Minister that I shall return to it in greater detail on the main Estimate, when he brings it before the House, and in order that he may be prepared to meet that and in the meantime to consider the reasoned representations I have made on this occasion, I have made the appointment of the Secretary to the leadership of this delegation an occasion for, as I think, a moderate and reasoned series of observations in connection with the general problem of which this forms a part.</P>

We have too few air conferences, or any other type of international conference, in this city or country and I do not, therefore, think anyone should wish to enshroud this <Col N="1711" /> Estimate with views of one kind or another as to the way in which we shall entertain visiting delegates, the kind of food we shall serve up to them and the type of entertainment to which they will be invited.</P>

All I want to say to the Minister and to the House is that every Party will welcome the selection of Ireland as the venue of the air conference.  We all extend a cordial welcome to the delegates.  So far as this House is concerned, it will give the Government every authority it needs to extend to the delegates the utmost courtesy as well as unfailing hospitality during their stay.  It is to be hoped that they will go away with pleasant memories of their visit and will take with them to a world in which we have been misrepresented a new view of Ireland. With that atmosphere for the forthcoming conference, I think we will have done very good work.  I should like to say to the Tánaiste that the Dáil will give him all the authority he needs to do the delegates well, so that <Col N="1712" /> they may carry away a pleasant picture of Ireland which in pre-emergency days was always noted for its kindness and generosity to visitors.

      <P>If the House turns to the Third Schedule they will note that among the public bodies referred to is the Dublin Port and Docks Board. The House has recently considered and I think passed the Harbours Bill which <i>inter alia</i> deals with harbour authorities. Therefore, it will not be necessary in this Bill to deal with harbour authorities.  Accordingly it is proposed to delete the Dublin Port and Docks Board from the Third Schedule.  There are two boards mentioned in the schedule and we are transferring them to the section.  I was dealing really with amendment No. 86, which proposes to delete the sub-section and to substitute for it the names of the two boards mentioned.</P>

      <P>May we ask why the Minister did not put the amendment to the Third Schedule to the section? It would have been much simpler.  The Minister is not merely deleting the Port and Docks Board but he is transferring, as has been pointed out, from the schedule indirectly to the section. I suggest that if the Minister wants to get rid of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, the simple way is to move to delete it out of the schedule and that does not interfere in any way with the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's attitude to the Third Schedule has been <Col N="1715" /> made abundantly clear because he proposes to delete it altogether and to transfer the two significant boards mentioned in it to Section 50.  I suppose perhaps the best way I could begin to explain this to the House would be to refer Deputies to the marginal note which shows that Section 50 relates merely to the accounts of certain public bodies.  It does not relate to the general control of these public bodies but it does relate to the provisions which must be made for the audit of the accounts of the public bodies mentioned.  Let me first of all point out that Section 1 is in fact a definition section.  It provides that, for the purposes of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1902, which, I think, is the fundamental Act governing the audit of accounts of public bodies, in this section, that is Section 50, each of the following bodies and no other bodies shall be a public body &mdash;that is to say, (a) a local authority and, if the amendment is accepted by the House, the Dublin Fever Hospital Board which is already in existence, and the Cork Fever Hospital Board which will come into existence when the Cork Fever Hospital is either built or in course of erection.  In relation to the audits of public bodies, difficulties have arisen as to the meaning of the term &ldquo;public bodies&rdquo;. Section 23 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1902, defines this term as &ldquo;any council, board, commissioners or committee, whose accounts are; under this or any other Act, or any Provisional Order confirmed by an Act, subject to audit by an auditor of the Local Government Board&rdquo;&mdash;or, as the position is now, following the implementation of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, by an auditor appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  This Bill first of all repeals this section of the 1902 Act and defines public bodies as it is defined in the Bill&mdash;a local authority or the two bodies I have mentioned: the Dublin Fever Hospital Board or the Cork Fever Hospital Board.  They are defined as public bodies for the narrow purpose of the auditing of their accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> The purpose of this section is to remove these difficulties and doubts which have arisen in regard to some other bodies where accounts are audited by local government auditors as, for instance, the educational endowments and the accounts of the central midwives boards.  The fact that the accounts of these bodies are audited by local government auditors &mdash;we wish to make this quite clear&mdash; does not make them public bodies or bring them within Section 20 of the Local Government Act, 1902, which, as I have already indicated, relates to the auditor charging persons accounting with deficiencies or loss.</P>
    <P>In addition to this ambiguity and uncertainty as to what bodies are in fact public bodies, other difficulties have also arisen.  Section 58 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, requires the accounts of vocational education committees to be audited by an auditor appointed by the Minister for Local Government and, in consequence of that, applies enactments relating to the accounts of local authorities, including, among other provisions, Sections 20 and 21 of the Local Government Act, 1902.  These sections relate to the accounts of public bodies, and their express application to vocational committees was unnecessary, but the Act of 1930 applied the section and, arising out of that, certain other uncertainties have arisen.  These sections, I should say, relate to accounts of public bodies and, as I have already said, their application was in fact unnecessary but the fact that the accounts of a vocational education committee are required by Section 58 of the Act of 1930, and also by Section 68 of the Local Government Act, 1941, to be audited by an auditor appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health makes a vocational education committee a public body for the purpose of the Act of 1902 and automatically applies, not only Sections 20 and 21, but also Section 22 of that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Act of 1902 empowers the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to make regulations as to the audit and to prescribe the form of accounts.  On the <Col N="1717" /> other hand, the Minister for Education has power, under Section 125, to make regulations governing the form of the accounts and has in fact exercised that power.  The result is that we have now two Ministers, the Minister for Local Government on the one hand, under the Act of 1902, the Act of 1930 and the Act of 1941, with power to regulate the accounts and audit of vocational education committees and, on the other hand, we have the Minister for Education, under the Vocational Education Act of 1930, with similar powers.  As I pointed out, the Minister for Education has exercised his power under the Act which he administers while the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has excluded the committees from the Public Bodies Order, 1942, so that there is in fact, so far as procedure is concerned, no conflict or difficulty but the legal position is, I think the House will admit, unsatisfactory and one of the purposes, perhaps the main purpose of this section, is to clear up that legal difficulty and make it quite clear that so far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned, the only public bodies to which the Act of 1902 applies as a local government measure are the public bodies which have been mentioned in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 50 and the other two bodies which are mentioned in the amendment now before the House. This applies not only, may I say, to vocational education committees, but also to county committees of agriculture. In these cases also we have two Ministers with similar powers to regulate the accounts and audits of the committees.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, a further difficulty has arisen under the Fisheries Acts, 1842 to 1944.  As the House is perhaps aware, under these Acts boards of conservators of fisheries have been set up and provisions relating, in particular, to the appointment of auditors, accounting periods, charges for audit, recovery of sums, etc., were made.  By Part VII of the Local Government Act, 1941, it was intended that these provisions should apply to all public bodies audited by auditors appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  As I <Col N="1718" /> pointed out, with this intention, Section 67 of that Act made vocational education committees and committees of agriculture local authorities for the purpose of Part VII.  Unfortunately, boards of conservators of fisheries were omitted from Section 67.  It is now proposed under Section 5 that Sections 69, 70 and 71 of the Act of 1941 shall apply to boards of conservators under the Fisheries Acts.  It is now proposed to declare these boards of conservators to be local authorities for the purposes of the sections I have mentioned.  Section 15 of the Fisheries Act, 1925, requires the accounts of boards of conservators to be audited by an auditor appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and, as I have already indicated, the relevant sections, Sections 20 and 21, of the Act of 1902 relate to the accounts of public bodies.  The effect, therefore, is that the accounts of a board of conservators are required by Section 15 of the 1925 Act to be audited by an auditor appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and such a board is made a public body for the purposes of the Act of 1902.  It automatically applies not only Sections 20 and 21, but also Section 22, which gives the Minister for Local Government power to make regulations as to audit and to prescribe the form of accounts.  On the other hand, under Section 15 (3) of the Fisheries Act, the Minister for Fisheries has power to make regulations as to the conduct of the audit and to prescribe the form of accounts.</P>
    <P>We have arising in that case the same sort of situation I have already described to the House as existing in regard to the form of accounts and audit of these accounts for vocational education committees and committees of agriculture.  We want to try if we can to clarify that position and make it quite clear.  The real purpose of the section, therefore, is to eliminate the present duality of powers in relation to the accounts and audits of bodies such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should say also that sub-section (6) of the section deals with the position of county manager.  Under the County Management Acts, 1940 and 1942, the <Col N="1719" /> county manager for a county is an officer of the council of that county. But he is also, by virtue of that office, manager for every elective body the functional area of which is wholly within such county.  Sub-section (6) of Section 50 of this Bill makes the manager for the purposes of Section 20 of the Act an officer of the local authorities for which he is a manager and renders him amenable at audit under that section for any deficiency or loss incurred by his neglect or misconduct.</P>

      <P>The purpose of my amendment No. 142 is to direct attention to the position obtaining to-day under local government audits.  The accounts of many local authorities have not been audited for something like three years and I think that the failure to carry out annual audits is in a large measure responsible for some of the looseness that is being discovered to-day when extraordinary audits are directed by the Minister.  What I had in mind when I put down this amendment was to get an assurance from the Minister that whatever steps may be necessary will be taken by him to ensure that every local authority which is brought under the audit section of the Department of Local Government will, as a matter of course, have their accounts audited annually.  I think it is a very important matter that this should be done because I have personal experience of cases where I believe that a certain looseness did grow up from the fact that audits were not carried out every year.  When the officials of certain local authorities get it into their heads that an audit may be three or four years away, it is quite on the cards that they may take certain chances, even without criminal intent. Suddenly, an audit is arranged and these officials may be caught out.  I think it would be fair to everybody concerned if it could be arranged that <Col N="1720" /> the audit would take place at a fixed period every year and, for that purpose, I think the Minister should increase the audit staff of his Department. I have no argument to put forward as to the merits of the case of the Cork Street Fever Hospital or the new Cork Fever Hospital.  The only reason I had was that if, at the present time, you cannot carry out automatically an audit of the accounts of local authorities under the Minister's supervision, we should not add to that until we have an assurance that an annual audit will be assured in future.</P>

      <P>The effect of the Minister's amendment, apart from the section, seems to be that it will discharge the Dublin Port and Docks Board from the provisions of Section 50.  When I read this Bill originally I was a little surprised to find that that board was included in the Third Schedule, the object being that it would come under the designation of a public body.  From my personal experience I happen to know that for years past an auditor from the Minister's Department actually audits the accounts of that board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering what was the necessity for introducing it at all into the Third Schedule, seeing that the practice was in operation for years.  Therefore, in restoring the position, the Minister's amendment shows that I was reading the position correctly, apart from the fact that a new order of things prevails now in respect of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, which is coming under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point of audits, to which Deputy Coogan referred, I drew attention to that matter in a general way some time ago in respect of complaints that were being made throughout the country which appeared to have a certain amount of foundation. Obviously, it would be a much better practice to introduce the system which obtains in commercial firms, so that the audit would take place on a fixed <Col N="1721" /> date and would be carried out regularly.  I must say from my experience that no complaints have arisen under that head so far as the bodies with which I am associated in the City of Dublin are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say on the question of audits that I share the views which have been expressed by Deputies Coogan and O'Sullivan.  I think it is most desirable, if we are going to have sound local administration, that the accounts of public bodies should be audited with efficiency, expedition and zeal.  It is quite true that audits had got considerably into arrear, but on the reasons for that I do not propose to dilate.  The arrears were, I think, to the order of about 600 or so a couple of years ago, but the position following the reorganisation of my Department, and the attention which the Parliamentary Secretary, at my request, has given to this matter, has now been so drastically amended that the number of accounts of public bodies still to be audited is less than 100 and, of this number, no less than 56 represent what might be described as current audits.  The arrears have been reduced to an insignificant 44. I hope that henceforward with the reorganisation that has taken place, and under the new directorship, we shall have no further cause of complaint on this score.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 87:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3), page 21, and substitute the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  A road authority shall provide on any road in their charge such traffic signs as may be requested by the Commissioner in the positions indicated by him and shall, as respects any traffic signs so provided, carry out any periodical transfers <Col N="1722" /> from place to place and any alternations and removals which he may request.</P>
    <P>(4)  A request by the Commissioner under sub-section (3) of this section may be for the provision either of traffic signs for all times or occasions or of traffic signs for a limited period or a particular occasion or particular occasions.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that this amendment is designed to make provision for the erection of road signs.  Under the Local Government Act of 1925, the Minister makes regulations prescribing the shape, colour and character of signs to be erected on roads.  Under that Act, he had also to indicate the place at which such signs should be erected.  In accordance with modern traffic requirements, it is considered desirable that the Gárda Síochána should make the direction as to where signs should be erected, leaving to the Minister the general power of prescribing the shape, colour and type of the signs to be erected.  In the course of Second Reading, certain Deputies objected to the wording of the section, and amendment No. 87 is designed to meet these objections by making it perfectly clear that it is mandatory on local authorities to provide the necessary signs.  The signs do not constitute a nuisance of any noticeable kind to persons on whose lands they are erected, and it is felt reasonable that an expeditions system should be in force whereby these signs can be erected in accordance with modern road traffic conditions.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (5), line 46, to delete the words &ldquo;visible from&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;adjacent to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with a small matter only as regards the location of a sign.  As drafted, the sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the provision by a road authority of a traffic sign on land visible from but not forming part of a road is reasonably necessary, the road authority may provide the traffic sign on such land, subject to the prescribed conditions, but without the consent of the owner or occupier of the land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The only thing I am quarrelling with is the fact that the words &ldquo;visible from&rdquo; seem to leave room for a very wide interpretation.  The sign might be erected at a point on a man's land which would perhaps be an attraction to cattle and cause some trouble.  I know there is great difficulty in getting a suitable formula for this, but I thought that the words &ldquo;adjacent to&rdquo; would be better than &ldquo;visible from&rdquo;. The present wording would enable the local authority to erect a sign at any distance from the road, provided it were visible, which would be an absurdity.</P>

      <P>(6)  Where a traffic sign is provided under sub-section (5) of this section on any land by a road authority, the owner or occupier of the land may at any time, on giving notice of his intention so to do to the road authority, apply to the Minister to direct the removal of the traffic sign.</P>
      <P>(7)  Where an application is made under sub-section (6) of this section, in relation to a traffic sign provided on any land, the Minister, after consideration of the application, shall either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  refuse the application, or</P>
      <P>(b)  if he is satisfied that the provision of the traffic sign is not reasonably necessary, direct the removal of the traffic sign from the land, or</P>
      <P>(c)  if he is satisfied that the provision of the traffic sign in its existing position causes unnecessary or unreasonable hardship to the owner or occupier of the land, direct the removal of the traffic sign to another position on the land.</P>
      <P>(8)  Where the Minister gives a direction under sub-section (7) of this section in relation to a traffic sign, the road authority who provided the traffic sign shall comply with the direction.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any need to indicate further to the House the nature of this amendment.  It simply provides owners with a right of appeal to the Minister, if they feel they are being unfairly treated.</P>

      <P>It struck me there was defective draftsmanship on this point.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would refer to sub-sections (3), (4) and (5) he will find the term &ldquo;road authority&rdquo; is used all the time, quite rightly, instead of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;.

      <P>We could not accept this amendment, as there is no objection to an unauthorised traffic sign if it is not visible from the road.  The erection of a sign on a private avenue requesting persons to drive slowly on such an avenue is not prohibited by sub-section (6), as the sign would not be a traffic sign as defined in sub-section (1) of Section 51.  The Deputy will find it does not cover traffic signs to which his amendment applies.  We do want to prevent persons, particularly large land owners, who like to erect signs on a main road close to their gates, warning that there is an entrance, because it is in actual fact the responsibility of the persons in the vicinity of the entrance to slow down. The question as to whether they are visible or not does not arise.</P>

While it may be reasonable in the case of some road in a very remote rural part of the country, what advice I can get in regard to road traffic safety in the future is that the commissioner should be given wide powers and should not have to appeal to a local authority in so small a matter.  The traffic sign generally consists of a post, it has very little effect on arable land and is generally very close to the road.  It cannot be compared with a telegraph pole or a post carrying electric current. I would ask the Deputy to allow the commissioner to have this power, in view of the urgent necessity to prescribe regulations for road traffic safety.</P>

      <P>Amongst the excepted enactments, you have Section 118 paragraph (b) of Section 148 of the Traffic Act.  I want to find out, for information purposes, the intention regarding bus signs on main thoroughfares in rural areas.  The present position is that buses traversing rural areas pull up anywhere and everywhere. That is a very unsafe practice, from a road safety point of view.  I can appreciate that there would be considerable difficulty in fixing regular <Col N="1728" /> bus stops in rural areas, but the time will come when it will be necessary that this haphazard stopping be prohibited and regular stops introduced. That is excluded at the moment.  I want to find out if there is any intention to introduce some form of regular bus stops at any near date.  During the emergency, when buses were congested, people flocked to the roads everywhere to get on buses and it was hard to see them being left in inclement and snowy weather at various points.  It would be much better to encourage people to go to definite points, arranged every furlong or so, according to the local crossroads and points of communication. The present haphazard system is dangerous to traffic and there will be an increase in traffic on the roads in the next few years.  We must now face up to the position that a regular system of bus stops will be necessary on the rural roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great convenience to people in rural areas, and those who live in rural areas know it, to be able to get off or on a bus at the most convenient point to your residence. That was one of the principal factors which made buses popular with rural dwellers as against the railway.  It would be very bad if there were unnecessary regulations and I hope the Minister will not be encouraged by what Deputy Coogan has said to make such regulations.  Usually a bus stops in one place only in a town or village, but will stop on country roads wherever people want to get on or off. There is not such dense traffic on the rural roads, and we have a small population and a small number of cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really rose to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question.  This section deals with traffic signs in general, I take it, in both city and country.  There is one type of traffic sign in this city and in other cities, erected by owners of business premises <Col N="1729" /> saying &ldquo;No parking here&rdquo;.  Would the Minister say if those people are allowed to put up such signs under the Traffic Act?  It is a great nuisance to persons who are driving cars and who want to pull into the kerb.  They are actually prohibited from doing so. Have those people who prohibit them any power in law to do so?  Are they permitted to put up these signs prohibiting you from pulling your car into the kerb?  You may wish to draw up outside a hotel or some exclusive residence, so to speak, but you find that you are not allowed to do that.</P>
    <P>I think it is time to stop that practice in the city.  I am calling the Minister's attention to it in order that he may look into the matter.  Many car-owners would like to know if the people who put up such signs around the city have power to do it.  They even have stands on the footpath with indications &ldquo;No parking here&rdquo; and these are a nuisance to pedestrains. It is time that the matter should be looked into, because it is becoming very prevalent in the city.  People who drive in from the country do not quite understand it.  Every street you go into you will see those notices printed.</P>

      <P>In connection with Deputy Allen's observations, local authorities are not bound to provide parking spaces for cars, but the Gárda Síochána are empowered to make regulations for parking in order to prevent congestion of traffic and to ensure the safety of the travelling public.  It would be impossible for me to go into detail as to the rights of private individuals in regard to prescribing parking places, or places where persons cannot park.</P>

These matters are under consideration in connection with the proposed amendment of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  I think both an adequate service for the public and the necessity for having frequent stopping places for the convenience of everybody concerned will be fully considered when the provisions covered by Emergency Powers Order No. 233 are included in the amending Bill.</P>

      <P>I have the greatest sympathy with Deputy Allen's point of view.  I suggest that this matter should be put to the test.  Until the local authority puts the Road Traffic Act into operation no one has the right to prevent a person stopping a car on the public street.  I have done it and I have refused to remove the car.  If a citizen allows a trader to say: &ldquo;You must not leave your car there&rdquo;, then he is a foolish man.  The law cannot be laid down until the Road Traffic Act is adopted by the various local authorities. There will be considerable trouble from the point of view of the Department when they come to enforce the Road Traffic Act.  We have had a short experience of it in Drogheda in order to give it a trial on a sort of voluntary basis.  We found that if the Road Traffic Act were put into operation the trader could not get delivery of his goods after 8 o'clock in the morning, and labourers do not start to work before 8 o'clock in the morning. That would be the position if the Road Traffic Act, as it is written, were put <Col N="1731" /> into operation.  I recommend that aspect of the matter to the Minister for his serious consideration.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 101:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 52, page 22, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>52.&mdash;(1)  Where, by or under any Act, it is the duty of a person other than a road authority to maintain a bridge forming part of a road or the approaches to such bridge, the road authority charged with the maintenance of the road may, by order (in this section referred to as a works order), require such person to carry out, within a specified time after the coming into force of the order, specified works for the maintenance of such bridge or approaches, being works which, by or under such Act, it is the duty of such person to carry out.</P>
      <P>(2)  A copy of a works order shall be served by post on the person to whom the order relates within seven days after the day on which the order is made.</P>
      <P>(3)  The person to whom a works order relates may object to the order by giving notice in that behalf to the Minister within 30 days after the day on which the order was made and the notice shall be in writing and contain a statement of the grounds of the objection.</P>
      <P>(4)  Where a notice of objection to a works order is given under this section, the Minister, after consideration of the objection and after consulation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the road authority who made the order, shall either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  confirm the order without amendment, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  confirm the order with such amendments as he thinks proper, subject to the limitation that no such amendment shall require the person to whom the order relates to carry out any works which, by <Col N="1732" /> or under the relevant Act referred to in sub-section (1) of this section, it is not his duty to carry out, or</P>
    <P>(c) annual the order.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where no objection is made under this section to a works order, the order shall come into force 37 days after the day on which the order was made.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a works order is confirmed without amendment on an objection under this section, the order shall come into force on the day on which it is confirmed.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where a works order is confirmed with amendments on an objection under this section, the order as so amended shall come into force on the day on which it is confirmed.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) a works order which has come into force specifies a period for the carrying out of the works required thereby, and</P>
    <P>(b) on the expiration of that period, such works have not been begun, or if begun, have not been completed,</P>
    <P>the road authority who made the order may themselves carry out or complete such works.</P>
    <P>(9)  Where a road authority carry out or complete under sub-section (8) of this section works required by a works order, the person to whom the order relates shall pay to the road authority the amount of the expenses reasonably incurred by the road authority in carrying out or completing such works, and the road authority may recover that amount from such person as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(10)  Any doubt, dispute or question which may arise as to whether any expenses, which have been incurred by a road authority in carrying out or completing under sub-section (8) of this section works required by a works order, were reasonably so incurred shall be determined by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for <Col N="1733" /> Industry and Commerce and such determination shall be final.</P>
    <P>This amendment is put down to meet a point raised in regard to the maintenance of road surfaces over railway bridges.  It enables the road authority to require a person, other than a road authority, to carry out such work of road maintenance as it is the duty of such person, under another Act, to undertake, and, if necessary, the road authority is authorised to carry out the work and recover the cost from the person who fails to perform his statutory duty.  Provision is made for an appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>At present a number of bridges are maintained by railway companies and, according to certain judicial decisions made in recent years, they are bound to maintain the road surface only in the state which will carry the traffic which normally passed over the bridge at the time of its erection or when the railway company was formed.  There have been disputes between local authorities and railway companies where it was urgently necessary to reconstruct the road surface over a bridge in order to carry modern traffic. These sections are designed to resolve difficulties between railway companies and local authorities in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, fairly clear to the House that it is the duty of the Minister to resolve a dispute where one arises, and this should overcome the many difficulties met by local authorities as to what constitutes a proper road surface and the relation of the cost of the present surface to what the road surface was at the time the bridge was erected.  Wherever there was difficulty about the amount, that can now be determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Where such bridges are found to be inadequate for the traffic the road is asked to carry in modern times, is there any provision whereby the individuals who originally erected the bridge could be called upon to improve or widen it, as the case might be&mdash;make sufficient room to cope with modern traffic?  I think that is an important point and perhaps the Minister might consider taking such power where it is found that the bridge as <Col N="1734" /> originally erected is not adequate to deal with modern traffic.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Murphy, I move amendment No. 102:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 52 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall be lawful for a local authority and for every subsidiary body within the meaning of Section 52 of the Act of 1941 to pay by way of reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses to every member of such authority or body such sum in respect of any meeting of such authority or body attended by him as may reasonably represent the amount of wages or earnings of which he has been deprived by reason of his attendance at any such meeting, together with such reasonable sum in respect of subsistence as may be authorised by regulations made under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Murphy is not able to be present, because obviously he could speak on this subject from personal experience of the conditions that operate in this connection so far as county councils are concerned.  I have no such experience.  Public bodies as a rule hold their meetings in the forenoon or the afternoon and certain individuals would have to forsake their employment for that day and suffer a loss of wages.  It is felt that this restriction is militating very severely against a particular type of candidate going forward for election. Obviously, if they believe such a disability exists, people are not inclined to allow their names to go up for nomination.  Public bodies lose the services of people who would be of great value to them.  It is undoubtedly a hardship on those who accept nomination that they should have to <Col N="1735" /> leave their employment on days when council meetings are held, and suffer the loss of wages.  I gather that the purpose of the amendment is to ascertain if the Minister would be prepared to consider the position sympathetically.</P>

There are very desirable citizens competent to take their place on elected bodies, but, if they do so, they are penalised to the extent indicated by the mover of the amendment. Those who have come into public life &mdash;and plenty of them have&mdash;find that they are working on these boards under a disability.  The amendment only asks that regulations should be made by the Minister whereby there would be compensation for loss of wages.

      <P>To delete sub-section (1), and insert in lieu thereof the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The appropriate authority may, by a majority decision of the members present at a meeting called for that purpose, change the name of a street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the elected representatives decide by a majority that the name of a street should be changed their decision should be final.  I have in mind what happened in the case of a particular street in Dublin.  If it was proposed to change a name, say, from Grafton Street to an Irish name, a majority would not be got to agree in that area. If it was decided to change a name to Montgomery Street or some other name that is at present familiar to the public, a majority of the ratepayers would be got, although the elected representatives would not agree.  In view of what may happen in future years, when we may wish to honour the memory of Irish patriots, and change the foreign names on some of our streets, I think the elected representatives, whoever they may be, should have the right to do so, and not have it dependent on the decisions <Col N="1738" /> of residents of streets like Grafton Street.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of objection, but I think there will be a certain amount of confusion. Deputy Everett is seeking to do something, which, I think, is not sought in the other amendments.  I think the other amendments are mainly concerned as to whether it should be three-fifths or two-thirds or 50 per cent., but amendment No. 105 is dealing with a different matter.  Deputy Everett wants to take the right away from the residents or ratepayers, as the case may be, and confer that right on the local authority solely.  I think there would be less confusion if amendment No. 105 were disposed of.  It is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to confuse this matter too much but it seems to me that, for the sake of clarity, the House might perhaps adopt amendment No. 109 and then discuss the situation which would be created. Amendment No. 109 is designed to deal with the possibility that the section as originally drafted might give a ratepayer occupying a corner house, the front of which faces one street and the side of which abuts on another, a <Col N="1739" /> claim to be consulted in regard to the naming of both streets.  Amendment No. 109 is intended to make clear that the ratepayers in the street, that is the persons shown in the rate book as being ratepayers in the street, are the persons to be consulted.  If that were adopted then we could consider the other issues that would arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is agreed that it is desirable to have a change in the existing method, personally I would feel like supporting Deputy Everett's amendment as being the most direct way and the one most likely to give satisfaction, that is, that the public authority, the elected representatives for the time being, should deal with this question.  I do not think it is necessary to have a referendum and to prescribe that there should be a majority of three-fifths, two-thirds or 50 per cent. of the residents in a street.  The alteration of a street name is not a matter of peculiar interest to the residents in the particular street.  It ought to be a matter of importance to the people of the particular town or city.  The elected representatives from all the wards in that town should have a say as to whether or not the time has come when the particular street name is objectionable and should be changed. It is not too much to ask that the elected representatives should be the authority.  In a particular street you may have peculiar types of characters, perhaps a congregation of them, and you might find a majority in the street opposed to the majority of the entire town and they would be able to defeat the wishes of the entire town.  In my opinion, Deputy Everett's method is the most direct and most equitable and, therefore, I think it ought to be accepted.  That much power should be vested in the local authority who will be answering for themselves to the people within three years at the very most and they will be quite capable of interpreting the views of the citizens.</P>

      <P>I believe that the <Col N="1740" /> people in the street are entitled to some say in the matter.  I differ from Deputy Keyes in that.  I think they are the people who will suffer anything that may be suffered as a result. They have a tradition, and they are entitled to some say in the matter.  I understand that the position hitherto was that in Dublin a majority was sufficient to change the name, but that in the country two-thirds of the occupiers of a street were necessary. I put down in this amendment three-fifths, because I thought two-thirds was too high.  I am not particularly tied to three-fifths.  As a matter of fact, I would appeal to the Minister, if possible, to make it a lower figure, but I do think there should be something above a bare majority in the street and that was my object in putting down amendment No. 108.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a difference between the term ratepayers in the Minister's amendment and residents in the street.  If you take, for instance, one of the streets that have given rise to a certain amount of controversy, that is, Talbot Street, you will have a line of shops with, perhaps, the individuals not resident there at all and over the shops a number of people to whom rooms would be let but who would not be included, as the Minister says, in the ratepayers' schedule.  Surely those living in the particular street should have the right to a say in that matter. The Minister's amendment is designed to limit it to the term &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo;. I agree with Deputy Keyes that the forthright way of dealing with the matter is the manner suggested in amendment No. 105.  The local representatives are elected by the people in the particular street as well as by the city as a whole and their judgment should be worth something in a matter of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself perhaps rather in a difficult position in relation to these proposals.  I have full sympathy with the object which those who put down amendments are trying to secure but I am not in their happy position because, as Minister and a member of the Government, I have to <Col N="1741" /> have regard not only to the desire of people but also to the rights of people, rights established by time, rights in some cases acquired at great expense. Most of the streets which have been the subject of recent agitation are streets of premises, particularly business premises, which carry a very high element of goodwill and the proprietors of these premises, or the occupiers of them, have paid substantial sums for that goodwill.  It is some advantage in the City of Dublin to occupy business premises in Talbot Street because Talbot Street has been associated in one way or another with good value. It is not an easy matter or a light matter to dispossess, by a mere stroke of the pen, people who have secured that goodwill or so much of it as inheres in the name and I think it would be found that where a question of the change of name has arisen, very many people who share the same political affiliations as the majority of us, people who have the same views, the same aspirations as Deputy Everett, Deputy Colley, and myself, fear that their interests may be seriously affected by a change of name and, as they have purchased their interest, whatsoever it may be worth or however one may evaluate it, at some expense, they have a right to be considered.  We cannot merely wipe out their rights simply because a majority of the people wish it to be done.</P>
      <P>That is a problem which goes very deep.  We are living in a democracy but if democracy is going to continue, it can only function and it can only survive on the basis that the majority will have regard to the rights of the minority and even if it were not these questions of property rights that were involved, if it were merely a question of sentiment, I think in present circumstances it would not be wise to go too fast.  The changes which we are all hoping for, which some of us have a certain amount of impatience in waiting for, are going to come about inevitably by the efflux of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirty or 40 years ago a proposal to change the name of O'Connell Street aroused a great deal of public controversy and a great deal of agitation. Within 10 or 15 years the name had <Col N="1742" /> been changed from Sackville Street to O'Connell Street more or less with general acclamation, but certainly with the consent of all the occupies of premises in the street and, because the change was secured with their consent, the change has endured and nobody ever hears of Sackville Street now. Similarly, Brunswick Street in Dublin became Pearse Street.  I am not satisfied, at any rate, as a Minister that, in a matter of this sort, we should have coercion, even though it be by majority rule.  I do agree that perhaps there might be uunreasonable instances of minority rights in this matter.  I am not tied to this two-thirds.  I am not tied even to the three-fifths, which Deputy Colley has suggested and which he, I think, would like to diminish.  But I think we ought to have such a majority as will make it quite clear that there is not a really significant minority in the street who are opposed to the change.</P>
    <P>In connection with this matter, there is another aspect which, I think, we ought to consider.  Most of these streets criginated as private property.  They were laid out, if you like, by the original land-owners who have been expropriated. But, if the land-owners have been expropriated, their rights have been acquired by purchase by citizens of this country and they still have a certain elementary right, as most of us have, to put a name on our own house.</P>
    <P>If any of us called our house &ldquo;Victoria House&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cambridge House&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wellington House&rdquo;, we would think it an infringement of our liberties if somebody came along and said that we ought to call it &ldquo;Home Rule House&rdquo; or something else.  Even though we do not agree with the point of view of those who have an interest in the existing situation, even though we might say: &ldquo;The street belongs to the city more than to the people who reside in it&rdquo;&mdash;which I think is a very questionable position&mdash;even though we may say that patriotism should come first and business afterwards, nevertheless, we should bear in mind that our problem is to try to assure the minority here that so long as they are citizens of this State such rights as <Col N="1743" /> they may have and, indeed, such sentiments as they may feel, will secure adequate respect from the majority here.  For that reason, therefore, I would be very strongly opposed to the proposal of Deputy Everett to make a change of name at the instance merely of the majority of the local authority.  I think the ratepayers in the street who own the property and occupy it have a right to be consulted and I think we should, so far as it is reasonable, try to meet their wishes. I think we should ensure, in whatever changes we may now make, that there will be a reasonable majority for a change.  If you do not do that the ridiculous situation which has developed in some parts of the Continent may spring up here, where one year you have a street called &ldquo;President Wilson Street&rdquo; and, a few years later, called &ldquo;Petain&rdquo; or something like that, and later called something else.  We do not want that.  Once we make up our minds to have it changed we want the change, whatever it may be, to continue to abide for all time.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I suggest to the House that it would be better to prescribe in the law some such proportion of the ratepayers of a street as will establish that there is a very definite majority in favour of a change. Deputy Colley has expressed a wish that the three-fifths which he proposed might be reduced.  I have no objection to accepting four-sevenths or, if I am pressed, five-ninths.  After all, if you cannot get that number in favour of a change it would seem, so far as the inhabitants and ratepayers in the street are concerned, that they are not in favour of a change.  In these circumstances, I do not think that it would be wise for the community as a whole to bring the steam hammer or the sledge hammer to bear on that minority in the community. It would be far better to tolerate them for the time being and allow time to produce the remedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with the Minister.  Another reason why I would be opposed to the amendment of Deputy Everett is that I do not think it could be worked out <Col N="1744" /> in practice.  Let us take the City of Dublin.  If the right is conferred on, say, the Dublin Corporation to change the names of the streets in Dublin, to be consistent the Dublin Corporation would have to change the names of at least one-half of the streets or roads of the borough.  They could not change the name of Talbot Street and refuse to change the name of Molesworth Street or Grafton Street or Burlington Road or Waterloo Road or Wellington Road and various other roads around the city.</P>
      <P>I have as much respect for local authorities as the next person and I have fought fairly strenuously here to try to retain the fullest possible powers for them.  But I am also conscious of the fact that their actions are not always guided entirely by wisdom.  We know that, at times, certain sections or groups or parties on a local authority, not for the welfare of a particular locality, but perhaps for some political purpose, will make use of their majority power to get cheap political profit out of a certain action.  I do not think that we ought to do that.  I think it is a very reasonable thing, as the Minister said, that the ratepayers in the street, the people concerned, should have a say in it.  I think the Minister is going as far as possible to meet the point of view put forward when he says that he is prepared to alter the fraction for the majority necessary. I am against the other proposal on principle, because I do not think it could be carried out in a consistent and fair way.  If you give this power to-morrow to the Dublin Corporation, let us say, in order to be consistent and fair they would have to alter the name of every street and road in the Borough of Dublin that does not bear an Irish name.  The reason usually given, but not always, for changing a name is that we want to honour some distinguished Irishman or Irish patriot.  If we want to do real honour to the memory of any distinguished Irishman or Irish patriot, we can do it in a much more effective way than merely by naming some street after him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased to <Col N="1745" /> hear the Minister's approach to this question and I agree to a large extent with the point of view he has expressed.  I should be very slow to associate myself with any action of a coercive nature against any section of our citizens who may hold strong views on a particular question, but I am inclined to think that if this question is closely analysed it will be found that it is one that should concern the general body of citizens rather than the citizens of a particular street. Some persons living in a street may feel, rightly or wrongly, that an alternation in the name of a street is going to deteriorate the value of their premises.  That is a view which they may genuinely hold, but an examination of the alternations that have already taken place in the street names, notably the example given by the Minister, will show that there was no deterioration in the value of premises in that street because of the alterations which took place. Similarly, I would say that the customers of shopkeepers in the street are not confined to that particular street.  They are drawn from a wide radius and, for that reason, I feel that the citizens as a whole should have a voice in the decision as to whether the name of the street should be changed, rather than that the decision should be confined to the people living in the street.  As to the suggestion that acrimony may be caused by a proposed change, it would be much better that the decision should be one for the general body of citizens, rather than have it left as a controversial subject between those living in the street. By leaving the decision to residents in the street you are localising the question, a question which they are likely to magnify into a great national problem, whereas if the citizens as a whole express their views through their elected representatives there is not likely to be the same acute controversy.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the suggestion of Deputy Morrissey that our councils are likely to go in for the sweeping changes that he visualies.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Corporation of Dublin or any other city will confine themselves principally to their ordinary routine business and that they will only act when representations are made to them in regard to any particular street.  In recent times when new slum clearances had to take place in Dublin, Cork and Limerick the naming of the new streets was a function for the councils and I do not think that they abused that power or privilege in the names they gave to these streets.  I do not want to inflict any hardship one way or another but would it not be better if a decision were taken by the citizens as a whole rather than by a majority of the residents of a particular street? As I have said, by confining the decision to the street, you are localising the struggle between the protagonists of the old name and the new name and that will have the effect of embittering relations between them for some time afterwards.  While I do not want to lean too heavily on one side or the other, I am still of opinion that Deputy Everett's proposal offers the most practical solution.</P>

      <P>I must say that I find myself also in agreement with the Minister's view on this matter and certainly in disagreement with Deputy Everett's amendment.  I speak from a rather long experience.  In my town the corporation at one time changed the name of a street and were practically unanimous.  Another corporation succeeded us in a few years and they, by a majority, decided to change the name of the district also.  They actually canvassed the tenants of the districts to have the name changed. There is nothing to prevent the existing council elected last June from taking similar steps and every succeeding council could do likewise.  For these reasons, I believe it is only right and proper that there should be some supreme authority over actions of that kind to prevent their happening too often.  For these reasons, I am opposed to Deputy Everett's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly there is much to be said on both sides of this question but when we consider, as the Minister has suggested, firstly the <Col N="1747" /> question of patriotism and afterwards the question of business and consider also as Deputy Keyes mentioned the effect of former decisions in these matters, I think we must come to the conclusion that changing the name of any street does not interfere in the slightest with business.  When King Street in Cork was changed to MacCurtain Street and Great George's Street was changed to Washington Street it did not interfere with either the business or the status of these streets.  I think at this stage of our existence it is rather invidious to have the names of explorers and adventurers of former generations will decorating the corners of our streets&mdash;names such as Marlborough, Wellington and the rest of them, sometimes through absentee interests.  I feel that we should have a right to make any changes we desire to bring them more into conformity with the spirit of the Gaelic revival of which we hear so much and in which we should be all interested. I do not agree entirely with changing names which do not in any way offend against our national ideals or aspirations but I do think in approaching a matter of this kind that the city authorities or the urban authorities should be the parties to decide exactly what those names should be or whether a name should be changed or not.  I appreciate what the Minister has said and if there could be a combination of both methods, say that a decision of the corporation would stand unless five-eights of the residents of a particular street objected, it might meet the matter.  I would leave the decision to the elected representatives of the people unless there is an absolute protest from the residents in the street concerned.</P>

      <P>For the first time in my life, I agree with the Minister and my reason for doing so is that unfortunately local bodies are now to a large extent manned by political groups. Sometimes one party dominates and sometimes another, and some members, to show how patriotic they are, may decide on a change in the name of a street irrespective of what the people think.  I certainly agree with the Minister that it is the majority of the <Col N="1748" /> people in a district or in an individual street that should count in this matter. Why should the local authority decide for these people?  I think the Minister has adopted the right attitude on this question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment by Deputy Everett, because I have had experience in Cork quite recently of an attempt to change the names of a number of streets. In the case of the South Mall in Cork City, one of the best business thoroughfares in the South of Ireland, it was sought to change the name. Those engaged in some of the business offices and others in residential premises on the South Mall objected to the change.  Surely we are not to take away the rights of the citizens who pay rates to the corporation and who have vested interests in the name of the street?  Surely the trader or occupier has the right to object and retain the old name?  I would object to having a place known as Cromwell Avenue and agree that some objectionable names might be removed, for very good reasons, but I am altogether opposed to the principle behind this amendment, which suggests that the local body alone should have such powers.  We know that, from time to time, some most undesirable people get into local councils.  We have had that experience in Cork City&mdash;I do not hesitate to say it&mdash;and if we are going to allow even the elected representatives of the people to change the names of streets, it will have a most injurious effect on businesses in most cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A corporation or a council should not be allowed to change the name at its own sweet will from time to time. As one Deputy has just said, it might easily occur that a succeeding council would alter the name again, to suit its ideas, so we would have, with a changing personnel, possibly a change every three or four years, according to the amendment proposed by Deputy Everett.  It would be a retrograde step on our part to suggest that the owners and occupiers, who are good citizens, paying rates and taxes and obeying their obligations of citizenship in every way, should have taken from them the rights they have hitherto enjoyed.  I <Col N="1749" /> do not at all agree with Deputy McCarthy, though I think his suggestion was well meant, that a five-eighths majority should be necessary to reject the proposal of any public body in relation to the name of a street.  I suggest that that is too high, that it should not require five-eights to resist the imposition of new names. I must register my opposition to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>May I point out that, as far as Dublin is concerned, the corporation have no power to change the name of the street except at the instance of the occupiers of that street?  In this section, as it is now, a corporation, by getting a majority or whatever fraction is decided on, can change the name of any street, and in that way we have advanced towards the views expressed by Deputy Keyes.  I hold the view that the occupiers certainly are entitled to be consulted and have their views recognised.  As one who wants to see the names of the streets of Dublin changed, I do not think it would be wise for us to exercise the jack-boot on those opposed to that.  What is in the mind of the people putting down this amendment to leave the power to the local bodies is the fear of opposition, and they want to drive at those people without paying any attention to their views.  That is not the way to get the names changed in an orderly fashion.  As the years go over&mdash;and very few years at that&mdash;any street in Dublin will be capable of being changed, with the consent of the people.  We should act by taking a little patience and doing the thing in an orderly way, instead of raising antagonism, as would occur if amendment No. 105 were accepted.  It is far better to proceed slowly and give these people their rights in the matter.</P>

      <P>The consent of the persons mentioned in sub-section (1) of this section shall be obtained by secret ballot.</P>
      <P>I regret I was not present at the discussion that has taken place; I do not know exactly what has taken place. The object of this amendment is to ensure that an absolutely fair decision will be taken.  It is possible that in a time of political or Party contention or strife a certain amount of pressure might be put upon residents of a certain street either to refuse to have the name of the street changed or to compel them to have it changed and, since we accept the principle that in all democratic elections here we vote by secret ballot, I think it is desirable that we should also have a secret ballot in a matter of this kind.  There may be some difficulties in carrying it through, but if the difficulties are not insurmountable, I think the decision should be taken by secret ballot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this is, in fact, necessary, because the ratepayers in a particular street, knowing a matter of this sort is under consideration, are not bound publicly to disclose what their attitude is.  They are approached, and I suppose the corporation officials indicate that there are so many in favour and so many people against a change, but they do not say that So-and-so in the street is on one side or the other.</P>
      <P>I am not so certain where this amendment, if it were carried, might lead.  First of all, we would have to set up a fairly elaborate machine, but apart from that, I am not so certain that it would not lead to a great deal of unpleasantness afterwards, because, naturally, in most streets the number of people concerned is relatively small, and there would be canvassing as to who voted one way and who voted another, and suggestions might be made.  People might say they voted one way when, in fact, they voted the other, and ultimately it would narrow down if the matter were hotly pursued, until some people were made the object of unwarranted and unjustifiable criticism or suspicion.</P>
      <P>I think, on the whole, the position as it existed up to now is working satisfactorily.  People have not been afraid to say which side they were on. I think this puts an element of undue elaboration into the whole thing, and I ask the Deputy not to press it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it might lead to more unpleasantness, and perhaps even an attempt at victimisation of certain people, if it is publicly known which way they vote.  Perhaps the Minister will see that.  I do not say it will happen, but it could happen, and people could be pilloried publicly and privately in various ways, particularly if they were business people, for exercising their opinions in a public way.  That sort of thing could be organised so as to injure them very substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is nothing wrong with the principle of the amendment, and I do not think it would require very elaborate machinery, unless it is going to arise in a very large number of <Col N="1753" /> cases.  I think people are entitled to whatever protection is necessary to enable them to exercise, without fear or favour, their real opinion of any project put before them.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his views on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something to be said for Deputy Cogan's amendment. We all agree that a number of petty antagonisms have been engendered over the changing of street names, or the proposed changing of them.  I understand, though I did not see the windows in which these notices were exhibited, that in certain streets in Dublin some traders had notices in their windows saying they were in favour of a certain change.  It was taken for granted that the man who had not a notice in his window was against the change.  We know that these little antagonisms persist in our country as a result of matters to which we do not want to refer now, and they have persisted right through the years.</P>
      <P>If these traders were allowed to have a secret ballot, I do not believe that the machinery would need to be so cumbersome as the Minister suggests. The traders among themselves could agree to issue a ballot paper and one or two could arrange to open the boxes.  They would not want elaborate machinery for that purposes and that would get rid of the idea present in many people's minds that a good deal of pressure was exercised in Dublin and elsewhere on the question of the re-naming of the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same argument could be used as has been used here against a secret ballot, for the election of Deputies to the Dáil, because it is well known that a practice has grown up in our country, which I never believed in and which I detest, of having street collections for various political Parties. I object to that no matter what Party shakes the boxes on these occasions.  I feel there is so much to be said for Deputy Cogan's amendment that the Minister should take cognisance of it. He decently stated a few moments ago that he will do everything he can to introduce something to meet the views of Deputies, and I hope that he will do so in this instance.  I do know <Col N="1754" /> that it would be far preferable in the interests of the traders themselves if they were allowed to have a secret ballot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment from the point of view of the official who would be involved. Deputy Anthony referred to certain antagonisms, but in my opinion the unfortunate man who will be pilloried on this occasion and who will be blamed if there, is anything like &ldquo;Who voted for this man and who voted for the other&rdquo; is the unfortunate official who will have to collect all this information.  The ballot might be secret to a certain extent, but if people get ideas into their heads about persons voting in certain directions, it is this unfortunate man who will be blamed.</P>
      <P>I do not think the machinery will need to be very elaborate for a ballot of this kind.  I am confident it could be done easily and at little expense through the corporations and urban authorities.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment from the point of view I have mentioned&mdash;that of the official who will have to collect this information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on the very excellent memorandum he prepared in connection with this Bill.  It was certainly excellent in so far as its explanation of the provisions of the Bill was concerned.  I should like to say at this stage that neither the Bill nor the memorandum gave ground for any suggestion that this major question of afforestation was going to be dealt with in the way that people would like.  I am disappointed, having read the Bill and the explanatory memorandum, as I felt that the vacuum created by these two documents would be filled up by the Minister's statement.  Again I must say that I was disappointed.  It is true that the statement did not carry any suggestion of a feeling of confidence in afforestation so far as its general effects were concerned, and I think alongside that there was definitely a suggestion of a lack of enthusiasm or conviction that the necessary steps would be taken in years to come to implement this important work of afforestation.  This Bill might be strictly described as a consolidating measure.  The Minister used that term.  The Bill consolidates the British Act of 1919 and our Act of 1928.  The key to it may very well be found in the explanatory memorandum and the Minister's statement, when he said: &ldquo;The Bill does not introduce any new principle and does not convey any new powers in any major sense.&rdquo;  We must take it for granted that the efforts and activities of the forestry division in the years to come will be based mainly on the Act of 1928.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that when that measure was going through this House it was the subject <Col N="1756" /> of scathing criticism by members of this Government who were then in opposition.  In that respect may I quote what was said by Deputy Dr. Ryan, the present Minister for Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every single section of the Bill states that the Minister has power to do so and so and, if passed, it will make the Minister a dictator in the timber trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Matt O'Reilly, speaking on the same Bill, is given in volume 24, column 485 as stating:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The timber which formerly beautified the country has been cut down and exported.  You are putting nothing in its place; meantime, you are imposing on people an obligation to permit useless timber to remain standing and thus inflicting serious loss on its owners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the measure which will now stand out as the lighthouse of afforestation in the years to come.  As the Minister says it is a measure which makes no serious or major change either in the Acts of 1919 or 1928, except perhaps to the extent that new machinery is provided in chapter 3 in the assessment of compensation.  I think the House will agree with the Minister's statement, that it is an advance as far as machinery is concerned. I am disappointed to find that the Minister's statement set no goal or target so far as afforestation is concerned in the years that lie ahead, particularly under his own administration. In that respect I might refer to a paragraph in the Minister's statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since 1928 the forestry division has expanded its activities and were it not for the war it would by now probably have come close to attaining the rate of annual growth which was believed by experts to be the desirable aim for the country's needs.  The war limited activities in some respects.  With the restoration of normal conditions, for which we may now hope, it is probable that in a few years the services will realise this aim.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister does not state what that aim is or seek to re-state what was <Col N="1757" /> his original conviction on that point which is found in the Report of the Department for the five years ending March 31st, 1943:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The forest policy remains as laid down in previous reports, namely, to create a home supply of raw timber sufficient to meet home requirements, so far as it is possible to grow in this country the types of timber required. It has been estimated that the total national objective of both State and private woodlands should be 700,000 acres of afforested land, including 100,000 acres of protection forest and 600,000 acres of fully productive forest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that enthusiasts for forestry would no doubt refer to the poverty of the position in this country in comparison with other countries, and I propose not to disappoint him, by giving figures which would be of interest to the House, regarding the position in European countries in relation to this country.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The land surface of various countries under woods and forests (pre-war) was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Finland, 73.4 per cent.; Sweden, 60.0 per cent.; Austria, 41.8 per cent.; Russia, 40.4 per cent.; Yugoslavia, 31.2 per cent.; Hungary, 27.9 per cent.; Bulgaria, 27.0 per cent.; Germany, 26.2 per cent.; Norway, 23.0 per cent.; Poland, 20.5 per cent.; France, 17.8 per cent.; Belgium, 17.7 per cent.; Denmark, 9.0 per cent.; Holland, 7.9 per cent.; Great Britain, 5.4 per cent.; Éire, 1.4 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am interested in the question of the use of the term &ldquo;forestry's national objective&rdquo; as set out in the report for 1943, and in the steps we have taken or propose to take to reach at least that unambitious objective.  Questions were asked as recently as the 7th February by Deputy Murphy and Deputy Corish as to the acreage planted and acquired over the period since the State started to operate here.  In that respect, the figures are: total held at the end of March, 1945, 172,000 acres; amount planted, 117,000 acres.  That was over a period of 21 years.  If it is any solace to the Minister to throw the spotlight on the average plantings per year, during <Col N="1758" /> the period 1923 to 1945, these are the figures:&mdash;From 1923 to 1932, the average acreage planted was 3,000; from 1932 to 1945, it was 5,500. On that basis, I should like to remind the Minister that if his original estimate of 600,000 acres of commercial timber is to be realised in a period of, say, 21 to 25 years, it is obvious, on a simple calculation, that he would have to quadruple the planting of the peak period, 1938-39, when the figure, as far as I can recall, was in the region of 7,000 acres.  In the reply given to the Deputies I have named, there was certain information as to the acreage planted in the Gaeltacht areas, and in that respect it is worthy of note that no acquisition at all took place within the past six years in Donegal, Clare or Mayo, while the total acquisition in Kerry was 2½ acres.</P>
    <P>My fundamental disagreement with the Minister on this Bill is that he, in 1943, set a national target of 700,000 acres and it is obvious, despite all the difficulties which are, perhaps, more apparent to him because of his practical experience and the difficulties that naturally are associated with his administration, with which I am not connected, that if we continue even on the scale which was in operation in 1938-39, it would take a considerable length of time before that limited objective of the Minister's of 700,000 acres would be reached.</P>
    <P>In relation to the requirements of this country so far as wood and wood products were concerned, the Minister for Agriculture, in his report for the year 1931-32, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Timber to the value of over £1,000,000 is imported annually.  Of this the bulk takes the form of planks, boards, flooring, sleepers, staves, etc., representing about 200,000 tons.  It is probably a safe assumption that three-fourths of the total imports are made up of pine and spruce from Northern Europe. Both of these species can be grown at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The figure of £1,000,000, in 1932, expanded to a figure of £3,000,000 prior to the war.  Various experts have put the total acreage available for <Col N="1759" /> afforestation in this country as between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000, but taking a conservative estimate of 1,500,000 acres &mdash;I think there would be no dispute of that particular figure&mdash;as available for planting in this country and taking into consideration expert opinion that the soil and climate of this country are particularly favourable to afforestation and that even on the basis of pre-war there was a home market here of £3,000,000 for wood and wood products, and taking into consideration the fact that during the winter, which would be the planting season, there are in this country between 70,000 and 100,000 idle men living on public assistance, I suggest to the Minister that it is a matter for surprise at least that more effective steps are not being taken to exploit the possibility of national wealth which is vested in afforestation.</P>
    <P>I am glad, in any case, that we have cleared up one position so far as afforestation is concerned in respect of the Minister and his predecessors, and that is on the question of the type of land that should be acquired for afforestation.  In 1940, in this House, the then Minister for Lands, Mr. Derrig, said that the type of land that should be acquired would have to be of a fairly good arable quality.  The Minister, in his speech, and in his reply to Deputy Murphy and Deputy Corish, indicated that that was not the case, and indicated the type of land as mountain land or waste land, of which the price would not exceed £4 per acre.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Bill&mdash;the Minister referred to it at length, and quite rightly&mdash;deals with acquisition.  So far as I know&mdash;I may be entirely wrong&mdash; the Minister had all the powers he needed so far as acquisition was concerned up to this date.  He now proposes, under this Bill, to provide more elastic machinery, and I think the House will certainly support him in the new arrangement providing for a certificate, which can only be used within certain prescribed categories. What I am concerned with is this, that while the Minister takes all these elaborate precautions in so far as acquisition is concerned, he nevertheless, in a fairly long paragraph in his <Col N="1760" /> opening speech, made it quite clear that almost in all circumstances compulsory acquisition would not be resorted to&mdash;I say almost all&mdash;and he made the rather interesting revelation that so far as the operations of the Forestry Division were concerned, there were only two cases since 1919 where compulsory acquisition had to be resorted to.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister, in reply, that he is prepared to adhere to his report of 1943 in regard to that limited objective of 700,000 acres&mdash;apparently he refrained from quoting or adverting to it in his speech last evening&mdash;and that he will give an assurance and an indication to the House that he will take vigorous and effective steps to ensure that that minimum objective, at least, will be achieved in the shortest possible time. Finally, may I ask the Minister if he would be good enough, when replying, to give us, as a matter of interest, the extent of the employment given by forestry in this country at the present time, and the rates of wages which are in operation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Domhnall Ua Donnchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of what the last Deputy has said, I am inclined to do what is done in the part of the country which I know best when something of outstanding merit is done by a member of the family, that is, to put a notch on the mantel-shelf, because, for the first time since Fianna Fáil took office, for the second time since this State was established, and for the third time during the memory of man, an attempt has been made to legislate on forestry in this country.  If we compare the present measure with the Acts of 1919 and 1928 we cannot but convince ourselves that the Minister has in mind doing something more than was done under the previous Acts.  The Act of 1919 contains 11 sections; the Act of 1928 20 sections; the Bill before the House contains 64 sections.  If and when it is enacted it will be the law of the land so far as forestry is concerned. Even though Deputy O'Sullivan is disappointed because the Minister has not stated categorically the area he will set about planting, a study of Section 9 (1) will show that <Col N="1761" /> this is not going to be the last word so far as forestry legislation is concerned, that it is simply the beginning of legislation.</P>
      <P>Though very little has been done since the State was established, there is one thing to be said for the Forestry Department, and that is that it has been consistent.  I should like to see, not five or six thousand acres planted per year, but five times that amount, as Deputy O'Sullivan suggested. But I would much prefer to see the Minister and the man responsible under him for forestry biting off only as much as they can chew.  If you compare the acreage acquired and the acreage planted over any certain years from 1922 to 1943, the last year for which figures are available, you will find that there is a consistency there which one must admire.  If we take the year 1922, we find we had only 14,415 acres acquired by the State. That was the amount that they took over from the Department of Agriculture that operated here during the British time.  In 1930, the acreage acquired was 41,924 and the acreage planted 23,361.  In 1932, when Fianna Fáil took office, 48,911 acres had been acquired and 30,570 planted.  In 1943, 165,530 acres had been acquired and 94,530 planted.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement yesterday said that the first serious attempt at restoring our forests was in 1904.  History tells us, though history sometimes is not very accurate, that away back hundreds of years ago when our lands were planted, not with spruce or fir, but with people imported from Great Britain, one of the conditions under which the people got grants of 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 acres was that they would plant with forest a certain proportion of the lands given to them. In the year 1880 we had 340,000 acres of woodland, or 1.7 per cent. of the total area of the Thirty-Two Counties.  From that on there was no respect for any tree in this country that was not worth money and these trees were cut down and exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1903 or 1904 the first serious attempt at Government control was introduced. There was an annual vote of £6,000 for the development of forestry in Ireland.  That £6,000 does <Col N="1762" /> not compare very favourably with the amount for which the Minister asked for the year 1945-46 for the Twenty-Six Counties.  He asked for £256,651. When comparing that figure with the total Vote, however, I was sadly disappointed, because it only represents 1/183 rd part of the total Vote, or 1.3d. in the pound.  In fact when I saw that amount of a little over 1¼d. in the pound it reminded me of the story I heard of two lads, Padraic and Seán. They died and were being judged together. Seán was asked what good he had done on earth to merit his getting into heaven.  He said that he had given a penny to a poor man.  He had to think harder and then he remembered having given a penny to a poor woman on another occasion.  He thought still harder and he remembered having given a halfpenny to a gossoon.  He was told that that would not do.  At this stage, Padraic was getting impatient and he told the big man at the gate to throw him his 2½d. and let him go to hell.  I felt like that when I saw 1.3d. out of every pound being devoted to forestry which is a matter of such importance that I think the Minister himself said not long ago that he had no reason to believe otherwise than that at some future date our whole national economy would revolve around forestry.  I agree with him.  I think the Minister is serious about that, and that this measure is, as I suggested earlier, only the start.</P>
    <P>If we look at Section 9 (1) (i) we will find that the Minister proposes to undertake the collection, preparation, publication and distribution of statistics relating to forestry.  In Section (j) he proposes to make &ldquo;such inquiry, experiments and research and collect or aid in collecting such information as he thinks important for the purpose of promoting forestry and the teaching of forestry.&rdquo;  I suggest seriously that what the Minister has in mind is making a survey to see what our requirements are.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Minister should set about planting 700,000 acres.  Some Deputies have gone so far as to suggest that between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 acres should be the safety line.  I suggest, that given this authority under this Bill, the Minister should <Col N="1763" /> estimate the amount of timber we require and then set about acquiring at least as much land as will carry sufficient trees to supply our own requirements. Deputy O'Sullivan suggests that enough timber should be provided to meet our requirements as far as boards, planks and timber of that kind go, but I am a firm believer in going much further than that.  Our climate, the Deputy says, is admirable for the growing of trees.  It is certainly admirable for the growing of trees but I do not know whether it is admirable for the growing of what the Minister or his experts would call commercial timber.  If by commercial timber is meant timber which is used in building, that is a matter upon which I can offer no opinion but I do say that, judging by the amount of water we have in this country and the amount of land that is barely above sea level, there is no particular reason why we should not encourage the growing of trees which thrive on water.  That brings us, apart from the building industry and the furniture industry which use up timber, to the paper industry. We import year after year hundreds and hundreds of tons of pulp. As a matter of fact coming up here on Tuesday I read that a ship, probably named after one of our trees, &ldquo;The Poplar,&rdquo; was expected into port bringing 500 tons of wood pulp and 200 tons of cardboard.  There is no particular reason why land, admirably suited for the growing of trees that thrive in water, should not be utilised to the fullest extent for producing such timber.  It is not yet 12 months since we had to legislate here to provide machinery to remove some of the water from the land.  The natural way to remove it would be to plant more and more trees that thrive on water.</P>
    <P>In my constituency in South Kerry there is a place called Gleann na Beighe, the Glen of the Birch, a name that has been handed down for years and years, which shows that birch thrived there.  We imported in 1938, the last normal year prior to the war, 15,250,000 square feet of plywood.  Most of that came from Europe, and 80 per cent. of European plywood is made from birch.  Therefore I see no reason <Col N="1764" /> why, in the Minister's proposals, a scheme should not be included for the growing of birch to supply our requirements in plywood.  Taking again 1938, we find that paper and cardboard to the value of £1,500,000 was imported and that timber to the value of £1,500,000, or thereabouts, was imported. In addition, we imported 500 tons of newsprint and 120,000 tons of pulp.  In the paper industry which could very easily depend, or be made to depend, on the timber industry, we had in 1938, 2,336 people employed, in the timber industry, 3,696, and in subsidiary industries, 2,809&mdash;making a total of 8,841 individuals earning £1,000,000.  With the extra industries which could be started, had we our own forests, there is no reason why that number could not be multiplied, not by two or three, but by 10.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact I give the Minister credit for having that particular matter in mind, because under Part II of the Bill the Minister aims at the starting of woodland industries.  To my mind, one way in which we can decentralise industry and de-urbanise labour is by having our woods centred in places as far away as possible from towns and cities.  We could have them of such size that plants could be erected there.  Work in these woodland industries could be carried through so economically that it would pay us to run these industries instead of importing either the raw material for manufacture in the towns and cities or the finished article.  Under Part II, Section 9, the Minister intends carrying out experiments and to encourage forestry education.  He has been doing that already.  In his Estimate, last year, he catered for the education of young men who would take up forestry as a profession, but if and when the time comes when our whole economy will revolve around the timber or around forestry as the Minister himself suggested not very long ago, I think the amount to be set aside for forestry education must be increased considerably.</P>
    <P>We cannot compare the importance of forestry at the moment with the importance of agriculture, but we look forward to the time when it will be as useful to us as agriculture.  The same <Col N="1765" /> difference cannot and must not lie between the amount devoted to forestry education and that voted to agricultural education.  During the present year, the Minister asked for £1,547, while the Minister for Agriculture asked for £80,444,52 times the amount, for agricultural education.  The Minister appears to be principally concerned with State forestry but he is also determined to encourage private enterprise.  Anyone reading Section 9 (1) (f) will be glad that he is so inclined. He proposes there to make advances by grant or loan, or partly in one way and partly in another, to persons, including local authorities, in respect of afforestation of lands belonging to those persons.  I am glad the Minister has thought seriously about that.</P>
    <P>Someone suggested yesterday that most of the trees and forests we had here up to the setting up of the State and subsequently were planted on private estates.  Now that the number of private estates is diminishing, when the lands are being divided and given to landless men, it is evident that policy can no longer obtain and that the efforts of local authorities and individuals must supplement the State forests, if we are ever to arrive at that point when we can safely say we have enough wood to meet the timber and paper requirements of our own State.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why the private individual should be encouraged to plant.  We cannot find 100 per cent. respect for public property just yet.  There is scarcely a week that young fellows are not charged with throwing stones at the cups along the railway.  We hear appeals to councils and other bodies to dissuade young fellows from defacing walls or painting on them.  There are appeals even to political bodies not to put the slogans on the roads.  There is a danger that, even after spending millions on forests, the carelessness or the lack of interest in them by our people might start fires or cause irreparable damage.</P>
    <P>The way to avoid that is to encourage the people to realise that these forests are their own and it would be hard to do that until they <Col N="1766" /> become interested in the growing of trees.  That is best achieved by getting them to plant trees.  Even if a person planted but one tree and saw it growing, there is something in it which appeals to the individual. Such a tree actually talks to people. The more people who can be got to grow trees, regardless of whether they are commercial trees or otherwise, the more widespread will be the respect for the State forests and the surer we will be to have them protected by public opinion.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, a society of foresters was formed here in Dublin and I believe that it was extended to include people interested in forestry and the growing of trees.  I do not know what progress that society has made, or what its aims are, though I have an invitation to attend the next meeting. If the Minister were to take my advice, instead of forming a society for the purposes of encouraging forestry, he would ask some of the existing societies to co-operate with him in his drive.</P>
    <P>At the present moment, we can legislate only for the Twenty-Six Counties, but we are all looking forward to the time when we will be able to legislate for the Thirty-two.  In the meantime, any voluntary effort which has to be made should be spread not through the Twenty-six but through the Thirty-two, and any organisation having branches over the Thirty-two Counties should be asked to co-operate in this drive.  I think it was in Ulster that compulsory planning was first started and the earliest date I can trace it to is 1609.  If they planted then, there is no reason why they would not plant now.  There is one organisation which spreads through Ulster as well as through Munster, Leinster and Connaught&mdash;the Gaelic Athletic Association.  It has branches in every parish and the Minister should encourage that body to take over voluntarily the development of tree planting.  We did it in the early days of the war in Kerry and the Kerry County Board agreed to give a present of 1,000 forest trees to the team winning the County Championship. With the slightest little bit of drive and the encouragement of the Minister <Col N="1767" /> and this House, something similar could be done all over the country. Other organisations beside the Gaelic Athletic Association might be encouraged to do the same.</P>
    <P>I agree with the speakers who said that the Forestry Department is going slowly but, on an examination of the figures, I am satisfied they have moved slowly but moved surely.  A start is being made with this Bill and there is no reason why, within the next five years, another measure would not be introduced giving wider powers if necessary. The Minister admits that some of the powers sought under this Bill go much further than the powers held under the 1928 Act.</P>
    <P>I come from a county where over 50 per cent. of the land is not fit for growing crops.  I am much concerned with that because of the number of people there who claim to have rights of grazing over land which I believe is suitable only for the growing of trees. The Minister proposes to abolish some of these rights.  He alluded to the rights which do not go so far as ownership and my suggestion is, for peace sake, instead of abolishing the right altogether, that they will get an absolute right over a smaller amount&mdash;instead of having the right to graze over ten or 20 acres, that they will get an absolute right over one or two acres. Unless there is compromise like that, the Minister or this House cannot hope to have the goodwill of the people who will be living adjacent to the forests when they are planted there.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer and that is planting by the sea coast.  Somebody here said that there was scarcely any planting done in the Gaeltacht districts.  I think the simple reason is that it is maintained that the trees would not flourish along by the sea coast where the Gaeltacht is.  I agree that the first and second and third line of trees grown adjacent to the sea will not flourish, but there is no particular reason why experiments such as have been carried out, I think, in Sligo, would not be carried out generally along by the sea coast.  Anybody going along the western coast of France, by the Bay of <Col N="1768" /> Biscay, cannot fail to see trees growing there in the very sand.  I saw them myself. If you look up the history of how these trees came to grow there you will find that towards the end of the 18th century France was being threatened by the sea, it was being eaten away. At the end of the century a society was formed for the purpose of protecting the coast and of promoting the interests of forestry.  Rows and rows of Corsican pines were planted there and, even though the rows nearest the sea grew as cailihini, the trees further in thrived and the land was protected.</P>
    <P>Now, with the exception of a part of the western coast, there is no particular reason why all the rest of our coast would not be planted, and I think that a start should be made, not along the parts where you are almost sure they will grow, but, talking of Kerry, along the western coast of Kerry where no trees stronger than the fuchsia thrive there at the moment, and it would encourage people who grow some trees from seeds there with very little success. People tell me that the inroads of the western wind are such that it would take not one or two, but maybe 20, rows of trees to break it.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to make a start with the coast of Kerry.  I asked a number of people in the parish of Ballyferriter if they would co-operate with the Minister in any experiment he might carry out, and they told me they would be delighted to put a strip of land there at his disposal.  I am throwing out the suggestion to him now that he should accept the invitation and experiment there, with the view of growing trees along there, and helping not only to beautify the place, but to make the lands further inland capable of carrying more cattle than they are carrying at the moment.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers who maintain that the amount of planting done in this country since the State was established is very small, that it is inadequate, but I am satisfied on account of the consistency with which they have worked.  I am satisfied with the measure before us, and with the promise of the Minister that this is not the last word in forestry, and that within a few years we will have a <Col N="1769" /> measure giving the Minister even wider powers than he is asking for in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite obvious that the last speaker has a deep interest in this matter of forestry, and that he has gone to some pains to keep himself fully informed on the matter. He has very optimistic hopes for the future of forestry&mdash;enthusiastic hopes. I am sorry that the Deputy's hopes as to what will grow out of the forestry business in this country, if I may so put it, are likely to be shattered.  I think it is a pity that the Deputy did not give the same close attention to the Minister's explanatory statement, which was circulated, that he apparently gave to the Bill, because, if he had, I do not see how he could have any hope for the future of forestry, or how he could think there will be any forestry in the future in this country. If the Deputy will look at the first page of the Minister's statement he will see this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not the object of this Bill to provide for any radical changes in policy and plans in relation to the furtherance of forest needs but rather to improve in divers minor respects the statutory machinery under which the business of forestry is carried on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The needs of Irish forestry are keenly appreciated in all quarters; indeed, the forestry service is frequently the butt of criticism by enthusiasts whose zeal for a more rapid restoration of Irish woodlands refuses to be trammelled by practical considerations.  Ireland, is, as Deputies will probably stress in the course of this debate, comparatively the worst situated of all European countries in its home-grown timber supplies and Deputies will probably be disappointed that thé measure now before the House does not contain more virile provisions aimed at remedying that state of affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next part of it is the part to which I want to draw the attention of the Deputy who has spoken.  Here is summed up the Minister's whole policy <Col N="1770" /> and philosophy in connection with forestry:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I wish, therefore, to make it quite clear that it is my view, and the view of the experts who are responsible for the technical control of forestry work, that the present scheme of expansion is adequate, and is best suited to meet the country's needs.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a matter upon which one could go into the question of principle.  It is one of judging whether it would be convenient and practicable.  Whatever we may think of the principle underlying the amendment, that the views of the persons concerned ought to be expressed confidentially and ought to be regarded as a matter peculiar and particular to themselves, I do not think it would be wise to set up the elaborate machinery which the acceptance of the amendment would involve.  The amendment seeks to provide that the ballot must be secret, and will be taken on the assumption that that is a more convenient and, from the public point of view, a better way of ascertaining the wishes of the inhabitants of the street.  It might be a question as to whether it is necessary. As I indicated already, the views of those primarily interested in the question of changing the name&mdash;the <Col N="1771" /> views of the ratepayers in the street&mdash; are ascertained in a confidential way. They are not disclosed to any person, but the obligation is put upon the local authority to endeavour to get every ratepayer in the street to express a view, one way or another.  The mere fact that the necessary forms are delivered&mdash;I do not know whether they are delivered by hand and again collected, or by post&mdash;to an officer of the local authority concerned does ensure, to some extent, that there will be an adequate expression of opinion on the part of the ratepayers.  That is all done in a very simple way under the existing machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to accept this amendment we should have to go much further than it does, because we should have to make statutory provision for the taking of this ballot; we should have to prescribe the manner in which it was to be taken, we should have to lay down the whole procedure.  We should, for instance, have to determine whether the ballot would be conducted according to the rules of postal voting or whether, instead of that, we should not have ratepayers attending in person at the appointed place to tender their votes.  Then, perhaps, we should have to make provision for the appointment of a returning officer, or a person who would preside over the ballot, who would announce the result, and who would ensure that the result was brought to the notice of the local authority concerned. We should, in fact, have to provide a whole code for the conduct of this matter, and I suggest to the House that we should not, in what is, after all, a comparatively simple matter, extend the administrative problems of a local authority in the way it would be necessary to do if we accepted the amendment.  Unless there is a really compelling reason, something which coerces us as to the justice and equity of it, we should not necessarily elaborate the procedure for ascertaining the mind of a section of the people in regard to any public matter.  For that reason, while it is not a matter of principle, but merely a question of what is convenient, and what is sufficiently effective to deal <Col N="1772" /> with the matter, I feel that we ought not to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I readily recognise that the implementation of this amendment would involve considerable legislation and possibly administrative difficulties.  I am vague in regard to the procedure at present adopted.  I am quite satisfied if the Minister would indicate that precautions would be taken to ensure that voting would not be given publicity.  That is a rather difficult matter, because if the views of the ratepayers concerned are taken by an official of a local authority, I think it is open to the local authority to look into the papers and to scrutinise them.  I imagine they would have power to do that.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not reply to Deputy Corish's question as to the difficulty an official of a local authority might find himself in, that is to say, if undue pressure were brought to bear on him in regard to the manner in which he would give his decision. As a matter of fact, this is a matter in which an official of the local authority would be called upon to make a count of the votes for and against the proposition and it would be a rather invidious position for an official of the local authority.  If the Minister were to look into this whole question before the Report Stage he might possibly be able to find some means by which the interests of the ratepayers who might possibly be intimidated in some way would be protected, and by which there would be no undue or unfair pressure brought on any official of the Department in connection with the matter.  If the Minister would give that assurance, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 55, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that I wish to raise&mdash;I raised it on the <Col N="1773" /> Second Reading of the Bill&mdash;namely, the question of empowering local authorities to change the names of townlands.  There is no power that I know of to do that.  In my constituency it is the unanimous wish of the local authority to change the name of one townland.  I asked the Minister on the Second Reading to bring in an amendment giving local authorities that power but I see no amendment down that would empower a local authority to change the name of a townland in the same way as an urban authority is empowered to change the name of a street.  I think it is generally found throughout the country that 90 per cent. of the names of townlands are national names derived from old Irish names, whereas we find that probably not 5 per cent. of streets bear national names unless they have been changed within the last 20 or 25 years.</P>
      <P>I have often thought that that is a great pity.  I have a particular case in mind, the townland of Bunclody, which is known officially as Newtownbarry, much to the disgust of the people living within the townland.  All the people of that area want the name changed to Bunclody but there seems to be no power to do so.  I want the Minister to bring in an amendment to this Bill giving the local authority power to do so, by the same machinery, if you like, as is here provided for changing the names of streets and subject to the sanction of the Minister, if that is desired.  The section should be further amended so as to provide that when a name is changed it will continue under that name for 25 or 50 years or any long period.  In regard to the point raised by Deputy Walsh, if a local authority name a street or a new terrace of houses that they have built, the local authority coming after them should not have the power to alter the name of that street, and I suggest to the Minister that the section should be still further amended so as to provide that once a local authority has changed the name of a street or has named a street or a terrace of houses, the succeeding local authority should not have the power to alter it, but that it should stand for a considerable time &mdash;20 years, 50 years, or some period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very definitely, the people of County <Col N="1774" /> Wexford have a grievance, because there is no power whereby the local authority or the people living in this district can change the name.  It is known to everyone as Bunclody, but cannot be recorded as such on the register.  The Post Office call it Newtownbarry. Government Departments call it Newtownbarry, but the people of the district all call it Bunclody. There may be other townlands similarly situated.  There is one thing that local residents are entitled to have, namely, the right to call their townland as is desired by an overwhelming majority in the particular townland.  I would ask the Minister to consider bringing in an amendment on Report to cover that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to what Deputy Allen has said, I will look into that particular matter to see what we can do about changing the names of townlands.  Of course, the real trouble in this regard is that the law relating to the nomenclature of towns and cities and streets was in a rather confused condition.  We are bringing it into some sort of regularity now in relation to urban areas, but about townlands I have some reservation.  However, I will look into it and see what we can do.</P>
      <P>On the question of prescribing that once a name has been adopted it will continue to be the name of the particular place for a period, that may present other difficulties.  I think the provision which we are now making to ensure that there will be a reasonable majority in favour of the change will prevent the sort of spasmodic changes which appear to have been taking place at least in one urban area.  Henceforward, whatever else this section does, it prescribes that the name will not be changed except with the consent of a certain number of people.  That will prevent a local authority from behaving in the way that Deputy Walsh told the House Drogheda Corporation behaved on at least two occasions.</P>

Usage made it O'Connell Street but the bourgeoisie called it Sackville Street. My partner and I, in our national ideals, called it O'Connell Street. There was a well-known firm in the street at that time that called itself by such-and-such a company, Dublin, and never mentioned either O'Connell Street or Sackville Street.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 6 and 7, to delete the words &ldquo;in their opinion&rdquo;; in line 7 to delete the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;in the future&rdquo;; and in line 8 to delete all the words after the word &ldquo;duties&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>So far as I can see, Deputy Hughes's amendment is to ensure that a local authority will not embark upon the purchase of land until it has absolutely satisfied itself that it needs the land for the purpose of exercising its powers ánd duties and that it will not embark upon the purchase of land when it has not definitely determined on using the land for some public purpose.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that that is almost a direct negative to the section.  It certainly would make the proposed section superfluous.  With some idea of the trend of town and country planning and what the future requirements of urban areas for land may be in that connection, we are seeking to give local authorities power to acquire by agreement land which, in their opinion, they will require in future for the purpose of their powers and duties.  Notwithstanding that, the section says that, at the moment, they need not determine the purpose for which they will use the land.  I think that that is a very necessary power if we are to have any sort of town and country planning, because the one merges in the other.  It is necessary, I think, to enable local authorities, who are taking a farsighted view of what their future aims may be, to acquire land which will enable them to give effect to what they think will be their ultimate aims and purposes.  For that reason I could not accept the amendment, which seems to me almost directly to negative the effect of the section and which, in any event, would make it superfluous.</P>

      <P>The trouble is that the Parliamentary draftsman actually has a very strong objection to putting in words that may be superfluous and that are not clearly required for the purpose of expressing the meaning of the section.  They are not required here, because the local authority may let the land.  That is a general term. It does not refer to any specific or definite portion of land.  They may let any land which they may have and they may sell any land which they may have.  That is the effect of the section and I do not think the amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 116:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add after sub-section (5) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6)  Where land acquired by a local authority has been dedicated to the use of the public and the local authority are of opinion that the use of such land by the public has been abandoned or is no longer required they may sell it with the consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>This is designed to meet the case where land was formerly acquired by a local authority and dedicated to the public and has since been abandoned and is no longer required by the local authority for public purposes.  I understand that there is doubt in a case of that kind that the local authority has statutory power to sell the land. I put down this amendment in order to remove that doubt.  I know a case where land was taken in some time ago from an estate.  Subsequently a portion of that land was converted to public use.  It has since been abandoned for all practical public purposes and is no use to the local authority. I am advised that the local authority has no statutory power in a case of that kind to sell the land, if they so desire.  I am seeking to give the local authority power in a case of that kind if they so think fit, to sell the land to a private householder or business firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to what the effect of the amendment would be, nor indeed as to what is the precise difficulty which the Deputy is endeavouring to solve by the amendment.  There are a number of expressions in it which I think would afford occasion for quite a great deal of legal discussion.  There is, first of all, the question of &ldquo;where land has been dedicated to the use of the public&rdquo;.  What constitutes dedication I think the Deputy will appreciate is not always very clear.  In addition to that, where the public have acquired certain rights in land they may be of a very general character and they may be precarious and uncertain.  In fact, <Col N="1779" /> the local authority may in some cases have a statutory power to take those rights away.  I was referring to what precisely would constitute dedication to the use of the public.  A road, say, over which the public have a right of passage might be on land acquired by a local authority.</P>
      <P>The local authority might have abandoned the road, but the right of passage might not be extinguishable and perhaps they would not be able to sell the land.  On the other hand, they might be able to extinguish the right of passage and the land might be sold.  I do not want to resist the purpose which the Deputy has in view in regard to this amendment until I am quite clear that the purpose which he has in mind should be rejected.  If he could let me have a note of some cases which he thinks should be dealt with under this proposed new sub-section, I would look into the matter and see whether we can meet him at all, or whether it can be met by an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Minister in considering the amendment will be very careful as to its implications. The section as it stands refers specifically to land acquired under sub-section (1) and all the subsections have that same reference.  In Deputy Coogan's amendment there is, however, no reference to land being acquired under sub-section (1) and, in its present drafting, it could apply to any land acquired at any time by a local authority.  I think that raises a principle that many of us would strenuously object to.  For instance, take the city estate of the Dublin Corporation.  At present they have no power to sell that.  With this amendment inserted, the gate would be wide open possibly to speculation in the city estate.  The other difficulty I see is that it is quite possible that a parcel of land may be in the possession of a local authority for some time and used as a public park.  It may be very valuable and it is possible to envisage circumstances where the controlling body on that local authority might decide to dispose of that piece of land. It might be entirely against the public <Col N="1780" /> interest and yet under the powers conferred by the amendment, the possibility would be there.  While it may be argued that they are subject to the eventual control of the citizens and the ratepayers, by the time the citizens and the ratepayers have acquired control, the damage may have been done.</P>
      <P>It may be said that there is a safeguard, inasmuch as the consent of the Minister must be obtained, but Ministers change, just as local authorities do, and it is possible that we may have a Minister in office whose regard for the public interests might not be of the character of that of the Minister we have in office now, or who may be in office in the immediate future.  I can quite readily conceive the possibility of large and valuable sections of public property being disposed of under the powers suggested in the amendment.  I think, if anything, the section as a whole should be allowed to stand as it is, and the question can be argued on the principle as a whole at a later stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the view put forward by Deputy Larkin to a large extent, and perhaps the amendment would have been better framed if I had suggested a new section rather than couple the amendment with Section 57.  I had not in mind land acquired under Section 57, but I have in mind land which was acquired long ago, and which is not now used even as a public place, and which has been virtually abandoned for all public purposes. Neighbouring householders might need expansion in the way of a yard or some facility of that kind, and I think that it is only right in a case of that kind, if the local authority were satisfied, that they should have the right to sell such land to adjoining householders with the consent of the Minister.  The case of Dublin is a big problem, I agree, but the case I have in mind is a rather small one.  Some years ago, on the De Vesci estate in Dun Laoghaire, when the landlords were selling their houses, they gave the right to a number of householders in a certain street to enclose a certain portion of ground at the rere of the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the actual cases I have in mind, <Col N="1781" /> the householders did not opt to take this portion of land at the rere of their premises, but their successors in title do require the ground for the purposes of convenience and of business generally.  They are cramped in space and they have been denied rights which the adjoining householders got a number of years ago.  The land, I believe, is, in the opinion of the local authority and their engineers, useless for public purposes.  The householders are quite prepared in the circumstances, if the local authority is willing to sell, to buy at a reasonable price.  There is no question at all of interference with the right of passage or the right of the public to use the place.  The land is there and it is derelict.  Through a mischance in the past, this land was not enclosed and it is virtually useless. Portion of the place has been set aside as a parking ground but in my experience, since going to reside there in 1939, it has never been used as a parking place.  If the local authority intended to build on it they would naturally enclose it.  It is a case of that kind I have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether the acquisition of land under this section is a reserved function.  I suggest it should be a reserved function, and that the local authority should know the purpose of the acquisition of such land.  The section is a bit wide and if the local authority had no knowledge of what the land was being acquired for, it might be acquired over their heads.  I agree with the principle of the section, that it is necessary to have a kind of <i>ad hoc</i> authority to acquire land when it comes on the market without waiting to set up machinery to acquire it.  I know an instance in which a local authority had <Col N="1782" /> to pay triple the price for land because they could not buy it when it was first offered on the market.  They had no power without going through the usual course of law and when the matter had gone through the usual course of law, they had to pay three times the price at which they could have bought the land on the open market.</P>
      <P>I believe that this should be a reserved function and that when land is being acquired for any purpose the local authority should be consulted.  If they are going to pay I suppose they could refuse to find the money but I suggest that, apart from that, they should be consulted by the manager.  While I am on that subject, I believe that under the existing law county managers can dispose of property without the authority of the council or without even referring the matter to the council.  That may lead to trouble in future.  It is something the Minister should look into because one individual should not have the right to dispose of property acquired and paid for by a local authority without consulting that authority. The right should not repose in one individual to dispose of public property already paid for by the taxpayers of the area without their authority.</P>

      <P>As to the point Deputy Allen has made, I am not convinced that it is necessary to include here provisions specifically constituting this a reserved function, because one thing certain in this country is that no person, except perhaps in the case which Deputy Coogan has mentioned, which I think is extremely rare, can acquire land without money.  Certainly the manager cannot raise money on his own account.  Only the local authority can consent to the raising of money, either by way of loan or by way of rate.  In regard to the other point, as to the power of the manager to dispose of property, I think I should require to look into that matter a little more carefully before I commit <Col N="1783" /> myself.  I should be surprised to find that the county manager could dispose of property without the consent of the local authority.</P>

      <P>We can look into it. I find that one of the matters in respect of which the powers, functions and duties are reserved functions is, according to the County Management Act, 1940, &ldquo;the disposition (otherwise than by demise for a term not exceeding one year) under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Acts, 1840 to 1888, of lands, tenements, or hereditaments.&rdquo; The precise scope of that provision must be examined before I can commit myself to any definite view on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>(1)  Where any council of a county, corporation of a county borough or urban authority have for the time being any power to borrow money, they may, with the consent of the Minister, exercise such power by the creation of stock to be created, issued, transferred, dealt with, redeemed and extinguished in such manner, on such terms and in accordance with such provisions as may be prescribed.</P>

    <P>(e)  disposal of unclaimed dividends.</P>
    <P>(3)  Before making regulations for the purposes of this section, the Minister shall consult the Minister for Finance in relation to such regulations.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every regulation made for the purpose of this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 30 days on which the House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>(5)  If no such resolution as is mentioned in sub-section (4) of this section is passed in relation to any regulation made for the purposes of this section, the regulation shall be deemed to have been duly made and to be within the powers of this Act and shall be of the same force as if enacted in this Act.</P>

I have a further amendment later on, on this question of inquiries, under Section 62.  Inquiries of a public character should be conducted by people with some knowledge of the law and of the rules of evidence.  If you appoint a purely technical person, such as an engineer, he may be perfectly qualified to deal with certain technical aspects of the inquiry but may not be at all qualified to deal with what I consider the important aspects&mdash;the nature of the evidence which is admissible.  From experience, I find that local Government inquiries may often take on the character of a fishing inquiry.</P>

That is an obnoxious system and very unfair to those whose positions and livelihood are at stake.  That does not arise so much on this as on the subsequent amendment.  Public inquiries of this nature should be conducted as far as possible after the manner of a court, having regard to the rules of evidence. If the Minister takes the view that it is an investigation, then so is every case before a court and the courts are not restricted in any degree in their investigation except by the rules of evidence.  They may not take in every fishy story they hear and may not accept every hearsay yarn that comes along.  It is with a view to stopping that kind of thing I put down this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the purpose of this section has been misunderstood by the Deputy, and that some of the points he proposes to raise might be raised more effectively on a later section.  Contrary to the general opinion, and certainly contrary to the views which have been expressed here in the Dáil, the Department of Local Government is not overstaffed but understaffed, particularly in regard to inspectors.  It is often found to be a matter of great difficulty to allocate an officer to act as inspector to hold an inquiry, particularly where it may be of a protracted nature, as in the case of the Limerick Gas Undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this section is to enable the Minister to appoint temporary inspectors to hold investigations which may be protracted.  I quite admit that, in some circumstances, the person appointed should possess special qualifications.  In some cases, these qualifications may be of a legal nature and in other instances they may be of a technical character.  Having recognised the need for this&mdash;it having been brought home particularly in connection with the Limerick inquiry, and one or two other instances, the Cork Fire Brigade Inquiry, for instance&mdash;the purpose of this provision is to allow us to meet that situation, which may arise more often in the future than it has in the past.  It is not desired to enlarge the permanent <Col N="1788" /> inspectorate in the Department for the purpose of holding such inquiries and this will enable us to appoint a person <i>ad hoc</i> in such special cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the inquiry mentioned by the Minister is specifically a case in point.  There you had a marathon inquiry, extending over a very long period, and you had the parties before that inquiry represented by counsel.  The inquiry was conducted by an engineer.</P>
      <P>My point in putting down the amendment is that I consider it is unfair to put a technically qualified engineer into the position of having to decide on matters of evidence, particularly where issues of such a serious nature were at stake as at the Limerick inquiry.  I think it would be much better if the person holding the inquiry were a legally qualified person and the engineer were to act as his assessor.  You can reverse the position if you like, and, if the technical aspect is the overwhelming consideration, then I suggest that the engineer should have a legal assessor.  The Minister can quite see that counsel can, at a public inquiry, get in a whole lot of material, perhaps very damaging material to the interests of a particular party, before that inquiry which he could not attempt to get in before a court of law.  It is for that purpose I am raising this issue.  I think we should put this more or less on the basis of a legal tribunal&mdash; perhaps not altogether on that basis, but as far as possible the conduct of the proceedings before the tribunal should be based on the practice and procedure in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the Deputy and I are poles apart.  These inquiries are not trials; they are not judicial processes; they are in the nature of an investigation.  They are what they purport to be, what their name proclaims them to be&mdash;inquiries, investigations to ascertain facts, not to prove charges.  In connection with the Limerick inquiry, the fact that had to be ascertained there was whether the manager of the gas works was competent or incompetent; whether he had been allowed to carry on a function properly as a manager of such a concern should be allowed.  These were <Col N="1789" /> matters that could only properly be determined by a person with technical qualification, by an engineer and not by a lawyer.  There was not any question as to whether the manager was producing gas illegally.  The question at issue was as to whether the manager was producing gas efficiently and economically, or whether the organisation which had been built up around him was such as to prevent him from producing gas efficiently or economically. Those were the points of issue and there was no legal aspect in the matter.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that lawyers were engaged on both sides.  I do not want to reflect upon the legal profession, but I think that perhaps the inquiry would have been shorter and that the results would have been ascertained with equal certitude if, instead of having persons whose sole practice was the practice of the law, the parties who had to justify themselves at the inquiry, or the persons concerned in the inquiry, had had a couple of people technically competent to consider the technical issues raised and to advise them on those issues.  It was arising out of that that we found there was a need on occasions to have people with particular technical knowledge and, I quite frankly admit, people with legal qualifications to act as investigators.</P>
      <P>These inquiries are not all of the same type.  Sometimes they will be concerned as to whether road maintenance and construction and civil engineering works have been properly carried out.  The only person who can decide this is a civil engineer, a person himself competent to construct roads and bridges.  In other instances, as in the case of the Limerick inquiry, it may be a question as to whether a municipal undertaking or a gas undertaking has been properly run.  On other occasions it may be as to whether a hospital has been properly conducted or a patient properly treated.  These are matters in which, I suggest, persons who have an intimate and competent knowledge are better able to determine and decide&mdash;because you must remember that this is an investigation and not a trial&mdash;much more competent to determine and decide than a lawyer could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1790" /> There may be other occasions where questions of accountancy will arise. Again, an accountant would be better employed because it is not the law or the application of the law that is involved in these matters, except on very rare occasions. What is involved in most of these inquiries is the question of administration, the extent to which the administration is good or bad, the extent to which say, a storekeeper has accounted properly for the goods entrusted to his care, the extent to which a doctor has properly attended to his patients, or the extent to which an engineer has carried out duties efficiently and economically.  These are technical matters and they are not matters to be made the subject of a trial.</P>
    <P>We have to remember in connection with this that the inquiries are, if you like, fishing inquiries, because the need to hold an inquiry will perhaps arise only on what appears to be an isolated matter.  When we receive a complaint from somewhere that moneys are not being properly accounted for, or that a bridge has not been properly constructed, we send a person down, not with very precise terms of reference; we send him down generally to investigate the whole conduct of a local service. Sometimes when it is a case of the treatment of a patient, it may specifically relate to that, but remember, when these cases come to our notice they are only, so to speak, a trace of smoke indicating that there is a large fire, and when we send an inspector down, naturally he starts on the specific matter that has been brought to his notice, but in the course of his investigations he may uncover a lot of other things which indicate that the local administration is not as it ought to be.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would be quite impossible to fulfil the purpose of these inquiries if they were to be regarded as trials at which charges would have to be formulated and at which charges would have to be proved according to the rules of evidence.  The trouble created in this matter is because the public mind has been confused as to the function which an inspector has to fulfil.  An inspector is, as his name <Col N="1791" /> implies, an inspector.  When he holds an inquiry he goes to inquire and he goes there not limited in the scope of his investigation to any narrow issue. If we feel it necessary to have a sworn inquiry into any matter of local administration, we are not going to send an inspector there with his hands tied behind his back and one eye blindfolded. He goes down with his eyes wide open and, if he suspects any defect in that local administration, it is his duty to probe it to the bottom. That is the only way in which we can keep our local administration clean and efficient.  Accordingly, as I already indicated, I could not accept this amendment, and I cannot accept any amendment, the purpose of which would in any way tend to change the nature of the sworn inquiries and make them judicial proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that there are degrees in this matter.  There is quite a good case for his argument that a technical man will be probably the best qualified in regard to mortar, cement and engineering work, but where the livelihood of individual officers may be at stake, it is only right and proper that the inspector should be hedged around with law.  The position is that the inspector like every other citizen is subject to the law and cannot get outside the law. Neither can the Minister.  All I am seeking here is to ensure that where an individual officer's future may be at stake, some regard will be had to the evidence, and that there will be some limit to the fishing investigation. The only way to impose a limit is to insist that the investigation will be carried out in accordance with the rules of evidence, and that the inspector will not accept as evidence anything which would not be acceptable in the ordinary courts of law. There is a good case for that.  I know of no court which follows the same procedure as ministerial inquiries in the recent past.  I am not going to argue the merits of the position in this case, but I say that time and again evidence has been admitted by an inspector which would not be admitted by a <Col N="1792" /> court of law.  That evidence was admitted to the detriment of officials whose fortunes and future were at stake.  There should be some regard to the rules of evidence in cases affecting the fortunes of public servants.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Coogan in this matter.  I think the Minister made a good speech from his point of view, but I do not think he improved on it.  He said that the inquiry was to ascertain the facts, not to prove charges.  If I understood him aright, he stated that was the diference between an inquiry and a court of law.

      <P>When a case comes before a judge his function is not to prove the charge.  I presume that is the duty of those making the charge.  I do not think there is any better fact-finding institution than the courts of law.  The rules of evidence grew up in order that facts should be ascertained correctly and with as much justice as possible.  Whilst I can see the point which the Minister made, and which Deputy Coogan admitted and agreed with, that a technical man should be given freedom to inquire into technical matters, I think the person who was the subject of their inquiries should be given the protection of the rules of evidence, not in a way to hinder the investigation but in order to protect him.  Personalities might be brought in, or a man's past character might be brought in, greatly to his detriment. Something might be referred to that had nothing to do with the case, but which might colour the mind of the inspector holding the inquiry because he was not a trained legal man any more than the Minister or myself are trained legal men.  The rules of evidence have been designed, not to limit the scope of an inquiry to that of a court of law, but in the interest of those concerned.  Rules of evidence can help both parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for having a trained man sitting beside a technical man is very strong.  A man who appears before such an inquiry should have that protection. Justice demands it.  I do not <Col N="1793" /> say that all inquiries in a local area are unjust to men who appear before them.  I am sure they are not.  But I can see that when working outside, and when completely ignorant of the rules of evidence, something might be admitted which should not be.  There is a good case for the amendment.  The Minister referred to the question of administration, and mentioned doctors and others.  A doctor in charge of a hospital down the country could hardly think any charge more serious, professionally, than that of mal-administration. While it probably would not mean a criminal charge, it might damn him professionally.  In the long run what is proposed should strengthen the hands of the Minister and the Department, and should build up a greater public respect than now exists for the present system of inquiry.  It might, in certain instances, react unjustly on individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal in what Deputy Coogan and Deputy Dockrell have said but I should like them to develop their argument further because it seems to me that to proceed on the basis they suggest would eventually end up in the setting up of a fully established court of law.  Let us take, for instance, that you have, say, an engineer assisted by a legal assessor, holding an inquiry, governed by the rules of evidence.  One of our objects is to prevent extraneous matters from coming out in the inquiry which would colour it in the viewpoint of the person holding the inquiry or of the Minister or might damage witnesses on either side in the locality.  That means that there must be some guidance of the evidence to be given by the individual.  Everyone is aware that if a person who is before an inquiry of any kind, or before a court, is asked merely to make a statement, some purely extraneous matter comes out that has no relation at all to the subject under discussion.  In the ordinary formal court of law he is guided by questions by the prosecution or defence and the judge is there to see that the rules of evidence are complied with and that he keeps within prescribed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have an inquiry such as is envisaged <Col N="1794" /> by Deputy Coogan, it seems to me that there must be some similar guidance for the persons appearing before the inquiry and that that guidance must come either from the legal assessor who then, by the nature of the inquiry, very obviously will find himself being committed to one side or the other regarding the issues being inquired into or, alternatively, the legal assessor and the person acting as inspector holding the inquiry remain aloof and the witness is taken through his evidence by another legal person, if you like, acting for the prosecution, and assisted on his part by someone appearing for the defence. I cannot see how Deputy Coogan will succeed in getting what he is anxious for without having to go the whole way and having it a formal court of law.  It seems to me that if that is the position we are to end up in, while it may be an improvement to some extent, it also has objections because we are then facing the question of inquiries where ordinary working men, clerical officers, and so on, with no great financial resources, may find, as you will find in a court of law, that his ability, not to defend himself against actual charges, but to maintain his position in the inquiry, may depend on his ability to provide expert legal assistance.</P>
    <P>It seems to me much better, even if there are difficulties in the present system, that it should be more free and not confined by limitations. While I agree, in so far as Deputy Coogan suggests that there should be technical advice from an assessor in an inquiry where the inspector should have legal qualifications, and legal advice from an assessor where the person holding the inquiry requires to have technical qualifications, in order to have the two sides represented, it does seem to me that we should still maintain the inquiry on as free and unrestricted a basis as possible, and certainly avoid the possibility of its developing into the more rigid form, with all its consequences, of a court of law.</P>

      <P>Counsel will appear in any inquiry of any importance, and the parties have the right to be represented there and to be heard through counsel.  That is the existing practice.  I am not suggesting that we should set up a system of local government courts.  I am only asking that in their deliberations the inspectors holding these inquiries would be guided by the rules of evidence and that in admitting evidence and in dealing with witnesses they would have regard to the rules of evidence.  But, I would remind Deputy Larkin that the practice prevailing in the Department of Industry and Commerce in matters affecting wages and the conditions of labour is, roughly speaking, what I should like to see brought about in local government. There you have a legal chairman of these councils set up by the Minister and he has the assistance of assessors, and the various parties come before them.  There is at least this safeguard in that system that you have a man who has legal training and who can decide on matters of evidence in an expert fashion.  My whole concern in this is that in many of these inquiries the whole livelihood of an individual or a series of individuals may be at stake.  The punishment meted out by the Minister as a result of an inquiry of this nature is so drastic that I think there should be some safeguards for the particular individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but you have instituted a managerial system. That managerial system has introduced an entirely new system of supervision over local authorities.  We have the <Col N="1796" /> Minister's inspectors making periodic visits through the country to the various local authorities, being in touch with the members of the local authorities and with the officials of the local authorities.  You have, in theory, a system of annual audit.  If all these things were being conducted efficiently, then the number of loopholes for particular individuals to escape through would be very, very few indeed.  I think that there is a reasonable case for considering merely the viewpoint that I have, that where individual officers' livelihoods or future are at stake, in these cases the inquiry should, as far as possible, be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence. I am not pressing the matter further than that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 119 and 120 hang together.  Section 60, as it is framed, says that the Minister, if he so thinks fit, may order that the manager for the local authority may appear separately at the inquiry.  I raised this point on Second Reading.  I think that, as a matter of course, the interests of the local authority, that is, the elected members of the local authority, and <Col N="1797" /> the manager are certainly not identical and in many cases may be so diverse that, as a matter of course, the manager should have the right to be represented separately at a public inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would leave it to the discreation of the manager as to whether he would appear separately or not at the inquiry. If there is to be a discretion in this matter, I think the discretion ought to rest in the hands of the Minister, because that is really the purpose of the section, although it has been phrased in this way to ensure that the local authority will be separately represented, if they wish to be.  Prior to this, there was some doubt, if it were necessary for a local authority to be represented by counsel at an inquiry, as to whose function it was to instruct the legal representatives. Arising out of that, at least at one inquiry where I thought that the council should be represented separately, the manager was able, in his interpretation of the law, to instruct counsel to appear ostensibly on behalf of the local authority who were the complainants in the matter, but, in effect, to act on behalf of the servants of that local authority.  It has not happened that it would be necessary for a local authority to be represented independently of the manager, but where it is felt that the members of a local authority should have independent legal advice or be independently represented before the inquiry, then we propose to take that power, and the only way we can do it is by requiring the manager to be separately represented.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), page 24, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I am somewhat amazed, after listening to the last contribution of the Minister, because it seems to me that I am protecting the local authority against something which does not exist, and that I have completely misread the section.  As I see the section at the moment, if the Minister <Col N="1798" /> so decides, he may order that the manager or the local authority may appear separately at the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The point I was concerned with was, that the order being so made by the Minister, the manager is entitled to be represented by counsel or solicitor, and that the counsel or solicitor appearing at the inquiry shall be paid by the local authority.  It seems to me to be an invidious position in cases where the reasons for an inquiry being held are due to a conflict between the manager and the local authority, possibly arising out of a question of authority or abuse of authority by the manager, the Minister having ordered the manager to appear separately, that the local authority would then have to pay for the legal representation and separate appearance of the manager, acting on the Minister's orders, although the whole crux of the situation into which the investigation is held arose out of the actions of the manager himself.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister says that the purpose of the section is to permit the local authority to be represented separately. If that is so, it does seem to me, if the Minister in a particular case is of opinion that for certain reasons it is important for the manager to be separately represented, that some provision should be made whereby the expenses of the legal representation of the manager should not be thrown on the local authority.  If we are dealing with the case of the Minister being afforded power to exercise over-all authority with regard to a local authority, he should be prepared to take the additional step of meeting the costs that arise from the necessity that he has found to make this particular order, rather than to impose the costs on the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we will have to have regard to the situation which might arise where, a <i>prima facie</i> case being submitted to him, the Minister determines that the manager should be separately represented at the inquiry and the evidence at the inquiry exonerates the manager.  In that case we could not surely mulct the manager in costs.  That is really the position, that where the manager is <Col N="1799" /> required to be represented separately and his general conduct has been justified at the inquiry, he should not have to bear the expense which is inflicted upon him by the order of the Minister.</P>

      <P>It conceivably might happen, but certainly so far I have not ordered an inquiry in which the conduct of a local authority <i>vis-á-vis</i> the manager has been the issue.  In the only other two cases of which I have a recollection it was the conduct of the manager which really arose and not the conduct of the local authority.  In the case of the Limerick gas works, the corporation asked for that inquiry.  I suggested that perhaps the Limerick Corporation might consider being separately represented, because I thought there was a case to be investigated, but they determined that they would not be.  They were represented by the manager.  If I had the power in this section, I would have had a great deal of hesitation in allowing the manager his full costs.  He did get his full costs, even though the result of the inquiry reflected upon him.  There may be a case in which the demand for an inquiry is shown by the evidence to be fully justified, and there were perhaps mitigating circumstances.  In that event, I think it would be only just that the extent <Col N="1800" /> to which the circumstances mitigated the conduct which gave rise to the demand for the inquiry should be taken into account in assessing what proportion of the costs the manager or any other officer concerned might be called upon to pay.  That is the purpose of this section.</P>

If it is possible to state it in another way, I shall state it in another way which shall leave no room for ambiguity.  On the other hand, I must say&mdash;and the Minister must be the final judge in this matter&mdash;that if having examined the evidence, I think that, while the manager has been culpable, there are mitigating circumstances and that it would impose too onerous a burden on him if he had to meet the full amount of his legal expenses &mdash; these mitigating circumstances might arise because the local authority took up an unreasonable attitude or because perhaps there was some lapse on the part of the Minister or his Department or they might arise because of a certain kind of local pressure &mdash; circumstances like these would seem in justice to demand that <Col N="1802" /> the manager should not be mulcted in his full costs, and I think the Minister must have power to waive some part of his costs and ask the local authorities to bear them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 122:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) page 24, line 4, before the word &ldquo;cost&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment has been pretty well adumbrated in the discussion on previous amendments.  The amendment aims at inserting the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; before the word cost because the only power, as has already been mentioned, left to the Minister is to limit the cost.  Prior to the Minister's intervention, however, it might be possible for the manager to engage any counsel he likes.  &ldquo;Counsel&rdquo; in that context may be singular or plural and he may have a whole array of counsel to whom high fees will have to be paid.</P>
      <P>We had a recent experience in my city of an inquiry of this kind and we had to pay the cost of it.  In that instance the inquiry was asked for by the corporation.  The corporation did not want to shirk their liability but we had two counsel and a solicitor on one side and a senior counsel and a solicitor on the other side.  There is nothing to prevent a manager under this section from having a full bench of counsel and the Minister would not come into the picture until after counsel had been engaged.  Under the section the manager might hold that he was entitled to engage counsel <i>ad lib.</i> and even if he did not get his full costs from the local authority, part of his costs might reach a very substantial figure.  The historic inquiry in Limerick cost approximately £5,000 as between the two sides and we have naturally to be cautious as to the liability of the local authority in future when such inquiries are held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> I hope we shall not have an inquiry lasting 35 or 37 days on the next occasion, but history has a knack of repeating itself and I think the Minister should take precautions now.  Personally I am not objecting that, in the circumstances in Limerick, we have to pay reasonable expenses to the manager but other circumstances may arise where a manager would not be entitled to any expenses.  In the Limerick case the manager was compelled willy nilly to engage counsel by the action of the corporation in asking for an inquiry but I think there should be a stronger form of words in the section so as to restrict the liberty of action of any manager in bringing in a big array of counsel and make the local authority pay for them.  I think the Minister should agree to add the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; so as to ensure that no abuse of this kind will take place.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 17, after the word &ldquo;where&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;after the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is perfectly clear.  I think it is only fair to insert the words which I suggest so as to prevent any attempt to extend this contribution to cases already decided in the last few years.  The effect of this section should not, I submit, be retrospective because otherwise it might lead to considerable anomalies.  I do not know if there are any outstanding cases of the character I have in mind but there may be, and I do not think it would lead to very good legislation to have an omnibus clause of this kind to bring all previous inquiries under the section.</P>

      <P>I have given the whole case.  If an officer of the local authority finds it advisable to be represented by a solicitor or barrister, or if an ordinary private citizen affected by the inquiry finds it necessary to appear, he is not entitled to his costs, even though he may be exonerated as a result of the inquiry, and the auditor is not bound to pass as legally paid any sums which may be paid in those cases.  I mentioned the case of one inquiry which was held and, in order to put it beyond yea or nay, this section <Col N="1805" /> is brought in and we have to make it retrospective, so as to cover such a case.  Otherwise, there might be a surcharge on the members of the council.</P>

I do not want to be one of the persons going blindly to pass a section without knowing what it is put there to cover. All I asked the Minister for, as nicely as I could, was a little bit of information. I have no objection to the matter of the information which the Minister now gave me.

      <P>The Minister himself was represented at that inquiry, and I am perfectly certain the auditor will not query that portion.  There is one other portion, the one of the successful litigant, and we were told we might not pay if we liked; but, having some sense of justice, since the man who lost the case had to have his costs borne, the corporation in its wisdom thought that the man who won the case ought not to be mulcted in costs.  I hope the Minister has sufficient moral reason to agree with that.  If there is any other section of the expenses he has in mind, <Col N="1806" /> I am anxious, like Deputy Morrissey, to know if the Limerick inquiry is the only one being covered by this retrospective clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I am concerned with this most recent and most serious one.  We want to have our auditors on sure ground and there is no legal authority.  The Deputy has told the House that the city manager, in the case of Limerick, had his expenses paid, even though as a result of the inquiry he retired from the corporation service.  The gas manager, who, I think the Deputy will agree, has justified himself since he got control of the gas works, was himself liable for his own costs.  The Limerick Corporation, as a matter of grace, paid his costs, but they had no legal authority to do so, and our auditors have no legal authority to pass them. They may pass them, but the position is uncertain, as there is no express legal sanction for the payment of the costs.  We want to correct that, and I think it is reasonable that we should be permitted to correct it and, for that reason, this section will have to have retrospective effect.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 18, to delete the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; and after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in line 21 to insert the words &ldquo;on the application of the local authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the old point, trying to reserve some little right for the local authority. We think the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; should be inserted there and &ldquo;with the sanction and consent of the Minister&rdquo;. That ought to give the Minister all the control he needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy Keyes does not put this forward seriously? Take the position in which the Minister stands in relation to the ordinary citizen.  His primary duty in administering his Department is to the ordinary citizen.  He is responsible to the Dáil, and the Dáil, I am sure, is anxious that justice should be done to <Col N="1807" /> any citizen who appeals to the Minister. Where a citizen makes a complaint, whether against a local authority or an officer of a local authority, which the Minister thinks requires investigation, the Minister should have power to set that investigation on foot. What is proposed by this amendment is that, if a person moves the Minister to hold a sworn inquiry&mdash;and sworn inquiries are not granted lightly&mdash;and if he produces to the Minister evidence which, in the opinion of the Minister, demands that such an inquiry should be held, then if that person is summoned, as he will be summoned, by the inspector to attend, and if he chooses, as other people concerned may choose, to be represented, whether by technical advisers or by counsel, and if, as a result of the inquiry, the Minister were to find that the person who complained to him had been perfectly justified in the complaint and that there was maladministration in the local services, that while perhaps even the manager or even the officer concerned might get his costs, when every witness appearing would probably get his costs or some portion of them, the man who exposed the whole thing is going to be left to bear the whole expense of his bringing this matter to the Department in the first case and exposing it to the public and thus enabling the Minister to take steps to ensure that the abuse complained of would be removed.  I do not think that is reasonable and I think that whatever purpose Deputy Keyes and Deputy Murphy may have in mind in putting down this amendment, on consideration they will see that no responsible Minister could accept a proposal of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts of the matter are these. The Minister for Local Government has to depend upon the public to bring to his attention any failure or lack of zeal or duty on the part of local officers.  So far as I am concerned, I may say that I welcome representations, well founded representations, made by the public in relation to the local services.  I do not think they should come to me.  I think, in the first instance, these representations should be made to the members of the <Col N="1808" /> local authorities.  I think it is one of the most important functions of members of elected bodies to see that the local services are properly administered. But when a matter is brought to the attention of the local authority and the local authority, for one reason or another, fails to take action, either by challenging the county manager about the efficiency of the services for which he is responsible to them, or by bringing the matter to my notice, then I think it ought to be open to any citizen to bring the matter to my notice and to try, if he can, to have the matter remedied or redressed.</P>

We want to make it easy for the general public to draw our attention to these things.  We do not want them to come to us in the first instance.  We think they ought to go to the local representatives and the local representatives should see that these abuses do not go unheeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> If the local representatives are not able to have these abuses remedied, I think they ought to come to the Minister, but the ordinary citizen must have the same right of approach to the Minister and, if the Minister takes action on the ordinary citizen's complaint, then I think that the ordinary citizen ought to be indemnified in regard to his costs and that is why I will resist this amendment very strenuously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in a spate of words, has completely concealed the principle that is involved here.  In the course of his statement he clearly indicated his complete lack of confidence in the ability and integrity of local authorities to carry out their duties.  It would now appear that the Minister feels he has to depend on outside citizens, anonymously or otherwise, to get reports as to the inefficiency of public bodies.  In the case he cited he had no ground for any such complaint.  The Limerick Corporation initiated the demand for the inquiry and paid the costs of it. That is one case in point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to quote cases where local authorities failed to face their responsibilities.  His whole speech was a series of innuendoes against local authorities.  Underlying his statement was the attitude that he could not trust the local authorities throughout the country to do their work properly and he has to depend now on the outside citizen.  The most recent case that the Minister quoted was one where the public authority <Col N="1810" /> did face up to its responsibility, initiated the demand for an inquiry and paid for it.  The point now is whether or not the Minister will have confidence in any local authority.</P>
    <P>As to who should be paid compensation, there is no desire to sacrifice any man who may be pulled into an inquiry and who has to give evidence of a valuable character.  In a later amendment I am using the words &ldquo;involuntarily concerned&rdquo;.  There are cases, as we all know, of people who bring forward vexatious and frivolous complaints.  There are cases of an individual using his position as a member of a council to initiate inquiries leading to a public investigation of certain matters for which later it may be found there is no foundation.  I think that such a person ought not to be compensated from the public purse. Anyone who is essential as a witness in an inquiry should be paid his expenses, but there are other types who should not be compensated.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are elected by the people and there ought to be confidence reposed in them.  The members of local authorities are quite capable of carrying out their duties and why should the Minister insist on wiping out every vestige of responsibility that these local authorities have had for so many years?  The Minister's words are indicative of his whole attitude towards local authorities&mdash;a complete lack of confidence in them.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 20, to delete the words &ldquo;any person&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;a person involuntarily concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I dealt with this matter already on a previous amendment.  I do not think it is fair or proper that persons who may initiate proceedings should get the same treatment as would be accorded to essential witnesses who might be called.  I think it is a reasonable precaution to insert the words &ldquo;a person involuntarily concerned&rdquo; in order to prevent the possible abuse that I envisage taking place.  I know of cases where it did take place and where the council was involved in considerable costs.  The initiating gentleman got his portion of the costs from the public purse.

      <P>The Deputy has covered the ground in his speech on the amendment which has just been defeated, that was the amendment which proposed to deprive any person who was voluntarily concerned in the holding of an inquiry of the right to recover expenses.  The Deputy now is carrying that matter further because he is putting the local authority in the position to refuse to pay the expenses of a person who has been involuntarily concerned in the holding of a local inquiry.  Take the position that might arise in connection with this matter. Say a poor woman is in labour, and her husband applies to have her admitted to a county hospital and cannot have her admitted there; she dies and the baby dies; the husband writes to the Minister and produces such evidence to satisfy the Minister that an inquiry should be held, and an inquiry is held, and the husband&mdash;as I have known cases&mdash;is represented at that inquiry and before the inspector by counsel.  This unfortunate man has been voluntarily concerned with the <Col N="1813" /> inquiry and I would have power, if this section passes, to indemnify him against the expenses which he has incurred in having the complaint investigated and in having an incident proved, an incident as a consequence of which he had lost his wife and his child.  In these circumstances, if the amendment which has been defeated had been carried&mdash;I hope all those who voted for the amendment will take this home with them&mdash;I could not have paid the expenses of that unfortunate man.  Deputy Keyes, his original preposterous proposal having been defeated, wants to carry this vendetta of his further by leaving it within the power of the local authority to refuse to pay these expenses.  I would have thought that a Deputy purporting to represent the workers and the poor of this country would be concerned to facilitate them in having their grievances investigated and ensuring that where, as a result of a complaint to them, some abuse in the local administration was exposed and, I hope, remedied, that they would not be at any loss.</P>
      <P>I submit that the Deputy has not considered this matter.  I do not know what is the purpose behind these amendments.  I find it very difficult to understand.  I know that the Deputy and members of his Party, just like myself, do not want to make things difficult for anybody but I must say that I cannot conceive what has been behind these amendments and I do not know why they are being pressed.

      <P>I can only assure the Minister that whatever inspires the amendment, it is not the vendetta referred to by the Minister.  There is no question of a vendetta in the minds of the movers of these amendments against the poor or any other section of the community.  The type of case the Minister quoted is certainly very deserving but there are other cases, that I sought to cover in this amendment, of people who initiate proceedings vexatious and frivolous in many <Col N="1814" /> cases and quite distinct from the type of case the Minister quoted. Possibly there may be a danger but I do suggest, as the Minister did advert to the defeated amendment, that it would have no such effects as the Minister now indicates after the division has been taken.  However, I shall not press this amendment, since the Minister has indicated the grave dangers he sees in it and that it may react in other directions not aimed at by the amendment.  I had in mind cases that I know of that involved public authorities in considerable expense in regard to things of a very minor character far removed from the case of the death of a wife and child, as was quoted by the Minister.  In case it might ever have the effect that he indicated, I shall not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 127:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The proceedings at a local inquiry shall be governed by the rules of evidence and the findings of the inspector upon the evidence tendered before him shall be made public within three months from the date upon which the inquiry terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already covered a good deal of the ground in the arguments concerning previous amendments, and I do not want to go back over what we have said already on this subject beyond again emphasising that I think that some safeguards should be held out to the individual whose fate is at stake in these inquiries.  The only safeguards that I can conceive are those which are given to the ordinary citizen before a court of law, that is, a strict adherence to the rules of evidence.  We have discussed that aspect fully and I do not want to go back on it again.  The second portion of the amendment suggests that the findings of the inspector upon the <Col N="1815" /> evidence tendered before him should be made public within three months from the date upon which the inquiry terminated.  In the debate last night we adverted to certain aspects of this matter of publication, and I put forward the argument that, whether or not the Minister agreed with the findings of the inspector, the findings should be made public, and in the case where the Minister disagreed with the inspector the Minister would be free to make a public statement as to the grounds upon which he disagreed.  The Minister's answer, I fancy, will be that this is entirely an internal matter of administration and that the inspector is merely investigating the facts so as to enable him to come to a decision.  I want to emphasise as strongly as I can that whilst there may be some grounds for admitting the soundness of that argument, there is abroad the suspicion that in investigations of this kind the Minister may select an individual, a subordinate of his own, whose findings are likely to coincide with the Minister's views upon a particular matter and, if for no other reason than that, and to disabuse any public suspicion that might arise, the findings should, to my mind, be made public.  The decision which the Minister has to give on a matter of this kind very often is in the nature of a quasi-judicial decision.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is essential that the grounds upon which he gave his decision should be made as public as possible.  It is also essential that the evidence upon which he reached his decision should be made public.  I would go so far as to say that the findings of the inspector should also be made public.  The inspector himself in a case of this kind must be open to suspicion, criticism, or to any animadversions of various kinds.  In fairness to the inspector himself it is only right that the findings should be made public.  If, in the course of his findings the inspector has occasion to comment adversely upon particular individuals, then I think there should be some safeguard by which that inspector would be indemnified against any possible action that might follow as a result of these animadversions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> The Minister to-night has admitted that these inquiries are in the nature of fishing inquiries.  He is quite frank in admitting that.  But, as I argued last night, I am only concerned with endeavouring to secure that the investigation will be conducted in accordance with accepted principles of law.  It is possible in a local inquiry to throw the net so wide that it is almost impossible for any individual to escape the Ministerial fishing.  I think that we have got to this stage, that there is so much power vested in the Minister and his subordinates that there should be some safeguard for the average official and the average citizen.  Owing to the complexity, as a result of modern life, of present-day legislation which is largely of a social and economic character, we are rapidly coming to the state here where we will have to set up an administrative law.  If we cannot get redress through the ordinary courts and if the present policy of concluding the citizen as against the State continues, willy nilly a system will have to evolve itself whereby in administrative matters some system of administrative courts will have to be set up.  The present drift of legislation is such that we will be driven into this position. The citizen, in his relation to officialdom, in many cases now has no rights. The only right he is given in the various Acts coming before this House since I came here is the right to appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In 99 out of 100 cases, the right of appeal to the Minister is a right of appeal to some anonymous official in the Custom House or some other Government Department.  The decision is reached in the privacy and secrecy of the individual official's office. The aggrieved citizen or the aggrieved official, as the case may be, does not know upon what grounds the final decision has been reached.  The whole thing is carried out in the secrecy of the Minister's Department.  He is told the result.  He has no opportunity of knowing what evidence may be filed against him in the archives of the Department.  He certainly has no opportunity of cross-examining the individual official who is responsible for coming to the decision.  In other <Col N="1817" /> words, the final proceedings leading up to the Ministerial decision are conducted behind his back.  To that extent, he is completely in the dark.</P>
    <P>Now that position obtained in France up to Napoleon's time and led to such a crisis that Napoleon introduced the <i>conscil d'etat</i> to relieve the citizen as against officialdom.  In later times you have developing out from that a system of administrative law and an administrative code.  To-day in France you have this position: An aggrieved official or an aggrieved citizen in relation to officialdom can go to an official court and have his case threshed out openly.  You have, in addition to that, the Court of Conflict, which resolves the rights and interests of the ordinary courts as against the administrative courts.  I mention this matter because I can see that we will be driven eventually into the position that some system of this kind must evolve itself here unless we can call a halt to the present Ministerial policy of circumventing the courts and concluding the citizen as against the Minister by the customary enactment telling you that the Minister's decision shall be final and conclusive and that there shall be no appeals therefrom.</P>
    <P>In the matter of local inquiries we are in this position, that the inquiry is conducted in public and the inspector makes his report.  In addition to his report, a typescript of the evidence is given to the Minister and, on the report and evidence, the Minister reaches his decision.  But the finding of the inspector is not published.  As I said, that leads to a certain amount of public uneasiness and suspicion, because the inquiry is conducted by a subordinate of the Minister and for that very reason suspicion inevitably grows up that the subordinate will endeavour if at all possible, unless he is a very strong-minded individual, to ascertain what the man above is thinking and what he wants and he will try to meet his wishes and wants.  The case where a civil servant will be of such an independent mind that he will openly oppose the Minister, in the present tide of our affairs here, is I think a very rare one.  The examples which have taken place in recent years are such as <Col N="1818" /> to be a very forcible reminder to any inspector conducting an investigation of this kind that it is to his interest to be careful and not to offend the powers-that-be, and, if at all possible, to meet their wishes.  That is an aspect of these inquiries which is the real weakness.  It is for these reasons that I want to hedge these inquiries round with some form of legal protection for the individual officer or official or citizen who may find himself paraded before such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, the penalties ultimately inflicted upon the individual may be so great that even the highest court in the land would have considerable reluctance in inflicting such punishment for the irregularities, omissions or commissions of that particular individual.  After all, when this is all boiled down to the case of an official who has been incompetent or irregular in the discharge of his duties, it means that his livelihood is at stake and the penalty of loss of livelihood is one which no court in the land inflicts even for the most grave offences.  From that consideration alone, I am moving this amendment in the hope that the Minister may find it possible even now to change his mind. and that he may give some degree of legal protection to the parties who may be affected in future by such inquiries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought that the Deputy, like the House and myself, would have been weary of this matter.  It is clear, I think, from the terms of the amendment that the Deputy has misconceived &mdash;as I endeavoured to point out in relation to a former amendment&mdash;the nature and the character of an inquiry held under the Local Government Acts or under the Public Health Acts.  These inquiries, let me repeat, are not judicial proceedings.  The person appointed is a layman and not a lawyer. I mentioned very substantial grounds why in many cases it was better that he should not be a lawyer but that he should be a person who had other special qualifications.  Not only is the inspector not a lawyer, but he is no more than the agent or the instrument of the Minister appointed to ascertain facts.  He is not a person superior to <Col N="1819" /> the Minister.  He is one of the Minister's officers whom the Minister designates to investigate a certain matter on behalf of the Minister.  Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as inspector's findings from an inquiry. We should have to frame a new definition of that phrase if we were to think for a moment of accepting this amendment. There are findings by the Minister, who is the constitutional head of his Department and who is responsible to this House.  Apparently, the wheel of democracy has now turned full circle so that those who were proclaiming the Minister to be a dictator are now anxious that the Minister should become the agent or the instrument of his officers.  How could any responsible Minister run his Department in these circumstances if he, who is responsible to the general public and to the Dáil for the administration of his Department, should be bound by the findings of one of his own officers? Are we not reducing the position to an absurdity, if we bind one of a Minister's officers to publish the memorandum or advice which he feels called upon to give to his Minister as a result of what he has ascertained, and we bind the Minister to accept that advice?</P>

      <P>I thought I made it very clear last evening, though I did not advert to it this evening, that I did not intend that at all.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I have been more logical than the Deputy, because naturally if any memorandum or minute which an officer addressed to his Minister is to be published, then the Minister is going to be put in the situation that he has to justify his conduct as against the advice of his officers.  What sort of diarchy would <Col N="1820" /> we have in this country in such circumstances? Suppose the head of my Department gives me advice, as he frequently does, an advice which I most frequently take but which sometimes I reject, because my function as Minister is to come to an independent judgment on the best advice available to me.  If the judgment of my officers, in my view, is sound, I naturally accept it but sometimes I have the hardihood to erect my judgment over theirs and to give my decision according to whatever wisdom or discretion I have.  If the principle of this amendment were once admitted, every minute that was submitted to me might be called for in this House and we should have the Opposition&mdash;because that is the whole aim which they desire to attain by an amendment of this sort&mdash;justifying the action or the advice of the Minister's officer and condemning the action of the Minister for rejecting the advice of his officer.  As I say, we should have a sort of diarchy in this country in which, on the one hand, we would have the Minister responsible to the Dáil supported, I presume, by a majority in the House and, on the other hand, we should have another section in the Dáil setting up the judgment and the wisdom of a civil servant as against that of the Minister. That would tend to create a state of utter confusion in the administration of public affairs which I think could not be tolerated.  An attempt is being made, principally by lawyers, to confuse the public mind in relation to this matter, by trying to suggest that an inquiry is a judicial procedure and that therefore it is necessary that it be conducted according to the rules of evidence and that there should be a lawyer appointed to hold the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the question of law very seldom arises at these inquiries.  Questions of fact continuously do; but the extraordinary thing about the settled legal procedure of this country is that in regard to grave matters, when individuals are arraigned on account of their conduct, the determination of the facts of that conduct is not rested on a judge or on a lawyer, but on laymen. These laymen do what the Minister does&mdash;they consider the evidence. They may, and, I am sure, do, take <Col N="1821" /> account of the speeches which have been made on one side or the other and of the charge which has been delivered to them by the judge, but they meet in private, they consider the matter in private, they discuss it <i>in camera.</i>  The subject matter of the discussions and the views which they have expressed on one side or the other are held to be strictly confidential. That is the ordinary legal process when the conduct of individuals is arraigned in court.  How does that differ in any essential particular from the present practice in relation to inquiries? The Minister gets the full transcript of the evidence, it is considered by his officers and their views on various aspects of it are expressed to him.  All the pertinent points in that evidence are brought out, just as in an ordinary court of law such points are brought out orally before the jury.  The Minister studies the evidence in the light of memoranda which he may have, discusses it with his officers, and then comes to his decision upon it.  Is not that precisely what happens in the courts, where the conduct of individuals is being adjudicated upon?  You have the same process, except that in the courts the business is done by word of mouth.  In the Department and in the Minister's office, it is conducted on the basis of the written word.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Minister is incompetent to determine these matters, since he has not seen the witnesses for himself.  Well, the duty of the inspector is to see that every witness is examined thoroughly, that all the facts are brought out.  Whether this might be in accordance with the rules of evidence or not does not matter, because the inspector is not sent there as a judge to determine questions of law.</P>
    <P>He is sent there to find out everything that bears upon the inquiry, whether it is in favour of the individual or not.  Where questions of administration are concerned&mdash;and these are the only things concerned in such inquiries&mdash;what matters is the public interest.  The public interest surely demands that, if a person has been guilty of any neglect or dereliction of <Col N="1822" /> duty, he will not be able to cover himself up by a technicality.  Therefore, the question of how a witness has comported himself before the inspector is not of primary importance.  In so far as it may be important at all, as where a witness refuses to answer, the inspector, if he likes, can comment on that to the Minister and the Minister naturally will take any observation of the inspector into account and will give such weight to it as he, in his judgment, feels it ought to carry.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what every juryman does.  Read any address to the jury in any important matter.  The judge will put the aspects of the evidence before the jury.  Counsel on both sides will do the same&mdash;not only will they put the facts, but will try to put the best complexion they can on the facts, if they happen to be for the defence, and will try, without straining the facts, to bring their full significance home, if they happen to be for the prosecution.  But it is the jury which decides&mdash;the laymen and not the judge on the bench who has conducted the investigation or inquiry.  Similarly, it is not the inspector sent down to conduct the investigation or inquiry who makes the findings&mdash;it is the Minister, who, in the same way as a jury, has to bear public responsibility for the verdict.  The inspector cannot be called to account here in the Dáil if his findings went against the weight of evidence.  Let me remind the House that that evidence is published <i>in extenso</i> in the local papers, where the inquiry is held outside the city and, in the case of one matter which was subject to great discussion, has been published <i>in extenso</i> here.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested also that there is something unprecedented in the Minister coming to decisions based on the transcript of the evidence, advised and assisted as he is by the observations of his officers upon the transcript.</P>
    <P>What happens in the Court of Criminal Appeal?  What happens in any court of appeal?  If there is a rehearing, is not the rehearing based, and has it not been based, on the transcript? I understand that is not exactly how the matter stands now, but that is how it stands, at any rate, <Col N="1823" /> in relation to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Witnesses are not heard there by the judges.  There only arguments are heard <i>pro</i> and <i>con.</i>  In the same way arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> are adduced before the inspector and the full significance of those arguments is sifted afterwards, as I have said, in the Department.  Therefore, let me repeat that there is no justification for the clamour that has gone up to try to tie the hands of the person who is responsible to the Government, in the first instance, because of the doctrine of collective responsibility, to the Dáil next, and then to the people for ensuring that the local services will be properly administered and will be carried on in the best interests of the people.</P>
    <P>We have undoubtedly had a great deal of confusion created in the public mind.</P>

      <P>How could the public business be carried on if effect were to be given to the proposal before the House?  There are inquiries held very frequently, much oftener than Deputies or the general public are aware.  I mentioned the type of case which most frequently occurs, where there is a complaint against some local officer, very often a medical man, or one charged with responsibility for the public services in a particular area. How could the Minister conduct the affairs of his Department if, in every inquiry of this sort&mdash;to ascertain whether, when a doctor got what is popularly known as a red ticket, he refused to take it and proceeded to charge a fee to a person entitled to have his services free of charge, or to deal with the sort of allegation that you sometimes hear, where it is alleged that people have been improperly treated in hospitals, in mental hospitals and other institutions&mdash;we were going to have a sort of State trial, such as is contemplated in this amendment, with the Minister appearing as a complainant and the public officer as the defendant and, I suppose, a bench of three judges sitting solemnly to determine whether Tom So-and-so misappropriated money given him to distribute <Col N="1824" /> as public assistance?  Sure, the thing would become farcical.</P>
      <P>We could not possibly carry on the administration if every fad that has been conceived by a legal hair-splitter were to be made part of our administrative machinery.  For that reason I hope the House will reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that a great deal of confusion had been created in the public mind.  There is, apparently, a great deal of confusion in the Minister's mind.  He certainly tried, in this amendment, to confuse the mind of the House.  What is the amendment before us?  It is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The proceedings at a local inquiry shall be governed by the rules of evidence and the findings of the inspector upon the evidence tendered before him shall be made public within three months from the date upon which the inquiry terminated.</P>
      <P>That is what is before the House. Listening to the Minister for the last 20 minutes, no one would think that was the issue before us.  The Minister, while repudiating that an inquiry was or should be a judicial function, in his zeal to prove that it was on all-fours with a court of law, started to give us a lecture on what happens in a court, and the functions of a jury.  He said it is exactly the same&mdash;there is counsel on one side and counsel on the other and it is the jury that ascertains the facts and the jury is <i>in camera.</i>  He repeated that a couple of times and then he started to put his foot in it. He got his toe in and when he realised that the foot was going in, he drew it back.  He talked of counsel for the defence and counsel for the plaintiff, and said the judge then starts to tell the jury and then the Minister, realising where it was leading him, drew back immediately.  That is exactly what we want this amendment for, that we shall get the judge's charge to the jury, to the people who come to the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister directs that an inquiry should be held.  That may be an inquiry affecting an officer or a local authority.  The Minister appoints the <Col N="1825" /> inspector.  He may be a member of the permanent staff of his Department or now it may be any person in this State selected by the Minister as a suitable person, in the Minister's opinion, to hold the inquiry.</P>
    <P>That person holds the inquiry and hears the evidence.  We are now told, for the first time, by the Minister, that he does not present any findings, he does not present even a report on the evidence to the Minister.  That is what the Minister now alleges.  But the inspector makes what the Minister is pleased to call observations on the evidence tendered before him.  There may be a subtle distinction, the Minister's own.  How a person can make observations that are going to be of any use to the Minister in coming to a decision on evidence tendered at an inquiry, which may last either for a day or 40 days, and which may involve taking evidence from one witness or 50 witnesses&mdash;how such observations, unless they are in the form of some sort of a report, or an intelligent presentation of the evidence, or an intelligent presentation of the inspector's views on the evidence, I do not know, but what I do know is that, far from being on a level with a court of law, as the Minister sought to convey now, it is the very opposite.</P>

      <P>In conjunction with Deputy Davin I asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he would state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;whether he has now considered the report submitted to him by the local authority relative to the housing scheme at Clara, Offaly; whether he is prepared to make public the <Col N="1827" /> terms of the report; and whether he proposes to have the scheme examined by an engineering officer of his Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a lengthy reply the Minister did not, I submit, answer the question. In the course of his reply he stated that the all-in cost of the scheme was £62,000 and he went on to say that the cottages were erected five years ago. How can the Minister explain why, after five years, in a scheme which cost £62,000, it is estimated by the county engineer that it will take £13,000 to put them into a condition in which 144 tenants can live in them?  Will the Minister explain to the House how £13,000 was arrived at to put the houses into a habitable condition?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his reply that cottages of a similar type to those in Offaly had been erected in other parts and that no complaints had been received from the tenants.  I wish to point out that the Minister made a statement on that occasion that was misleading to the House.  In the Custom House there are files and volumes of correspondence referring to the defects of a housing scheme that was completed at the same time in Edenderry. The Minister was asked to intervene there as the tenants complained to his Department that there was no right of way.  In another scheme a tenant took legal proceedings against Offaly County Council resulting in a victory for the tenants.  Though the Minister stated he received no complaints from the tenants residing in cottages similar to those in Offaly, I say that he did receive complaints.  I want the Minister to explain why he is not prepared to publish the terms of the report that he received from the county manager.</P>
    <P>I asked him to-day to send a copy of the report of the county manager of Offaly to the county council so that they could discuss it and make recommendations. If there is nothing in the report which the Minister wishes to hide, he will have no hesitation in sending a copy to Offaly County Council for their observations.  Does the Minister not realise that quite recently at a meeting of Offaly County Council the <Col N="1828" /> scheme to which he now gives great credit was referred to as the &ldquo;Clara Tuberculosis Factory&rdquo; where 144 tenants are living under deplorable conditions?  Yet the Minister told us that it was one of the most up-to-date housing schemes.  The tenants there have to bring turf from local bogs into their houses.  Imagine building 144 houses for the working classes in the year 1940 without providing a road which they could use, and where the back doors of some houses face the front doors of others.  The local people in Clara invited the five T.D's. in the constituency to inspect the houses. Deputy O'Higgins, who is also a county medical officer of health, Deputy Davin and I visited them.  I was shocked at the deplorable conditions under which these tenants are expected to live.  Remember that they are people who were mostly living in condemned houses prior to 1939.  They were told to leave and to go into the new houses where they find the conditions impossible.  The Minister knows that there must be something wrong when that is the position of houses after being built five years, and when the ratepayers of Offaly are asked to foot a bill of £13,000 for repairs.  I went into the houses and I found in a great many cases that the fireplaces had fallen out and had to be put back.</P>

      <P>I invite the Minister to go to Clara and to carry out the same inspection which three Deputies carried out but which two Fianna Fáil Deputies for Offaly reneged.  It is deplorable that there should have to be such heavy expenditure on the ratepayers of Offaly on a new housing scheme.  I would be pleased if the Minister would let us know why he is not prepared to publish the report received <Col N="1829" /> from the county council.  Will he state if the engineers from the Department visited the scheme when it was in progress and what they reported? I should be very pleased to know if the full amount has been paid to the contractors, or if any money has been retained until the board of health or the county council are satisfied that the scheme was satisfactorily completed.  I want the Minister to explain to the house if the scheme was completed in accordance with the specifications laid down.  Were the fences made in accordance with the specifications and to the satisfaction of the Department?  If the Minister will not disclose that information will he please give his reasons?</P>

      <P>I merely intervene for a few minutes as I do not want to take up the time of other Deputies or the Minister.  I was not in 144 of these houses.  I visited three of them, and I was given to understand that these three could be taken as a pretty fair sample of the other houses.  From my experience&mdash;and I have had to deal with houses&mdash;my impression is that as far as the building goes there is no fault to find.  The houses were built in pairs according to a plan, with a fireplace and flue in the centre, which meant that the end rooms of all the houses were without any provision whatever for heating.</P>
      <P>I regard that as a fault from the point of view of the comfort of the inhabitants, in health and in sickness &mdash;a fault in the plan and not a fault in the carrying out of the specifications or the plan.  I regard that as a major defect, which from the point of view of health as well as the point of view of the comfort of the inhabitant, should be remedied by additional structural alteration even at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing that I am sure would be contained in any report to the Minister.  A great number of houses was built on a comparatively small area of land.  The density of the population of Clara itself is very, very great.  There is no scavenging arrangements whatsoever.  The amount of ground at the rear of each house is <Col N="1830" /> very, very small and, with all the garbage going out day after day, you reach a point where, with the best housekeeper and the most energetic occupant, you cannot keep burying all the time.  The result is that at the back door of every house there is an objectionable and dangerous heap of excreta and garbage.  That indicates the necessity for some scavenging scheme, if not for the whole town, certainly for the area of this new building.</P>
    <P>The third thing that struck me about it was that the dividing fences that were between the different pairs of houses originally are in very many cases broken down, and in some cases they have ceased to exist.  There were very big defects, probably the result of wear and tear, on the road leading round that particular part.  The occasion I was there was in wet weather and, even well-equipped in the way of strong foot-gear, certainly, I could not go from the town of Clara to any one of those houses without having wet feet to a very considerable degree.</P>
    <P>The points that struck me most forcibly were, the lack of proper arrangements for the heating of the end rooms, the failure to have any scheme for the removal of refuse and garbage, and that kind of thing, the disrepair of fences and the lack of maintenance of the roads.  I think there is a subject matter to be looked into and inquired into.</P>

      <P>Speaking in the House to-night, inside the last hour, on the responsibilities of the Minister for the supervision of the local authorities, the responsibilities of the local authorities and the Minister to the citizens, the Minister himself admitted that it was the duty of any good citizen who had a complaint against a local authority, and having made that complaint had failed to get satisfaction, to report these matters to the Minister, and that the Minister would, having regard to his responsibilities, follow the matter up.  If that is the duty and the right of an ordinary citizen, I suggest it is the duty of a public representative, whether he be a member of a local authority or a member of this House, to bring such matters under the notice <Col N="1831" /> of the Minister in this House, having failed in other ways to get satisfaction. When I endeavoured to discharge my duty in that manner in the House this night week, I was almost refused a hearing, so far as the Minister could refuse me a hearing.  He stated here, Sir, and it is on the official record, that he had no responsibility whatever in connection with matters of this kind. His reply to-day to the question put by Deputy Flanagan clearly proves that he accepts responsibility, and that he has acted on that responsibility.  The concluding portion of the Minister's reply makes it clear that he has already contacted the county manager.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the reply given in the House to-day to the question addressed to him by Deputy Flanagan and myself entirely confirms the alleged <i>ex parte</i> statement which I made in the House this night week. I asserted, and the Minister now admits it, that the communication which I read from the Secretary of the Cottage Tenants' Improvement Association was a fair summary of the situation concerning the 144 tenants in Clara and I merely asked on that occasion that the Minister should send down one of his Departmental inspectors, whether a medical officer or an engineering officer, and find out and report to the Minister whether the situation was as serious as was represented to me and to my colleagues by the tenants themselves.  However, I am very glad that the Minister at least has gone some way to meet us in connection with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply here to-day he also <Col N="1832" /> stated that there were no complaints received from the tenants of cottages of a similar type built in the same county.  I assert here that the Minister will find a file in his own Department containing serious complaints submitted by me in connection with defects in a large number of houses built in the town of Edenderry.  I submitted suggestions from the tenants making certain offers of the payment of certain sums on certain conditions and the Minister authorised the head of a certain Department to write to me and say that he declined absolutely to accept the offer of the tenants.  The tenants engaged a local solicitor and went to the District Court.  They were beaten in the District Court but they brought the case on appeal to the last Circuit Court held in Tullamore.  Judgment was given against the county manager and the county council on a case that the Minister refused to support. Who will pay the cost of that action?  The tenants themselves probably will have to find some of the money.  Look for the file in your Department concerning defects in Edenderry houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister looks for the file in connection with the Edenderry case he will find there is no justification for the statement made in the reply which he has given to Deputy Flanagan to-day.  The Minister says in his reply, in connection with the defective ranges, that the tenants were not unanimous about having the ranges removed.  Would not it be a very difficult thing to have unanimity amongst 144 tenants on any aspect of the complaints made by them and, supposing the Minister received a resolution from the tenants, passed unanimously, telling him that the houses were not worth anything in the shape of rent, would he accept their opinion because it was passed unanimously?  It is a silly thing to suggest that the tenants should be unanimous in connection with <Col N="1833" /> the matters that have been brought under notice.  He says the tenants cannot be provided with special amenities to suit all the individual requirements of the particular tenants.  This is all pure evasion. I put this point to the Minister in all sincerity: If this is a democratically established Parliament and if the members of local authorities still have any power left, surely they have a right to hear the contents of a communication addressed to the Minister by the county manager in connection with a serious complaint of this kind?</P>

      <P>If the Minister seriously tells this House and the citizens of this country that Deputies of Dáil Eireann, elected by the people of Laoighis and Offaly or any other constituency, or county councillors elected to the councils of that particular constituency, the guardians of the ratepayers, the men who strike the rate and collect the rate, have no right to the contents of a report in connection with a matter of this kind, then neither the members of this House nor the members of local authorities have any power left.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the local authority under the Managerial Act are the only people who can strike a rate for local development purposes, housing, the maintenance of roads, or anything else, and the county manager could not carry on local activities were it not that they had the right to exercise that power.  Of course, the Minister would wipe them out if they refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But if they are the people who are still vested with the power to collect these rates from the ratepayers of a particular locality, they are certainly seriously concerned and are at least entitled to the contents of a report of this kind.  If the Minister has not already done so, I suggest that he should, in common decency, allow the members of the Offaly County Council to have at their disposal the contents of this report and should ask for their observations and recommendations in connection with a serious matter of <Col N="1834" /> this kind.  I do not want to deprive the Minister of his rights.  The Minister deprived me of my rights this night week.  I will not copy him, because he gave a bad example.  I will leave him his rights, if he wishes to exercise them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not following a Jack-o'-Lantern like you.  Deputy Davin has very peculiar ideas.  He is now trying to establish in this country a system which I think exists elsewhere, whereby every public document becomes the property of any member of Parliament who cares to ask for it. It is a well-established fact that the files of Government Departments are privileged.  Not even the courts can demand the production of documents in certain circumstances.  I just want to clear that matter up, because that is the sort of ridiculous thing which Deputy Davin tries to put over on the people of this country, and on this House every time he addresses it.  Let me say that what I said on the last occasion on which this matter was raised was quite correct in the context in which it was given.  I have at this moment no responsibility in regard to this matter, and I said that in my reply to-day.  The matter is for the consideration of the Offaly County Council.  No member of the Offaly County Council has addressed me in regard to it.  I have received no complaints from the Offaly County Council in regard to it.  I suppose I receive a lot of communications from Deputy Flanagan, but I think his connection with Offaly is very tenuous, and I am sure will not be very long-lived.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So will you.  Let me repeat that this matter is primarily one for the Offaly County Council.  Of course, I know that some Deputies want to get a little cheap publicity out of it.  It is clear from some of the statements made that either the Offaly County Council as a body, the officers of the Offaly County Council or, as I suspect, having listened to Deputy <Col N="1835" /> Davin's speech and the speech of Deputy Flanagan, the contractor responsible for building these houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite clearly from that remark there is the personal credit and reputation of some person involved in this matter.  As to the condition of these houses, I prefer to take the very moderate and temperate statement of Deputy O'Higgins.  Some of them are, perhaps, not exactly as we would like to see them.  But, if they are in that condition because of some culpable negligence on the part of a local officer, I would have thought that the members of the Offaly County Council would have been concerned to bring that matter to my notice and to demand a sworn inquiry, with, of course, the consequences that might follow therefrom.  But, of course, the position in relation to these houses, and the Deputies know it, is that the houses were built under emergency conditions.  They have cost £430 each. They have not some of the amenities which houses built earlier have, because the materials in some instances were not available and it was necessary to keep the cost of the houses as low as possible so as to avoid putting an undue burden on the ratepayers, on the taxpayers and on the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>These houses were not built in 1939.  That shows at how little pains the Deputy has been to ascertain the facts.  These houses were first occupied in 1942.  They were built during the emergency and, as I have said, to keep the burden on the three parties concerned as moderate as possible and, in particular, in order to keep the rents low, certain economies had to be made.  Now, a proposal has been put up to the tenants of these cottages which should meet them fairly reasonably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the council has indicated that it is prepared to carry <Col N="1836" /> out certain improvements in these cottages provided the tenants are prepared to contribute something.  But, thanks to the misguided advice of Deputy Flanagan, they are taking up the attitude that they are not going to pay anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
