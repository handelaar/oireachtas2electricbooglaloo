      <P>Before to-day's business commences, I wish to refer to an incident that took place in the House this day week during the discussion on the Local Government Bill when I made use of a remark against the Minister on that occasion.  Since then, I have had an opportunity of looking over the published proceedings of the House, and I realise exactly what the remark implies.  With your permission, and with the permission of the House, I offer my apologies to the Minister for any annoyance that the remark may have caused him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, I was dealing with the question that was <Col N="1464" /> raised by Deputy Larkin.  He referred to the very inadequate rates of pay provided for workers engaged in the development of our bogs.  I think that it ought to be the duty of the board that is to be established under this Bill to see that the workers employed on this very important national work&mdash;the production of fuel&mdash;will be given decent rates of wages.  As I pointed out, and as Deputy Larkin pointed out, if the worker is given a decent rate of wages it will give him an additional interest in his work and some encouragement to take good care of the very important machinery that he is in charge of while in the employment of the board. I believe that it is a wise policy, on the part of the Government, to develop our turf resources.  With the full development of native fuel we should see to it that the houses erected in the future are provided with fireplaces that are suitable for the burning of turf. May I mention that houses that were built quite convenient to Clonsast bog, in my constituency, were all fitted with coal ranges, while other houses built in my constituency in the Swan and Wolfhill areas, where we have coal mines, are fitted with turf grates.  That, I suggest, is a position that ought to be considered very carefully by those in charge.  I think it is the duty of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to see, in regard to all future housing schemes carried out on a large scale for which he will have responsibility, that the houses are so fitted that it will be possible for the tenants to burn turf in the grates provided. It would be silly, and not in accordance with commonsense, if the houses that were erected in the centre of bogs in the Midlands were not fitted with fireplaces suitable for the burning of the local fuel product.  It should be the duty of the responsible authority to see that they are suitably fitted. To the amazement of the tenants and all concerned, it has been found impossible to burn native fuel in the ranges of houses provided by the local authorities, with the approval of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the very same thing in areas where coal is being produced on a large scale.  We discovered that, in the neighbourhood of the Wolfhill collieries, <Col N="1465" /> in the County of Laoighis, where ranges should have been installed suited to the burning of coal raised in the local mines, turf grates were provided although there is no turf in the district.  In the City of Dublin, there is a great deal of waste simply because the fire grates were, in the vast majority of cases, designed for the consumption of coal which was then coming in in large quantities.  As the Minister pointed out yesterday, even if coal were coming in, the price would be so high that it would be impossible to procure it.  Owing to the seriousness of the position in England, I believe, as the Government realises, that it will be many years before we are able to get in supplies of coal as they were being obtained before the war.  I wonder if it would be possible under this Bill to give the board which is being appointed power to develop our coal resources in a manner similar to that in which our turf resources are to be developed.</P>

      <P>The coal could be developed on an equally large scale. This Bill has my whole-hearted support. I believe that it is a wise step and that the Government realise the necessity for developing our bogs on a large scale.  In years to come, I believe that a great deal of benefit will be derived as a result of the legislation contained in this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us a good deal of explanation regarding this Bill but I noticed that he <Col N="1466" /> was strangely silent on some points on which Deputies would like to get precise information.  He seemed to suggest that turf was to replace coal completely. As you, A Chinn Comhairle, have pointed out to the previous speaker, this is a turf-development Bill.  At the same time, coal, turf, heavy oil, petrol and timber are all, more or less, related to turf and would compete with turf if they could be got cheaply enough and in sufficient quantities.  Having regard to the contents of the Bill and the Minister's speech, the question at issue would seem to fall under two heads.  We have to consider the position in the emergency period and the position in the post-emergency period.  I have not spoken of it as the war period, because an emergency can last long after a war has ceased.  During the emergency period, when we had no coal, the Minister and the Government very courageously tackled the question of fuel.  Mistakes were made &mdash;bad mistakes&mdash;but nobody can make omelettes without breaking eggs, and dear, wet, poor turf, when there was nothing else available, was very acceptable. The Government are entitled to the credit for producing good, bad and indifferent turf.</P>
      <P>Coming down to the post-emergency period, some time alternative fuels will appear as competitors with turf. The question is, how far we ought to proceed and how far those fuels will compete with turf which is at present our only source of fuel.  In pre-war days, the Minister referred to a figure of 3,000,000 tons of coal as used here and others have spoken of 2,500,000 tons as the consumption in 1938.  The Minister has referred to turf as having half the calorific value of coal.  That is in briquette form and I am afraid that he is taking turf at its highest value.  Some people would say that it takes three tons of turf to equal a ton of coal.  If you take it that 2½ tons of turf are equal to a ton of coal, and if our requirements in 1938 were 2,500,000 tons of coal, it would appear as if the country would require about 6,250,000 tons of turf to be entirely self-supporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have spoken about <Col N="1467" /> the grates, ranges and boilers which were installed for the burning of turf. The Minister has pointed out that those were being installed in certain places.  The last speaker spoke of turf ranges being installed in coal areas and coal ranges in turf areas, and I should like to point out that you cannot change the fuel to suit the type of range you have installed.  In other words, if you opt for a grate which is efficient for coal, or if you opt for one which is efficient for turf, you have to stick to it.  That is why we should welcome further particulars from the Minister as to what we are facing.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be outside the Minister's province to ask the British what amount of coal they will probably have for export to this country over a period of years, leaving out the question of an engagement about taking it.  The Minister seems to think that coal is finished as far as this country is concerned and that we should have to rely on our own resources for turf.  Of course, it is certain that all the turf that can be produced at the present time is all to the good.  What I have said about turf and coal ranges applies also to turf and coal-houses.  There are many places which are equipped to take in a little coal but they cannot take in turf in any quantity.  That being so, it behoves us to make a careful estimate of the turf that will be used by this country.  The Minister is really dealing only with the machine-won turf under this measure, and one wonders why this Bill had to be put through just at this time.  Presumably, the three companies which were producing machine-won turf could have continued and been expanded, if necessary.</P>
    <P>In this Bill there is a provision for erecting a steam plant on the bogs&mdash; at Clonsast and at another place somewhere further south.  One would like to know from the Minister what is the reason for the development of machine-won turf, leaving out of consideration hand-won turf.</P>
    <P>Apparently the steam plant which is to be erected on the bog will not be ready until 1952.  By that time we shall still be in a position in which <Col N="1468" /> it will be necessary to import coal. I should like to know why the Minister wants to erect a steam plant some years before we reach the stage at which the production of turf will be sufficient to supply the whole country.  Surely the Minister's attitude should be: &ldquo;We are short of fuel for this country, we cannot get enough coal but we shall push on with the production of hand-won turf through the county councils and machine-won through these companies that are already working on it.&rdquo; It would appear as if by the time the steam plant is ready we shall not be as self-sufficient in turf.  If, by that time it is found that sufficient coal can be imported surely it would be better to use coal at the Pigeon House to generate the necessary electricity and to leave the production of the bogs to the private consumer and those industries which require it?</P>
    <P>When one comes to examine the figure at which turf can be sold, one is rather pessimistic about the price of machine-won turf.  From the figures supplied it would appear that the cost of turf at Turraun is £1 0s. 8d. per ton.  That is, I think, the cost delivered at the railway station or loaded in a lorry.  While one is on the question of petrol lorries, I might mention that last night the Minister paid a tribute to the Turf Development Board and I think Deputy Morrissey spoke about the credit due to the Electricity Supply Board for maintaining the supply of electricity, but really during the emergency we seemed to be dependent on petrol lorries for carrying turf to such an extent that one shudders to think what would have happened if this country had been left without petrol. Certainly it would appear to the ordinary person as if the petrol lorry and petrol played as big a part in providing this country with turf as any of the other media mentioned by previous speakers.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister thinks that in the future the railway will be capable of carrying all the turf that is produced.  He was silent on that point, but taking turf produced at Turraun and loaded on a railway wagon, I think <Col N="1469" /> the freight to Dublin is 12/- per ton.  I allow 6/- per ton for cartage to the merchant's yard.  The next item is delivery from the merchant's yard to the customer and for that I allow 11/-. I do not know if it is intended to distribute this machine-won turf through coal merchants but I have allowed to them, for the sake of argument, a profit of 7/6.  That tots up to £2 17s. 2d. for a ton of turf.  If you multiply that by 2½ it brings the price of the machine-won turf delivered to a private consumer to £7 2s. 11d.  Now, I do not know what the future of coal is going to be, but I cannot imagine that either coal or, possibly, heavy oil will not be delivered to people at a price very much less than that.  I would like to ask the Minister to let us know when he is replying how he can hope to compete with coal or heavy oil, if and when they return to the market.  Of course, the Minister may say to me that they may never return, and from that point of view he is quite right, although I think it was Deputy Larkin who thought that coal might even become cheaper.  Be that as it may, however, we have to face this heavy expenditure on turf. One wonders why there is this tremendous haste in putting up a plant on the bog, which will not be ready for six years and which, if one takes the figures as they look, will not produce fuel enough if there is a shortage of coal, which would mean taking turf from the private producer.</P>
    <P>That brings one to the question of hand-won turf and why hand-won turf has not been dealt with.  An extraordinary system has been built up, which is, possibly, a result of starting in a hurry, by which the turf is handled, as far as the ordinary individual can see, far too often.  I suggest that we should consider the ideal system, and the cheapest and best way of handling hand-won turf.</P>
    <P>I am not in any way referring now to getting turf out of the bog; I am assuming that the county council engineers are working that to the best advantage; but when the turf gets to the side of the road, I am beginning to wonder whether some of the various <Col N="1470" /> operations that follow could not be cut out.  First of all, there is the bringing of the turf to the side of the road, then bringing it to the railway station, then bringing it up to town, and then bringing it out to the Phoenix Park or to Ringsend, afterwards bringing it to the merchants' yards, and then distributing it to the consumers.  One wonders why some of these operations could not be cut out.  Could not turf be dried in some way by stacking it on the side of the road at the bog, and thus save bringing it up to the Park to be stacked there?  I should like the Minister to tell us what the difficulty is, and why, after six years of emergency conditions, we should not be able to cut out some of the operations connected with the handling of hand-won turf.  A very clever manufacturer once said that every time you touched material you added to its ultimate cost.</P>
    <P>I remember&mdash;I think it was the winter before last&mdash;that there was some difficulty about people out in Lucan getting turf, and what, apparently, none of the people in Lucan could understand was why you could not stop some of the petrol lorries that were rolling through Lucan <i>en route</i> for the Phoenix Park, and fill up the depots there, thus saving in labour and saving in cost.  The Minister has said that he would welcome any suggestions, but it seems to me that there are far too many handlings of the hand-won turf, and that there should be some practical way of stacking it at the side of the road at the bog, keeping it there until it was fit for use, and then bringing it up, either by railway or, possibly, even by petrol lorry, and delivering it straight to the consumer. At any rate, there are far too many handlings on the road at present, and I think that my suggestion is the only way by which you will get increased efficiency so far as the hand-won end of turf production is concerned.</P>
    <P>I shall come now to one last remark. Apparently, in ten years we are going to work up to production of only 1,000,000 tons of machine-won turf. Some people suggested that that would fill only one-eighth of the country's requirements, but according to my calculations <Col N="1471" /> I think it would be about one-sixth.  Now, surely, that will not solve any of our fuel problems, and, accordingly, I would urge the Minister to go slow on a plant which will not be ready for six years and for which it is doubtful if we can get the fuel without taking it from some other section of the community.  In conclusion, I should like the Minister to look into the matter of whether or not he can reduce the number of handlings of hand-won turf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome this turf development plan, still I have to protest on behalf of the people in Mayo, and to ask the Minister why he has not included Mayo in this scheme. I feel that if there is any county that should have been considered, Mayo should have been one of the first, and when I say one of the first, I say it from experience, so far as our own county council was concerned and the active part we took in the production of turf there during the emergency. When the emergency started, we were one of the first counties to be asked to go into turf production.  The reason for that was that we had the turf areas and we had the best of bogs.  Still, in this turf development plan that has been outlined here, Mayo has been overlooked.  I feel that that is not a fair way to treat Mayo in return for the services they gave at a time when it was essential that turf should be provided, and particularly in view of the way they responded there to the appeal.</P>
      <P>So far as the location of Mayo is concerned, if you compare its location with Kerry, Donegal, Galway or Roscommon, I think it would compare very well with those counties as regards main roads, by-roads, bog roads, and everything that would connect the bog areas with means of transport, and I am sure that it would compare very favourably with either Donegal or Kerry so far as freight and handling charges are concerned.  I feel that the Minister should not have overlooked Mayo.  He has given to Kerry, roughly, £125,000 for two development areas, and there is one already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> He has given Longford £104,000; Galway, £93,000; and Roscommon £236,000.  In one direction from Mayo, there are the counties of Kerry and Galway and, in the other, the county of Donegal, Mayo being practically on a line with these three counties.</P>
    <P>In Mayo, there is a huge population living in the bog areas, the majority of whom have to go abroad to make a living.  Some of them, to their credit, responded to the call and went to the counties near the city to produce turf. They had not to go to these areas for what they could earn there, as the money does not come back in full to the poorer people, but if the money had been earned in their own areas, near their own homes, the money would be of greater service and help.  In Mayo, and especially in North Mayo, we have the very best of bogs along the main trunk road, with main county roads leading into the bog areas and with bog roads constructed during the emergency into the bog centres, bogs which, I believe, cannot be beaten in any other county.  The Minister has overlooked Mayo, and I ask him, on behalf of the people of Mayo, to realise that there is still sufficient time to include Mayo in the scheme.  We are entitled to the same benefits as counties Galway, Kerry and Donegal.  We did our duty during the emergency and I feel that we are now entitled to ask that we be compensated by being put on the some footing with regard to finance as these three counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one of the few Bills that go through the House with general approval.  I think it deserves a certain amount of support, because the development of turf is very essential, simply because it seems to be the only type of fuel on which we can fall back when the pinch comes. Our coal supplies are inadequate. Whether they can be improved or not, we do not know, but a survey has been carried out, and it seems they cannot be added to or increased in any way. Our timber supply has been almost entirely cut, and therefore our only source of fuel is turf, of which we seem to have a fair amount, and it is only natural that we should develop the raw material of which we have <Col N="1473" /> most plentiful supplies.  The scheme deserves support also for the reason that an industry like the turf industry is bound to absorb a certain amount of labour and the more labour we absorb, the less emigration there will be.  For these reasons, the scheme is worthy of support.</P>
      <P>Almost £4,000,000 of the people's money is being invested in this scheme, but nobody will find fault with that, because, if we do not venture we cannot win, and we cannot embark on schemes of any sort unless we provide the money to finance them.  As several Deputies have pointed out, turf during the past few years was a very necessary commodity, but the position will eventually be reached, when the world gets back to normal, in which it will be possible to import coal, perhaps much more cheaply.  When outside countries start looking for markets, they will try to dump a certain amount of coal in this country, and the question will then arise as to which the people will prefer. So far as the rural population are concerned, turf is the natural fuel, but will the people in the cities and the towns prefer turf to coal, if coal can be got at a reasonable price?  Deputies seem to think they will.  Being a rural dweller, I do not know, but I do know that the city or town dweller can never have as good a fire with turf as he can have with coal.  Whether turf briquettes will be a better type of fuel than ordinary hand-won turf, time alone will tell, but I hope the dwellers in the cities and towns will be satisfied with this turf development scheme and with the spending of so much money on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several matters closely connected with this scheme.  An effort should be made to leave the bogs which are cut away in a condition in which they will be fit for replanting or reclamation. It may be hard to do that, because, when ten, 15 or 20 feet of the surface is taken away, the land will be inclined to get waterlogged, being then below the level of the rivers in the locality, so that side by side with any turf scheme must go a drainage scheme.  I hope that when everything gets into motion, that aspect will be considered.  If they all move with each <Col N="1474" /> other, there will be entire satisfaction for everybody.</P>
    <P>It seems from the Minister's statement that one of the chief objects of the scheme is not so much the production of turf for domestic purposes as for the operation of electric power stations. That is a very good proposal, and it would be a good thing if all the turf which can be produced by the briquette factory could be used for the development of hydro-electric power in the various localities.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it would mean that there would be no freightage, no carrying out from there and, secondly, it would leave the coal that now has to be used in the Pigeon House and places like that for the development of hydro-electric power, for domestic purposes.  Therefore, I think that is a very good idea and it would help the turf development plan.  It seems the amount that will be over and above, at the present estimation, will not be so great as to arouse any fears in the minds of those who produce hand-won turf that that turf will be left on their hands.</P>
    <P>The only other objection I have to the scheme has been referred to already by some of my colleagues from Mayo. I am surprised we have not been included in this turf development scheme, because we have bogs, especially in North Mayo, between 14 and 20 miles in extent.  There is one such bog running on towards Belmullet and Bangor Erris.  That is a long way from here, I admit, but, nevertheless, why not have a hydro-electric station there as well?  I am disappointed that we have not been included in this scheme and I hope the Minister will be able to grant a certain amount of money, as soon as it is possible to do so, in order that we will be able to partake in the benefits, the employment and everything else, that will accrue from this turf development scheme.</P>
    <P>Labour Deputies mentioned the working conditions and the wages of the workers in these schemes.  Wages in turf development schemes so far have been fairly good.  With a little overtime and piece-work, men have been able to make a reasonably good <Col N="1475" /> wage, much better than the other wage-earners to whom references were made in the debate last week.  I have heard complaints about conditions in the turf camps.  I hope those things will be investigated because, from the public health point of view as well as from other angles, it is essential that it would be.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the middlemen's profit, which seem to leave a very bad flavour behind.  When turf is produced, either hand-won or machine-won turf, the cost of production reaches a certain figure, but there is a terrible difference between that figure and what the turf is sold at to consumers in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>What with the haulage and the different times the turf has to be handled, there is an excuse for some increase in price, but I should like to see that difference in price cut to the very minimum, so that it will be possible for the consumers to buy the turf at a reasonable price.  I have not the slightest doubt that if it could be bought at a reasonable figure, and if it gave reasonable satisfaction, the city people would feel more inclined to use the turf, and would soon grow to realise that the home-produced fuel could be just as good as the type of fuel we have got in times gone by from outside countries.</P>
    <P>This scheme is one that definitely requires consideration.  I wonder would it have come at all but for the lesson we have been taught during the emergency?  We saw for ourselves that we had no coal supplies; our timber supplies were limited, and we were left only with the turf.  We in the country had first-class turf.  We always had good fires, just as good as we had before the emergency came.  There was no difference whatever in the country. But the city people had not that to say.  As has been mentioned, bad, wet turf was better than having no fire at all.  The only thing is that we should try to get a drier and better type of turf for distribution in the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>As regards those gigantic turf dumps in the Phoenix Park, definitely the condition of the turf leaving some of those dumps is bound to be bad.  If turf <Col N="1476" /> could be kept under cover of some sort, it would be a great thing. Deputy Blowick suggested something along those lines.  Even in the transport of the turf from the bog centres to the dumps, and from that to the consumers in the cities, the turf, in getting so much handling, becomes wet and otherwise affected, and if it could be provided with some sort of cover and brought in as good a condition as possible to the consumer, satisfaction all round will be the result.</P>
    <P>Another thing that I sincerely hope will come through this turf development scheme is an improvement of bog roads, even in areas where the turf scheme does not operate.  When we go into gigantic bog centres roads will have to be made, and I hope those people who have to fight and struggle to get out hand-won turf for their own use as well as a percentage for sale to the city consumers, will get better concessions in the way of an improvement of the roads into their bogs.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I believe it has come as a result of the lesson we have been taught.  Perhaps it will be for the betterment of this country that we have been taught that lesson.  At least it has given us an incentive to start an industry which, we hope, will be one of the best and most profitable of the industries which we have started so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The general approval of this measure from all sides of the House is, perhaps, the greatest tribute that could be paid to the Minister's foresight when, in 1934, he embarked on a turf development scheme.  I was in the House at that time and I can well remember all the adverse criticism.  I think that were it not for that scheme at that time, and the preparations that were made then, we would be in a rather awkward position during the emergency.  I am sure also that it was not the emergency that brought about this idea of machine-won turf.  That is no new idea at all in the Minister's mind.  He foresaw that and took steps in connection with it long before the war started.</P>

    <P>A good deal has been said about hand-won turf.  I believe hand-won turf will always find a ready market <Col N="1477" /> within a reasonable distance of the various towns.  One of the best ways to secure that ready market is by having the turf societies reorganised. Some of them have continued on and have done very fine work during the emergency, but some fell away because the county councils took over the bogs. I think if they were worked on business lines they would be able to compete fairly well with any outside fuel or even with the machine-won fuel, if they do things in a businesslike way, as I have known them to do it in past years.</P>
    <P>I have heard a good deal about Mayo's claims.  It is no blame to the Mayo Deputies to put forward the claims of Mayo, but I can assure them that to my mind we have not got the scheme in Galway because of any favour to Galway.  The scheme in Galway is ideally situated in every way.  The turf is of superior quality, it is over 30 feet in depth and the railway runs right through the centre of the bog.  I think that all these things were taken into consideration and that is why the scheme will be operated there.  I could put forward claims for other bogs in County Galway if I wanted to do so.  I am sure the bog at Attymon was selected solely because of its situation.</P>
    <P>There is only one point that I wish to make on this Bill.  It was mentioned by Deputy Commons when he referred to drainage.  Very often when a benefit is conferred on one section it only creates trouble for others.  I am sure the Minister and the Turf Board, when it is in existence, will take cognisance of that position and that there will be an understanding between the Turf Board and the National Drainage Board.  If there is not proper drainage of a river leading from bogs that are to be drained, considerable hardship will be caused to people with land and to those engaged in agriculture. That has already happened in the case of a bog that the county council entered upon.  The bog was drained and while on the one hand useful work was done, it also caused great hardship and meant the loss of crops belonging to many farmers. <Col N="1478" /> The main artery leading from the bog was not properly cleaned up and there was not a proper flow of water from it.  That could happen on a bigger scale on other schemes.  I do not want farmers to be coming along later on, complaining of the great hardship that had been inflicted upon them. That is why I suggest that, when bog development schemes are being carried on, there should be drainage schemes under the national plan, in order to prevent anything like what I mentioned happening.  I join with other Deputies in welcoming this Bill, believing as I do that it is a great step forward, and one that I am sure will give useful employment in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I wish to call attention to another point, concerning camp accommodation. I understand it is likely that labour will be migrated certain distances on some of these schemes, and that it is likely that local authorities will be asked to erect or to assist in the erection of cottages.  It was stated that the scheme was likely to last much longer than 30 years.  If it were only to last for 30 years, I am sure that local authorities would be very slow to undertake the expense of building cottages which might, at the end of that period, be left on their hands.  I am glad that we have had an assurance to the contrary, and I believe that when the time comes local authorities will be as generous as they can afford to be in providing the necessary accommodation for the workers.</P>

      <P>I find it rather difficult to get at the back of the Minister's mind in relation to this scheme and the plans in it for our general economy.  I ask the Minister not to be misled by the suggestions made that the Bill has been received with great gratification in the House.  There is no opposition to this work being gone ahead with, even in the absence of much information that we should like to have.  But the Minister ought not to be misled by the expressions of approval into feeling that we can go ahead in this matter without our eyes being fully opened so as to gather, through the next year or two, details <Col N="1479" /> and information that we feel we ought to have before this measure passes through the House.  The Minister has been interested in turf for a very long time.  I think it was in the first Budget introduced by his Party in 1933 that the Minister declared he was going to make turf our second largest industry.  As Deputies pointed out, we have had a considerable amount of experience of working with turf since then.  Before 1938 something close on £500,000 was spent in assisting the turf industry, and yet we find, with the stimulus of the emergency, and all the other work done that the work of the Turf Board shows that the cost of production has differed in quite a number of places.  At Lyrecrumpane the cost was 25/4; at Clonsast 34/11; at Turraun 20/8; at Lullymore 24/9 a ton.  The explanation given with regard to the differences in price is certainly in very general terms.  I do not think we can go ahead without having information presented to us in a much more systematic and critical way.  On the Minister's general plan I find it difficult to visualise what he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the appendix to the turf development programme given in the White Paper, the number of centres in counties where development work has taken place is shown, and the total cost comes to £3,673,000.  Taking one of these centres, at Littleton, in Tipperary, where the cost of development is given as £161,000, I should like to know what is covered by that amount and under what heading of expenditure it is contemplated that the money will be spent.  In the second place, with regard to the other places, I should like to know whether there is an order of priority in relation to the centres at which work will be begun. I take it that it is hardly the intention to start off with all these places at once.  I also ask, in relation to the work to be carried on, whether there is any relation between that work and the experimental stations mentioned on page 2 of the White Paper.  If all the work is to be on machine-won turf, considering that the plan is going to work out for only ten years, then I take it it is going to be begun in a concentrated way, and that the earlier <Col N="1480" /> years will be years of experiment.  It is very important that that should be so, because there are certain aspects which suggest that we ought to be careful to see that we make the best use of such resources as we have; that we are not led into any misunderstanding with regard to a great and successful ultimate development; that we are not misled in that way to neglect opportunities that we should be pursuing. In relation to the Minister's indication of cost&mdash;between 20/- and 25/- a ton&mdash;I ask on what general rate of wages that estimate is based.  On page 25 of the report of the board dealing with turf, information is given with regard to Clonsast.</P>
    <P>The total production expenses are there shown as £44,000; the interest on advances is shown as £15,000, so that there you have the position in which the cost of capital covers one-third of the total production expenses.  It is true that the report indicates that capital has been lent to the board by the Government at an average ranging between 5¾ per cent. and 4¾ per cent. interest.  I take it that that is going to be changed in the immediate future but I think it would be desirable to let us know in relation to, say, the 20/- or the 25/- estimate for the turning out of turf, how much of that is actually labour and in relation to what rate of wages it has been estimated, and how much is going to be payment for capital.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he has a rather poor outlook on the possibility of our getting coal in future to the extent to which we used normally require it.  I think the Minister is entirely wrong there.  I think it is a very remarkable thing that British production of coal at the present day is only about 25 per cent. below what it was pre-war.  I think nobody connected with the ordinary industrial or commercial life of Great Britain and closely interested in the whole situation there could be persuaded that, say, within a year even, the coal production in Great Britain is not going to be restored to what it was.  When we consider that we used only about 2,500,000 tons pre-war and when we figure out how little impression on that <Col N="1481" /> total amount the amount of turf production that is arranged for here will make, it is rather silly on our part to think that we could not get as much coal from Great Britain in a year's time or certainly in two years' time, as we ever got before the war.  At this stage of our knowledge of turf, taking into consideration domestic users and industrial users, particularly industrial users who are in very great difficulties to-day with regard to fuel, I think the Minister could get no support at all for the idea that we could do without coal and substitute turf for it, say, in Dublin as a domestic fuel or throughout the greater part of the country as an industrial fuel.</P>
    <P>If we slacken our demand on Great Britain for all the coal that she possibly can give us at this particular time we will probably injure our national economy very considerably. We will naturally require a considerable amount of industrial development here if we are to maintain our population and keep our increasing population here.  For the purpose fuel is one of the really important things.  One would imagine that additional industrial development here within the next ten years would consume in power and in fuel much more than the additional amount of fuel that this plan contemplates.  Therefore, granted that we are able to attain that, we would want, perhaps, even more coal than we were getting before the war to maintain the amount of industrial development we ought to have here inside the next ten years.</P>
    <P>There may be a tendency, as it were, to lessen the insistence of our demands on Great Britain for the coal that we want and which we could use with great advantage to our national economy.  We will be warping the development of our industrial plant here towards the use of turf when we may not be able to supply it adequately or at a reasonable cost when the experiments are fully carried out. That is why I appeal to the Minister that as we go forward, particularly for the next two or three years, in the matter of turf development or the extension of this turf plan, we must go forward with our eyes completely open <Col N="1482" /> and we surely should keep in our mind that the industrial development that we want here, as insistently as we want the additional employment that turf development would give us, would absorb more fuel than was represented by our pre-war requirements and more than we are likely to develop within the next few years here.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan yesterday spoke of the recent speech of the Minister for Mines in Glasgow, where he indicated that Great Britain owed very considerable amounts to the three countries, Sweden, Denmark and ourselves, and that they would have to pay these debts in full, that we had sent them, and would continue to send them, considerable food supplies, and that these had to be paid for.  The implication surely was that, as far as his responsibilities were, we should be able to get coal in payment for our food supplies and in payment for the debts they owe to us.  At any rate, it is imperative that we should be able to provide against difficulties that might arise out of our not being able to get it, but if we can get turf as cheaply as the Minister indicates and as useful for fuel as the Minister indicates and if we can get it even to the quantity the Minister suggests here, we also want coal, and we want it to as large a quantity as we ever got before the war.  People closely connected with British industry, at the present moment, see no reason why British production of coal would not be back to its pre-war level in a year or two. If that is so, our requirements are so small that we should be able to get our full requirements from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is wise in that, because it is desirable that the maximum amount of information should be available to the Dáil, and I am sensitive to the criticism which has been advanced during the debate that insufficient data had been made available to Deputies to enable them to judge the merits of this proposal. When introducing the Bill I thought it desirable to emphasise that our present fuel difficulties were not due entirely to war-time conditions and would not end in the near future when problems created by the war in relation to other commodities might be expected to disappear.  I think we will have fuel difficulties of one kind or another for many years to come.  I gave that opinion, however, merely as an additional reason why it was desirable to develop our turf resources and, particularly, to exploit the method of producing turf by the mechanical means which the Turf Development Board is now employing.  I certainly did not intend to convey any suggestion that this particular project is being embarked upon because of present or anticipated future difficulties.  In the Government's view, the development of our turf resources and, particularly, the increasing of the mechanical production of turf is desirable and would have been embarked upon even if no fuel difficulties had arisen or were anticipated in the future.</P>
      <P>The House, I think, is aware that the Turf Development Board was established before the war and commenced operations at Clonsast, Turraun and Lyrecrumpane before the war and, but for the war, its activities would probably have now reached the scale contemplated in the scheme outlined in the White Paper.  From every angle from which any national project can be judged, the development of our turf resources is desirable.  It will involve a strengthening of the national economy, it will have beneficial social consequences by the provision of employment in districts where an improvement in social and employment conditions is necessary, and it will also add to the national security in times of emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised by the attitude conveyed <Col N="1484" /> by the speeches of some of the Deputies opposite, particularly Deputy Hughes, Deputy Coogan and Deputy McGilligan.  For some reason, these Deputies considered it necessary to disparage and to discourage this project, just as they and some of their colleagues usually seek to disparage and to discourage projects for the development of our resources or any plans which seem to involve or are designed to secure a reduction of our dependency upon external sources of supply for essential materials.  That attitude is incomprehensible to me.  I do not think there is any considered opinion behind it, and, if it is based upon any conception of good Party tactics, it seems to be merely foolish.  Deputy Hughes went so far as to suggest that we should not attempt to develop our peat resources at all unless we had a definite statement from the British Minister of Fuel and Power that full and adequate supplies of coal from British sources would not be available. I think it would be the height of folly to neglect to develop any resource here which appears to be worthy of development, and it is obviously to the national advantage that we should, if we can, reduce our dependency upon our external sources of supply for our essential commodities, and fuel is one of the most essential commodities of all.</P>
    <P>During a recent visit to England, I had an opportunity of discussing with the British Minister of Fuel and Power the present supply position and future prospects.  It is true that I was concerned mainly with the quantity and quality of the coal now reaching us and the prospect of improving supplies in the immediate future.  I found Mr. Shinwell optimistic as to the future trend of British coal production when the process of nationalisation was completed and I hope that his optimism proves justified.  I think an improvement of the British coal position is practicable, although, judging by some reports recently published, it will involve the opening of new mines which will take some time.  I must, however, have regard to existing conditions and to the trend disclosed by recent British statistics.  The output of coal in Great Britain has declined <Col N="1485" /> continuously since the beginning of the war and, at the present time, it has reached a dangerously low level, so low a level that any further diminution in output must inevitably mean that no surplus for export will be available at all.</P>
    <P>I saw from a recent Press report that British ships are travelling from British ports on light bunkers hoping to fill their bunkers at ports in other countries.  That is certainly a new development and is an indication to us that we must endeavour to ensure, to the extent we can do it, that our complete dependence upon British coal supplies will be reduced.  We cannot possibly in any reasonable time hope to reach a position when imported coal will not be essential for us.  It is essential now and will be essential for many years to come, and, if we get into a position where we can buy all the coal we need, that would be very satisfactory. But, merely because we may get into such a position at some stage is no reason why we should not develop our own natural resources of power, whether water or coal or turf, if it is practicable to do it, and particularly when, as in the case of turf, it can be shown to be an entirely economic proposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan thinks that my fears as to the future trend of coal prices are unfounded.  I hope he is right.  It may be that, by intensive mechanisation of the British mines, the increased cost of production which has been evident will be offset.  I think it is extremely unlikely that coal prices will ever again fall as low as they were before the war.  My own personal opinion is that they will not fall below a point which will represent a 100 per cent. increase upon pre-war prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point I was going to make.  If circumstances should arise which will mean that coal prices will fall, either because of a reduction in the price of capital or the cost of machinery or in the general standard of living and, consequently, the wage level, presumably similar <Col N="1486" /> factors will operate here and the cost of production of turf by the mechanical means which the Turf Development Board will employ will fall also. When the Clonsast scheme was started it was anticipated that the cost of production of turf would be 10/6 per ton.</P>
      <P>Clonsast was never fully developed. It is not a fair criticism of that scheme to say that the present cost is 34/- per ton, because Clonsast was intended to produce 120,000 tons a year and the capital invested in it was designed to reach such a production.  The area of the bog, the extent of the drainage done, the railway lines, and the other physical equipment installed there were all designed to meet a production of 120,000 tons per year.  But production at that rate would involve the use of seven of the big bagging machines, and because of difficulties caused by the war, only three such machines are now in operation.  Consequently, the incidence of the capital charges on the cost of production to which Deputy Mulcahy has just referred is abnormally high, and the present cost of turf per ton produced at Clonsast is no indication of what will be practicable when an output at the rate of 120,000 tons per year is secured.  It is estimated that even at that stage, because of the higher costs which have arisen since the beginning of the war, the price per ton will be around 22/1 or 23/-, and it will not be possible to get back to 10/6 per ton upon which the scheme was originally started.  I have mentioned that wages are 50 per cent. of the total cost and wages there have practically doubled.  Other charges have equally increased.  As an indication that the figures given in the White Paper are well based upon the board's experience, I instanced the case of Turraun bog, which is fully developed and where the capital employed is in no sense fallow.  The production is proceeding there at the maximum rate at which it is practicable and last year the all-in cost of that turf, loaded on railway wagon or lorry, was 20/8 per ton.  It is reasonable to assume that some of the costs which were experienced in Turraun last year will decline.</P>

Má théigheann cigirí ag fiosrú i dtaobh na bpáistí agus ag cur na bpáistí faoi scrúdú béil agus ag fáil cibé faisnéis is féidir féachaint an bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt sa bhaile acu.  Sna blianta idir 1933-34 agus 1943-44 bhí laghdú sa neán-tinareamh sna scoileanna sa bFhíor-Ghaeltacht.  Bhí an laghdú san 10 fán gcéad i nGaillimh, 18 i Muigheo agus Tír Chonaill, 27 i gCorcaigh agus 40 i gCiarraighe.</P>

      <P>Níhea, ins na bunsgoileanna. Sin iad na figiúirí i gcóir an mhean-tinnrímh agus taspánann sé go bhfuil an scéal go holc.  Caithfimíd bheith ag smaoineadh gur thuit an meán-tinnreamh ar fud na tíre, agus na bailltí agus na cúl-áiteanna d'áirimh, níos mó ná a 11 fán gcéad san am chéanna.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil tuitim cosúil leis an tuitim sin ins gach ceanntar, go mór mór ins na ceanntracha iargúlta; ach is léir go bhfuil an scéal i gContae Chiarraighe go han-dona.  Le deich mbliana anuas bhí an tuitim ann, agus i gContae Ciarraighe tá sé níos measa ná áiteanna eile.  Mura dteigheann na páistí ar scoil ní féidir linn greim d'fháil orthu, ach is féidir linn an méid seo a chur ós ár gcomhair mar chuspóir.  Mura bhféadaimíd na Gaeilgeoirí sa nGaeltacht a choimead ar aon <Col N="1491" /> teangain amháin&mdash;agus sílim nach féidir an Bhéarla do choinneáil amach uatha&mdash;ba chóir dúinn an Ghaeilge do chothú agus do neartú sa gcuid eile den tír, sa slí go mbeidh an Ghalltacht dhá-theangach againn.  Bhéarfadh sin níos mó cúnamh don Ghaeltacht mar beidh cruthú acu ansin go bhfuilimid i ndáiríribh agus nach ceist poiliticiúila í, ach ceist mhór náisiúnta.  Caithfimid a chruthú dhóibh go bhfuilimid ghá cothú, ar bhealach nach mbéidh seans ar bith go nbuadhfadh an Ghaeilge orthú am ar bith.</P>
      <P>Ní dóigh liom go mbraitheann athbheochaint na Gaeilge ar an nGaeltacht ar fad, agus nílim ar aon intinn leo siúd a abrann go bhfuil an Ghaeilge caillte don náisiún nó gur cúis éadóchais dúinn an teanga do bheith ag trádh san nGaeltacht.  B'fhearr i bhfad gan an scéal bheith amhlaidh ach caithfimíd a thuigsint go bhfuil saol nua ar fad ann anois thar mar bhí 20 blian ó shoin agus tá an saol lasmuigh ag cur isteach ar an nGaeltacht faoi láthair le neart agus fuinne amh níos mó ná riamh.  Ar an taobh eile den scéal tá an athbheochaint ag brath ar an nGalltacht chomh maith leis an nGaeltacht.  Ní thig linn a rá go bhféadfadh lucht na Gaeltachta an teanga do shábháil, agus ní fhéadfaimís a rá nach bhféadfadh lucht na Galltachta í do tharrtháil uatha féin. Sna 20 blian so thart tá timpeall milliún páistí tar éis teacht amach as na scoltacha lena bheag nó a mhór á den Ghaeilge.  Tá i bhfad Eireann níos mó Gaeilge aca i gcoitinne ná mar a bhí againne agus a fhios acu gurb í a dteanga náisiúnta í.  Ach, faríor, is annamh a labhraid í tar éis an scoil d'fháil.  Sílim go bhfuil an scéal maidir leis an nglún óg sa nGalltacht ar aon dul le cás an aois óig sa nGaeltacht. Tá an saol ag cur isteach orthu araon. Tá dúil acu sa mBéarla.  Cad chuige nach mbéadh?  Tá gach uile rud timpeall orthu sa Bhéarla, leabhra, páipéirí, scannáin, radió.  Tá an Béarla ar fáil i ngach aon áit.  Caithfear dul ag tóraíocht na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní fheicimse, mar sin, gur ceist airgid nó ceist eacnamíochta ceist seo na Gaeilge.  B'fhéidir go bhféadfadh an Rialtas níos mó a dhéanamh ar <Col N="1492" /> mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht, cur leis na gléasanna atá acu, nó feidhm níos éifeachtaí a bhaint as na cinn atá acu cheana.  Má thig linn na gléasanna san d'fheabhsú, ba chóir é dhéanamh agus toradh ní b'fhearr do bhaint astu.  Ach sa deireadh mara bhfuil dúil ag an bPobal sa cheist seo, mara bhfuil siad sásta a gcion féin a dhéanamh, ní fhéadfaidh an Rialtas mórán eile do dhéanamh.  Caithfear an Pobal go ghríosadh.  Tá an ghlún óg ag braith ar dhaoinibh eile, na daoine fásta, na daoine udarásacha a bhfuil baint aca leo, dea-shampla agus treórú a thabhairt dóibh, agus iad do mhealladh chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt mar ghnáth-theanga.</P>
    <P>As I have said in Irish, we can all agree with Deputy Mulcahy that the position of the Irish-speaking districts should be systematically examined. In fact, the position is constantly under review by the Government.  There is and has been a Cabinet Sub-Committee which deals from time to time with the co-ordination, for example, of services relating to the Gaeltacht, with the question of the Irish language in the administration, and any other matters where it seemed necessary that there should be co-operation between Government Departments on matters affecting the Gaeltacht area.  There is no doubt, as the figures given by the Deputy, and which I have confirmed, show that the Irish-speaking districts are dwindling, and that the use of the Irish language as the vernacular is declining, but the rural population through the country, as the school attendance figures emphasise and bring forcibly before our minds, has been declining very much during the last ten or 15 years.  There have not been the number of marriages that one would have expected.  I do not know whether there has been any improvement in that respect recently.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that the people in the Gaeltacht are conscious of the fact that they are living in isolated, poor, barren districts, and that, for economic reasons, they may have to go outside.  For that reason they will have an interest in the English language, and it will be impossible, I think, to keep them from knowing <Col N="1493" /> English, but we can have the position even if they do know English that I know obtains in Tir Chonaill: that even those who have to go across to England or Scotland to work for a living speak Irish among themselves, and that when they are at home, I think I am correct in saying they speak Irish and give a definite preference to the Irish language.  It is their natural language.  If occasion arises where they have to speak English in the course of their work outside the country, they speak it.  In the Irish-speaking districts in Donegal, in spite of the decline in population which is there and which may be greater there than in other places, the reason being the decline in the rural population generally, it will be found, I think, that the Irish language is well established, and will, with the help of all our good friends in the North, please God, continue to hold its position.</P>
    <P>The same is true of Connemara.  The fall there has not been so great.  The people of Dublin, the Coiste na bPáisde, Government schemes and so on have all helped Irish, in my opinion, in Connemara.  The position of the Southern Gaeltacht is not so satisfactory. The Munster men and women who are interested in the Irish language ought to bestir themselves, and see that the few small remaining Irish-speaking areas will not become smaller still, because if they do, there is great danger that they will disappear altogether.</P>
    <P>Now, what can the Government do in this matter?  I think we have the particulars, and I think that the school figures give a fairly exact account of the actual position which I have dealt with briefly in Irish.  We have taken up, like our predecessors, the policy enshrined in the White Paper issued by our predecessors, based on the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission reports.  We have been implementing these.  Teachers have to have certain qualifications in Irish.  They have to have a good knowledge of Irish to teach in the Gaeltacht.  There are training schemes on which large sums of money have been spent for the training of our teachers through the <Col N="1494" /> medium of Irish.  Considerable preference is given to boys and girls from the Gaeltacht who enter for the teaching profession, and bonuses are given to teachers who teach through Irish in the Gaeltacht areas.  School administration is largely through Irish.  The Gaeltacht Commission reported that &ldquo;non-Irish-speaking officials ought to be replaced by Irish-speaking ones as soon as possible.&rdquo;  That has been done. Take the Gárdaí.  The Commissioner, some years ago, decided that the Gárdaí in the Irish-speaking districts should do all their work through Irish, and that is being done.  The courts are co-operating.  I think that now, perhaps for the first time, there is no reason whatever why, since the judges and the officials in the courts know Irish, that the work of the courts in these districts should not be through Irish.</P>
    <P>The Gaeltacht services branch administration has always been done through Irish.  The Minister for Agriculture has a special section of his Department dealing with schemes for the improvement of the Gaeltacht.  I do not know whether the people of the Gaeltacht are fully aware of all that the Department of Agriculture is trying to do for them.  In other parts of the country we have often found that the people were not aware of these schemes.  I have a list of them here, but I do not think I need mention them in detail.  I can indicate the type of scheme.  We have a farm improvements scheme, a lime subsidy, reclamation and drainage scheme, a scheme of grants for the erection or repair of lime kilns, a seed distribution scheme, a demonstration plots scheme, a poultry development scheme, a special term bull scheme, a special term ram scheme, a pig-breeding scheme, a veterinary dispensary scheme, a Connemara veterinary scheme, a scheme of loans for glasshouses.  Owing to the war, this scheme was held up, but the Minister for Agriculture is interested in it, and I believe it is the type of scheme which could be of the greatest advantage to the people of the Gaeltacht.  Many of them are experienced in this kind of work, and all that is necessary is that <Col N="1495" /> there should be an effective organisation for the production of tomatoes and for their transport and marketing in Dublin.  As soon as conditions permit and materials are available, the Minister for Agriculture intends to push forward with that scheme. Schemes in connection with beehives, fencing and tree planting are administered by the special section of the Department of Agriculture.  All the correspondence is done through Irish, and in the Gaeltacht areas the schemes are administered through six Irish-speaking agricultural overseers and 31 Irish-speaking assistant agricultural overseers.  They all do their work through Irish.  All the correspondence with headquarters is done through Irish, so that all the work in connection with the development of agriculture, horticulture, bee-keeping, poultry-keeping and tree planting, so far as these schemes are concerned, is done through Irish.</P>
    <P>The Post Office, we know, has given preference to young people from the Gaeltacht to enter its employment.  I feel that there is no difficulty as far as that particular branch of the administration is concerned.  The old age pensions officers in charge of that area are all Irish speakers and I should be surprised if there were any complaints on that score.  The Customs and Excise administration has always been noted for its interest in Irish.  As regards unemployment assistance benefit, there is a special section dealing with the Irish-speaking areas and the work is being done through Irish but there is no use in the Government setting up a special section or seeing that its officials have Irish and that, having gone into the service with Irish, they should be compelled, as the Gaeltacht Commission recommended, to use Irish in their ordinary business, if the people do not speak Irish to them. Unfortunately that does not always happen.  We hear complaints from time to time but we do not hear of the hundreds of officers who are there available, who can speak fluent Irish, who can do their work in Irish and whose services are not requisitioned. If they are requisitioned, it is very <Col N="1496" /> often a case of the official, rather than the person with whom he has had to do business, initiating the discussion in Irish.  As far as administration is concerned, I think the Government can claim that in a great many respects we are far ahead of the people outside. There may be certain branches of the administration not as good as we would all wish them to be but taking them all in all&mdash;and I think the examples I have given are proof of it &mdash;the administration in the Gaeltacht areas, I think, is very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the Gaeltacht Order.  The principle upon which these Orders was based was that a definite preference should be given for a knowledge of Irish.  That is the rule in the filling of all public positions and an over-all preference is given for a competent knowledge of Irish.  A person who is qualified to do his work in Irish will get the position provided he has the requisite qualifications.  But what has happened?  Persons have secured posts in Gaeltacht areas who are not qualified in Irish because, as I say, applicants with a knowledge of Irish, who were otherwise qualified, were not available.  The posts had to be filled.  There has been a genuine difficulty in getting Irish-speaking officers&mdash;medical officers of health and nurses&mdash;and I think that local authorities, if they are interested and wish to co-operate in the national policy of helping Irish forward, ought to have regard to these difficulties and when they are fixing scales of salaries and remuneration for their officers, particularly on the public health side, they ought to make allowance for the fact that the officers have to live in these isolated areas.  They have to do their work in Irish and the same compensation ought to be given as is given in the case of other public services.  From 1918 to 1945, 1,442 officers and employments were affected by these language Orders and out of the 1,442 vacancies filled only 355 have not qualified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>Does the Minister say 1,442 vacancies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 1,442 persons have been appointed to offices and employments in the Gaeltacht during that <Col N="1497" /> period.  A certain number of those people claim to be over age.  There is also the position, as the Deputy knows, that a great number of these posts are minor posts, such as those of laundresses and wardsmaids where a high standard of education would not be expected.  It appears that even in those cases it has not been always possible to find persons even with an oral knowledge of Irish such as would enable it to be said that they were competent to do their work through Irish.  There has been a scheme also for providing nurses from the Gaeltacht which, I think, the Deputy initiated.  Even so, there is this difficutly in getting people who have the language.  The whole matter has been a cause for anxiety to the Government, not only now but for years past.  The Government does not wish to impose hardship on people who have made a genuine effort and who are incapable, because of age or for some other sound reason, of learning Irish, at least to the extent of being able to do their work through it.  On the other hand, this Order is of the greatest importance because if officers of the State and public servants in the Gaeltacht are not able to do their work in Irish, we cannot expect ordinary citizens to have respect for Irish or to speak it themselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health has been examining this matter and is most anxious that those persons, who have not qualified in Irish so far, would do so and that they would be able to do their work through Irish.  He is considering what further steps should be taken to deal with the cases of those who have not qualified.  The intention of the Minister is to enforce the policy of Gaelicising local services in the Gaeltacht area, that is, the policy which is enshrined in the Gaeltacht Order.  It is the intention of the Minister to make that policy effective and I think the Dáil may take it that the Orders will be put into more effective operation in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think, having regard to the fact that the Government is examining this question from time to time and that Ministers who deal with economic <Col N="1498" /> affairs have special relations with the Gaeltacht areas&mdash;Ministers like myself, not dealing with economic affairs, are also in a position to have special knowledge of the circumstances&mdash;that it is necessary to have a further examination, merely for the purpose of ascertaining the facts.  I do not know that the examination is likely to suggest remedies which have not already suggested themselves and have not been considered.  From the economic point of view, I have referred to the schemes of the Department of Agriculture. There has, of course, been an enormous improvement in the condition of the people in the Gaeltacht in our time. There has been not alone the income that they have derived from the magnificent turf schemes; there have been the cottage industries, which have been financed by the Government for many years, and the housing policy, which did such a wonderful amount of good in these areas.  The Land Commission has given a great deal of attention and spent a great deal of money in these areas.  Fishing has also received attention.  Then we had general schemes like unemployment assistance, children's allowances, public works schemes, farm improvements and land reclamation, all of which were of special benefit to the people in these areas.</P>
    <P>The unification of all the Gaeltacht services in a single department which has been suggested from time to time, not recently&mdash;the matter received pretty full consideration by the Government more than once&mdash;was not considered by the Minister an effective method of giving assistance.  My belief &mdash;and I think I can speak for the Government&mdash;is that the particular schemes that it has been found are of special benefit to the Gaeltacht should be pushed forward&mdash;if necessary, they should be improved&mdash;and that each Department, such as the Department of Local Government, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Lands, dealing particularly with the Gaeltacht from the economic side, should all do their utmost to improve the people's condition. I would go further and say that <Col N="1499" /> every one of the Ministers responsible for these activities would be prepared to encourage suitable schemes, and even to initiate them, if they are satisfied that they will be of benefit.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has helped persons to initiate industries in other parts of the country, would be more than willing, I feel quite sure, if propositions were put before him for the development of suitable industries in the Gaeltacht, to carefully consider them and, if possible, put them into effect.</P>
    <P>There is the question of co-ordination, as I have said, in Irish. Co-ordination between the Government Departments has been effected through a Cabinet Sub-Committee, and that committee can be always called upon to deal with matters that may arise or, if necessary, it may initiate a new policy or a new orientation, either on the economic side or from the point of view of the language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has that committee considered the fact that the areas are declining and that the language is weakening?  Has it discussed that aspect of the situation at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it has not specifically discussed that aspect, but it has been dealing all the time with the question of advancing Irish in the public administration and co-ordinating and making more useful the various Government activities.  It can always be called together, however, and if the Government choose, they can ask the Cabinet Sub-Committee to go into the matter in more detail.  However, as regards the administration generally, so far as the language is concerned, I think that the situation is pretty satisfactory.  There may be certain hollows which will have to be levelled up, and certain weaknesses and shortcomings which ought to be remedied. So far as the Department of Finance is concerned, being the Department responsible for the public service, the Minister has undertaken to see that there will be effective co-ordination, with his Department as the key-stone, <Col N="1500" /> to see that the work of the administration is done through Irish, and efforts will be made to push forward with that work so that, at the earliest possible date, all the work of administration in the Gaeltacht areas will be through Irish.  Attention is constantly given by Ministers to schemes for the promotion of Irish, and the Government will consider what further steps they will take to focus attention upon this matter and to strengthen the Irish language, not alone in the administration, but in public affairs generally.</P>
      <P>I should like, in conclusion, to emphasise that the co-operation of the public is necessary.  I do not think that we are likely to get anywhere if we think that the Government can alter this situation in the Gaeltacht and make the Gaeltacht, for example, uni-lingual, or prevent English from breaking in there, if they have not the co-operation of the public.  The Government can do certain things; they can give a lead in the matter, and the Government are prepared to give that lead and a certain direction, but in the long run, as the House will realise, the success of anything that the Government may initiate must depend on the co-operation of the people themselves. The Deputy has not explained, in his speech, in what particular directions he thinks the Government could effectively intervene to remedy this position of the dwindling of the Irish-speaking districts and of the Irish language as a vernacular.  The Government have the greatest sympathy with the motion, and if it were possible to do more in the way of systematic examination that would be worth while, the Government would be quite prepared to do it.  I am not ruling out the possibility that a more systematic examination may be made, but I have pointed out that, so far as encouraging Irish in the administration is concerned, the Government have done their share.  I have shown that there is co-ordination between the Departments dealing with the Gaeltacht and that special efforts have been made to intensify the drive, not only in the Gaeltacht but outside it, and the Government will consider further what steps they can usefully take.</P>

I gConnachta faoi láthair, níl duine amháin ann ag scríobh na scéalta nuair ba cheart trúir nó ceathar a bheith ó mhaidin go faoithin ag scríobh ann, mar má imíonn sí mar atá an Ghaeilge imithe i gCuige Mumhan beidh na records againn lena chruthú go raibh sí ann lá éicínt.  Mar sin, ba cheart rud éicínt a dhéanamh go luath agus gan é ligean ar cáirde.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mise óg, bhí an mhuintir a raibh an seanchas agus na scéalta acu go tiugh is gach uile bhaile agus iad ag comórtas le chéile féachaint cé acu ab fhearr.  Agus nach againn a bhíodh an siamsa ag éisteacht leo. Chuimhním go dtáinig fear i bhfad blianta ó shoin a raibh Fournier air agus bhí sé seachtain in éineacht liomsa. Chuala sé an oiread amhráin agus dánta is cheap sé nach raibh sa domhan. Thug mé soir go Leitir Mealláin é agus thug mé Túna Thomáis Seáinín, anamhránach, liom.  Chuamar go Teach Ósta an Chuigéil.  Cuireadh fios ar an gCeannabhánach sean-amhraní eile. Thosaigh pobal Chárna agus Pobal Leitir Mealláin ag cor a chéile ag amhráin ó mhaidin go meán oíche.  Níor stopadar gur cheap Fournier go raibh a sháith aige féin agus é cruthaithe dhó amhráin agus scéalta bheith ann a shíl sé bheith caillte.  An t-am sin, bhí sé chomh héasca na scórtha de na hamhránachaí sin fháil; anois, murach Sorcha Ní Ghuairim agus a leithide a thóg na hamhráin óna máthair ní bheadh mórán seanamhránach ann.  Tá Sorcha go maith agus bhí a mathair go maith ach goir ná gaobhar ní raibh acu ar mháthair mhór mháthair Shorca a bhí híontach.</P>

      <Col N="1504" /> Anois deir an tAire go bhfuil an Ghaeilge beagnach caillte ag muintir Chúige Mumhan.  Má tá sí caillte acu níl sí caillte ag daoine atá ag déanamh brabach uirthi.  Chailleadar féin í agus ní ligean an náire nó an onóir dóibh í labhairt; tá sí leáite ach níl fáil ag duine ar phosta dá huireasa.  Cén fáth má ligeadar féin uathu í a gcaithfe muide glaeadh léi?  Tá níos mó Gaeilge in mo phobal féin ná tá i gCúige Mumhan ar fad.  Bhí mise is gCúige Mumhan ceathair nó cúig de bhlianta ó shoin agus ní chuala mé focal ar bith ann ach corr fhocal anonn is anall sna sléibhte ann.  Tá sí againn ar fud an chósta ar fad.</P>
    <P>Má cailltear an Ghaeilge sa nGaelacht caillfear an Ghaeilge; tá sí le bheith imithe.  Mar sin ba cheart dúinn a bheith ceanúil ar an nGaeltacht agus rud éigin a dhéanamh dhóibh lena gcur os cionn boicíní.</P>
    <P>Is as iargcúil na Gaeltachta mise agus níl náire orm a rá agus níor rith mé as mar dhéanas cuid mhaith nuair shíleas siad a bheith go maith sa saol.</P>
    <P>Má bhíonn beagán cabhrach ag sroicheadh don Gaeltacht bíonn gach áit na Ghaeltacht agus nuair tugtar an chabhair ní Gaeltacht ar aon chor an áit sin.</P>
    <P>Teighim thar Theach an Phiarsaigh gach seachtain agus, ach amháin go bhfuil a theach folamh déarfainn go bhfuil ballaí agus a chuid tuí ag coinneáil spirid na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta beo.  Mar sin, ina ainm agus in ainm Eamoinn Ceant i ndeireadh na dála féin, tagamaid uile go léir le chéile agus déanamuis, ón duine is airde go dtí an duine is ísle againn, ár ndícheall an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo bríomhar.  Labhramaid gach uile uair í is féidir linn, spáinimuid don tír uilig gurb na Gaeilgeoirí an Ghaeilge agus an Fhíor-Ghaeltacht ancaire agus slabhra na tíre.  Má bristear an slabhra sin beidh an tír le , agus rud ar bith a theighea, le fánaidh is deacair é thabhairt ar ais.</P>

Tá meas ag na daoine ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht.  Tá daoine anseo gan focal Gaeilge acu agus tá meas acu ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht.  Táim cinnte go bhfuil daoine ar fuaid na tíre ná raibh riamh sa Ghaeltacht a bhfuil níos mó suime sa Ghaeilge agus sa Ghaeltacht acu ná cuid de mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin.  Níl aon mhaith i gcaint cosúil leis an gcaint a chualamar anois. Ní mór dúinn bheith ciallmhar má theastaíonn uainn an Ghaeilge a thabhairt thar n-ais.  Is éigin dúinn comhthuigsint agus chómh-chaidreamh a bheith againn má tá uainn an Ghaeilge do shábháil sa Ghaeltacht agus í a leathnú ar fuaid na tíre.  Do réir mo thuairimse, dá mbeimísne, lucht na Gaeilge, nios ciallmhaire uaireanta ná mar atáimid ar an gceist seo, d'feadfaimis níos mó daoine do mhealladh linn.  An sórt baoth-chainte a chualamar ón gcainteor deireannach &mdash;sin é an rud atá ag coimeád na ndaoine ó nGaeilge d'fhoghlaim.  Ní mar gheall air gur rugadh agus gur tógadh duine sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil Gaeilge aige ón gcliabhán gur féidir leis a rá nach bhfuil aon tsuim ag daoine eile san scéal.  Ina ionad sin, agus in ionad duine bheith ag cur de mar sin, ba cheart moladh do thabhairt do na daoine a chuireann spéis sa Ghaeilge agus a chaitheann <Col N="1506" /> tréimhse sa Ghaeltacht ag foghlaim na Gaeilge.</P>

Is dóigh liom go bhfuighfeá níos mó cainteoirí Gaeilge i nDún-na-nGall ná i gConamara.  Do réir na bhfigiúirí atá ag an Aire Oideachais, tá níos mó páistí ag freastal ar na scoileanna i nDún-na-nGall ná mar tá i gConamara.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody can find fault with the motion that is before the House.  I think it is true to say that, so far as any evidence that we have would indicate, the area of the Gaeltacht is dwindling. If there was any systematic examination which could be undertaken that would help us in any way to find out why that is so, other than what we know generally already, I think it should be undertaken but, like the Minister for Education, I do not know that we would get very much from any investigation that we might undertake.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows what the position is.  In this country at the moment the majority of our people speak English as their ordinary language, as their natural language; it is the language that is spoken in their homes.  That is the fact and we cannot get away from it.  What we are trying, and have been trying, to do through the schools is to produce a generation by which the Irish language, the national language, will be spoken from their earliest days, so that we will have the advantage of having it as the vernacular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it the aim of everyone who is interested in the revival of the language is to try to bring about a situation in which the people of this country will use the Irish language as their everyday speech, as their ordinary vernacular.  That does not mean to say that we want to exclude <Col N="1508" /> them from the knowledge of any other language.  We do not want that, but we do want to try to bring about a situation in which the people of this country, in their ordinary language, speaking one to the other, will use Irish in preference to any other language. If that is our aim, it is quite clear that the Irish-speaking districts play a most important part, because it is there that the tradition of using the language as the vernacular has remained unbroken; it is there that the language is spoken in such a way as it can only be spoken by people who have used it from the time they spoke their first words.</P>
    <P>Any of us who learned even a few words of Irish when we were growing up, know that the words we learned then have a significance for us that we have never been able to get from the words we acquired later.  I know that has been the way with me, in any case. The few Irish words I knew when I was young had a certain significance, a fullness of meaning for me that I have never been able to get from any Irish words I have learned since.  I saw them applied in a particular way and I knew all about them.  I have learned many other words since but, in regard to these particular words, I know their peculiar application and their shades of meaning and the manner in which they could be applied and, so far as I am concerned, I have not been able to get the same thing from any other words I have learned in the meantime.  It is for that reason we are so anxious that the children should learn Irish in the schools from the start.</P>
    <P>I know there has been a difference of opinion as to whether that is wise or not, but those who have paid attention to the teaching and the learning of languages, particularly where children are concerned, have all agreed that the age at which language is best learned, the age at which there is every likelihood of it becoming the vernacular with those who speak it, is about eight to 11 or perhaps earlier.  Our aim, therefore, is that we want to get Irish brought back so that it will become the vernacular of our people.  That being our aim, there is not the slightest <Col N="1509" /> doubt about it that the preservation of the Gaeltacht, the preservation of the language where it is the natural language of the people, is of prime importance.</P>
    <P>What can we do about it?  A great deal of nonsense is spoken, and there is nothing, I think, more irritating than to hear people talking about the preservation of the language where it is spoken at present&mdash;the Gaeltacht&mdash; as if you could put a wall around that area, or as if you had some method by which you could, when you are speaking of the area outside the Gaeltacht, compel the people to speak a language they do not want to speak.  You cannot do that and, consequently, the first thing to be done is to get the people to have the will to speak the language, to want to speak it, and they will not want to speak it unless they appreciate its value.</P>
    <P>I get angry when I hear people from the Gaeltacht talking about the attitude of people outside, the attitude of members of the Government, and suggesting they are not in earnest about it.  What those people are doing is, they are getting their own people to believe that those who are anxious about the language are only pretending. That is not so.  Every person in the Gaeltacht who loves the language &mdash;and I take it most people who speak it must love it&mdash;has reason to be proud of it.  I do not mind if a person from Connemara thinks he has the best Irish.  I am glad to know that he thinks that.  If a person from Donegal thinks he has the best Irish, let him think that and be proud of it. Similarly, if a Munsterman thinks his Irish is better, let him think that, too. The point is that everyone who speaks like that is proud of the language that he is speaking and, if we get those of influence in the Irish-speaking districts to let the people understand that they have something of great value and that the other people around them envy them, that is all the better.</P>
    <P>I have been for some time learning the language.  I have listened to native speakers and the dialect that I learned is probably more near that of the Connemara speaker than it is to the dialect of either of those who <Col N="1510" /> spoke from Donegal.  When he speaks he speaks naturally and I could hardly follow it at all, he spoke so rapidly.  I might live for several hundred years and, unless I was born and lived my life all over again, I could not hope to have the fluency that the Connemara speaker had.  The beauty of it is that the language is natural in those areas and you can talk to those people and say to them: &ldquo;You have something which we all envy, which the rest of the people of Ireland would envy.&rdquo; Many of us would give up all the knowledge we have of English in order to acquire the fluency that the speaker from Connemara and others have.  We would give a lot to acquire that, but we would have to become young all over again in order to get it.</P>
    <P>The first thing is for the people in the Gaeltacht, and all who have influence&mdash;and Deputies have influence &mdash;to talk to native Irish speakers and say to them: &ldquo;You have something which is of tremendous value to the nation.  As good Irish people, do not let it go.  Cherish it.  We do not want you to neglect your native language. We know you have to earn your living and some of you may have to leave the country to do so.  We do not say to you that you are not to know other languages.  Let you have five, ten or 15 languages.&rdquo;  So far as I am concerned, the more languages they know the better, provided that when they are speaking in their own country to their own people the language they will use will be the language of the country, the Irish language.  That is what we are out to do and the first thing for those in the Gaelic League, or in Comhdháil Náisiúnta, or Deputies, if they want to keep the language alive in the Gaeltacht and to help in the restoration of the language, is to get the people in the Gaeltacht to realise that they have something precious.</P>
    <P>I remember, when I was beginning to learn Irish, I went down to the West anxious to study the language there.  I met an old man there.  I had a question to ask him and I asked it in Irish.  What did he say?  I remember it perfectly well, because I got a great shock.  He said to me: &ldquo;Do you <Col N="1511" /> think I do not know English?&rdquo;  He, I suppose, thought the reason I turned to Irish was because he was a poor man and I thought it was a fit language to address to him.  That was a complete misunderstanding of the situation.  I went there to try to learn the language and my object in speaking to him was to practise speaking Irish, but this man thought that it was because he happened to be wearing a báwneen or something else that I spoke to him in the native tongue.</P>
    <P>The first thing we must do is to kill any idea in these Irish-speaking districts that the fact that they speak the language is anything but an honour. We must encourage them to realise that they ought to be proud of it.  Can we get that done?  That is our first step.  In this matter there is no difference between Parties.  If we discuss it on this side we might have the same differences of opinion about putting it ahead as Deputies would have, perhaps, on the other side. Thanks be to God there is no political Party difference with regard to this. The first thing is for all to deal with it seriously on that basis, that there is no difference.  We may as individuals differ as to what is the best way to advance, but for goodness' sake let nobody suggest that there is not seriousness on the part of those who are in favour of the language.  It is a terrible blow at any attempt to get the language back to suggest anything of the kind.  It may be said that we are not doing more, but as far as the Government, and as far as I am concerned, if I thought the expenditure of any sum of money was as a certainty going to bring the restoration of the language, I would say that it would be like winning a war, that the money should be spent on it.  The trouble is that it is not possible to ensure that the expenditure of money in any particular way is going to get with certainty the results hoped for.  You cannot be certain of it.  The sums of money which have to be spent are sometimes very large.</P>
    <P>The one thing definite that you can get after is the question of schools. There again we have the difficulty that <Col N="1512" /> many parents and, sometimes, I am afraid, some teachers nullify to a large extent the aim of the policy of teaching Irish in the schools, by suggesting all sorts of things which, I think, are not well founded.  Most of us, if we go back to our young days, could ask ourselves what we knew when leaving the primary school, and we will probably admit to ourselves that it was very, very little.  If we were to judge ourselves by the amount we had learned when leaving the primary school, we would say that we did not know very much.  The fact is that they do not realise that they have a fair knowledge of Irish.  They have learned a lot. They have a tremendous training and, as far as the secondary schools are concerned, those who have done the course have all the value that used to be said was got from study of the classics, the mental discipline and all the rest, whatever was said about it can be said of those who studied Irish in that way.  In the Gaeltacht we are trying to do that.</P>
    <P>As far as the Gaeltacht services are concerned we are trying to bring it about as quickly as we can, that the whole of the officials in the Gaeltacht will be able to talk to the people in their own language&mdash;in the Irish language.  If it is said that there are exceptions let us look at them and do our best to try to bring about changes. We are trying to secure that civil servants coming in have to know Irish &mdash;to co-ordinate it&mdash;and a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet has been set up to keep in touch with it.  It is mainly through the Department of Finance, as the Minister pointed out, that there is general government of the Civil Service.  It is through it we hope to get the necessary co-ordination, so that through the various Departments dealing with the Gaeltacht, there is an effort made to see, as far as it can be made, that they will have good example, and that there will be no excuse for anybody saying: &ldquo;We have to turn to English when dealing with these Departments.&rdquo;  We are told that it is an economic question.  It is only partially an economic question.  It is economic in the sense that those were congested areas, where conditions were <Col N="1513" /> hard, living was difficult, and the people, apparently, could not keep a high standard of life in particular areas.  The natural thing is that the moment we relieve that congestion we are taking the Irish speakers out of those areas, whether we relieve it by getting them opportunities in the cities, in industries, or whether by their going abroad.  There is no doubt that the relief of congestion means that there is a thinning of population and, to that extent, you are weakening the strength of the language in the area, because the more speakers of the language in a particular area the stronger the language naturally becomes.  That has happened.  It is not our fault.</P>
    <P>I can quite understand the Deputy saying that more could be done through Radio Eireann, but unfortunately Radio Eireann has to cater for the whole of the people of this country and if it did not they would turn the station off and listen to the English Radio.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a big question. I assure the Deputy that I thought over many times what more we could do.  It is much the same sort of remedy as that suggestion of putting a wall around the place.  It is the same type of remedy and does not get you anywhere.  What you want is to have your programmes in Irish as attractive as you can make them, so that people will listen to them in preference.  Tastes differ.  I have not had the privilege&mdash;because it is a privilege&mdash;of being reared in the Gaeltacht.  I do not know how the Gaeltacht reacts to some of these programmes, but, speaking for myself&mdash;I differ from others&mdash;I know that I would rather listen to an Irish tune than to classical music.  Perhaps that would be regarded as a musical defect.  I am perfectly certain that if our radio is heard in Scotland, and if Irish people listen in, they would listen to the Irish tunes rather than to others, though at home people are not always like that. I am speaking of places outside the Gaeltacht.  I do not pretend to interpret <Col N="1514" /> the attitude of those in the Gaeltacht in regard to that matter.  The forces against us are very strong, the newspapers, the opening up of areas by the buses, the radio, and the cinema, all these things are breaking in and, undoubtedly, help to bring in a foreign language.  What we must try to do is to get the spirit there, so that these things are not going to destroy the desire of the people to speak their own language.  We must build up strength so that the strength inside will be so great that you will be able to resist those influences.  I would ask everybody who has any interest in the language, for goodness' sake, not to suggest that those trying to restore it are not in earnest.  Anybody who suggests that the Government is fooling, pretending, or letting on, is undoing whatever efforts we are making and rendering them fruitless. What we all want to do is to teach the people to understand that the restoration of the language is vital from the national point of view, and that it is independent of Party, seeing that all Parties are combined in that desire. We may differ as to the best method. That is natural.</P>
      <P>The next thing is, when there is a Government, whatever Government is in office, and when, having considered the matter, it has a certain plan, let us all get behind it and try to make that plan as successful as we possibly can.  Let us not be pulling in opposite directions, undoing whatever is attempted.  After all, the Government of the day will have certain powers in a certain direction; it will have certain responsibilities; it will have to make up its mind what things it can do and, when it has decided on a certain course, we ought to be careful in throwing our weight against the Government in that particular direction because it will weaken the efforts and it will prevent the natural fruits from coming.</P>

    <P>With regard to the motion itself, it was a narrow motion.  The proposer when introducing it said he was not asking lots of questions, and I think he was wise, because in these questions there is room for difference of opinion. He simply wanted to know, do we <Col N="1515" /> know ourselves what is happening; next, could we do something to get the people who, if they realised what is happening, might help.  With that I am heartily in agreement.  The only thing I would be anxious about is that it should not bring about a feeling of despondency in regard to the matter. I think we can, but I agree that it is not by putting your head in the sand that we can do it.  That is not the way to do it.  I agree that we should see exactly what our difficulties are.  I think we do look the difficulties straight in the face and understand what they are but I believe, notwithstanding all the difficulties, that we can succeed over a time if we can secure only one thing, and that is realisation by the people of the value of the language and a desire on the part of the people to learn it and, on the part of those who have learned it, a desire to use it on all possible occasions.  If we can get that much we have everything.  We have the machinery.  We have still, thanks be to God, enough of the Gaeltacht in which we are able to get the language from its living source.  We have machinery now that was not there at all 20 years ago.  We have got control of the schools, control of education; we can settle the books.  Please do not make points about the spelling.  Do not, please.  It is not for the Irish speaker.  The Irish speaker does not care what way it is spelt.  He does not bother his head.  It does not matter to him in the slightest and if he is able to read it at all, anyway it is spelt he will very quickly know what the word is intended to be.  But that is not the reason.  What we are trying to do is to get a new reformed system of spelling so that when a child, or a person like myself or somebody else who is learning the language, on seeing the word once will recognise it in the same dress the second time.  I do not know whether others have the same difficulty as I have but I think it makes it much easier to recognise a person if I see him in the same dress as when I saw him on the first occasion.  That is the purpose, to try to get a common standard.  It has a lot of influence.</P>
    <P>It is a bad thing for children if they <Col N="1516" /> can spell it any old way at all.  That is bad.  It is much better to get accuracy so that there is one known way and that is right and the rest are wrong.  That is what we want to get so that there will be in regard to Irish the same standard of correctness in spelling as there is in other languages. That is the whole purpose.  I am sure the Deputy who is making points about the spelling will see that to do that is not wise.  Anything that disparages efforts that are genuinely made for the progress of the language, anything that is done like that, is giving an opportunity to those who are not very strongly in favour of the language of going in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>We accept the motion, if the Deputy would only indicate what particular way he thinks the examination could be made.  As a matter of fact, I think, at first sight, that probably the best examination would be to go over these figures again, to see the homes where the language is spoken; how many homes in which it is spoken naturally; whether isolated, in groups, and things of that sort.  Economic questions could be examined also.  I think there is touch with them.  I do not know that the setting up of a commission or starting some investigation of that particular sort would be of great value. The Gaeltacht is important but if I could systematically do it, the way in which I would preserve the Gaeltacht is by systematically tackling the Breach-Ghaeltacht around it.  It is in the Breach-Ghaeltacht around the Gaeltacht that your efforts will bear most fruit.  The older people in these places know it.  They have the right word and the right pronunciation.  The children coming home from school will be understood in these places.  That is the place in which we should make our effort, although not all our efforts, because we want it generally.  But, if there is to be concentration of effort in any particular place, it is there it should be and then if you restore the language to the Breach-Ghaeltacht you are putting a protective ring about the Gaeltacht proper, you are expanding the Gaeltacht proper and in that way you are spreading it around the country as a whole.  I believe that the one <Col N="1517" /> way of systematically tackling the language, outside the school question, is to tackle the Breach-Ghaeltacht and to put an intensive effort into these particular areas so that the language will be brought back there.  In that way you will be protecting what we regard as the Fíor-Ghaeltacht of to-day in the best possible way, you will be increasing it and gradually spreading it out.  The more you can spread the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, the greater will be the area of the Breach-Ghaeltacht around it.</P>
    <P>Personally, I welcome the motion.  I have often wondered whether it would not be useful if we could from time to time here in this House discuss these questions, provided we discuss them from a non-Party point of view, in other words, that we do not simply try to be making points one over the other, but seriously examine to see how our combined efforts could secure the success of this which is in my opinion the most important thing that the nation could turn its attention to at the present time.</P>

      <P>It is because I think that we have a responsibility to discuss these things here that I put the motion in the form in which it is but, unless we have the facts, then our discussions will flow off away from the point in the way in which, to a very large extent, this discussion has flowed on this motion.  Until the Taoiseach spoke his last few sentences I felt that the effort was completely wasted and that we were leading nowhere because I did not ask to have any particular situation in the Gaeltacht remedied; I asked to have it described by a systematic examination.  I think that is the thing on which we really ought to concentrate.  The Minister and the Taoiseach mentioned a very large number of Departments that are in systematic touch with every aspect of the life of the people there: the old age pension machinery, the Department of Agriculture through its various branches, assistant agricultural overseers and others who come in close touch with the people's lives such as the courts, the guards, teachers, home assistance officials, local officials.  From <Col N="1518" /> every aspect of man and every aspect of work you have trained officials there in touch with the people and yet the only description we get of the strength of the Irish language in these districts is the short description contained on pages 20 and 21 of the Report of the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with the Taoiseach that we do not want a commission set up to investigate this, but we surely do want an annual report as to the extent of the Irish-speaking districts and the position of the language in these districts. The teachers might fill up one particular kind of questionnaire, agricultural overseers might fill up another, people in touch with houses might fill up another.  From every point of view you can get a picture that will show you the area, but from every point of view you want an opinion as to the state of the language from the point of view of linguistic strength and from the point of view of its use.  It should not be beyond the bounds of our imagination to find out what particular type of question ought to be answered by way of report in an annual volume that will show us what that situation is.</P>

      <P>I think that except the matter is brought to our notice yearly we will not have our minds focussed on it in the way in which they should be.  The Taoiseach says this motion is for the purpose of getting information and seeing what we can get people to do about it.  I want to have information not only for the House here for public discussion but for the country as a whole.  There are many people in business, many people who visit the Irish-speaking districts for various reasons, and many people who never visit them but who are interested in the development of the language, who would be spurred to efforts in their own way by reading of the Irish-speaking districts and understanding the position there.  If we are only to review the position in the Gaeltacht every five years or every three years, that is putting it on the very long finger.  In the whole of Donegal there are only 1,790 families <Col N="1519" /> on whom the living language is dependent in that area.  In spite of what Deputy Mongan may feel about it, the figures show that there are more families with Irish-speaking children going to school in Donegal than in Galway.  Galway comes next.  But there are only 1,500 families in Galway sending to school children who have Irish.  There are 640 in Mayo, 330 in Kerry, 190 in Cork and only 79 in Waterford.</P>
      <P>With a position so attenuated as that we should have our minds challenged once a year by a very well-prepared report, documented, illustrated, diagrammed and provided with maps, because there is no doubt that there is a rapid deterioration there, no matter what anyone may say. There is a very rapid deterioration when you see that, between 1936 and 1944, families to the extent of 13 per cent. have vanished out of the picture so far as can be seen from the schools scheme.  The schools scheme gives a truer picture than you can get in any other way, although it is violently out of agreement with the statistics collected by the Gárda in 1935 and, perhaps, if they were compared, violently out of agreement with the figures provided by the ordinary census.  I think they are the only real figures that you can bank upon as showing the area and the strength of the language as the living, traditionally spoken language in those districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a serious thing that we have all to admit that the Irish-speaking districts are dwindling and that the vernacular is weakening.  I thought it <Col N="1520" /> was a mistake on my part to put that down in the motion, because I thought there might be disagreement about it. We may not like to admit it, but we cannot deal with the problem except we are realists.  If we are realists, I think we will want a picture presented in greater and more striking detail than we get from these figures.  If we got a picture presented by the various Departments, I think it would strike us in a more hopeful way than the picture we get from the educational statistics, and that many people would see signs of hope, or would see directions in which they could help in a constructive way, where other people would see nothing but things at which to be dismayed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I plead for consideration of how, in the best possible manner, the position in the Gaeltacht can be pictured and reported on in a systematic way.  That will give us a clear picture, and from a clear picture I think we will be able to derive hope. If we do not have that picture presented to us, we will allow the situation to slip in the way in which it is slipping now, and we will be all just feeling that we are fully occupied and doing right by disagreeing with one another as to what ought to be done.  The important thing is to get a picture of what the situation is and to get it early and, in the meantime, to keep on and to increase and intensify, if possible, the work that the Minister for Education described.</P>
