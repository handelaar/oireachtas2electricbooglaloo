    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has considered the advisability of having uniform control of the smaller harbours to which the Harbours Act, 1946, does not apply; and, if not, whether he will consider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ports and Harbours Tribunal recommended that small harbours should be administered by the local authorities, who have staffs experienced in management and engineering.  The public harbours to which the Harbours Act does not apply are, with the exception of the railway - owned harbours, controlled either by the Commissioners of Public Works or by the appropriate local authority.  The rates chargeable at these harbours are subject to my control under the Harbours (Regulation of Rates) Act, 1934.  Machinery is provided in the Bill whereby a harbour authority can subsequently be brought within the scope of the legislation, if such course is considered desirable.  I do not consider that there is a need for any greater uniformity of control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, having regard to the forthcoming reduction announced in the price of gas, he is now in a position to state when the Electricity Supply Board <Col N="936" /> propose to reduce the price of electric current to a more reasonable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the continued high level of costs it is not at present possible to give any indication as to when it may be practicable to effect a reduction in charges for electric current.  The revenue resulting to the Electricity Supply Board from the present charges is not producing a surplus which could be used to reduce the charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that a serious strike has existed for the past five weeks on a Minor Employment Scheme in Fermoy, County Cork; that this strike came about because the workers employed on the scheme refused to work unless they were paid weekly, as they are unable to obtain credit over a long period; that under the present system of payment the men may have to work for four weeks before they receive any <Col N="938" /> payment; and whether he will state if he is prepared to make arrangements to have these men constantly employed and paid weekly during the operation of the scheme.</P>

Two sites for houses have been acquired by the county council and revised lay-out plans were submitted to my Department last November.  These plans are under examination, and I hope to be in a position in a few days' time to communicate with the local authority regarding them.  The question of proceeding with the erection of the houses will be a matter for the local authority when the plans have been approved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the commissioners acting for the Dublin Board of Assistance will not grant outdoor relief to married men who are in receipt of unemployment benefit; that this class is worse off than those drawing unemployment assistance, who also draw outdoor relief and receive food and fuel vouchers; and whether he will direct the commissioners to grant outdoor relief to married men in receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>The grant of home assistance is a matter within the discretion of public assistance authorities.  I understand that the commissioners acting for the board of assistance have not made any order debarring married men who are receiving unemployment benefit from receiving home assistance.  Each application for home assistance is considered on its merits, and, if the circumstances indicate that such assistance is necessary for the support and maintenance of the applicant and his dependents, the assistance is given.</P>
      <P>In regard to the last part of the Deputy's question I would direct his attention to Section 5 (2) of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, which sets out that nothing in the Act nor in any Order, or instrument made or preserved by the Act shall be construed or operate to enable the Minister to direct the giving of public assistance to any individual person.</P>

      <P>The information requested in the first part of the Deputy's question is set out in a tabular statement which will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Local circumstances, which vary considerably, have an important influence on the differences in production costs.  Difficulties of access to bogs, varying depths of top-sod, the altitudes of bogs, distances from spread grounds, climatic conditions, the traditional skill of workers and also the shortage of labour in bog areas necessitating transport of labour, are factors which prevent the standardisation of county production costs on a common basis.</P>
      <P>Transport difficulties of the emergency period also have a bearing on the cost.  Where substantial quantities of turf had of necessity to be left on the bogs over the winter both quantity and condition suffered and extra expenditure on re-saving was necessary in the following spring.</P>
      <P>In comparing average costs shown on the tabular statement for each crop it should be noted that wages have been increased from between 25 to 33? per cent of the 1941 levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the Carlow County Council has decided not to cut turf this year; and whether, in view of the need for the maximum production of turf, he will urge the county council to continue to cut turf for local needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Carlow County Council has decided to obtain by contract the turf required for institutions and machinery for the coming year.  Carlow County Council does not cut turf for Fuel Importers, Limited.  I do not think in the circumstances my intervention is called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary now permitting the county council, as a matter of policy, to purchase turf elsewhere although turf could easily be cut in the county and thereby employment could be provided for many people who have been employed in turf-cutting up to the present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is probably aware that the costs of producing turf in Carlow have been extremely heavy and, as a result, Carlow County Council, on their own initiative, decided to obtain its turf by contract and gradually to reduce the amount of turf produced directly. Tenders have been issued for turf by contract and if the arrangement is not satisfactory they can reconsider the position.  They are at liberty, if they so desire, to continue with their present plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is possible to evolve some proper system of management for the cutting of turf in Carlow so that the cost of production there will bear some reasonable relation to the cost of production elsewhere.  If the scheme is managed properly, turf can be produced economically in Carlow.</P>

      <P>I received a deputation from the National Agricultural Association on the 29th March regarding the farm labour strike referred to by the Deputy.  I explained the position in regard to the settlement of wages disputes and arranged for the deputation to be received by a representative of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who fixed a meeting between employers and employees.  As already announced in the Press, work has been resumed by the employees concerned in this particular dispute and the negotiations are proceeding.</P>

Under these provisions, a suspected person may be detained for not more than 48 hours and may be required to give certain information.</P>
      <P>In the opinion of the Gárda authorities, it is important, in the working of these provisions, that accomplices of a detained person shall not be in a position, during the period of detention, to communicate with the detained person or to know what, if any, information the detained person has given or proposes to give.

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Dáil is presented with a rather serious problem when considering this amendment. There is a number of things that concern us.  The first is, what is happening inside the Department of Local Government and Public Health that, through the Parliamentary Secretary here attempts to persuade the House that it is dealing efficiently and satisfactorily with new proposals to deal effectively with public health? We are considering in Committee a Bill that was presented to the House on 15th November, 1945, which was dealt with in Second Reading on 14th or 15th December.  Now we are discussing <Col N="952" /> an amendment which, if passed, will mean that a person who has vermin in his head or on his body will not be allowed, under penalty of prosecution and the imposition of a severe fine, to come out of his home into any street, shop, church or any other place.  We are dealing with that proposal as an amendment to a measure that was introduced in November last with no proposal of that particular kind in it.  When we discussed it in September there was no suggestion that powers of that particular kind were to be sought.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as I pointed out on Friday last, the last report of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, covering the year 1943-44, was presented to the Minister in December, 1945, perhaps after if not before the discussion on the Second Reading of this Bill, which was introduced in November last.  That report was printed for circulation in this House in January, 1946.  After that passage of time we read in that report that very satisfactory steps had been taken from 1923 in an efficient and satisfactory way to deal with the disease of typhus, and the small number of cases that occurred in the country and the small number of deaths are shown in the table which accompany the report as well as the slight increase during the last three or four years of the emergency period, an increase which, nevertheless, only brought the total in 1941 to 25 cases; in 1942, to 28 cases; in 1943, to 20 cases; and in 1944, to nine cases; the deaths in these periods being two, six, five, four and one, respectively. We are told that the reason the total was pushed up to these figures was that a couple of packs of itinerant tinkers of one kind or another went wandering through the country and the last comment in the section of the report on typhus fever says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is significant that in several instances in recent years the disease has been spread by itinerants and it may be necessary to obtain more power by legislation to ensure that the standard of cleanliness amongst that class will be improved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> With such a considered report of the Department, signed in December and published in January, here on a measure which has been before the House since November we get put before us on the Committee Stage in March a proposal, not that more power by legislation will be taken to ensure that the standard of cleanliness among itinerants will be improved, but that a person who knows he is verminous shall not expose himself in any street, public place, club, hotel or shop.  That is introduced after the report says that for a number of years the disease of typhus has been, you might say, practically wiped out in this country.  It is introduced at a time when, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, science has put preventatives and cleaners into the hands of the people by which they can keep themselves clean.</P>
    <P>In the first place, I ask what has gone wrong and what is operating inside the Department of Local Government that we have had the introduction of this measure without any reference to this problem, and that we have had a report from the Local Government Department, through the Minister, published in the terms in which it has been published.  In the second place, on its merits, I want to say that this is as insidious a piece of building up the State as over-lord over the very souls of the people as could be thought of.  I do not know whether I misunderstood Deputy O'Sullivan on Friday last when he was pointing out, very properly, that if among any section of the people there was uncleanliness it was due to bad housing and poverty.  I understood him to say that until such time as the lack of cleanliness of this kind could be remedied by the erection of houses and the eradication of poverty we should subscribe to any kind of plan to keep our people clean and comfortable.  If that is his opinion, I would ask what have we come to in this country, where there is such a grabbing of power by the State to control every aspect of our economic and social life, if in respect of our personal cleanliness we pass a law, no matter how documented and no matter <Col N="954" /> how persuasive any Minister or any Party behind the Minister may be, to hand over control over our own persons and the cleanliness of our own persons into the hands of the police and the new medical constabulary that is apparently to be established in this country, the recompense being that their income will be raised to the pre-war standard of real income.  We have not heard a case for that from the Parliamentary Secretary.  The case put by the Department in its records is there in detail, with dates given.  We have not heard a word from the silent Party behind the Government as to why we should allow the police or the medical fraternity to wash our necks and to take the dirt off our shirts or out of our hair.</P>
    <P>I absolutely and utterly resist the whole suggestion and the whole of the implications in this.  If any Party or any Deputies are going to surrender on this question, then you can give up talking about asking the Government to take their hands out of your pockets or to take their hands off the control of industry or agriculture.  It is bad enough to think of allowing them to put their hands into your pockets to get the price of the D.D.T. or the carbolic soap they are going to dish out to you to clean your shirt or your neck.  The Ministry are taking power to do that, I wonder who in this House will stand behind this amendment that will give them this power over the people when their own records have shown that preventive measures were put on a basis which was scientific but simple and easy to operate and had practically wiped out typhus in this country.  The Parliamentary Secretary says: &ldquo;Typhus, typhus; deaths, deaths, deaths.&rdquo;  If the Parliamentary Secretary is asking powers for this by an amendment in March, 1946, he ought to tell us what he was thinking about when talking on the measure in December, 1945, and what the Department were thinking about when they wrote the report which is now in their hands and which has been in their hands for a couple of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The main difference between the section and the proposed new section&mdash;amendment No. 121&mdash;is that the amendment extends the provisions of Section 21 so as to include all persons.  Section 21, as originally introduced, was confined to persons under 16.  The proposed new section extends the penalties to every person who may be described as verminous, irrespective of age or sex. I should like to know what has happened in the past three months to induce the Department to regard it as necessary to extend this section to all persons, irrespective of age.  In addition, I should like to know how sub-section (1) of amendment No. 121 is to be made effective.  Sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who knows he is verminous shall not expose himself in any street, public place, club, hotel or shop.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How is that to be enforced?  There is no machinery in the proposed sub-section or in any part of the Bill, so far as I know, to make that sub-section effective.  If it cannot be given effect, why put it in the Bill?  Who is to stop a person who knows he is verminous from going into a street, a shop, hotel or any other place?  Is that person to be stopped in the street by some medical officer or by an official of the Department and examined?  If not, why put that provision in here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to a point, this is so much window-dressing.  In so far as it is not window-dressing, it is positively <Col N="956" /> dangerous.  Worse than that, it will not be effective because the Bill does not pretend to deal with the conditions out of which a verminous condition grows. There ought to be some regard for personal rights in this country.  I should like to repeat what I said on Friday, that I do not believe for a moment that any normal person goes around in a verminous state merely for pleasure. There is no pleasure in doing that.  I suppose there are in this country, as in every other country, certain persons who are so chronically lazy and dirty that, no matter what legislation was passed, and no matter what the conditions under which they lived, it would be hard to change them from an unclean into a clean state.  These people are few and far between and they are not normal, using the word in its ordinary sense.  I believe that our people are as clean as the people of any other country and that they have as great a desire for personal cleanliness as the people of any other country.  In so far as we are dealing with normal, average, people, a verminous condition is due to the shocking conditions under which many of them have to live.  I honestly believe that.  Until such time as the social conditions under which those people live are changed, no amount of legislation and no amount of D.D.T. will provide a permanent solution of the problem.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with two points&mdash;(1) what has transpired in the past three months, or what fresh information has come to him, which induced him to extend this drastic section to adults and (2) how does he propose to make effective sub-section (1) of the proposed new section?</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey has been anxiously searching for any new debating points which might emerge. When they do emerge, we had better deal with them.  The Deputy wants to know why we have extended the disinfestation provisions of the Bill to adults.  May I say that it never causes me any embarrassment to change my mind about anything.  If I am satisfied that I can do things in a better way next week than I propose to do them this week, I have no hesitation at all in adopting the better way.  Since this Bill first came before the House, I have had very close and intimate discussions with representatives of practically every shade of thought in relation to public health and social matters in this country.  I had a particularly interesting interview, lasting some hours, with representatives of the Association of County Medical Officers of Health.  Emerging from all these discussions and exchanges of views it appeared to me, as Deputy Cogan said on Friday last, that it was logical, if the louse was dangerous, and if it seemed to be necessary to get after him in the child, to get after him in the adult.  I accepted the advice I got in this matter from people who are working in that field, who have an intimate knowledge of these matters and whose particular responsibility it is to protect the people against these outbreaks of infectious diseases and to control these diseases if an outbreak should occur.</P>

He seems to think that he has got some useful debating material there.  I do not think it is of so much value to quote from that report references to <Col N="958" /> simple and easy preventive measures for the control of typhus fever.  Simple and easy preventive measures for the control of typhus fever do not necessarily refer to the measures for the prevention of lice infestation but the problems are closely related, as I stated on Friday last, so closely related that if we get rid of the louse we have an absolute assurance that we have got rid of typhus fever.  Nevertheless the reference in that report is not to ridding our people entirely of infestation.  The reference is to the measures for the control of typhus fever.  Let me read a few passages from that report that Deputy Mulcahy did not read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the new arrangements every medical officer was required, where there was any doubt as to the nature of the fever, to send blood samples for Widal and Weil-Felix tests.  In addition a previous history of any cases of undefined illness in the family (especially among children) was to be noted as highly suspicious and adequate precautions were to be taken until the true nature of the outbreak was established.  By means of this procedure early diagnosis was promptly secured in the vast majority of cases.</P>
    <P>The prompt removal of the patient to a fever hospital, a rigorous quarantine and efficient cleansing of contacts and the disinfection of clothes and premises were the next steps in the preventive machinery for controlling the spread of the disease.  The vital importance of tracing and dealing promptly with all possible contacts was stressed on every occasion because it was fully appreciated that the most thorough and complete investigations concerning contacts are essential to the successful control of any outbreak of typhus fever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now it is no harm to have that portion of the report on record side by side with the portion which Deputy Mulcahy quoted.</P>

      <P>What point does the Parliamentary Secretary make out of the portion which he quoted?  I made <Col N="959" /> some points out of the portion which I quoted.</P>

      <P>I was not aware that Deputy Mulcahy made some points. Certainly they did not get home.  The Deputy presumably tried to make points that were outside the scope of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will make his own case.  He has already made a case that got the support of the House on last Friday. Whether anything has occurred since or not, remains to be seen.  Deputies in the course of the discussion on Friday and to-day definitely suggested, and presumably are themselves under the impression, that infestation is peculiar to the poor.  They are making a very big mistake.  On every conceivable occasion the poor have to be dragged in&mdash;housing conditions, unemployment conditions, nutritional state and so on.  If it is necessary and desirable to have a debate on housing conditions, nutritional states, or unemployment conditions there are ample opportunities but these factors are of no particular relevancy in relation to the matter we are discussing now&mdash;far from it.  The occupant of the tenement in the poorest circumstances is often as clean in his person as the occupant of the mansion.  The same applies to the occupant of the cabin.  He is often as clean in his person and in his habits as the occupier of the castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will Deputies accept the scientific fact&mdash;if they do not accept it from me will they go out and consult those medical men who adopt or accept their political views and they will be told the same basic scientific fact&mdash;that dirt as such is not the cause of infestation? Lice will not breed outside the human host.  If lice are put in a corner of a room that is absolutely filthy with decaying vegetable matter, they will not live.  Lice can only live on human blood and blue blood is just as acceptable to them and as palatable to them as any other kind of blood.  It is time that was fully realised.  In fact not <Col N="960" /> many centuries ago the problem of infestation was more a problem of the wealthy and of the aristocracy than a problem of the very poor.  The louse likes comfort.  That is an accepted fact.  The more miserable the conditions are in which the louse is asked to live, the more anxious is he to get out of them.  The one thing he does not like is cold.  We have heard the case made here about people who have not a stitch of clothing to put on.  If they had not a stitch of clothing to put on there would be no lice on their bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say very shortly how they are caused at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Through breeding.  The more layers of clothes an infested person has on him, the more comfortable and warm the female louse is, the more rapidly will she produce eggs and the eggs hatch out into more lice.  The fact remains that if people stack the &ldquo;duds&rdquo; they have on them during the day on their beds at night&mdash;as Deputy Morrissey on Friday stated they did&mdash; if they are infested, the lice will reproduce.  There is no doubt that if lice get a human host on which they can remain undisturbed for a period, for so long as they do remain undisturbed, they will certainly multiply, but it is as certain as it is that I am addressing the House to-day that poverty is not a factor in this matter. Deputies will tell me about congestion, overcrowding and so on.  Commonsense will tell them that if people are herded together in close physical proximity and if there are infested people among them, the infestation will spread, but the herding in any tenement house in the City of Dublin or any cabin down the country does not approximate to the physical proximity we get when people go to the theatre, to the cinema, to a football match, to school and so on, so therefore I am afraid the case as to the influence which housing conditions have on infestation falls.  It is disappointing to the Deputies opposite because it is difficult to make a case against this section and if the points brought forward fall to the ground, the confusion becomes worse confounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> The liberty of the subject, human dignity and all the rest of it will, presumably, he paraded again.  So far we have only hinted at it, but I think we are getting close to it.  Is there anything wrong with asking people to rid themselves of lice if we present them with a certain remedy?  On Friday last, when discussing this matter, I said that no child might be seven days from school, that no child might be one day from school, that nobody might be kept at home from Mass, that the condition could be got rid of in less than seven hours.  I may have created a wrong impression.  I may have created the impression that it takes seven hours' treatment.  As a matter of actual fact, the application of the remedy will take about five minutes, and, in five minutes' time, the most highly infested person in the State can be rid of infestation.  I think it is worth trying out.  Even though, as Deputy Mulcahy says, we have not had any widespread outbreak of typhus fever, there are other diseases which I think we ought to try to eliminate which are very closely associated with this problem of infestation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What are these diseases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to them.  Let me say, before I come to that point, that I do not accept the viewpoint that even nine cases of typhus fever are not a serious matter for us in this country.  It may not be regarded as a serious matter for the people who are not affected, but it is a very serious matter for the families that are.  It may not matter much that only one person died of typhus fever in 1944, but to me it matters a lot. The death of that one person meant a lot to the family to which that one person belonged, and I do not think we can boast of the merits of our efforts to guarantee our people against the particular danger of disaster that is ever present in this country so long as a big percentage of our people remain infested.  I do not think there should be any difference of opinion on the question of taking a step which is a certain remedy, which is certain to <Col N="962" /> prevent and completely to eliminate typhus fever, if we get the co-operation of political Parties and the general public.  Let me say that outside this House&mdash;and I have discussed this problem with many people&mdash;I have not met a single individual, lay, clerical or medical, who did not say: &ldquo;It would be a good day's work for the people of the country if you can effectively rid our people of the verminous states which exist rather too widely.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I mentioned here on Friday last&mdash;I thought it would not be necessary to mention it again&mdash;that there are certain facts and figures which I would prefer not to put on record. Deputies are satisfied as to the extent and magnitude of this problem, or they are not.  If they want facts and figures, and if they insist upon them, they will have to get them, but there are certain facts and figures which have been made public, and consequently there is no embarrassment about referring to them.  I am coming now to the question of infestation in its relation to impetigo particularly, and typhus to a lesser extent.  Various county medical officer of health and the medical officer of health for the City of Dublin have recently referred to this matter and I propose to quote certain extracts from their reports of 1944.  Dr. Russell, Medical Supertendent Officer of Health for Dublin, in his report for 1944 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The increased incidence of scabies and impetigo only too frequently associated with verminous condition of the scalp, especially in girls, is one of the most disturbing features of the past four years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is of some value or it is not.  That is what Dr. Russell, Medical Superintendent Officer of Health, thinks of the position in Dublin.  Dr. Fitzgerald, County Medical Officer of Health for Kerry, in his report for 1944 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is well known that typhus fever is conveyed from person to person by lice&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Dr. McCarthy, County Medical Officer of Health for Mayo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in his report says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The position with regard to louse infestation remains the same as last year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>He then proceeds to give certain figures which I do not propose to quote</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not accurate, nor are any figures regarding infestation from any county medical officer of health accurate, because of two factors. One factor is that it is more or less a spot check, occurring perhaps once in two or three years, and to that extent is not reliable, but the figures are vitiated to a greater extent by the other factor, that, on the day of the medical inspection, it does not always happen that the most highly infested children are present.</P>
      <P>Dr. Maguire, County Medical Officer of Health for Roscommon, in his 1944 report says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;More vigorous methods, uniformly adopted everywhere, are certainly called for to prevent infestation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And listen to this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That these conditions arise from neglect, rather than from lack of amenities like piped water supply, is proved by the fact that the worst cases come from town cottages with all amenities while rural schools are often gratifyingly free.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report of Dr. Bastible, County Medical Officer of Health for Donegal, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The presence of such a degree of louse infestation is disquieting in view of the ever-present possibility of another outbreak of typhus fever, which in its epidemic form is spread by lice&mdash;both varieties, the head and the body louse, being capable of transmitting the infection.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If we can completely disregard the advice we get from our county and city medical officers of health in this matter, there would not appear to be very much point in building up the public health machine we have been boasting about so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the actual figures for <Col N="964" /> impetigo, which we discussed at some length on Friday last, I would inform the House&mdash;and particularly Deputy Mulcahy, who has been examining this matter pretty closely&mdash;that the number of cases reported by county medical officers of health in 1944 was 1,004.  I have here the numbers for the various counties, which show that, generally speaking, it is distributed pretty evenly all over the State.</P>
    <P>I do not know what I can do to convince Deputies that this is a matter on which we should have agreement, that it is a matter on which we can hope to achieve success.  I cannot do anything more than I have done.  I have been accused earlier in the debate of not contributing enough to the debate. More recently, the inclination has been to put the shoe on the other foot: some Deputies would appear to be better satisfied if I said less.  I suppose it is the old story, that no matter what I do I will be wrong.  I am trying to place all the information at the disposal of the House that can reasonably be supplied.  It is discouraging, inasmuch as the more informative I have been in the course of these discussions the less co-operation I appear to get.  It is going to be a very tedious business, if we have to continue in that atmosphere and with that type of debate until we wade our way through all these amendments&mdash;but if it has to be that way I suppose we will have to put up with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>After the speech to which we have just listened, I think the Parliamentary Secretary might spare us, for the remainder of this Bill, the little taunts about debating points. His speech was an amazing one.  He has told us in plain, blunt language that we are verminous and infested with vermin in this country, not because of our conditions but because of our nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that the conditions under which people had to live had nothing whatever to do with their being in a verminous condition, that you were as likely to find people living <Col N="965" /> in a mansion as verminous as people living in a slum.  If that is not saying we are verminous, that we are dirty by nature and not because of any need, I do not know what the statement meant at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary becomes downright dishonest in the debate.  He talked about the poor being dragged in, the suggestion being made that only the poor are infested. Neither as a Parliamentary Secretary nor speaking out of the scientific knowledge placed at his disposal, is he convincing when he takes that line.  He suggested that a person who can afford a change of clothing once a day, once a week or three times a week is as likely to become infested with lice and remain so as a person who has no change at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary's solution for that is quite a simple one &mdash;all that those who have no change of clothes have to do is to go naked, and if they go naked the lice will neither live nor breed on them.  Is that not putting in straight language what he has just tried to convey?  He spoke here last week about not giving a handle to people outside, who were fond of talking about the &ldquo;dirty Irish&rdquo;, to give us more headlines.  What is his statement just made but something which can be made use of by people who want to make use of it outside?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a family living in a mansion, having at their disposal all the amenities that go with that mansion, are infested with lice and remain so, can we say it was otherwise than because they are unclean and have no desire to be clean in their person or in their homes?  I am not dragging in the poor in the sense that the Parliamentary Secretary suggested.  I am saying that the poor are infested to a greater extent than any other section of the community, not because of their personal habits but because of the conditions under which they are forced to live; and I defy him or any of his medical advisers to deny the truth or accuracy of that.  I have here a letter I received this morning from a person living in County Dublin.  Of course, I am sure the condition of affairs described in it would not be more conducive to the breeding of lice than if those people were living in a mansion. <Col N="966" /> The writer says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of all the talk on public health and the spread of tuberculosis and infectious diseases, it is annoying that the Public Health Department should allow such conditions as exist in Back Lane, High Street, Dublin.  The four walls of my room are wringing wet, but the sanitary authority says they will dry out in the summer.  The House is walking with rats.  There is only one lavatory for the whole house. The ashbin is in the hall with all kinds of filth in it and next door to me there is a rabbit factory.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no lice in the ashbin, you may tell him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait until I finish the letter, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to tell me there is not any more likelihood of there being lice or infestation there than if those people were living in the Viceregal Lodge.  He continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We might as well have a slaughterhouse, for the smell that comes up.  You would not get worse in the lion house in the Zoo.  A friend of mine, on a visit from Australia, asked me if this was the condition under which Irish people had to live.  I told him it was not, that if we did not like to live in that way we could go to London, Birmingham or Manchester.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>People who know Dublin far better than I know it are aware that that is not a grotesque picture of the conditions under which some people have to live in Dublin.  I do not want to labour that point much further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to answer two points in particular. First of all, I asked him a specific question about sub-section (1) of this proposed new section that he did not answer, or even attempt to answer.  He may have forgotten. Secondly, I asked him what had happened in the last three months which caused him to make this radical change in the section.  What does he tell us?  He makes the astounding admission&mdash;I repeat the word astounding&mdash;whether he was conscious of the <Col N="967" /> full implication of what he was saying or not I do not know, that he made this change because, since the Second Reading of the Bill, he had consulted people who had close touch with public health business and he had a consultation with the county medical officers of health lasting over a number of hours.</P>
    <P>I am entitled to ask why these contacts and these discussions with the county medical officers of health and others did not take place before the Bill was introduced.  The extraordinary thing about this is that the Parliamentary Secretary is astounded, or pretends to be astounded, that any question should be raised on this side of the House.  He was astonished that anybody should dare oppose the Second Reading and he now admits that it was only after the Bill was introduced and had passed the Second Reading that he had those full conferences and consultations with the people in this country best fitted to advise him on the matter. We are told now that there is a big percentage of our people infested.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asks is it unreasonable that we should ask people to disinfest themselves. Is that all the Parliamentary Secretary wants in this proposed new section&mdash;authority to ask the people to disinfest themselves?  If it is, then we can pass on; that is granted freely. But the Parliamentary Secretary knows quite well that he will not be content merely with asking the people to do it.  He will not be content merely with a propaganda campaign.  He is suggesting to us that the problem is a much more difficult one than any of us supposed.  We thought that if not altogether, certainly to a large extent, this sort of infestation was due, not to the people themselves, but to the conditions under which they had to live.  Now we are told their living conditions, their incomes, their training and their amenities have nothing to do with it.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said the social conditions have nothing whatever to do with it.  You are as likely to find people infested in Merrion Square as you are in whatever is supposed to be the worst slum district in Dublin, the most overcrowded district in Dublin.  That is the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary. I do not want to emphasise that any further.  I described it as, in my opinion, the most amazing and astounding statement that could come from the responsible head of the Public Health Department.  If that is the position, then it is a very serious position and the proposed new section will make no impression on it and cannot make any impression on it.  As to the position being widespread, and embraces all sections of the community, I doubt it very much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say the Parliamentary Secretary gets more and more difficult to understand.  In his last statement everything was put aside and we began a regular hunt with the <Col N="969" /> louse, simply on its own merits.  But, nevertheless, the Parliamentary Secretary, in his discourse, had to fall back on deaths from typhus and impetigo, diseases arising out of the existence of vermin.  He implied there was something in what he read in pages 41 and 42 of the report to which I have been referring, but he did not indicate what point he wanted to make from the reference.  I say that report shows that, under the powers the Minister already had, as far as typhus was concerned, it was brought absolutely under control and that the Department considered that it would have been practically nonexistent but for the itinerant groups who had to be dealt with.  All the report suggested was that more power would be got for dealing with itinerant groups of that particular kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of impetigo, there is the rather remarkable thing that if impetigo is causing the serious concern that the Parliamentary Secretary suggests to any medical authority, we did not hear anything about it until this amendment was put forward.  The Registrar-General publishes a report annually in which he gives, for every county borough, urban district and rural district in the country, particulars of the notifiable infectious diseases.  It is remarkable that in spite of the fact that that report accounts for 25 notifiable infectious diseases, there is no reference to impetigo among them. Is it not an astounding thing that impetigo should come out of the clear blue sky now in order to help to <Col N="970" /> persuade us to give the Department authority to take us individually and keep us clean?</P>
    <P>I will suggest, as Deputy Morrissey has suggested, that it is a remarkable revelation that after the Bill was brought into the House and discussed here, the Parliamentary Secretary deigns to meet the county medical officers of health and discuss this problem with them.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was charged before with this, that he had spurned discussion with the organised medical authorities in the country before he introduced this measure.  I do not think he denied that.  At any rate, he could not have denied that some of the most important medical organisations in the country were not consulted, and we are now given the information, by implication, that the county medical officers of health, as such, were not consulted either.  As the Parliamentary Secretary himself has indicated, the more he says the less confidence we have in what he is doing.  The more we find out as regards the way in which he arrived at the point of putting this amendment before us, the better we can understand how this Bill came to be put together.  The more we see the kind of anatomy which the Parliamentary Secretary has used for building up his case, the less confidence we have in him, and the more we are opposed to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 164:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>The purpose here really is to find out what is the object of the notice required by the sub-section.  It would appear that if there is a single case of whooping cough in a school or college &mdash;say in Maynooth College&mdash;the principal of the college has there and then to compile a list of all the students or pupils, and serve it upon the medical officer, who either puts it in a basket or in the fire.  There is nothing in the sub-section to show for what object the information is required, or what is done with the information if and when it is procured.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the sub-section, that the amendment proposes to delete, is to enable the district medical officer of health to acquaint himself at the earliest possible moment with the existence of infectious disease in a school or college in his area.  There are two reasons for that.  The first and obvious reason is to ensure that he, on whom statutory responsibility rests for the control of infectious disease, will be aware of certain potential dangers in his area.  On the other hand, a dangerous position might present itself if an infectious disease broke out in a college coming up to holiday time, and if children drawn from a wide geographical area were distributed all over the country without any control.  If the disease was confined to the college in the first instance it might, in fact, be transmitted in that way to various other parts of the State.  It is true that detailed statutory provisions are not set out here, as to what the medical officer of health will do when he becomes aware, on being supplied with this list, of an outbreak of infectious disease.  In fact, the control of infectious disease, and the protection of the health of his little community is part of his statutory obligation.  In the course of our consolidating efforts in this Bill we are repealing the existing law in this regard.  Sub-section (1) of Section 58 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, dealing with this matter reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The principal of a school in which any scholar is suffering from an infectious disease shall, if required by the local authority, furnish to them within a reasonable time fixed by them a complete list of the names and addresses of the scholars in or attending at the school or any specified department thereof other than boarders.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I need not put on the records of the House the other detailed provisions of Section 58.  This is the operative one with which we are concerned.  It is proposed to repeal that sub-section and to replace it by Section 22.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment is to amend the procedure governing the delivery of notice set out in the preceding sub-section requiring the principal of a school or college in which there has been an outbreak of infectious disease to furnish a list of the names and addresses of the pupils or students attending the school or college, or any specified department thereof.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the last line might be altered.  I do not think it is fair to suggest that it is sufficient merely to leave the notice with an adult person.  Multitudes of adult persons may be around schools and colleges.  Some of them may be intelligent and competent and may realise what they undertake to do. Others may not be.  Anyone who has experience of the ordinary legal notice of summons being served is aware that it is not correct that the court always takes into consideration that the notice has not been properly served, because there is often conflict of evidence as to whether the notice has been properly served or not.  This may be only a machinery matter, but I think the amendment should be amended to provide that the notice will be served by post or delivered to the principal or some other authoritative person in the school or college.  There may be more than one member of the staff.  The sub-section is very wide, merely saying that it should be left with an adult person.</P>

      <P>I should like to direct attention to amendments Nos. 168 and 169 to the original sub-section. If the principle of these amendments were adopted, then the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment would read, in the last three or four lines: &ldquo;May be given by delivering it to such principal or by sending it by registered post to the school or college&rdquo;&mdash;and you could stop there.  If a communication is sent by registered post to the principal of the school or college&mdash;that is a system that has been adopted before in circumstances like this&mdash;it can be proved to have been delivered, because the machinery of the post office is such that a registered letter can be proved to have been delivered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue against the principle of any of the <Col N="975" /> amendments because in fact there is no great principle involved.  It is purely a matter of machinery.  Generally speaking, these things work out all right in practice.  The medical officer is in close touch with the manager or with the school teacher.  I admit right away that that does not always obtain but, generally speaking, he drops in and says: &ldquo;I will be around on such a day&rdquo;.  The registered post method is fool-proof.  It is just a little bit cumbersome. I have no rooted objection, if the House thinks it is the best way of doing it.</P>

In a very urgent matter such as we might be dealing with under this section, post, registered or otherwise, might cause delay that should be avoided.  I would favour the inclusion of the word, &ldquo;registered&rdquo;, plus something along the lines Deputy Hughes has in mind enabling a person holding a position of authority to take delivery.  I think you could tighten it up in that way by including these two suggestions.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary give me some information on one point which I am not quite clear about?  This section deals with the notification of an outbreak of infectious disease by the school authority.  What is the position in regard to an outbreak in other places where there is a collection of people, either permanently or from day to day, such as a hotel, lodging house, restaurant or cinema, or any other place where there may be a coming together of people?  I looked through the section and it does not seem to cover the point.  It may be that it is covered by some of the existing regulations, or probably it is intended to be covered by the regulations which the Minister is to be empowered to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is specifically covered in any section; but the medical practitioner who attends any case of notifiable infectious disease within the district, regardless of whether it is a private patient or a dispensary patient or what category of patient it may be, is required by the existing regulations to notify the medical officer of health of the district. At any rate that provision ensures that, if there is a doctor called in, the case must be brought under the notice of the district medical officer of health.</P>

      <P>We are making fairly wide provisions with regard to public conveyances, schools, lodging houses, etc., after the event has taken place. We have got a list of diseases which are supposed to be infectious.  In regard to quite a number of them, no medical practitioner may be called in. There is the one referred to by Deputy Mulcahy a while ago.  It is quite possible that there might be a person suffering from that disease who might not seek medical attention.  Take the case of that person being employed in a cafe, restaurant or cinema.  We are being meticulous with regard to what may happen in a house and we are protecting the incoming tenant.  Yet we are making it possible to have a number of these diseases, which many people regard as not being very serious, but which are serious from an infectious point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates that we have already covered the position of a person suffering from an infectious disease appearing in a street or public place.  Any person suffering from an infectious condition who exposes himself in any street or public place is liable to incur a penalty.  I think it would be a rather difficult matter to put the responsibility on somebody in charge of every group of persons, whether two or three or more persons, who are congregated together at work to notify the medical officer of health that a certain person engaged in that employment was suffering from an infectious condition. I am afraid it would be difficult to administer.  If we could envisage very large groups of people working together and we could name some person who could be made responsible, that might be worth considering.  But I am afraid we would encounter difficulties in the administration.  We have specific powers so far as the handling of food or engaging in the production or distribution of food is concerned. However, I will look into the matter between this and the Report Stage and, in the meantime, if the Deputy gets any further inspiration about it, perhaps he will put down an amendment which we can discuss on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where a case of an infectious disease occurs among the pupils or students attending or the other persons frequenting a school or college ...&rdquo;</P>

I am trying to get behind Deputy Coogan's mind.  He wants to delete these words: &ldquo;a probable source of infection with&rdquo; as superfluous.

      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), line 31, after the word &ldquo;disease&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and such first mentioned person has been advised or notified by a registered medical practitioner that such second mentioned person was such a source of infection as to constitute the dwelling at the time of the proposed sale or letting a danger to the health of any person who may occupy such dwelling on such sale or letting.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this amendment involves something which was not fully discussed on other sections when dealing with the words &ldquo;probable source of infection&rdquo;.  The provision deals with a person occupying a dwellinghouse who was suffering from such a disease as to <Col N="982" /> constitute that dwellinghouse a danger to the health of anybody coming in to occupy it.  The mere fact that a person who was a probable source of infection resided in the house three months before might not, of itself, render the occupation of that house dangerous to anybody coming into it.  I think that that was what Deputy McGilligan had in mind in putting down the amendment.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision, as it stands, would appear to impose on the owner of a dwellinghouse far too onerous a burden.  Under the first sub-section of the section, he is required to set out a variety of matters and give the information there specified.  It would be extraordinarily difficult for the owner of a house to give with precision the information he is required to give in this section under pain of prosecution. He has to set out not merely the situation of the dwellinghouse but the date of the commencement and termination of the period, or each of the periods, during which such person resided in the dwellinghouse while a probable source of infection.  Even a medical practitioner of considerable experience might not be able to give the information which this unfortunate house-owner who desires to sell or let his house is required to give.  The owner might not be able to state when the person occupying the premises became a probable source of infection and when he ceased to be a probable source of infection. That is far too onerous a duty to impose upon him.  Again, the owner of a dwellinghouse who desires to sell or let it has to state in his notice how the person who was a probable source of infection was, in fact, a probable source of infection.  I doubt that many medical practitioners would be able to state that in individual cases.  I do not know why such particularity should <Col N="983" /> be required in the notice.  The owner of such a dwellinghouse would have to call in not only a lawyer but a medical assessor to help him to fill in the form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The section does, undoubtedly, place considerable responsibility on a person who desires to sell or let a dwellinghouse in which, to his knowledge, a person has resided while a probable source of infection with infectious disease.  Again, it is the old story.  If he does not know that a person who was a probable source of infection with an infectious disease resided there, he does not incur any liability.  That may not be brought out sufficiently clearly.  We discussed the word &ldquo;knows&rdquo; on other sections. Evidently, Deputy Costello thinks that this is much more indefinite.  I shall have the matter looked into and see if the provision requires amendment in that regard.  If he does not know the date of the commencement or termination of infection, he ought not to incur any statutory obligation.  If he does know, I do not think that any person will quarrel with the terms of the section.  As to (d)&mdash;how such a person was a probable source of infection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, it appears to be very drastic, but we have to take very drastic powers in relation to the control of infectious diseases.  Whooping cough is regarded as a comparatively harmless disease.  It is anything but that.  The death rate from it is very high and its incidence is very high.  We must try to impose some degree of control as to the extent to which people suffering from that disease may expose themselves.  Leading them around the gas works was all right in Deputy Costello's time, but it is not sufficient nowadays and we will have to do something more effective.  I do not deny that it is drastic, but we have to take drastic steps in dealing with a very difficult situation.  That can be done only by at least having the drastic powers.  The Deputy is as well aware as I am that the very fact that you have the power is in itself an assurance that you will seldom have to use it, but if you had not the power you would be up against a very great difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This thing is not as far-fetched as it might appear. Having regard to the number of diseases brought within those sections, it is easy enough to say that a person can get an ambulance or a private car, but in practice the position is quite different.  Let us take a case that <Col N="994" /> could quite easily happen.  Suppose a traveller, whose home is normally in Dublin and who happens to be in the West, or in Donegal, Clare or Kerry, becomes a victim of one of these diseases.  That man, not only for family reasons, but for other reasons, may be very anxious to get back to Dublin in order to get treated.  Some of us who have had to hire cars, not to speak of private ambulances, know what it would cost that man to get a vehicle to bring him, say, from Donegal, Kerry, Roscommon or Sligo, to Dublin.</P>
      <P>Of course, the local medical officer has all the powers.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he had unlimited powers.  He will decide to put that man into the local institution, whether or not it is suitable.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that some of the institutions that we have in the country are not adequate to meet the cases of people who want voluntarily to go into them, and they are likely to have less adequate accommodation when this Bill becomes law. It is not a question of raising objections, but there is a very definite possibility of extreme hardship under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should appreciate the normal reaction in a case of that sort. Supposing a man from the City of Dublin is in the West of Ireland, the normal reaction is &ldquo;He is not a patient of ours; he is a stranger&rdquo; and they might not bother too much about him. I suggest, if it is necessary to be as drastic as the Parliamentary Secretary proposes in the section, he ought to put a specific responsibility on the local authority to send that patient home.  It is not good enough to leave him to the tender mercies of any individual who may or may not treat him properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say what provision is made for a patient who comes between the type of patient who is able to pay for himself and the public assistance patient?  In the normal way the patient with reasonable means comes along and the public assistance <Col N="995" /> authority will say that he is able to make adequate provision for himself. But, while the person suffering from an infectious disease might be normally able to pay whatever costs are involved, the cost of transport from a remote part of the country to Dublin or <i>vice versa</i> might be far above his capacity.  In such a case the public assistance authority might consider that he was able to pay for himself, but he would find himself unable to do so.  Is there any provision made in such a case for the cost of his transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary course a patient suffering from infectious disease will be isolated in an institution in the area in which he contracts the disease, or at least in the area in which the attention of the medical officer of health has been brought to his condition.  If, in a rare case, there is a possibility that he is caught out away from his own native place and in the area of jurisdiction of another local authority, there is provision, if he is a poor person, for that other local authority to transfer him to an institution under the control of the local authority of his native area.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised the question of a person who might not be entitled to medical assistance under the Public Assistance Act, or might not appear to be and yet would not be in a position to pay out of his own resources the full cost of transport from the area in which he is caught out to his own native heath.  That, too, is covered by the Public Assistance Act inasmuch as there is not any limitation to the patient's economic circumstances. If a person is so circumstanced <Col N="996" /> that he cannot out of his own resources pay any of the cost involved in his treatment under that Act, the local authority comes to his rescue.  The local authority is not bound to pay the full cost.  A person may be able to contribute a share of the cost but the determination of that matter is one that rests with the local authority, as to whether the whole cost should be borne out of the rates or only a portion.</P>

There is a very wide gap between the person who qualifies for a red ticket and the person who can afford to pay the present-day rates for an ambulance. It is all right for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that the local authority may or can do this, but he knows quite well that in practice the local authority will not pay £12 or £20 for an ambulance.</P>

That is why they are increasing the rates; every local authority in the country has increased the rates this year.  But even that may not be enough to meet the Parliamenary Secretary's requirements.  However, that is beside the point.  I am talking about what the Parliamentary Secretary knows as <Col N="997" /> well as I do&mdash;how these things work out in practice.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that if a person is suffering from an infectious disease away from home, he is clapped into the local institution and the local authority&mdash;in this case the county manager&mdash;is satisfied when it does that, that it is doing its duty and it will not go to the expense of sending that person 100 or 150 miles, as the case may be</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If we remember that this is a Public Health Bill, and try not to score petty political points, we may get further with it.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows just as well as I do what the mentality of a local authority is with regard to expenditure of this kind.  The question at issue is not whether I want this made mandatory or not.  Take the case of a person who normally resides in the City of Dublin, and who goes to the country on a Monday morning and remains there until Friday night or Saturday morning, as, for example, many commercial travellers do.  If such a person should be so unfortunate as to contract any of these diseases, the first thing he will want to do will be to consult his own medical adviser in the City of Dublin.  The second point is that there would be far more facilities for dealing with that particular disease in the City of Dublin than there would be, say, in a remote <Col N="998" /> country town.  Therefore, that person's first reaction will be to try to get to Dublin as quickly as he can.  If he finds that he cannot get back except he travels in a particular way, then he is going to take measures of his own to get back, and these may result in doing more harm than good.  I am putting that case because I can see a case of the kind happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, following the case put by Deputy Morrissey, the matter boils down to this.  Take the case of a man who goes to the West and who, let us say, contracts typhoid.  In such a case the choice that you are left with, if you are going to do anything, is this: either to provide transport to send the person back to his place of origin, or allow him to travel by train or public bus, the risk in the latter case being this, that he may infect everybody else in the bus.  The point, therefore, for the House to consider is whether there should be a mandatory provision on a public authority requiring it to provide the necessary transport for such a person, or whether the situation should be left open with the powers that are already there under the Public Assistance Act.  I think that is the net question before the House. The House is faced with a choice of evils.  The question is, are you going to put in an explicit provision requiring the public authority, if a man, say, contracts typhoid in one of the western counties, to provide transport to have him transferred back to his area of origin?  I can see difficulties in connection with a provision of that nature, and quite obviously Deputy Morrissey sees a difficulty in it, too.  On the other hand, is it sufficient, with the powers that are there at the moment, just to let matters take their course, and trust to the way that these things do work out?  Personally, I would advocate the latter procedure.  I think it would be dangerous to put in a definite, explicit and mandatory provision requiring every infected person to be transferred back to his area of origin.  Apart from anything else&mdash;I am not speaking on this with any medical knowledge&mdash;it would appear to me that it would not <Col N="999" /> be a good thing to transfer the focus of infection from the area where it contracted the disease to another area with the remote possibility, but yet the possibility, that it is going to act as a focus there.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the Deputy does not understand the point that was made from this side of the House.  There is nothing in dispute between us so far as typhus or typhoid is concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary has admitted that these cases will be isolated right away in the local institution nearest to the place where the person contracts the disease.  What we are thinking of is the case of the man who has whooping cough, or some of those other diseases, in which case the medical officer decides that he cannot go home and is to be isolated there.  In other words that man is told by the medical officer that his freedom is to be restricted, and that he cannot use a public conveyance to get home.  What we are suggesting to the Parliamentary Secretary is that if that man is permitted by the medical officer to go home, then it ought to be made mandatory on the local authority to provide a conveyance to enable him to do so. One must have sympathy with the man who finds himself a long way from home and is ordered by law not to use a public conveyance to get home.  He is told that he must restrict his movements. What we are suggesting is that there ought to be some responsibility on the local authority to provide a conveyance to enable that man to be conveyed to his home.</P>

      <P>While I have every sympathy with the Deputy's point of view, I still think he must admit that where, for example, you are dealing with a case of typhus, or any of these other diseases, it means that you must go further into subdivisions.  In the end, you get lost in detail.  Would it not be better to work under the permissive powers that are already available under the Public Assistance Act rather than attempt further subdivisions?  I think that, if anything, we have been tending to go too far in the direction of legislating in detail.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should remember that the person suffering from typhus or typhoid is immediately put into a local institution. We are speaking of the case of a man suffering from whooping cough or some of those other diseases.  He contracts the disease when he is in the country on business.  He is staying in a hotel and is anxious to get home. He is forbidden to travel in a public conveyance, and it may be that he cannot afford to continue staying in the hotel.  I think that when you restrict a man's movements in that way, and deliberately prevent him from using a public conveyance, it is reasonable to ask that provision should be made to enable him to get home.</P>

If he cannot afford to remain in the hotel, and if he is not allowed to move around and cannot return to Dublin by a public conveyance, then, I am afraid, he will take the risk of travelling by a public conveyance and render himself liable to a fine of £50 or three months' imprisonment.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of putting down the amendment is to draw attention to the possible hardships which might be inflicted on the unfortunate sufferers of various kinds of disease if the wide scope of the section were permitted to stand.  The action of the Parliamentary Secretary in indicating to the House the list of diseases which are to apply in respect of Section 27 has removed to a considerable extent the objections that I had to this sub-section. The only matter I would emphasise is that these diseases, which are within the ambit of Section 27, should be specified in the Act or in the Schedule to the Act.  While we, of course, accept the Parliamentary <Col N="1001" /> Secretary's word that the list which will be circulated will be a comprehensive one as far as he is concerned, under the existing circumstances of diseases to which the section will apply, nevertheless another Parliamentary Secretary might take a different view, or medical advisers to other Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers might take a different view and the House would have no control over diseases brought within the scope of the section.  The only other matter that arises is, as to the absolute necessity of bringing into this section such diseases as whooping cough and erysipelas.</P>

      <P>I do not press my views about erysipelas.  I think it might be a contagious disease.  If the Parliamentary Secretary says that he has received expert advice I am prepared to accept it.  I am not so sure that he will find it easy to persuade mothers, whose children have whooping cough, from bringing them to Bray or in a bus to the gas works at Ringsend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to undertake to have the diseases included under different sections of the Act set out in the Schedule, for the reason that that would give an appearance of permanence.  I rather think experience will establish the need for modifying this from time to time.  We will have to be guided in this matter by the experience we gain, and particularly by people who are trying to operate this Act.  Diseases that come within the scope of certain sections in the provisional list I furnished, may, in fact, at a future date be included, or perhaps be transferred <Col N="1002" /> from the operation of one section to that of another section.  That is inevitable, because of the advance of medical science, and the additional knowledge regarding these diseases that is from day to day coming to our notice.  The best arrangement for dealing with a schedule of diseases to which the different restrictive sections will apply is either to have them declared by Order, and to have the Order laid on the Table of the House or published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I have no fixed idea about that.  I am largely in the hands of the House.  I think the House is in favour of having the Order placed on the Table of the House.  That procedure will enable the House from time to time to have the opportunity of discussing the propriety of bringing certain diseases within certain sections. It will also give machinery easy to operate for changing the schedule of diseases from time to time.  It will be quite a considerable time before there is a final and firm decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These schedules are merely for the general guidance of the House, and need not be regarded as firm.  The first firm schedule will be when the Bill comes into operation.  A schedule of the diseases to which the various sections apply will be placed on the Table of the House.  In the meantime, I suggest to Deputies interested that they should invite the views and the criticism of people outside, particularly medical people, and ask them to forward these views to us for consideration before a final determination is reached.  All that will be useful. We can at any time change one disease from a particular schedule to a different schedule, or perhaps take it out of all the schedules, unless the schedule listing the infectious diseases. There are diseases that are relatively harmless from the point of view of mortality, but it is necessary to list them as infectious, and make them notifiable, in order that we can keep in touch with their spread and geographical distribution.  Deputies need not have any uneasiness as to the manner in which this section or any other part of the Bill will operate. There is no purpose or intention behind <Col N="1003" /> this measure other than to safeguard health, and any suggestions of any sort that are of a helpful nature will be always welcomed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), line 47, before the word &ldquo;care&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;medical or nursing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to get a clarification as to the class upon whom the duty indicated will be imposed by the sub-section.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person having the care of another person and knowing that such other person is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease to which this section applies shall not permit such person to enter</P>
      <P>(a) any public conveyance used for the conveyance of passengers at separate fares, or ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Take the obvious case of a parent and child, or a doctor or a nurse in charge of a patient upon whom the section imposes responsibility.  It is difficult to say what other class of persons shall have such duty imposed upon them.  There have been cases under the Public Health Acts where even medical men have been charged with offences of exposing persons with infectious disease in public places and the courts took the view that it was very difficult to say when a person would be in the charge or care of another person, at least, if that patient or sufferer from infectious disease was an adult person with full possession of his faculties, to what extent any other person has any right to restrict his freedom of movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The sub-section sets out that a person having the care of another person and knowing that such other person is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease to which the section applies shall not permit such other person to do certain things.  Under the Deputy's amendment the only persons who would be under this obligation would be the persons having medical or nursing care <Col N="1004" /> of another person.  Such a restriction would not meet the purpose of the section.  It would completely exempt the parent or guardian.  In fact, it would give the section very limited application.  If there is ever any question as to who in fact has the care of another person within the terms of this sub-section it will have to be determined in court; there is no other way of doing it.  The parent would have charge of his child but, if the child were, say, in a school, the teacher or headmaster or president of the college, might be the person in charge of the child for the time being.  Similarly, a person might contract an infectious disease in another institution.  The person in charge of that other institution would be the person who would be responsible, knowing the person was suffering from infectious disease, for seeing that certain precautions for the protection of the public would be taken, one of the precautions being that the person suffering from the infectious disease would not enter upon a public conveyance.  While there may be difficulty, and possibly would be difficulty, in giving an explicit definition of the classes of persons who would be included in the category of persons having the care of another person, to confine it to medical or nursing would be so restrictive as to render the sub-section almost useless.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Hughes, I move amendment No. 45:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (5), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A person who is a probable source of infection can with the written consent of a registered medical practitioner enter a public conveyance and travel thereon and a registered medical practitioner can exercise his discretion on the issue of such written consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes, apparently, thinks that there might be a stage of a particular <Col N="1005" /> disease at which it would be possible for a person suffering from the disease to enter a public conveyance without danger of spreading the disease.  The amendment seeks to provide that if such person is armed with a permit from a registered medical practitioner, he should then be in a position to go on the public conveyance. There does not seem to be any great objection to this amendment.  If a medical practitioner gives a permit to a man to go on a public conveyance then the permit ought to run in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no great objection to the principle in this amendment but there is objection to the actual machinery proposed.  Under this amendment a person who is a probable source of infection could, with the written consent of a registered medical practitioner, enter a public conveyance. That may seem all right and appear quite reasonable on superficial examination.  I do not want to say anything very critical of the freedom with which general medical practitioners sometimes issue certificates but I want to make this point, that in regard to the control of infectious diseases there is a special statutory obligation on medical officers of health that is not on the general medical practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an epidemic of a deadly infectious disease occurs in a district, perhaps with fatal consequences in a number of cases, it is the medical officer of health of the district who will have to accept responsibility and face public criticism for the fact that the disease has appeared at all in his area and for the consequences of its appearance. Consequently, while I could not accept the amendment in the form in which it appears, I would see no objection to substituting &ldquo;a medical officer of health&rdquo; for &ldquo;a registered medical practitioner&rdquo;. It would seem reasonable that if the medical officer of health was satisfied that there was no particular danger involved in allowing a person to travel by bus, such a certificate would issue but, if such certificate is to be accepted at all, I think the onus of issuing it ought to be put on the <Col N="1006" /> man who is responsible for the preservation of the public health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3).</P>
      <P>The reason we put down this amendment was not that we felt an individual suffering from an infectious disease was not a danger to other persons travelling, but rather because we felt that the section as at present drawn is entirely unworkable and is calculated to place rather serious burdens on the individuals in charge of the public conveyance. There are, for instance, bus conductors and, in a lesser degree, railway guards.  I was interested in Deputy Costello's amendment a moment ago, but I did not like to intervene as he was getting on so well with the Parliamentary Secretary. My understanding of the law so far as a person suffering from infectious disease is concerned is that already provision is made in the law for such a person to travel provided he can be isolated.  The difficulty I saw in that amendment was that it was unworkable from the point of view of certain conveyances in regard to the matter of isolation.</P>
      <P>The point we have in mind in regard to this is the unworkability of the sub-section as it stands at present because of the difficulties for individuals like conductors.  How are they to know that an individual is a probable source of infection?  What will be the source of their knowledge?  How does the Parliamentary Secretary expect them to act?  We have put down an amendment deleting the sub-section for the purpose of getting information.</P>

      <P>There is one aspect of this sub-section upon which I should like to get some information. I should like to know what is the position of private ambulances under this sub-section.  I take it that they are public conveyances in the sense that they can be hired by anybody <Col N="1008" /> paying the necessary charge.  How will they be affected by this sub-section? It seems to me that they will be excluded under this sub-section from carrying any person suffering from an infectious disease.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with Deputy Morrissey's point first, so far as I am aware, a private ambulance is not operated on a system of separate fares. It is unusual.  I think, for a private ambulance to convey more than one patient at one time.  I think it would be a rare occurrence.  With regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's difficulty in relation to this sub-section, I cannot just follow it.  The sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The person in charge of a public conveyance used for the conveyance of passengers at separate fares shall not convey therein a person whom he knows to be a probable source of infection with an infectious disease to which this section applies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is the old story over again.  If he does not know that the person is suffering from an infectious disease to which the section applies, he is not under any statutory obligation.  There has been a good deal of misunderstanding and a good deal of misrepresentation about this section, more outside the House than inside.  On the 9/3/1946 an article appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> from somebody called &ldquo;Civis&rdquo; on this very matter.  I do not know anything about this gentleman except that he is paid, apparently, to write this type of misrepresentation I suppose in the hope that it will do some damage to the Government.  It could not have any other purpose behind it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Deputy to the subject matter of this article written by a man, who, presumably, was paid to write it, and the Deputy will have to draw his own conclusions as to what the particular object was.  Why the <i>Irish Times</i> or any other newspaper that calls itself <Col N="1009" /> Irish, or even the foreign Press for that matter, hate our native institutions so intensely that they present their readers with this type of misleading propaganda is entirely beyond me.  The writer says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Even the bus conductor and railway guard are to be penalised should they incur the Minister's displeasure. Giving the Minister the right to say what diseases may be deemed to be &lsquo;infectious&rsquo;, the Bill (Section 28) proceeds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;The person in charge of a public-service vehicle used for the conveyance of passengers shall not convey therein a person who he knows to be a probable source of infection&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on to ask the question that some people are asking in the House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;How, one asks, is the busy conductor or guard to &lsquo;know&rsquo; (a) what are infectious diseases, and (b) who is an infectious person?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If he does not know this already, there is no harm done.  The point is that if he does know it we expect him to act the part of a good citizen.</P>

He is really amused; he is enjoying himself, the old rascal:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These, and other, of the Bill's provisions, no doubt, may be dismissed as unimportant, or merely amusing.  Nevertheless they are significant of the mentality that inspires the whole measure, and of the obvious intention to endow a Minister with arbitary powers that extend from the design, construction and management of hospitals to the design of bathing costumes.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently he did.  I want to show that perhaps he did not understand it as well as he pretended. The man who wrote that article would surely have been expected to have acquainted himself with the law.  He is terribly surprised, he is amused, he is chortling to himself at the provisions we are making in this measure.  Bear in mind that we are repealing certain provisions.  He did not draw the attention of his readers to that.  We are repealing certain provisions that make this specific provision.  This propagandist apparently never heard of that.  He took very good care that his readers would not hear anything about it, at any rate.</P>
      <P>In the light of the misrepresentation regarding this section that has gone abroad, I must have set out on the records of the House the powers that have been embodied in the law and operated in this country in regard to this particular matter over a long number of years; that are operating to-day and that would continue to operate if we did not repeal them in our co-ordinating measure.  Section 143 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every owner or driver of a public conveyance shall immediately provide for the disinfection of such conveyance after it has to his knowledge conveyed any person suffering from a dangerous infectious disorder, or any bedding, clothing, rags, or other things which have been exposed to infection from such disorder ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If he fails, he shall be liable to a penalty.  He shall provide for disinfection; so much for that.  Then there are Sections 63 and 64 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907.  Section 63 states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The owner or driver of a public vehicle within the district of the local authority used for the carrying of passengers at separate fares shall not knowingly convey, or any other person shall not knowingly place, in any such public vehicle a person suffering from any infections disease, or a person suffering from any such disease shall not enter any such <Col N="1011" /> vehicle, and every person who shall offend against this section shall for every such offence be liable to a penalty not exceeding 40 shillings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the law.  That is the provision which has been in operation for the prevention of the spread of infectious disease in this particular way.  Those are the statutory restrictions on the owners and drivers of buses and all persons suffering from infectious diseases who enter those buses. Further, those provisions applied not to selected lists of infectious diseases, as will be the position in future, but to all infectious diseases&mdash;major and minor.  Deputies may tell me that those provisions have not been operative. The fact is that they were operative, as most of the provisions of the public health law were operative, but only a very limited section of the community were affected.  Consequently, only a very limited section of the community are aware that such a law exists.</P>

      <P>The drivers were under a statutory obligation not to carry persons suffering from infectious disease. Even in the Deputy's time, they did not carry them.  He wielded all those powers.  Let me quote Section 64 (1) of the same Act:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any person suffering from any infectious disease is conveyed in any public vehicle within the district of the local authority, the owner or driver thereof as soon as it comes to his knowledge shall give notice to the medical officer and shall cause such vehicle to be disinfected, and, if he fails so to do, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds, and the owner or driver of such vehicle shall be entitled to recover in a summary manner from the person so conveyed, or from the person causing that person to be so conveyed, a sufficient sum to cover any loss and expense incurred by him in connection with such disinfection.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of the same section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" />&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the local authority when so requested by the owner or driver of such public vehicle to provide for the disinfection of the same....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the light of that, I wonder how old &ldquo;Civis&rdquo; got so much enjoyment out of the innocent-looking provision in the Bill, seeing that we are repealing all these extensive powers and substituting those in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Because we are co-ordinating the law.  Time and again we have been twitted regarding the difficulty, which even lawyers experience, of determining what the law is at present, because it consists of a stack of amendments which would be a couple of feet high if piled one upon another.  One enactment amends another enactment, so that the ablest lawyer in the country, as has been demonstrated in the course of this discussion, does not know what the law is at the present time.  We are trying to co-ordinate the law.  We are repealing 15 Acts and amending 11 others, and that particular line of criticism will not be open when we get a couple more of these Public Health Bills through the House.  It will be a tedious process, but it will be worth the trouble.  There was a similar state of confusion regarding our lunacy law.  We co-ordinated that law, but, if we did, we did not divest ourselves of all the powers we had in regard to the control of mental diseases or the persons suffering from mental diseases. We had a similar inheritance in the poor relief code and we co-ordinated the law in that regard.  We introduced a Bill repealing all the old legislation, but, if we did, we had to substitute something for it.  If we drop some provisions in the British law dealing with the control of infectious disease, we have to provide ourselves with some effective machinery in lieu of those provisions.  Deputies had a bad case against this sub-section, but they approached it very cautiously.  Old &ldquo;Civis&rdquo; made a fool of himself.</P>

      <P>I read less important newspapers.  I look on this question mainly from the point of view of the public servant whom I regarded always with deep admiration and respect, that is the bus conductor or the guard on the railway train.  We all know that the duties of a bus conductor or a guard are very onerous.  They have got not only to keep a check on the number of passengers but to carry out a number of other duties.  That is particularly true in the case of a bus conductor.  He has to carry out a number of important duties and to keep the details of these duties in his head.  He has to keep a time table of the speed at which the bus travels, the number of passengers on board and a number of other particulars and it would be placing an unjustifiable burden on him to have him converted into a sort of medical inspector who has to determine whether certain passengers are suffering from infectious disease or not.  Under this section, which is very vague, the bus conductor <Col N="1015" /> is confronted with a choice of two evils.  If he suspects a would-be passenger of being a carrier of infectious disease, he has two alternatives. He may refuse that intending passenger admission and if he does, he may be open to legal proceedings for having so refused that passenger.  It is a very serious thing publicly to accuse a person of suffering from infectious disease.  It is a matter which would very seriously affect a bus conductor if brought into court and proved.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if he carries such passengers he may be open to proceedings for having done so.  The obligation is placed on him to try to prove that he did not know the person was suffering from an infectious disease. It may be very difficult to prove.  I think in fairness to transport companies, and particularly to the officials of the transport companies, this section should be deleted.  There is already in the Bill an obligation placed upon persons suffering from an infectious disease not to travel.  I think that obligation should be sufficient to safeguard the public interest without placing this additional obligation upon a bus conductor or a guard on a train.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary himself appreciates the fact that this sub-section will be unworkable in many cases.  There is a case in which it can be worked absolutely rigidly, and that is in the case of an ambulance worked under public authorities.  I am not making any accusation, because I have not sufficient facts, but I should like to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that, say, an ambulance attached to a sanatorium, is used exclusively for the conveyance of tuberculosis patients, and that it is not the case that an ambulance attached to a county hospital, a cottage hospital, or other district institution is used for conveying tuberculosis patients or patients having any other type of infectious disease to or from a sanatorium for the purpose of X-ray. The majority of cases in a county hospital are not infectious, but there may be some cases where a patient who is known to be suffering from tuberculosis while in the county hospital or district <Col N="1016" /> institution is conveyed to the sanatorium and when that is found out the necessary fumigation or disinfection is carried out immediately.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could reply briefly on that point, because the conveyances used by public authorities are rather numerous, and I should like to have an assurance from him that ambulances from the ordinary institutions are not used to convey patients to and from a fever hospital or to any of the tuberculosis sanatoria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that one of the difficulties we are up against in dealing with this section is a lack of logic on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary.  A short while ago I asked the Parliamentary Secretary for some information regarding the position of persons who might be suffering from infectious disease and who might work in places frequented by the public.  He went the length of pointing out that it would not be fair to place this responsibility on the owner of a factory, or a restaurant, except in regard to the section dealing with the handling of food.  He relieves, say, the owner of a café from any responsibility in regard to one of his employees suffering from an infectious disease and letting the public come in and associate with that person.  In that case, we are dealing with the owner of the business who may be personally present and very often is.  We rely on the medical officer to deal with the case through the ordinary channels and to take the necessary precautions.  Yet when we come to deal with public conveyances we have the owner who may not see the conveyance from one week end to the other, put under very serious obligations that do not apply in the <Col N="1017" /> case of the owner of the premises to which I have referred.  I quite agree that where the owner of a public conveyance realises that a person is suffering from infectious disease the provisions of sub-section (5) should apply, and that would hold also where a person conveying a passenger knows that that particular individual is suffering from an infectious disease but why do we make an allowance in the case of the owner of a café or a factory when in many cases the owner is available on the premises to observe the type of people coming in and going out, while we are so rigid in the case of an owner of a public conveyance who, as I say, never sees that conveyance for a long period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of the obligation placed on the particular person in charge of the conveyance, in the list which the Parliamentary Secretary supplied to us regarding the diseases which will be listed under Section 28, we have a peculiar position.  We are dealing with ordinary workers.  They are not very familiar with legislation as it passes through the House but I presume there will be a certain responsibility on owners of vehicles and other bodies running public conveyances to convey the terms of the Bill to their employees in so far as they affect their duties.  As to the two groups of diseases, one of them is included, and the other excluded.  We have the peculiar position that unless the conductor or the guard or other responsible person is fairly familiar with the provisions of this section, after it becomes law, it is quite possible that he may make a very grave mistake, a mistake from which the court may not relieve him of responsibility.  Amongst the diseases to which the section will apply is whooping cough.  I wonder how many citizens regard whooping cough as being infectious, seeing that in everyday life a great number of children are to be found frequenting public places while suffering from this complaint. How many people are able to distinguish between an ordinary cough and whooping cough?  I believe that quite a number of laymen would be in doubt as to whether a cough was whooping cough or not.  Supposing a child is <Col N="1018" /> brought into a bus and starts a fit of coughing, and the conductor decides that the child is suffering from whooping cough, and requires the mother to take the child off the bus.  The mother subsequently sues both the conductor and the company and is successful. What is the position of the conductor, who proceeded on the basis that he knew that it was a case of whooping cough and that, therefore, the child should not be allowed on the conveyance?</P>
    <P>In the section under which certain diseases are excluded, we find scabies, ringworm and impetigo listed as diseases which are not affected by the section.  Most laymen, merely on the basis of their general knowledge of diseases, would regard these three as far more infectious than those listed in the first section and would regard a person suffering from these skin troubles as being in greater need of isolation and of being prevented from using a public conveyance than a child suffering from whooping cough.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious to get a section which will be workable and all anxious to see that people who use public conveyances will be protected, but at the same time I do not think it is fair of us either to retain powers provided in an older Act which will raise difficulties for the men or women who have to operate the section in relation to public conveyances, or to put sections into this Bill which will not be workable. If we can find a middle way which will achieve what the Parliamentary Secretary wants which will be workable and which will not be unfair to persons either owning or in charge of public vehicles, all sides of the House will be anxious not only to see such powers inserted in the Bill but to support the Parliamentary Secretary in his request for their inclusion and application.  It seems to me, however, that there are a number of anomalies in the section which require further consideration and to which the Parliamentary Secretary should apply his mind, either now or before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Corish as to the conveyance <Col N="1019" /> of tuberculosis cases or other infectious disease cases in local authority ambulances from the county home or county hospital to a sanatorium, I might first point out that only a proportion of persons suffering from tuberculosis are in fact infectious.  The Deputy probably knows already that tuberculosis is not infectious, unless the patient is what doctors call sputum positive, unless the actual germs which cause the disease are being exhaled or expectorated in the sputum.  So far as the general body of tuberculosis patients is concerned, only a proportion would be deemed to be infectious at all, but if such infectious cases, or any other infectious cases, were transferred from one institution to another, or in fact if a local authority ambulance were used in an emergency for the conveyance of infectious cases&mdash;the ambulance which would ordinarily be used for the conveyance of patients suffering from non-infectious conditions &mdash;the ambulance would be thoroughly disinfected before being put into use again.  The most explicit instructions have been issued by my Department in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is an ambulance which is used exclusively for the conveyance of tuberculosis patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were being used for the conveyance of any other infectious case, the ambulance would be disinfected after every journey, because the infectious disease carried in it to-day might be different from the infectious disease carried in it the next day, and, consequently, you would be taking a very serious risk of giving your patient another disease in conveying him to hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin suggests that since cafés, hotels and other institutions where people congregate are not specifically included within the restrictions of the Bill, we should not include bus conductors.  Very few Deputies have pleaded with me in the course of the debate for a further extension of the scope of the Bill, and I will be prepared to consider that suggestion.  I am glad to have some support for a <Col N="1020" /> further extension of its scope and I will consider the point between this stage and Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is feasible.  A café is not in the same category as a public service vehicle, but we need not argue that at the moment. I think I have said all that can usefully be said on the principles involved in this amendment, and have said it pretty often.  Once again, I should like to emphasise that if the owner or driver does not know that a person is suffering from an infectious disease, he is under no obligation.  I cannot agree with the Deputies who are pressing this amendment to deprive the Minister of this statutory power.  He has had this power in a much more extended form since the institutions of Government were set up in this country.  If they have not been brought prominently to the notice of the public, if there have not been a number of prosecutions that would stamp these powers on the minds of the public, it is because of a realisation of the fact that these powers were there, and having them there is in itself a guarantee that certain care will be exercised in this serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still at a loss to know why there should be so much pressure in the course of the discussion designed to divest the Minister of powers in relation to the control of infectious diseases which he has at present.  It is as clear as noonday that if we had not bothered to try to co-ordinate the law at all, if we had merely come to the House and asked for the new provisions we deemed to be necessary, a very small Bill would have been sufficient and we would have had considerably less discussion. Notwithstanding the fact that we have these powers and have had them for the past 23 years or so, and that our predecessors in office had them and operated them, we are now being asked to surrender them, and not on the plea that they have been abused, because that suggestion has not been made.  I still cannot understand what the reason for it is.  Why should we not have unlimited powers in relation <Col N="1021" /> to the control of infectious diseases? Why should we not have, at any rate, all the powers our predecessors enjoyed? Why should we not have all the powers a foreign Government enjoyed in this country in relation to the control of infectious diseases, and why should we be deprived of the powers we ourselves have had for the past 14 years and have never abused?</P>

When he can convince this House &mdash;and might I assure him we are open to be convinced&mdash;on this particular point, we will be only too glad to assist.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 50, to delete Section 58 (i) (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage, I drew attention to the severe injustice on a person whose land adjoined a plantation if he were compelled to rid his land of rabbits or vermin and, in the event of his failing to do so, he were compelled to allow the Minister to send in his employees to do the work and, having done it, if the Minister were to have power to collect from that farmer the cost of clearing the land.  I was contending that, if this power were given to the Minister to recoup himself at the expense of the adjoining landowner for any expense he might incur in getting rid of the vermin, then the adjoining landowner should have the right to claim compensation from the Minister for any damage which foxes or other vermin on the State forests might do to the farmer.  The Minister indicated that he would like to look into the whole matter.  I also have looked into it and so far as I can see it would be very difficult to frame an amendment which would enable the landowner to recover compensation <Col N="1023" /> from the Department for the damage.</P>
    <P>I can well understand the difficulty there would be in enforcing such a provision and, on reconsideration, I think that the only fair and just way out of the difficulty would be for the Minister to drop his particular sub-section and divest himself of the power to regain compensation.  If that particular sub-section is dropped, I think the section will not be open to any serious objection by such landowners.  If his lands are infested by foxes, vermin or wild animals, he will have two courses open to him&mdash;either to clear the land himself or allow the Minister's employees to do so.  That is a reasonable proposition. There are two types of land adjoining plantations.  In one case the farmer has fairly good fertile land with good fences and he would object to the Department's trappers coming in and damaging those fences.  He will have the opportunity of doing the clearing himself.  On the other hand, there are persons whose land is very extensive, poor mountain land, probably heavily infested with all kinds of wild animals, foxes, rabbits and so on.  The cost of clearing it would be very high, so high that the landowner may not be able to face it himself, as he may not have the means.  To that farmer, the cost might be so high that, if this sub-section were retained, the amount of compensation to the Minister might be as much as the land itself would be worth.  That man would have the opportunity of letting the Department's trappers in on his land to clear it.  In fairness, the Minister should agree to the deletion of this sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment down on the Committee Stage to delete this sub-section, but did not get an opportunity of arguing it.  The proposal is a most unjust one.  One could understand it if a man were using his land deliberately to produce vermin, but I do not know of any farmer in this country who is anxious to breed rabbits and hares.  Everyone looks upon vermin of that sort as a nuisance, and it is not by any means a simple matter to eradicate them completely.  Very often vermin may not be confined to <Col N="1024" /> one farm.  The infestation occurs over a pretty big district and a man's efforts to exterminate the vermin on his particular land, which may be adjacent to a forest, might not result in any measure of success because, in the course of a few months, the vermin might come in again from neighbouring farms.</P>
      <P>I think if the Minister appreciates the problem he must realise the injustice of fixing a responsibility of this sort on any land owner.  He is served with a notice to exterminate, but his efforts might prove a failure, no matter how anxious he was.  Apart from the forest interest, he might have a personal interest in trying to exterminate the rabbits.  I am aware of a number of farmers who suffered financially as a result of the infestation of holdings with rabbits and other vermin, and unless there is a general effort made all over the country to exterminate them it would be an unfair responsibility to put on any individual.  I do not know why, because it happens to be a forest centre under the control of a State authority, they should claim exceptional treatment.  A farmer might suffer severely through the infestation of a neighbouring farm.  His crops might be ruined.  It is not the individual who suffers as a consequence. Nationally we would suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister remembers that before the emergency we were paying a bounty of 3d. on rabbits to encourage their extermination.  With the emergency the value of rabbits for export purposes appreciated considerably, and we were exporting huge quantities of them.  The people engaged in the export trade, which became a valuable trade, thought that if we did not declare a close season for rabbits we might succeed in exterminating them.  These people prevailed on the Minister for Agriculture to declare a close season, so that we would make sure that the rabbits would not be exterminated and, for the first time, the Minister did declare a close season.  During that season the rabbits are given an opportunity to multiply.  The Minister appreciates how prolific they are.  With a close season every year, they are given an <Col N="1025" /> opportunity which prevents their extermination.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind that that is the attitude of the Minister, the man who is responsible for the welfare of agriculture. We have another Minister trying to counteract that by fixing a responsibility and a severe penalty on an individual if he fails to comply with the idea of the Minister for Lands.  It is a wonder there would not be some co-ordination between the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Agriculture. Both Ministers appear to be pursuing different policies.  I advise the Minister for Lands to try to reconcile his policy with the policy of the Minister for Agriculture.  There ought to be some Minister responsible for the use and the disposition of land here.  If we had that we would not experience such a wide difference in policy between the two Departments.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister to accept the amendment.  I think it would be grossly unfair and unjust otherwise.  I think the Minister, with his practical experience of rural Ireland, will realise the difficulty a farmer might experience, not because rabbits could be found on his holding, but because his holding could be infested from neighbouring holdings.  It would be grossly unfair and unjust to compel him, under this sub-section, to do things that it might be almost humanly impossible for him to do.  He has no control over the land outside his own farm and even though he might make continual efforts year after year, he might fail in his attempt to exterminate the vermin.  If the Minister acts as a countryman and ignores the advice of the civil servants in his Department, I believe he will, without any hesitation, accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I missed the opportunity of moving an amendment which was moved for me but was not accepted.  There is one thing I object to in this measure, and it is on the question of fixing compensation.  There are two parties interested, the man who owns the land that is to be acquired for forest purposes, and the Land Commission.  We are providing here that the Land Commission are to be the judges of what is a fair measure of compensation.  In principle, I think that is unsound, unfair and unjust.  If there is a dispute as to what is fair compensation between the two parties, one party hardly can be expected to act in a strictly impartial manner in fixing the compensation.  The Minister may say that the Land Commission are already doing that in the acquisition of land for the purposes of division. They may be doing that, but it is no answer to my argument and in this instance it is not justifiable.  I believe we should go outside the parties interested to find an arbitrator, who should be a man with no interest in the contract.  Here we are giving authority to an interested party to fix compensation. That is contrary to any ideas or principles of justice.  It is the one thing in this measure I take exception to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must express regret that the Minister did not see fit to accept the amendment that I submitted.  It would ensure that in a dispute between the two parties&mdash;the Land Commission proposing to acquire land for forestry purposes being one, and the owner of the land the other&mdash;there would be an <Col N="1027" /> outside tribunal to fix a fair measure of compensation.  Because one party to the contract is a State organisation is no earthly reason why it should be authorised to act as arbitrator in the matter of fixing compensation.  I believe it will not give any confidence to an individual that he is going to get justice and fair play.  The Minister possibly may say it was in the original legislation, and that it is embodied in this Bill because it was part of our forestry law.  If we are consolidating the law and trying to improve it, then a fundamental matter of that sort should get the attention of the Minister. While I agree that the Minister ought to have power to go ahead with forestry, that is an aspect of the measure which, as it stands in its final form, I do not like.  So far as the Bill is concerned, I think that the Minister ought to have ample power to go ahead with afforestation and to increase the annual amount of land that is going to be planted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the question that I raised on the Committee Stage, the provision giving the Minister power to fix the maximum price that he will pay for the land that he acquires.  That, in effect, is giving notice to the commissioners that there is a price provided for them in the Bill that the Minister will not exceed.  With that provision before them, they will approach this question of the valuation of land with the knowledge that, unless the price they fix is within that amount, the land will not be acquired.  Therein lies the danger that these men may feel biased to give an owner less than what his land would be worth.  They may think that it would be worth more than the maximum price which the Minister has the power to give, and for that reason they may feel justified in taking the land at less than its value.  This is not a question of taking over an estate, a demesne or a large tract of land on which there may be certain redemption charges under the Land Purchase Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with the taking over of land from a farmer or an owner of land.  Therefore, in my opinion, the person to fix the price of that land should be some person independent of <Col N="1028" /> both the owner and the Minister.  I think it would have been wise on the Minister's part if he had accepted my proposal with regard to that.  It is very difficult to appreciate why he did not do so.  I referred to this before in dealing with the administration of the law, and pointed out that not only must the law be just but that it must give the appearance of being just.  It is important to give to the citizen the idea that the administration of the law is just.  I realise quite well that the men who will fix the price of land in these cases will be, perhaps, perfectly honest about it, but border-line cases will crop up where the question at issue may be £1 or £2 an acre, the difference, say, between £4 or £6 or £7. The commissioners, acting as the valuers or arbitrators in the matter, will know perfectly well that they must bring the price down to the £4 or under because otherwise the Minister will not take the land.  There is that danger, that quite unconsciously they may do an injustice to an owner in fixing the price.  I think that even now it would be wise for the Minister to accept a proposal to have this question of price decided by some outside body. I take it that under this measure a good deal of land will be acquired. Therefore, the owners should be convinced that the price of their land is being fixed by an impartial body of persons who will hold the scales independently and fairly, and do justice to both sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the view that, whoever is appointed to value the land acquired under this measure, will have a real knowledge of the value of such land, and what I mean by that is a close knowledge of the manner in which such land has been worked, and of its value to the particular farmer.  For example, mountain land may be of little value in itself, but, regarded in conjunction with a small holding, it might be of exceptional value to its owner as a means of carrying on a particular type of farming.  The same consideration would apply to rights-of-way and easements. Compulsory powers are being taken to give compensation in regard to these matters.  It is essential that <Col N="1029" /> the persons who are ultimately to decide these questions should know all these problems, as well as the particular circumstances in which the farmers in question have to live.  They should be prepared to take into consideration not only the value of the land proposed to be acquired, but should put a proper valuation on the amount of inconvenience that may be caused by their action.  I hope that in cases where compulsion is exercised, and where grazing lands are acquired from farmers, the question of inconvenience and disturbance will be taken fully into account, because it is possible that a farmer might receive the full market value of the land acquired from him, and still suffer a considerable consequential loss by reason of having lost land which, used in conjunction with the rest of his holding, might be of very great value indeed to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be good legal theory, of course, that it is far better to have the appearance of justice than it is to do actual justice, but I do not think that the people with whom we have to deal in the country with regard to the acquisition of land would be quite satisfied that camouflaged justice would suit their bill.  The amendment which was proposed on an earlier stage did mention an official arbitrator. I think that, in doing so, the proposer of the amendment should have gone much further and made the necessary provision in his amendment for the appointment and duties of an official arbitrator.  I pointed out that, in fact, there is no such person as an official arbitrator in any of the Land Acts. An arbitrator may be appointed when, for example, the Department of Defence is acquiring a barracks or something of the kind, but, in regard to land, the Land Commission is completely independent of the Minister in matters of this sort, and therefore of the Government, and must be regarded as the real official arbitrator.  I think we are dealing quite fairly with the people.  I pointed out during the debate that compulsion under this Bill was not compulsion in the ordinary sense.  If we are to have forestry, we must have good will.  We cannot go <Col N="1030" /> into the country and take land from farmers compulsorily without having a very great measure of agreement. Otherwise, forestry being open to a good deal of damage, which could be simply done if we had not local good will, we could not have forestry.  I do not think there is any point in the argument that the Land Commission is not a competent and impartial body. Deputy McMenamin mentioned one example in regard to the acquisition of land and the fixing of prices.  I stated then that hard cases do not make good law.  At the same time the case was not by any means as hard as Deputy McMenamin made out.  In fact, he had not the facts correctly.  If he went to the officials, they would have given him a good deal of information.  I think the Land Commission has been quite reasonable in meeting individuals. Official tribunals are independent of the Minister, and the officials have full knowledge of the type of land to be acquired.  They are, therefore, the most suitable instrument by which land may be acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some other matters were raised by Deputies during the debate.  Deputy Roddy referred to the appointment of a foreign expert.  I said that there was no real reason for such an appointment. Those in charge of forestry here are not only abreast of all modern information in regard to forestry, but because of the peculiar conditions that exist in Ireland, they have much more information on the subject of what we need than is held elsewhere.  There is hardly any natural regeneration of forestry here as in other countries, consequently those in charge in Ireland have to be concerned with a particular type of forestry code which is not known in Europe.  They are, therefore, much better fitted for this work than any foreigners, who are used to conditions other than those obtaining in Ireland.  At the same time, if there is need at any time to call outside assistance or advice, it would be possible to have such experts appointed on the consultative council.  I think that would meet the Deputy's case.  In the meantime, there is not the least necessity to secure any advice beyond what we <Col N="1031" /> have.  Deputy Cogan raised a question about a holding that might be uneconomic if all the land other than the arable land were acquired for forestry.  There again the question of compulsion arises.  We could not compel such a man to surrender a portion of his holding if by doing so it would be made uneconomic.  We would be running counter to the Land Commission's activities and views there.  The work of the Land Commission is to make holdings economic and a State Department like the Forestry Department could not run counter to the main work of the Land Commission, by making a holding uneconomic.  The Deputy can be assured that such a position will not arise in any activities of the Forestry Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised a question about the iniquity of delaying a felling licence for 21 days from the date on which an application was made.  At one time, when we had not a spate of such demands, a notification was sent back as quickly as possible to the applicant, possibly within ten or 12 days, but during the past few years we had such a spate of applications that it was impossible to deal with them in that fashion.  Therefore, we had to adopt a 21 days' system.  It does not seem to me to be very hard on the applicants.  Where it turns out that it is a question of not giving a licence they get immediate notification.  I gave the Dáil a list of the applications submitted during the last few years, a list of the permits issued, as well as a list showing that no great inconvenience was suffered by anybody.  Deputy Cogan also referred to the possibility of including in this Bill some provision for dealing with roadside trees.  The Minister for Defence gave some notification regarding that matter, as it affected defence purposes.  It does not concern the Forestry Bill nor is it one for the Forestry Department.</P>

      <P>In relation to the amendment under discussion I rose before the adjournment of the debate at 7 o'clock merely to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he had anything to say in connection with the point raised as to the position of the owner or person in charge of a public conveyance who would refuse to carry a person on that public conveyance in the belief that that person was suffering from an infectious disease when in fact the person was not so suffering within the meaning of the Act.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with the position of that person if brought before a court, because I think there is hardly any doubt that if he refused to allow the person to travel, still worse, if that person were publicly ejected from the particular conveyance, and was afterwards able to prove that at that time he was not suffering from an infectious disease, he would get damages in the court.  I should like to know whether there is to be any protection for persons acting in a <i>bona fide</i> way.</P>

      <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary says now really hits the nail on the head and drives home the arguments.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary has been asked, during the last 70 years that this law that he quotes has been in operation, was there ever a case of the kind brought up?  At any rate, since the State was set up, in 1922, was there ever a driver of a public vehicle prosecuted for allowing a person suffering from an infectious disease to enter his car?</P>

      <P>There is no use in talking to us like that.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been pointing out that the laws in these matters were so obscure that even the very highly qualified legal people in the House did not know what the law was and, while making that attack on those who are criticising the Bill here, he asks us to accept that every person driving or conducting a vehicle in the country was aware of what is in the Act.</P>

      <P>The Act of 1878 was the Act that the Parliamentary Secretary particularly quoted.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will look through the Statute Book for 1878 he will realise that the ordinary people were only at the dawn of their liberties at that particular time and that there is nobody going to dare&mdash;as he now suggests&mdash;in the capacity of driver of a public vehicle, to interfere with a person boarding a vehicle or to challenge him that he suffers from infectious disease and will not be allowed to board.  The 1878 Act was framed at a time when people's sense of responsibility and people's rights to liberty were not as advanced as they are now, after the passage of 70 years.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary will only look at some of the statute laws that existed in Ireland up to 1878 and were wiped out at that particular time, he will have some realisation of the fact that the idea of liberty and a sense of responsibility was only dawning at that particular time.  He is simply enshrining in this Bill an Act that ought to be wiped out of the Statute Book.  He is imposing very large fines on persons suffering from infectious diseases who go into public places, and he might very well leave the responsibility for answering for offences of that particular kind on the person suffering from an infectious disease who knowingly goes into the public vehicle.  It is only making the law appear silly to put sub-sections like this into the Bill.</P>

In the case of a person in charge of a public conveyance, he is required to know by looking at a complete stranger whether or not he is suffering from an infectious disease.  In the case of a parent of a child, living with the parent, according to the amendment that we passed and which is now part of the Bill, the parent is not deemed to have reasonable belief that the child is suffering from an infectious disease unless he has been served with notice from the medical officer.  The bus conductor who casually sees the man or woman getting on the bus has to determine whether or not he knows the person has an infectious disease.</P>

    <P>Suppose the owner learns a week, a month, or two months after the occurrence, surely these things do not <Col N="1036" /> apply.  Therefore, I put down the amendment.  The position here is that if the general manager of Córas Iompair Eireann learns that somebody suffering from whooping cough travelled on the train from Dublin to Cork and if he discovers, a week after the occurrence, that he travelled in a particular carriage, the carriage has to be taken out of commission and disinfected, etc., etc.  I suggest that there ought to be a time limit.</P>

      <P>I do not think that anybody incurs a special risk of a punitive character at the hands of the District Court by reason of the fact that there is an upward limit to the fine which can be imposed.  As the Deputy will observe, there is no minimum fine fixed and, as Deputy Larkin conceded earlier to-night on another penalty clause, the probabilities are that the fine will be of such a nominal nature that it will not operate as a deterrent at all.  I think, at any rate, that we <Col N="1037" /> can leave the question of the amount of the fine, within the maximum limit of £50, to the wisdom and judgment of the district justice.  He will have heard all the evidence and, if he is fully satisfied that a serious offence has been committed, presumably he will inflict a salutary fine.  On the other hand, after all these various contingencies which have been mentioned here have been brought to his notice in the course of the hearing of a charge, if he is impressed with the strength of the arguments and the mitigating circumstances operating on the case, I am sure that the district justice will not act in a harsh manner. I do not think we are risking anything by leaving the maximum fine pretty high, so long as we do not fix a minimum fine that might be deemed, in certain circumstances, to be excessive.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is quite on a par with the penalty we were discussing at an earlier stage, to which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred.  Those penalties are to apply to any breach of sub-sections (3), (4) and (5).  I think the district justice will have to take it as a direction that the Oireachtas thought it necessary to put into this section provision for a fine of £50, or three months' imprisonment, or both.  We are not dealing now with a maximum fine of £5 or £10. You are giving a direction, in so far as you can give it, to the district justice that a breach of sub-sections (3), (4) and (5) must be looked upon by him as a very serious matter and that, in imposing his penalty, he must have regard to the penalty provided by the Oireachtas under this particular sub-section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by the Parliamentary Secretary's argument on this.  It may be that some justices may fix a low fine, but a crank, if you like, might decide on the full penalty and there would not be a fair measure of justice in that case.  I <Col N="1038" /> think Deputy Morrissey's argument is quite sound.  When you provide in the section for a maximum penalty of £50, that would be an indication to any justice that the Oireachtas considers that a substantial fine was essential in the case of an offence under this section. Instead of trying to defend a fine of £50, or three months' imprisonment, the Parliamentary Secretary went on to argue that, in the ordinary administration of the law, it is unlikely that that amount will be imposed and that we should leave it to the discretion of the justice.  I think the maximum provided for here is far too high.  If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks that, by leaving it to the discretion of the justice, it would be very much lower, I think we should fix what we consider should be the maximum.  From his argument, I think the Parliamentary Secretary does not think that the maximum will ever be imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a legal expert and I am seeking enlightenment. Under sub-section (3), the person in charge of a public vehicle who admits a person who, he knows, is a probable source of infection commits an offence. That is the basis of the offence, as the Parliamentary Secretary has been emphasising. Under sub-section (7), where the person who contravened sub-section (3) was not the owner of the relevant public conveyance, the owner is guilty of an offence.  I can guess what the Parliamentary Secretary will say, but it is not set out in the section.  How is the owner of the conveyance guilty of an offence unless he &ldquo;knows&rdquo; that the infectious case was so conveyed?  You do not set out that in the section.  Is he guilty because his servant knew and committed the offence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I do not see why we should bother framing legislation at all.  If we prescribe a fine in respect of the owner of the vehicle, it would not be difficult to say that, if he also has knowledge as to the person being infected, he is guilty of an offence.  But there is no such statement. With regard to the punishment, under sub-section (6), it may be a fine or imprisonment or both.  Under sub-section (7), it may be a fine.  That may be discrimination as regards responsibility between the owner and the employee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-section (6), the punishment is a fine or imprisonment or both.  Under sub-section (7) the punishment is £50.  I think that the punishment will be largely in the form of a fine but there is no equitable relationship between a fine of £5 on a bus conductor and a fine of £50 on, say, C.I.E., or any large transport organisation.  In so far as we <Col N="1042" /> have sections dealing with individual employees and large public undertakers, we should bear in mind the equity of the punishment to be meted out.  A fine of £5 on the conductor of a bus on which such an offence was committed would be far heavier than a fine of £50 on C.I.E.  In one case, the offence would have been committed by an individual and, in the other, by a large and wealthy corporation.</P>

      <P>We have already argued this question to some extent but I think that grave injustice could be done in this case. Even the owner of a hackney vehicle might not be aware that there was an infectious case in the vehicle.  The driver might be aware.  If the driver were convicted, under sub-section (7) the owner can be convicted and fined, although completely ignorant that an infected person had travelled in his car.  If the guard of a train permits an infectious case to travel from Dublin to Cork, the company can be fined £50, although they knew nothing whatever about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not suggested that we should convict a man who is not aware at all of the offence alleged?  Deputy McGilligan's amendment would put the responsibility on him, if he is aware that an infectious <Col N="1043" /> case travels in the vehicle he owns. There is a responsibility on him then to put the vehicle out of commission for a certain period.  As the sub-section stands, whether he is aware or not, he is convicted and he is liable to a penalty.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to defend that principle.</P>

      <P>It does not require to be defended.  I think the section speaks fairly eloquently in its own defence. Again, it is not an innovation, and that is all I need say about it.  It is part of the existing law which would have remained in the statutory code had we not attempted to co-ordinate these laws.  Deputy Mulcahy at one time twits us with continuing the enactment of laws that were made by an alien Government.  Well, he has used a fair share of them and they seemed to work all right for him.  We, at any rate, are adapting any useful principles we found in the existing statutory code. I do not mind where a law originated so long as it happens to suit the purpose aimed at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We would not adapt any bad law.  Deputy Larkin understands clearly enough what the purpose of sub-section (7) is.  Sub-section (7) puts an obligation on the employer to see that an employee complies with the law and he is subject to a penalty if his employee does not in fact comply with the law.  That is the principle involved in this, and that is why it is drafted in the terms which appear in sub-section (7).  I do not think any Deputy could regard it as an innovation. Certainly there is nothing novel about the principle.</P>

I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if a guard on a train from Dublin to Mullingar allows a person with whooping cough to travel in the train knowingly or wittingly, is it intended that, as well as the guard himself, the general manager of Córas Iompair Eireann under sub-section (7) should be liable to a fine not exceeding £50?

      <P>Is that an argument that it should not be there?  If nobody suffered the death penalty in the past 20 years, would the Deputy argue on that ground that we should abolish the death penalty?  Are penalties not deterrents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Penalties may be deterrents. I am presuming that, as this is only a summary offence, no such offence must have been detected in that no prosecution was taken.  There is no analogy between this and the death penalty.  I take it that if there were no prosecutions, there were no offences, or the law was incapable of enforcement, which is the argument put forward here.  I want to support what Deputy Costello has said.  In this provision, you are attributing to the company the offence of its servant.  There cannot be an offence unless there is guilty intention, and here the company has no knowledge, good, bad or indifferent, of the offence at the time of its commission. The servant is properly punishable under sub-section (3) and it seems most unreasonable and unjust, having punished the servant, to punish the owner under sub-section (7), who could not have prevented the servant from committing the offence at the time he committed it.  He was not then in a <Col N="1047" /> position to stop the commission of the offence.  The vehicle may have been miles from his office, place of business or residence, as the case may be, and he could not possibly have intervened to prevent his servant from committing the act which contravened the law.  It seems most unreasonable that, in these circumstances, the owner should be liable to the maximum penalty of £50. I hold that there is a principle that unless the owner himself did something directly to connive at the commission of that offence, there is no guilty intention and that he has committed no offence in law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies may like to hear Section 63 of that Act.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The owner or driver of a public vehicle within the district of the local authority used for the carrying of passengers at separate fares shall not knowingly convey, or any other person shall not knowingly place, in any such public vehicle a person suffering from any infectious disease, or a person suffering from any such <Col N="1048" /> disease shall not enter any such vehicle, and every person who shall offend against this section shall for every such offence be liable to a penalty not exceeding 40 shillings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the law which is supposed to have been enforced by the last Government. It is a good thing we were able to send for the section to expose the Parliamentary Secretary's fallacy and inaccuracy.  The Parliamentary Secretary cannot reply to that, and that is the section he relied on.</P>

      <P>We are rather laboriously endeavouring to see that <Col N="1051" /> the laws we pass here are reasonable and that nobody who is not guilty may be affected in any way by the penalties those laws provide.  It has been pointed out very clearly here that the Parliamentary Secretary completely misled the House in his references to the section of the 1907 Act which he said was analogous or exactly the same thing as is enshrined here in sub-section (7).  When this was brought home to the Parliamentary Secretary by us, he had no explanation to give of it, and when others draw attention to the fact and seek an explanation of it, he simply tends to get abusive or insulting.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not coming to anybody's rescue, except to the rescue of the people for whom we are legislating, and I do not think that Deputy Larkin will ever ask me to come to his rescue, nor have I ever seen any necessity for his calling for the assistance of anybody in debating here.  I think he has been endeavouring to assist the Parliamentary Secretary and has been doing it very well. However, I am simply concerned now with the facts involved and I called attention to the absence of a quorum so that the Deputies of the Parliamentary Secretary's Party may hear what is going on and may gather some kind of impression as to how the work of this House is being treated.  I refer Deputies to sub-section (7) here, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person who contravenes sub-section (3) of this section is not the owner of the relevant public conveyance, such owner shall also be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has insisted that where the employee is guilty of an offence, that is, where he carries a person whom he knows to be afflicted with an infectious disease in his car, he may be fined £50 and may get three months' imprisonment.  But, under this sub-section, the owner, <Col N="1052" /> whether it is Córas Iompair Eireann or a person who owns a couple of taxis, without knowing anything about it, may be fined £50 as well.  We are seeking to introduce an amendment that will secure that the owner will not be liable under this sub-section unless it be proved that such contravention occurred with the consent and the knowledge of such owner.  The Parliamentary Secretary has endeavoured to mislead the House by suggesting that sub-section (7) as it stands, without any reference to knowledge, came directly from Section 63 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred us to Section 63, and I want to quote, for the information of Deputies who have now come into the House, what Section 63 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The owner or driver of a public vehicle within the district of the local authority used for the carrying of passengers at separate fares shall not knowingly convey, or any other person shall not knowingly place, in any such public vehicle a person suffering from any infectious disease, or a person suffering from any such disease shall not enter any such vehicle, and every person who shall offend against this section shall for every such offence be liable to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in the absence of knowledge on our part of the 1907 Act, endeavoured to persuade us that we were refusing him rights and powers under sub-section (7) to punish an owner, that he already had under an Act he is wiping out.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is brought up against the discrepancy in what he puts to the House, instead of helping us he has nothing to say about it and he becomes abusive to those who ask for further information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment suggests that there shall be put into sub-section (7) a provision making it clear that the owner <Col N="1053" /> must be knowingly guilty of the offence. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary on what grounds he takes out the reference to the owner knowingly being guilty of the offence in the sub-section he has here when it existed in Section 63, to which he referred us, and why he now imposes a penalty of £50 where, under Section 63, which he quoted for us, the penalty was then 40/-?  Perhaps there is some Deputy in his Party who could help us?</P>

      <P>I repeat that, and the Parliamentary Secretary's whole case with regard to the Act of 1878 and the Act of 1907 was that there was no difference between the provisions of those Acts and the provisions with which we are now dealing, that the only <Col N="1055" /> reason why they were being repealed was simply because it was a matter of codification and simplification and there was no difference between the powers he is seeking now and the powers he has under the 1878 and 1907 Acts.  His attitude here is that he will give just, and in such a manner as he thinks best, whatever information it pleases him to give to this House, not what the House is entitled to get.  If that is to be the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude, we know where we are.  If we have to deal not only with this difficult Bill, but with misrepresentation as well, we can, and we can expose it, and we shall expose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we exposing?  We are exposing here sub-section (6) in respect to the contravention of sub-section (3) by a person in charge of a vehicle and sub-section (6) inflicts a penalty of £50 or three months' imprisonment, or both.  Sub-section (7), in relation to the same offence, although the offence may be committed without the owner having the slightest knowledge, in addition to the £50 and the three months on the driver or the person in charge of the vehicle, puts a fine not exceeding £50 on the owner.  The Parliamentary Secretary sought to mislead the House by trying to convey to the House that there was no difference between sub-section (7) of this proposed new section and Section 63 of the 1907 Act.  The fundamental difference is that under Section 63 of the 1907 Act the person must do it knowingly, <Col N="1056" /> but under this sub-section, even though it is done without his knowledge or consent, he is made subject to a fine not exceeding £50.  Every time that the Parliamentary Secretary is driven into a corner by argument from this side of the House, he falls back on the 1878 or 1907 Acts.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (8), line 46, before the word &ldquo;suspects&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;on reasonable grounds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The sub-section, as it stands, enables an owner, or a person in charge of a public conveyance, to refuse to convey a person in the conveyance whom he knows to be a probable source of infection, or whom he suspects to be a probable source of infection.  The amendment is designed to secure that suspicion, which would enable a driver of a vehicle to prevent a person from travelling upon it, must be based upon some reasonable ground.  It will not be sufficient merely for a driver to say: &ldquo;I suspected that A.B. was suffering from a disease which was likely to be a source of infection and I would not let him on.&rdquo;  That goes too far.  It gives too great a power to the owner or the driver of a public vehicle to refuse to allow a person, who had a right to travel on it, to use such a conveyance. The amendment is a reasonable one.  The object here is to secure that this suspicion will not be allowed to develop into something which would enable a person who has a grudge against another person to work that grudge under the colour of an unfair law.</P>

      <P>Before moving amendment No. 64 I wanted to give the Parliamentary Secretary an opportunity to explain what he has in mind in leaving paragraph (b) as it stands. It gives the local authority power to make a reasonable charge to the person who was conveyed, as he was responsible for bringing about the infection of the vehicle, whether he knew he was infected or not.</P>

      <P>As it stands there might appear to be nothing wrong with a person, but he might find out later that he was suffering from scarlatina or measles or any of these diseases which are applicable to the section.  In the interests of the owners of the vehicle, has he to report that he is suffering from a disease? <Col N="1060" /> It might be necessary in the public interest that that confession should be made, but if having innocently travelled in a vehicle while in an infectious condition he is liable under the section for the cost of the disinfection of the vehicle, he may hold his tongue.  In the next amendment Deputy McGilligan is seeking to secure that just as the owner would not be liable under paragraph (a) unless he knowingly conveyed a person suffering from infectious disease, under paragraph (b) a person conveyed in a conveyance while suffering from an infectious disease would not be liable for the cost of the disinfection of the vehicle if he did not know that he was a probable source of infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so&mdash;if they did not know.  If the owner or the person in charge knows that the person is suffering from an infectious disease and conveyed the person in his conveyance, the local authority may make a charge for the disinfection.  There is no fault to be found with that.  In any case where the owner or person in charge has not been aware that the person conveyed was a probable source of infection the local authority can make a charge for the cost of disinfecting the conveyance.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan I move amendment No. 64:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of paragraph (b) the words &ldquo;if it be proved that the person conveyed or the person having charge of the person conveyed knew that the person conveyed was a source of infection with an infectious disease at the time of such conveyance and that the person having charge of the person conveyed knew of or consented to such conveyance at such time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is that if a person, without knowing that he was suffering from an infectious disease, travelled in a public conveyance he would not be liable and if he found out, that night, that he was suffering from an infectious disease, he could, with perfect impunity, report <Col N="1061" /> the matter, so that the public health could be protected.  Take the case of a person not feeling well and going to a doctor.  He might get a taxi and might dismiss the taxi on reaching the doctor's house.  He would realise, after seeing the doctor, that he was suffering from an infectious disease.  It ought to be possible, in the public interest, for that person to report to the taxi owner or driver that he was suffering from an infectious disease and that the conveyance ought to be put through a process of disinfection. He having innocently been the cause of infecting the vehicle, should not be asked to bear the cost. If an amendment such as is proposed by Deputy McGilligan is not added, he would be liable to such charge and it might deter him from making the confession which in the public interest might be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, we understand, is a new and up-to-date measure changing all the obsolete regulations and Acts that have hitherto governed public health but, in spite of the time that we have spent discussing Section 28, I doubt if we have yet got <Col N="1062" /> down to all the possible ramifications of the section.  The discussion has been about the &ldquo;person&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; occurs in nearly every paragraph. I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how far &ldquo;things&rdquo; will come into this section.  For instance, there may be a case of infectious disease in a particular house. There will be clothes, bedding, etc., that will have to be removed and cleaned or washed.  I think most of us who travel in public conveyances see from time to time bundles of washing or various other parcels that it is intended to deal with.  Is it the position that under this section the conductor of a tramcar or bus, who must make himself aware of anybody in the district through which the vehicle passes who is suffering from an infectious disease, must also make himself aware of people who may be carrying things from that house for the purpose of having them cleaned or washed?  To bring this to its logical conclusion, I take it the Parliamentary Secretary contends that in the case of certain diseases the clothes or bedding may be as dangerous as the person infected. How far is this going to be dealt with? Is the Parliamentary Secretary going to say: &ldquo;That is all right; I will deal with that under the regulations&rdquo; and, later on, when the regulations are produced that we have not yet seen is he going to slip in something to the effect that clothes or bedding which come from houses where there is infectious disease are to be treated in the same way, if carried in a public conveyance, as Section 28 now lays down in respect of persons?  Does that bring us to the logical conclusion that ambulances or some special form of conveyance will have to be used for the purpose of bringing clothes or bedding which require special attention, as coming from infected houses, to laundries and cleaners?  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if that aspect of the matter has occurred to him and how it is going to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In sub-section (5), there is provision that where the owner of a public conveyance learns that a person has been conveyed in the conveyance <Col N="1063" /> while a probable source of infection with an infectious disease, such owner shall forthwith take the conveyance out of service.  What does that actually mean?  Take the case of a taxi plying for hire.  The taxi-man may be a married man with a large family.  If he takes a patient to a hospital who, afterwards, is discovered to be an infectious case and if the Gárda authorities and the public health authority insist on the conveyance being taken out of commission, is there any method of compensating the taxi-man concerned?</P>
      <P>If there is no method of compensating the man whose livelihood depends on his taxi, there is no encouragement given to him.  He may possibly take the risk of not informing the Gárda authorities or the public health authorities that he had an infectious case in his taxi.  In order that that man will report such a case, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to state that a driver of such a conveyance will be encouraged to state the nature of the case he carried and that he need not fear that his livelihood will be taken from him.  I suggest that if a taxi-man has his car put out of commission because of doing his duty by the State in reporting such a case, he ought to be given adequate compensation until his car is ready to go on the road again.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that this is an important point and that it would be helpful if he could assure these people that they will lose nothing by reporting that a person suffering from a contagious disease had been carried in their taxi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Dockrell as to the carrying of articles and the disinfection of articles, structures, vehicles and other things, these matters are not dealt with in Section 28.  Section 28 deals with the carrying of persons in a conveyance.  The detailed regulations governing the matters mentioned by Deputy Dockrell will be placed on the Table of the House, under the Second Schedule, items 5 and 6.  Item 5 provides for regulations dealing with the compulsory cleansing, disinfection and disinfestation of persons, buildings, <Col N="1064" /> structures, vehicles or articles, and the safe disposal or destruction of infected or dirty articles.  The Deputy will have a full opportunity of discussing these regulations when they are placed before the House.  The existing regulations dealing with these matters can be consulted.  I do not think it will be necessary to make any radical departure in the matter of the regulations under this particular heading.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Byrne's point about the taxi-man taking a patient to a hospital, I do not think it will be possible to provide compensation for such a taxi-man if he takes a patient to hospital whom he knows to be a probable source of infection.  He will not be under any obligation to take such a patient.  There are conveyances for bringing infectious disease patients to hospital.  His vehicle need not be long out of commission.  Provision has already been made for the disinfection by the local authority of any vehicle that may be so used.  As soon as he gets his vehicle disinfected he will be free again to ply his trade.  I think that is a reasonable effort to meet the difficulties of the position.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the local authority ought to be asked to compensate him for loss of time and possible loss of clients during the period within which his vehicle would actually be out of service.  If such a provision were made, it could well happen that it would be more profitable for the taxi-man to take his vehicle out of service after giving a joy ride to someone suffering from an infectious disease than it would be to continue at a station.  However, it is not likely that that will arise.  In fact, I think it would be a very rare occurrence that a taxi-driver would in fact bring a person suffering from an infectious disease to hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the provincial centres we are fairly well supplied with ambulances for the removal of infectious disease cases.  Here in the City of Dublin no difficulty has been brought to my notice in regard to the matter of providing vehicles for conveying infectious disease cases.  Therefore, all private vehicles such as taxis ought to be discouraged and they should be used only, if at all, in a case of emergency, where the rapid removal of a patient would be necessary <Col N="1065" /> in the interest of the community and where an ambulance could not be found within a reasonable time.  I doubt that such a circumstance would arise even in the City of Dublin.  Anyhow, I do not see that we can make provision for compensation if a taxi-man, voluntarily and of his own free will, with full knowledge, takes upon himself to carry an infectious disease patient in his taxi.  I think it is not unreasonable to ask him to put that taxi out of commission so that the next person who occupies the taxi will not run the risk of contracting the disease.  It will only be put out of commission for a very short time until the local authority has an opportunity of having the vehicle disinfected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary overlooked the point that I made. His last few words convinced me that he did not follow what I said.  He said that if a man of his own free will takes an infectious case into his car the least he can expect is that his car should be taken away and disinfected.  I agree with that.  But that is not what the Bill says.  The Bill says that such owner shall forthwith take the conveyance out of service.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that a taxi should not be used for this purpose.  He should have said knowingly used.  If a doctor is called to a house in an outlying district, and the residents do not want the neighbours to see an ambulance pulling up at the door&mdash;it has happened in Dublin not once but thousands of times&mdash;a taxi may be ordered.  When the patient arrives at the hospital it may be found to be an infectious case.  In the meantime the taxi has gone away and somebody says that it should be traced.  An advertisement may be inserted by the Garda authorities asking the taxi-man to report to them and he may not do so. You cannot blame him if he does not report to them.  If he does, his taxi will be put out of commission and he will get no compensation, although his means of livelihood will be taken from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have done so much in the interests of public health that I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary between this and the next <Col N="1066" /> stage to think over this matter and provide for some compensation to be paid to the taxi-man who voluntarily comes forward, in order to protect other persons who may be using his taxi, and says: &ldquo;I am the driver of a taxi that brought an infectious case to such-and-such a hospital.&rdquo;  The public health authorities or the Gárda authorities will say: &ldquo;We will have to take the taxi for a period of 24 hours.&rdquo; It might be a period of seven days, according to the seriousness of the disease.  That unfortunate man and his family will be left without bread and butter because of his honesty in reporting that he had taken a patient to a hospital.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that matter seriously and to improve this section by adding after the words &ldquo;forthwith take the conveyance out of service&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and shall be compensated for his loss accordingly&rdquo;. It will mean only a few pounds.  It might not mean £100 or £500 a year, for the whole country, to encourage these men to do right.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the point before Report Stage.  Otherwise, I shall ask to be taken as objecting to that section because of that line.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 67:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 15, after the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;after personal examination of a person carried out by such officer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think it will be admitted that this is a reasonable amendment having regard to the drastic powers given in the sub-section. The sub-section states: &ldquo;Where the chief medical officer of a county or county borough, or the medical officer of a port sanitary authority is of opinion either consequent upon his own observations, or consequent upon information furnished to him by a registered medical practitioner, that a person in the area where such medical officer acts is a probable source of infection... such medical officer may order in writing the detention and isolation of such person in a specified hospital or other place...&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 67 seeks to insert after the word, &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;after personal examination of a person carried out by such officer&rdquo;.  Having regard to the fact that the officer may order the detention and isolation of a person in any hospital or other place, it is not asking too much to require that that order shall issue only after the person has been seen and examined by the officer who is to issue the order for detention and isolation.  The necessity for this safeguard should be clear to anybody reading the sub-section and the amendment must be considered a reasonable one.</P>

      <P>If amendments Nos. 67, 68 and 69 be taken together they will show the wide alternatives for which Deputy McGilligan's amendment provides.  If this section were amended as suggested it would read:&mdash;&ldquo;Where the chief medical officer of a county or county borough or the medical officer of a port sanitary authority is of opinion, after personal examination of a person carried out by such officer, or where a registered medical practitioner, after personal examination of a person carried out by such practitioner is of opinion and notifies such medical officer...&rdquo;  The section would then provide that the order would issue only if either the chief medical officer of the <Col N="1068" /> county or county borough or the medical officer of the sanitary authority had personally carried out an examination of the person or a registered medical practitioner, other than he, had personally carried out an examination and had reported the result of that examination to the chief medical officer.</P>

      <P>In these three amendments, Deputy McGilligan seeks to ensure that a person will be properly examined before such an order is made by the chief medical officer or the medical officer of the port sanitary authority or by a medical practitioner who advises the chief medical officer.  The chief medical officer or medical officer of the port sanitary authority would then make the order on his own observation or it would be made on information furnished to the chief medical officer by a medical practitioner who had examined the person.  Under the Bill as it stands, it does not seem to be the responsibility of the chief medical officer, or of the medical practitioner on whose report he may act, to carry out an examination of the individual. The patient should get a very thorough examination before any such order is made.  Where the chief medical officer acts on the advice of a medical practitioner, that medical practitioner should be under an obligation to carry out an examination of the person.  That is not prescribed in the section as it stands.  The responsible medical officer could make an order merely on information furnished, which might not be first-hand information.</P>

      <P>The House appreciates the point that the chief medical officer in the variety of circumstances, which may present themselves in connection with the operation of this section, could not personally examine every person who was a probable source of infection and who ought to be detained, because time might be an important factor and we have only one chief medical officer in the City of Dublin and only one chief medical officer, for the purpose of this section, in each of the counties.  From the brief statements made in support of these amendments, I think that the House appreciates that difficulty.  The sub-section, as drafted, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" />&ldquo;Where the chief medical officer of a county or county borough or the medical officer of a port sanitary authority is of opinion either consequent upon his own observations, or consequent upon information furnished to him by a registered medical practitioner ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the information upon which the chief medical officer would act might be conveyed to him by a medical practitioner who had not, in fact, examined the patient, and that it is conceivable that a person might be detained under this section who had not been examined by a medical officer at all.  I would suggest to the House that it is so highly improbable, that it could be regarded as impossible, that any medical officer would advise the detention of a person without satisfying himself that the person should be detained as a danger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While I say that, if the House desires, as apparently the chief opposition Party does desire, to ensure, within the section at any rate, that there would be a statutory obligation to have the patient examined by some medical practitioner before the chief medical officer acts, I am prepared to meet the House to that extent.  I think amendment No. 69 would be the most appropriate of the group of amendments, but by accepting any amendment at all, that whole part of the section would have to be examined. I am prepared to accept the principle embodied in amendment No. 69, it being understood, of course, that the first portion of the section as drafted, would stand, that the chief medical officer could act on the certificate of a medical practitioner.</P>

It reads at present &ldquo;Where the chief medical officer of a county or county borough or the medical officer of a port sanitary authority is of opinion ...that a person in the area is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease and that his isolation is necessary or expedient in the interests of public health&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; It appears to me that the medical officer would deem it expedient to isolate such a person as a safeguard.</P>

      <P>It might not be absolutely necessary.  He might not be sure it was necessary, but he might have sufficient doubt about it to feel that he would have to err on the side of safety and that it would be expedient to isolate the person.  I think it would be wise to leave at least that amount of discretion to the medical officer.  It is nearly on a par with the matter which we have discussed so much&mdash;the person who knows.  The medical officer might be pretty well satisfied but, in fact, he would be very uneasy in his mind if he did not isolate the person.  He could not be just sure that it was necessary but if he was satisfied that it was expedient, we could allow him that amount of discretion, because after all, none of us will forget that, in the main, our chief county medical officers or the medical superintendent officers of a county borough are men of fairly mature judgment.  One does not get appointed to that post early in life.  In addition to their specialised knowledge of infectious diseases, these medical <Col N="1071" /> officers usually have accumulated a considerable amount of worldly wisdom.  I grant that we cannot assume that invariably every county medical officer will act in a thoroughly responsible way, but I think the risk is pretty small. At any rate, if anybody should be isolated or detained under the section, merely on suspicion, on the ground that it was expedient, and that, later on, the patient or anybody else is not satisfied that it was necessary, there is ample provision for the remedying of that position.  On the whole, I think that we should leave these words in the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 74:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 20, before the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, to insert the words &ldquo;with the concurrence of a registered medical practitioner nominated by the person to carry out a personal examination of him and having carried out such examination, or, where the person is clearly advised of his right to nominate such practitioner as aforesaid and fails or refuses to make such nomination, with the concurrence of a registered medical practitioner chosen by such medical officer, and, in the event of disagreement between such officer and such practitioner, with the concurrence of such other registered medical practitioner as may be agreed upon between such officer and either the person, or the practitioner nominated by such person, or the practitioner chosen by such officer as the case may be&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides that where <Col N="1072" /> there is a conflict of opinion between a registered medical practitioner and the chief medical officer as to whether a person should be detained in isolation, a third opinion agreed upon by these two persons may be brought in to decide whether it is necessary to have the person detained in isolation. In a case where the chief medical officer himself is the person who has examined the patient and proposes to make an order, the amendment provides that the person whom it is proposed to deal with in that way will be advised that he has a right to nominate a medical practitioner, to controvert, if he desires to do so, the opinion of the chief medical officer.  In any case he can bring in an adviser of his own to consider his case and to consider the decision of the chief medical officer. If there is a conflict between these two in the matter, a third person agreeable to the two persons involved will be brought in as a kind of decider.  It gives an expert court of appeal in the case of a person likely to come under the compulsory powers of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this amendment, we would set up a rather complicated, tedious and slow-moving type of machine.  In the first place, the chief medical officer would have satisfied himself in one or other of the various ways we have been discussing that it was necessary to isolate and detain a person who is a probable source of infection.  Bearing in mind that the chief medical officer, in addition to having reached fairly ripe years of wisdom and of age, has acquired specialised knowledge in the matter of infectious diseases, and has a statutory obligation placed upon him for the control of infectious diseases in his area, it seems to me unwise to place such obstruction, if you like, in his way as would delay him in the important matter of isolating a person whose isolation, in his opinion, is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this scheme, a patient may nominate a practitioner, and clearly the patient is dissatisfied with the decision to detain him in an institution.  Otherwise, he would not want to nominate any practitioner to call into consultation with the chief medical officer.  We then have reached a position where the <Col N="1073" /> opinion of the practitioner brought in will be of equal importance in so far as an immediate decision is concerned with the opinion of the expert and the man who has a statutory obligation placed upon him.  Time is passing while all these disputes are being adjusted, if they can be adjusted at all, and time is a very important factor in this matter.  The chief medical officer does not lightly come to the conclusion that it is necessary to isolate anybody, but if he is to be obstructed by this compulsory type of machinery, you will make it very difficult for him to discharge his duties properly.  If the doctor nominated by the patient disagrees with the chief medical officer, another medical man has to be called in.  He, too, may have little or no specialised knowledge of infectious diseases at all.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that all this is entirely unnecessary, and, again without unduly labouring it, let me direct the attention of the House to the machinery that operated in the past to meet this particular type of difficulty. In the olden days, before the institutions of government were set up in this State, if a person suffering from an infectious disease declined to go to an institution, the district medical officer could get an order from a justice of the peace for the patient's forcible removal.  Without disparaging in any way the justices of the peace, most of us know that they had not any specialised knowledge as to the desirability or necessity of isolating anybody. On what evidence was the justice of the peace to act?  He certainly could not act on his own knowledge, because he was issuing an order on a matter of a purely medical nature, and, consequently, if he were to act at all, he had to act on the opinion of the medical officer who applied for the order and who was the dispensary doctor of the district.  I do not think it can reasonably be argued that the machinery proposed in the Bill is unfavourably loaded against the persons who may be detained under the section by reason of the change we are making.</P>
    <P>Justices of the peace passed out, and we got our district justices and the district justice became the proper authority for issuing such an order. <Col N="1074" /> The machinery of the district justice for this particular purpose is not workable. Down the country, as people from the provinces will know, the district justice sits once a fortnight or once a week at most in the particular towns. If the county medical officer of health had to go before a district justice, make his case and secure an order from the district justice, clearly the section would be ineffective to meet the purpose intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If you got some of the diseases the Parliamentary Secretary has, it would make a tremendous improvement in you, but they are not infectious unfortunately.  That machinery, as I say, was unsatisfactory, and, in 1919, regulations were made which provided the type of machinery we are providing in this Bill.  I hope I will not be accused of misleading the House.  I had better make sure of reading them so as to safeguard myself fully.  Article 19 (2) of the 1919 regulations provided:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any suitable hospital or place for the reception of the sick is provided within the district of a sanitary authority or within a convenient distance of such district, any person who is suffering from malaria, dysentery, trench fever and is without proper lodging or accommodation or <Col N="1075" /> is lodged in a room occupied by more than one family or is on board any ship, vessel or boat or is lodged in any common lodging house or is in any place where such person cannot be effectively isolated so as to prevent the spread of the disease may on a certificate signed by the medical officer of health and with the consent of the superintending body of such hospital or place be removed to such hospital or place at the cost of the sanitary authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These regulations remained in operation until 1929.  They, at any rate, established the principle of isolating persons suffering from certain specified infectious diseases who are a probable source of infection on the certificate of the medical officer of health. Therefore, so far as this particular departure&mdash;which has been the subject of a good deal of criticism&mdash;is concerned, it is not of a very novel nature either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the provision there whereby the patient, if he desired, could ask for an appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no provision at all for an appeal.  So far as the provision for appeal was concerned, not only could the justice of the peace, and subsequently the district justice, order the original or intermittent detention of the patient, but he could order the continued detention if, after the disease in its acute form had spent itself, it would appear to be dangerous to allow the person out of the institution. The medical officer could get an order from the district justice, or the justice of the peace that preceded him, detaining the patient for any specified length of time and by renewing the detention order from time to time, he could keep him in custody indefinitely. When the emergency began, and we found ourselves in difficulties again in regard to this particular problem of rapidly isolating a patient who was either a contact or actually suffering from an infectious disease, we found that the machinery we had would not operate with sufficient rapidity to ensure the safety of the community. Under an Emergency Powers Order, we set up the machinery that has operated <Col N="1076" /> from 1940 down to the present day, that is, for the past six years. Under that Order, the Minister orders the detention of a person.  We have detained quite a number of people under that Order.  Deputy Mulcahy got the particulars, in answer to a question.  It was a considerable number&mdash;I think, 160&mdash;within the past six years.  Clearly, that machinery is not as satisfactory as the machinery proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The number was 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I included the contacts. What has the Minister to guide him?  He is requested by telephone or telegram to issue an Order for the detention of Mr. X and Mrs. X and the little X's, who are probable sources of infection.  He cannot take the responsibility of refusing to give the Order, because if he has confidence at all in his chief medical officers of health he has to decide that the responsible officer would not ask him to make such an Order unless he believed it was necessary.  Consequently, we have made these Orders, we have never seen the patients, we have to assume that our officers will act in a responsible way, and we are fortified in that assumption by the knowledge that they do act in a reasonable way and that the medical profession is a noble profession with the highest traditions &mdash;even though I do belong to it, and the profession will be forgiven for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of all that experience of the different types of machinery set up from time to time to deal with this matter, the machinery set out in Section 29 has been devised.  I feel it is a reasonable proposition to put to the House that, in consideration of the fact that an immediate appeal can be made to the Minister if any person feels aggrieved because of the exercise of a detention order, we ought to allow the chief medical officer of health to exercise his judgment in this matter.  I do not believe any hardship will be inflicted on anybody, but I do say that, under the terms of the provision, no continuing hardship can operate, because an appeal lies to the Minister.  If anybody is dissatisfied, the case can be expeditiously and thoroughly investigated <Col N="1077" /> and if a person should not be detained he will be detained no longer. The machinery set out in this amendment could not work expeditiously and could only give rise to friction.  It could only operate, in my opinion, to defeat the object and intention of the section. I do not know how strongly Deputies feel as to the propriety of making the amendments that are suggested here, but I think it would be highly injudicious to pursue this line and set up this particular type of machinery.  It would be wiser to leave us the machinery proposed in the Bill.  I feel perfectly certain that, if I come back in old age to whomsoever is in this House in 20 years&mdash;if we live that length of time&mdash; I will be told that no hardship has been inflicted on anyone under the terms of Section 29.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has made a case for the appeal.  He has reminded the House that it was always considered necessary to have some person other than the medical officer himself.  In the old days, it was considered necessary to go before the local justice of the peace. That was up to 1919.  It must be remembered that, in those days, we had not the same wording as we have now, it was not a question of &ldquo;probable source of infection.&rdquo;  It was then for specific infectious disease.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the justice of the peace had to be guided by the medical officer making the application for the detention order.  I do not think he was confined to that.  I do not know if there was anything to debar the person concerned from getting another medical opinion and having that put before the justice of the peace.  That system was changed in 1919, but even after that it was still considered necessary to have some check.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, again quoting from the regulations of 1919, whether intentionally or not, was trying to give the impression to the House that those regulations dealt with the same sort of thing as he is trying to deal with under this section.  It was not the same.  First and foremost, the <Col N="1078" /> powers such as they were in 1919, were not as great and, secondly, they were only in respect of specified infectious diseases, actually named and limited. Here we are dealing with &ldquo;a probable source of infection&rdquo;.  After 1919, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, the Minister had to make the order, at the request of the chief county medical officer of health.  Even that in itself was a check, since no such officer would ask the Minister to make an order unless he were absolutely satisfied as to the reason for the order.  Now we are asked to depart from that procedure, in respect of a far wider range of diseases, and even then not for specified diseases, but for cases where a person may be considered to be &ldquo;a probable source of infection&rdquo;.  The Parliamentary Secretary is asking that whatever safeguards were thought necessary, not only during our own period from 1922 to this date, but even during the British period, they are now to be wiped out completely by this Bill.  I do not think the House ought to give the unrestricted powers for which the Parliamentary Secretary is looking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of case that I am concerned with is what is known in typhoid as an intermittent carrier.  I speak here without any specialised knowledge, but I understand that in cases of typhoid a person may be a source of infection for a short time, then there may be an interim period during which that person is no longer a source of infection, and then at a later period he becomes again a source of infection.  In a case like that I do not know what the period may be when the person would be a source of infection, but I understand that one case resulted in a number of people becoming infected, and it was then this particular type of carrier was discovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a person who appeals to the Minister.  The Minister, I presume, then consults the county medical officer of health.  Is there any provision whereby the person concerned could have independent medical advice, or an independent medical adviser who would also report to the Minister?  In such a case it is desirable that the Minister should act not merely on the opinion of the county <Col N="1079" /> medical officer of health who, no doubt, would be acting <i>bona fide.</i>  In some of these very difficult stages of a disease where a doubt may exist, I think the doubt should always be resolved in favour of the patient, because the liberty of the subject is important. Where a person is detained, possibly for a lengthy period, an independent adviser should be available, not alone from the patient's but also from the Minister's point of view, to consult with and give an opinion.  In that way the person concerned will have the full benefit of medical opinion.</P>

      <P>I would like to put this point to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Nobody wants to tie the medical officer of health or other competent medical authorities into knots. Nobody wants to prevent the removal of a source, or a probable source, of infection.  But what are the safeguards against a mistake in a medical opinion or, a still graver thing, a miscarriage of justice?  Could something be inserted into the sub-section which will provide for the right of examination after the person has been removed to a hospital or other place, to quote the words of the section?  In other words, could some system be devised whereby the medical officer of health would be given the widest powers to which his position would entitle him and also give the person concerned certain safeguards against being held up for a long period, perhaps through a mistake on the part of the medical authority or perhaps through the more unlikely but still graver case of an actual miscarriage of justice?</P>

      <P>Might I say first, in reply to Deputy Morrissey, that I will refer him to Sections 61 and 65 of the Act of 1907?  He will find that under these sections the procedure by court order applies to all infectious diseases.  The regulations under the 1919 Act are confined to specified diseases, but all <Col N="1080" /> infectious diseases are covered by Sections 61 and 65 of the 1907 Act.  It is there we have the round-about machinery of going through the court to get an order.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the difficulty of the intermittent carrier. The intermittent carrier does undoubtedly present a difficulty.  It would be altogether wrong to assume that any or all carriers will be detained in an institution under this section until he or they are definitely and finally rid of the carrier condition. Let me take an intermittent carrier, for example.  For periods that medical scientists cannot estimate&mdash; they can only ascertain by frequent and periodical examination&mdash;the intermittent carrier will be found not to be a probable source of infection. In other words, a probable source of infection this week may, in the course of a few weeks, clear up for a period and then become a probable source of infection later on.  That type of case is difficult to deal with, because you cannot estimate in advance how long such a patient is likely to go free from the carrier condition.</P>
      <P>Let us take a case of infantile paralysis.  It is now fairly generally accepted by medical scientists that the virus which causes infantile paralysis is excreted for a considerable period after the disease has passed over&mdash;perhaps a matter of months.  They are two types of cases we have to deal with. Coming now to the openly infectious case of tuberculosis, the sputum positive case may become sputum negative for a period and then become sputum positive again, so that we will have to exercise continuing supervision of all types of cases that are carriers, but not necessarily constant or continuing carriers.  It is not proposed or intended that these people should be confined for the rest of their lives in an institution.  These three types of cases will constitute, in the light of our present knowledge, the principal difficulties.  Possibly there will be diphtheria, but it will not constitute so great a difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would hope, and hope with absolute confidence, that, by means of a period of training as to personal conduct, personal hygiene, the treatment <Col N="1081" /> of excreta, and the disposal of sputum &mdash;even if we are not able to cure the carrier condition&mdash;that having given our patient a period of training in an institution as to how it would be necessary to behave in private life in order to protect the community, such a patient can with safety be released to his home.  We would still, through our public health machinery, have to keep in contact with that patient so as to ensure that the precautions which the patient has been taught to take for the protection of the community will continue to be taken.  That is the conception behind the section.  I think it is a reasonable conception.  These are things that cannot be translated into Acts of Parliament.  You have to take powers to do things that appear to be outlandish and even outrageous, but which are absolutely essential.  We do not intend to do anything either outlandish or outrageous.  It may be difficult for the Opposition to try to place that kind of trust and confidence in us.  I think the machinery is reasonable machinery, and that it will work reasonably well.  Once again I say that I do not think any Deputy need fear consequences either to the patient or to the public health under this section.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary directed our attention to Sections 61 and 65 of the Act of 1907, and said that they applied to all the infectious diseases set out in the section that we were discussing&mdash;Section 29&mdash;which deals with the treatment of a person who is a probable source of infection and so on.  It is well to see what are the terms of Section 61 of the Act of 1907 as against what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.  The section, having dealt with the question of putting up a temporary shelter or house accommodation, goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the local authority in pursuance of the aforesaid powers have provided a temporary shelter or house accommodation they may, on the appearance of any infectious disease in a house, and on the certificate of the medical officer, cause any person who is not himself sick, and who consents to leave the house, or whose parent or guardian (where <Col N="1082" /> the person is a child) consents to his leaving the house, to be removed therefrom to any such temporary shelter or house accommodation, and in the like case on the like certificate may cause any such person who does not consent to leave the house to be removed therefrom to any such temporary shelter or house accommodation where two justices, on the application of the local authority, and on being satisfied of the necessity of the removal, make an Order for the removal, subject to such conditions (if any) as are imposed by the Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That section seems to imply that a certain amount of discretion resides in the two justices to have the case proved to them.  The Parliamentary Secretary has made some point about the urgency of dealing with these things.  I do not see that there can be any very serious delay where there is a question of calling in a second opinion, particularly if the case has been dealt with on a medical practitioner's report to the county medical officer.  No doubt, he will have indicated whether he thinks the case is one which should be isolated or not. If there is any conflict of opinion between the person reporting the case and the chief medical officer that will be seen at once, and the calling in of a third person should not involve any great delay.</P>
    <P>To leave the section as it stands savours carrying forward into ordinary peace times the smack for doing things on the hop that the Government got accustomed to by means of dealing with situations through Emergency Powers Orders.  On a number of occasions recently we have been asked to enshrine in our legislation if not a full Emergency Powers Order certainly the seed or the shadow of one.  I do not think it is advisable, since no serious kind of argument has been put forward in support of this, to leave it to the county medical officer of health alone, subject to an appeal to the Minister. The section does not give the necessary power or suggestion of appeal.</P>

      <P>I do not think the amendment that we are discussing <Col N="1083" /> is one that calls for support because of the complicated machinery which it proposes to provide under sub-section (1).  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that he is prepared to consider on Report an alteration of the section in regard to securing the personal examination of a person, a thing which, to my mind, would be satisfactory. There is one point in regard to which I have some difficulty.  I take it that if the medical officer, either through his own personal examination or that of his deputy, satisfies himself that a person is either suffering from an infectious disease or is a probable source of infection, he is still left with discretionary powers under the section to leave the patient in his own home if he is satisfied that the facilities for isolation are satisfactory, and that he is not under any compulsion to order the detention of that person in a hospital or elsewhere.  It is from that point of view that I am still somewhat dissatisfied with the section.  I would be quite satisfied if on the medical officer on his own examination or that of his deputy, having certified that a person is either infected or a source of infection, when it comes to the question of deciding whether it is essential that that person should be removed from his own home to a hospital or place of detention, an opportunity would be afforded of calling in another doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> I say that because all our hospitals and places of detention are not of an equally high standard.  If I or some member of my family were under the necessity of being isolated at the present time we would be faced with a very great difficulty, due to the fact that a distance of a mile or a mile and a half would make a difference as to the choice that would be offered to us in the matter of hospital accommodation. I think that, in cases of this sort, when the medical officer feels that the facilities in the home are not sufficient to provide satisfactory isolation for the patient, those in charge of the patient should be afforded an opportunity of calling in another doctor so that there could be discussion and consideration not only of the conditions in the home but of those in the institution to which the patient would normally be sent.  There is the ever present danger of cross infection as well as the question of general surroundings, and the distance from the home to the institution to which a patient may be sent, especially where the patient happens to be a child.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
