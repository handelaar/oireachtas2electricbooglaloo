The District Electoral Division of Ballynahaglish is not a scheduled division. Having regard to the procedure adopted in selecting districts for scheduling, it would not be possible to include Ballynahaglish without including many adjoining electoral divisions, and electoral divisions elsewhere in which general conditions are not dissimilar.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer questions Nos. 18, 19, 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The number of officers in Portlaoighise Prison is 53.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made for an inspection of Portlaoighise Prison by several members of the Oireachtas, including one of the members of the Dáil representing the constituency of Leix-Offaly.</P>
      <P>The present governor of Portlaoighise Prison was appointed to that post in September, 1987.  He had 17 years previous experience as a governor. Portlaoighise ranks as a Class I prison; particulars of the salaries of governors of such prisons will be found on page 150 of Estimates for the current financial year.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the diligence, humanity and courtesy which this officer has shown throughout his service and particularly in the recent very trying circumstances.</P>
      <P>The following are the contents of the report dated the 27th instant from the medical officer, Portlaoighise Prison, in connection with prisoners Tomás MacCurtain and Liam Rice:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I examined prisoner Tomás MacCurtain this morning.  He was complaining of soreness of the glands of the neck.  There was no evidence of any serious swelling.  He was otherwise in good health.</P>
      <P>I examined prisoner Liam Rice this morning.  He complained of dyspepsia last week, and I put him on a special light diet.  He is quite well again.&rdquo;</P>

In each case, the health of the prisoner is good.  They have all gained weight with the exception of MacCurtain.  He has lost weight very slightly but he is in good form.  There was no such thing as a telephone inquiry.</P>

      <P>That is another question but if the Deputy wishes to have the information I shall tell him.  I was asked by members of the Labour Party to allow representatives from their Party visit Portlaoighise Prison. I said I should like to know who they were as I would not agree to anyone who was not a member of the Oireachtas. They submitted four names, one of them being a member for Laoighis-Offaly, and I agreed to let them go.  I am responsible for the selection.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the wages paid to forestry workers in the Kilrush district of County Clare are 30/- a week plus bonus; that this rate is considered totally inadequate for the district, and is giving rise to unrest amongst the men concerned; further, whether he will consider reviewing and revising the wages conditions applying to these workers with a view to a substantial improvement, and, if so, whether he will indicate if a revised scale will be put into operation before the opening of the next planting season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be misinformed regarding the remuneration of labourers employed at the State Forest, Kilrush, County Clare.  The rate of wages payable to these labourers is 39/- a week, inclusive, for a 48-hour week.  In addition, a differential of 2/- a week over and above the normal rate is paid to a number of the labourers with long service and experience.  I am not aware that the rate payable at Kilrush Forest is considered to be totally inadequate for the district or that it has occasioned unrest amongst the labourers concerned.  The rate compares favourably with the minimum rate of 40/- a week payable in the district to agricultural labourers in respect of a 54-hour week under the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1944.  The wages of forestry labourers are related to the rates payable to other classes of labourers in Government employment and may not be altered at the sole discretion of my Department.  It is the practice to review the rates of wages of forestry labourers in the light of the variations in the minimum rates payable to agricultural labourers under orders promulgated from time to time by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The rates were last reviewed in February, 1944, following the Agricultural Wages <Col N="887" /> (Minimum Rates) Order, 1944, and an increase of 4/- a week was then granted to forestry labourers.</P>

      <P>One would have expected that the Minister would say something at least on the Fifth Stage with regard to the new company that has been actually formed.  When discussing this measure on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage it was indicated that the large properties which the Tourist Board had already acquired were to be transferred to a new company which the Tourist Board were to set up.  But, beyond telling us that a new company would be set up, the Minister gave us no information that the company was actually being set up.  Since the Bill passed through Committee we have seen formal announcements that two companies have been set up (1) a company called Fáilte, Teoranta, and (2) a company called Tráigh Mhór (Tramore Development), Teoranta.  There are two aspects of Fáilte, Teoranta, I should like to say a word about.  The first is a small thing but, nevertheless, it is important.  Why we should call a company set up for the purpose of bringing tourists into the country Fáilte, Teoranta, which means &ldquo;limited welcome&rdquo;, is more than I know.  If, in the usual way, Fáilte, Teoranta, is to be given the usual &ldquo;Teo.&rdquo;, like &ldquo;Ltd.&rdquo; for Limited, we will have this company described as &ldquo;Fáilte, Teo.&rdquo;, &ldquo;a hot welcome&rdquo;.  It is a great pity that whoever was responsible for suggesting this name for the company which is to manage all this property did not know a little more about the Gaelic mind, the subtlety of the Gaelic mind, and the understanding the Gaelic mind has of its own language, because I think the name given to the company is certainly a very absurd one. But the powers taken by the company in its articles of association are even more absurd and more outlandish. This new company, Fáilte Teoranta, are taking power under their articles of association to carry on the business of victuallers, wine and spirit merchants, distillers, maltsters and brewers.  They can manufacture pleasure steamers and other river craft. They can manufacture other sea-going craft.  They can import food and can <Col N="902" /> be brokers of food, including live stock and dead stock.  They can import colonial and foreign produce. They can have hairdressing saloons. There is nothing that a man or woman can carry on in this country as a business or an avocation that Fáilte, Teoranta, in their articles of association have not taken power to carry on.</P>
      <P>When there was an opportunity of discussing this matter to some extent on the Committee Stage, when we were full of curiosity as to what was to happen the properties and as to what kind of a company was to look after them and, in general, what was to be done by the company that would be set up, it is an extraordinary thing that the Minister did not take us into his confidence and explain what was happening.  Here in these articles of association we have, as I say, these extraordinary powers taken by this new company or for this new company by the Tourist Board.  The new company, Fáilte Teoranta, is to be set up by the Tourist Board.  The members will be removable by the Tourist Board at their will and pleasure, and, generally, the Tourist Board are practically to be the lord high victuallers and the lord high manufacturers of pleasure steamers and other things, as well as brewers, maltsters, etc.  We have had to complain already of the ridiculously wide interpretation which the Tourist Board and the Minister put on the powers given under the 1939 Act.  But this is going beyond any stretch of imagination we might have allowed ourselves. I have not seen the articles of association of the Tráigh Mhór Development Company, but judged by the language which has been used in announcing its formation, its powers do not seem to be any less inside the restricted area of Tráigh Mhór than the general powers which the larger company is having over a wide area.  I think we are entitled to some explanation of these matters.  The articles of association state that no dividends will be paid in any of these companies, so I would like to know what is meant by the suggestion that the nominal capital of the company is to be £5,000, divided into 5,000 shares of £1 each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider the nature of the <Col N="903" /> powers taken under the articles of association and the fact that the Minister has already explained to the House that this new company can sell any property that it purchases or develops, we see an enormous avenue opening for traffic in all kinds of businesses and of developing all kinds of businesses and then selling them off. The articles of association give Fáilte, Teoranta, power to set up and promote subsidiary companies to carry on some of its activities and that fact must make us realise that we are having certainly a little minor experiment in absolute and pure totalitarianism. It is extraordinary that we get only a little more of the veil lifted when the articles of association of this new company are published.  Would the Minister put in the Library a copy of the articles of association of these two new companies or of any other company that has been formed or is in process of formation under the Tourist Traffic Acts?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The company to which the Deputy referred, Fáilte, Teoranta, has been established by the Irish Tourist Board as a temporary organisation to take over, manage and develop this property, prior to the disposal of it to the public.  I do not know to what extent the Deputy considers it desirable that the activities of the Tourist Board should be subjected to the supervision and sanction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I have taken the view that it is desirable that, in matters of detail, it should not be subject to Ministerial sanction at all.  Therefore, the position is that I cannot answer for the motives of the board, either in naming the company or in constituting it in a particular way.  I was not consulted on either point.  I approved of the proposal of the board to acquire certain property to be developed as hotels; I approved of the proposal of the board that these properties when acquired should be offered for sale to the public; I approved of the proposal that, to ensure the protection of the board's interest, some interim organisation would be necessary and <Col N="904" /> this company has been formed in pursuance of that idea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the company ultimately will become a privately owned company, I see no reason why the board should impose through the memorandum of association any limitation on its activities that would not be imposed by law. The board, of course, cannot engage in the business of distilling spirits or certain other activities named by Deputy Mulcahy, without other formalities having been completed first. The same circumstances arise in connection with the Tramore Development Company, which is a local company promoted by the board to develop through local enterprise the land which has been reclaimed by the board and which they hope to have developed.  Again, I think it is desirable that the development of properties acquired by the board in that way at holiday resorts should be undertaken by local enterprise rather than by the board itself and I strongly approve of the policy of the board in taking steps to promote local organisations, controlled, and to a large extent financed, by local interests for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that the memoranda of association of these companies are open to inspection somewhere.  I would have no power to require either company to submit these documents either for my approval or for tabling in the Library.  I think, however, it would be possible to procure copies and place them in the Library and I will arrange to have that done; but it will not be because of any view of mine that the details of those documents or the activities of the companies <Col N="905" /> should be subject to review by the Dáil or even subject to review by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The policy in this matter is to get private enterprise at work and the formation of these organisations is purely a step to that end.  They are not intended to be permanent organisations, but intended merely to facilitate the transition from the stage of development by the board to development by private enterprise.</P>

While not finding fault with the size of the Vote itself, I think it demonstrates the extent to which the Department has spread its influence and demonstrates its extended activities.  It strikes me, as it has struck other Deputies, that the influence of the Department in many spheres is a growth of State intervention, if not interference, which, so far as we in this country can see, has not any defined or definite limits.  The tendency over a number of years has been towards a wider extension of State interference and State intervention in many matters which were formerly the sole concern <Col N="906" /> of private enterprise or limited companies.</P>
      <P>During the war it became apparent that the influence of this Department was felt in almost every sphere of industrial activity.  So far as one can see, the general tendency is an extension on those lines rather than any contraction.  While it might be more desirable to discuss some of these activities on particular subjects, such as turf development or aviation, I should like to draw attention to, and if possible get a statement from the Minister on, the extended activities of the Department.  During the war we saw the rise of many companies and, within the last year or two, we have seen that these companies have greatly extended their activities.  I have in mind such companies as Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus and also the Tourist Development Board.  While it is obvious that a company such as the Air Transport Company must have Government sanction and assistance, it is not so desirable that many businesses which might normally be left to private enterprise should have to get the benediction of the Department before proceeding with development.</P>
      <P>We have observed recently, in legislation, that the tendency is to set up companies nominally independent and, in fact, in some cases entirely free from the control of the House, but in connection with which the Government have power to nominate either the chairman or the directors, and there are cases where direct nominees of the Department of Industry and Commerce figure on the boards.  While that may be desirable in companies such as the Air Transport Companies, is it proposed to extend the Department's activities into forms of enterprise which formerly were solely within the sphere of development of individuals, trading under their own names or in companies, but operated free from Government interference?  I am anxious to know whether this form of State intervention will continue, as in recent years, with partial control from the Department, but in most cases without control from the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal objection to those companies is that the Minister has certain <Col N="907" /> powers, but the Dáil has not the right to inquire into the activities of these companies, and the drawback which appears to result from such a situation is that nominally these companies are State companies but, in fact, they are independent.  Most of them have a monopoly.  In one respect they are a form of nationalisation, but ultimately the House has no responsibility and it is only after considerable difficulty that the House is able to get information about them.  I would like to know what the future policy in connection with this matter will be.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that many new proposals for industrial development have come into his Department and some of these proposals show that the promoters intend to develop an export trade and, consequently, will not require protection&mdash;at any rate, protection which will prevent dumping on the home market by outside concerns. What type of company will be set up and what will be the form of industrial expansion?  It appears to me that one of the drawbacks in industrial development has been the degree to which industries are centralised in Dublin and our large towns.  In certain rural areas and in the smaller towns there has been development of a considerable kind.  I am sure Deputies realise that a further extension of industrial development in Dublin must inevitably lead to a greater influx of people from rural areas.  I am sure the Minister and Deputies realise that approximately one-sixth of our population is now centred in Dublin and that is not, so far as the general welfare of the country is concerned, a desirable development.  If further industrial development takes place in Dublin, with an influx of people either from adjoining countries or from further afield, the possibility of maintaining in rural areas people on the land, or at any rate close to the environment of their homes, will be greatly limited.</P>
    <P>There are numerous problems as a result of this extension of population in Dublin.  The first is housing, which is not strictly a matter for the Minister. The fact is that in Dublin and adjoining areas sufficient workers are available <Col N="908" /> for any industrial extensions that may take place and, if the influx from the country continues, the workers who come from the rural areas or the areas around Dublin will be forced, in the event of further employment not being available, to emigrate.  I suggest that a determined effort should be made to decentralise industrial development and establish, in so far as it is possible to do so, by encouragement or through whatever facilities may be available in the Department, businesses and companies in different towns through the country.</P>
    <P>It is not always possible to develop industry in a rural area because of disadvantages from the point of view of transport and other things, which do not apply in developed centres.  I think attention should be paid to suitability from the point of view of the area.  In the South of Ireland, for instance, cheese making concerns and other industries, which draw their materials directly from agriculture, have been established.  A better and more determined effort could be made in smaller towns and in rural localities to extend some forms of industry.  In certain areas, which have historical associations with particular forms of industry, it should be possible to provide employment for people who have an adaptable turn of mind for the types of industry which formerly existed, or which may actually exist there, in an undeveloped sense.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister, when replying, would give some indication of the type of industries proposed to be established.  In connection with the extension of industrial development, I should like to say that, so far as one can judge results over a number of years, it has not shown any appreciable increase in the numbers employed, or any appreciable reduction in the emigration tendency.  Even before the recent was considerable industrial development took place, and a great amount of propaganda was indulged in by interested parties, to the effect that such development was absorbing many people in employment.  While, strictly in accordance with actual development, it could be said that a number of people were absorbed, on the other hand, a <Col N="909" /> very considerable number left employment on the land.  So that while there may have been an extension in industrial development, as regards the provision of certain commodities which were not formerly available, the fact that people left the land must give the Dáil and the country certain food for thought.  I think we will have to concentrate on affording protection to industries which will supply either commodities that cannot be imported, or that can only be imported at a price far in excess of home produced commodities with a particular local environment, which makes it incumbent on the Government and the State to see that such industries should be established.</P>
    <P>While particular attention has been paid to the question of protection, in the long run it is unwise for protection to be given to industries which react unfavourably on agriculture, or put up the cost, as a result of the commodities being manufactured at home, of either raw materials, machinery or other necessary requirements of agriculture. I am glad to learn from the Minister's speech that, so far as the Department is concerned, for the future industries are to be protected only in so far as that is essential in the early stages, and in order to prevent dumping of goods of a similar character from outside. That is a wise departure, and I think will pay a good dividend to the community. In many cases in the past protection was given where, so far as the general good of the country was concerned, it would have been wiser and better policy, if not to withdraw protection to give more limited protection than was given.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal next with fertilisers. The Minister stated that he hoped to be in a position to import large quantities of fertilisers, but he was not able to say what the exact position would be.  As he is aware, while the net output of agriculture increased in the last few years, as distinct from pre-war, the fact is that that was achieved possibly with a smaller number of people being employed, or with a smaller supply of farmyard manure or artificial manure.  While greater energy and better methods of <Col N="910" /> farming have been adopted, it is obvious that the soil has been seriously depleted and fertility used up which must be replaced, if we are to continue the present production, or if we are to have any greater production. In view of the fact that wheat growing is compulsory, and is likely to remain so for a number of years, I urge the Minister to see that every effort is made to increase the supply of fertilisers, and also the supply of machinery.  During the war many farmers were forced to rely on whatever improvements they could make on existing machinery.  In many cases that machinery has become derelict. New types of machinery have been brought into operation elsewhere, and that puts our farmers into a disadvantageous position, whether with those in England or elsewhere.  I would be glad if the Minister made efforts to secure elsewhere tractors and other essential machinery.  It appears that on the Minister's visit to London some time ago he made representations, particularly with regard to a supply of tractors, and he stated that attention was being paid to the provision of a smaller type of tractor.  I do not know if any tests have been made, but some tractors which I saw were of the light kind.  While they worked well on light soil over small areas they were totally unsuitable for large scale working.  Before tractors are imported attention should be paid to the necessity of seeing whether they are suitable for heavy soil or on large farms.</P>
    <P>Other matters to which the Minister referred, and which are of great importance, are timber and cotton.  The Minister stated that he hoped to import approximately 15,000 Petrograd standards, and that normally 70,000 standards a year were imported.  As far as I can understand from builders, next to the difficulty of securing land at reasonable prices, timber is undoubtedly the biggest drawback.  I assume that the Department is making every effort to import large quantities, and that the timber which is being imported will be suitable for building work. It is obvious that the home supply of timber has greatly diminished, and that <Col N="911" /> that is continuing more rapidly than any extension of planting, or that the supply could make good.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister would say what are the prospects of securing a supply of baths.  I understand that timber and baths are holding up an extension of house building in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that it was still very difficult to get supplies of cotton, and that no increase in supplies was likely.  I understand that in March of last year the supply of cotton yarn was reduced by one-fifth, and subsequently was reduced in effect to one-tenth, as the cotton spinners and weavers were taking the available supply for thread, the amount available for the production of cloth being thereby reduced to one-tenth.  At present home-produced cotton goods made from South American yarn cost from two to two and a half times the price of imported materials made in England.  I do not know if the Minister's Department has given any attention to this problem, but, so far as I can see, the situation is that cotton yarn and cotton piece goods are produced in England from yarn costing approximately 3/2 per lb. while similar goods are made here from imported South American yarn costing over 7/- per lb, so that the home cotton materials manufacturers have to make goods from a raw material costing something over 7/- as against raw material costing 3/- in England.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would say what efforts have been made to secure a supply of cotton at a cheaper rate.  I assume that the British Cotton Control Board are limiting the exports of cotton yarn or materials made into wearing apparel to this country, but I know at least one industrialist who has imported the machinery and who would be in a position to go into production if he had the cotton yarn.  I take it that the Minister and his Department are doing everything they can in the matter of the import of these materials, but some industrialists and many people are wondering why all clothing materials have risen so much in price here and why a better effort was not made to control the prices of clothing. <Col N="912" /> It may be that some of these people got a few lengths start on the Department, but the fact is, that so far as the cost of living is concerned, clothing is one of the factors in which there has been a price increase far greater than in any other factor and for the reduction of which a far less successful effort was made.  I should like to hear from the Minister that his Department will leave nothing undone to make a supply of these commodities available at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred, towards the end of his introductory speech, to the air agreements and to the extension of the air companies in this country.  The Minister and his Department deserve the congratulations of the House for the manner in which they managed the air agreements and for the extension of air facilities, both here and elsewhere, which has been brought about.  It reflects credit on the country, on the Department and on the Minister that these agreements have been so successful and have put this country on the map in relation to air development.  It is satisfactory to know that we have extended our aerodromes and our air facilities and that it is proposed to undertake flights to different parts of Europe, and possibly eventually to the United States.</P>
    <P>I understand that a number of pilots have been engaged by Aer Lingus, and that, while some of them have been drawn from the Air Corps here, a number have been drawn from outside sources.  It is natural that pilots in the Air Corps here had not the same facilities as pilots elsewhere during the war, but if pilots are available from the Air Corps in future, I suggest that they should be given a course of training elsewhere in order to fit them for commercial flying; in other words, to make up for the lack of facilities in the past.  If these pilots are available they should get preference. I appreciate that a certain number of pilots were required in a short time and that those available in the home pool were drawn on, and then pilots from elsewhere employed, but in the future facilities should be afforded to home-trained pilots.  So far as I am aware, a number of the pilots who <Col N="913" /> were trained in the R.A.F. are Irishmen, but I think facilities should be given to pilots trained in the Air Corps here.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the 1938 Trade Agreement and said that it made provision for the examination of tariffs by the Prices Commission on the initiative of British trading interests. I should like to know if the Minister can say what the proposals are for revising the trade agreement and if he can give any indication to the House as to the terms of the revision, and if in future price control will be made more effective.  The Minister said that the old Tariff Commission worked too slowly and was too cumbersome for many industries, because the benefit of a tariff could be forestalled by the export or import of commodities.  If the Tariff Commission, or the Prices Commission, which, to a certain extent replaced it, could be made more effective in the matter of price control, it would certainly have a far better effect on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>While it is obvious that the old system under which selective tariffs were decided by the Tariff Commission had many disadvantages, if a more expeditious method could be employed, under which the protection to be afforded could be decided with greater alacrity so as to prevent dumping, it would be more satisfactory.  So far as we on these benches are concerned, one of the matters in relation to which the Department of Supplies was defective was the control of prices and particularly of commodities such as clothes.  I should be glad if the Minister would give an indication of the new methods to be adopted by the Prices Commission to make price control effective.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is not strictly one for the Department, but in view of the fact that it affects commercial travellers, I want to ask the Minister to make representations to the Minister for Justice in regard to it.  I understand that the parking regulations which limit the time of parking in the city adversely affect commercial travellers and interfere considerably with their business, and I <Col N="914" /> should be glad if the Minister would make representations to the Minister for Justice on the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister this year is in the comfortable position of representing only one Department and we also are in the comfortable position that we have not to try to segregate in our minds what particular Minister we should address.  His Department is certainly wide enough to require all the energies of a very energetic Minister and in his introductory statement on Friday last he covered a very wide field in a very short space of time. The Minister's statement was, I think, very gratifying inasmuch as he held out a hope for considerable industrial expansion without the aid of very extensive protection.  That is a prospect which everybody will welcome and which I think the manufacturers themselves will welcome while availing of any opportunity which world circumstances will provide in order to enable them to compete, not only in the home market but also in external markets.  I think this country has made considerable progress industrially in one direction; that is, that during the years of the emergency our manufacturers, in common with other producers, had to face up to very grim realities and had in many cases to rely upon their own resources and to adopt improvised methods of overcoming exceptional and unexpected difficulties.  I think the fact that our manufacturers have managed to keep up a fair level of production during the emergency and did manage to avoid having to dispense with a very larger proportion of their employees is a matter for gratification.  I think the fact that such a measure of success has been achieved during the emergency must inspire a considerable amount of confidence in facing the difficulties of the future because I believe that nothing is so important in the development of privately owned industries as confidence&mdash;self-confidence on the part of the manufacturers and their workers, and a realisation that they are at least as good as the managers or workers in similar industries in other countries given, of course, a fair chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> We all know that this country has not a long industrial tradition and that such a tradition will take some time to establish.  As I pointed out, the emergency period did, I think, lay the foundation for the establishment of such a tradition and I think, as the Minister suggested, in the conditions which prevail in the country at the present time every opportunity for industrial expansion here and extension into external markets will help still further to develop confidence in our industries.  The Minister made one statement which, while I admire him for drawing attention to it, might appear to be to some extent a reflection on the general economic policy of the Government.  He admitted that the home market for Irish industries depends mainly on the prosperity of agriculture.  I for one feel that one of the greatest mistakes made by the present Government in regard to economic policy was its failure to realise that sooner and that they did not seek to raise the standard of prosperity in agriculture during the early stages of their tenure of office and thereby provide a better market for industrial products.  However, it is satisfactory to know that the Minister realises now that the basis of industrial prosperity in this country is a thriving agricultural population with ample purchasing power.  In the Minister's realisation of that now there is hope that our economic development in future will be sound.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with the Minister in his statement that, while it may not be necessary to provide a very far reaching measure of protection in the home industries during the next few years, it will always be necessary for the Government to have such powers as will enable them to act speedily for the protection of any industry endangered by dumping, or by some action on the part of another nation.  That, I think, is a matter upon which all will be in complete agreement.</P>
    <P>There is at the present time in this country a very wide measure of agreement in regard to industrial development and the lines upon which it ought to proceed.  In other nations in <Col N="916" /> the past there have been long and bitter controversies regarding the rival merits of free trade and protection.  I think that question is now completely out of date.  If there is general agreement on this question as to the desirability and necessity of extending industries then it is only a matter of commonsense to find out what is the best and most effective means of achieving that object.  It is not a question around which Party contention or Party conflict can rage.  The main guiding principle for the Government should be, I think, to take into consultation at all times those who are engaged in industry, whether they be engaged on a large or small scale.  I feel&mdash;and I think it is widely felt throughout the country &mdash;that there is a tendency on the part of the Minister, as there is a tendency on the part of other Ministers, to be guided exclusively by the permanent officials of his own Department.  We all know that when the 1938 Trade Agreement was being negotiated between our Government and the Government of Great Britain the British Government was all during the progress of those negotiations in close consultation with the various industrial groups in Great Britain.  Our Government here, however, concluded that agreement without consulting industries here at all, and certainly without consulting the organisation which represents Irish industry.  That, I think, is a mistake which should be avoided in the future. While the Minister is a well informed administrator whose Department is generally recognised to be efficient, no one knows as fully and accurately the needs of a particular industry as the man actually engaged in the industry. If manufacturers were brought into closer consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce there would be less likelihood of serious mistakes occurring in the shaping of industrial policy and the negotiation of agreements in regard to our external market.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of what appears to me to be strange and inexplicable policy on the part of the Minister in regard to a particular industry.  I refer to Solus Teoranta which engages in the manufacture of <Col N="917" /> glassware.  That industry, as everyone knows, rendered great service to the nation during the emergency.  The industry was producing drinking glasses and was proceeding efficiently and satisfactorily in that line of production. Their products were of very high quality, as is generally acknowledged. Owing to the fact that production was of hand-made articles of high quality, the industry could not compete with the machine-made products of Great Britain, and when the British exported machine-made products of inferior quality at a much lower price, Solus Teoranta were definitely unable to compete.  That will be appreciated. The company showed initiative and enterprise when they found they could not hold their place in the home market, in exporting to the British market and they succeeded in placing their products on the British market, proving that their products were equal to anything of a similar type which could be produced in Great Britain. They showed that they were able to compete on equal terms in the British market.  That was a satisfactory achievement.  The British Government, however, immediately prohibited the importation of these particular products into Great Britain.  Then the position was that the company were unable to compete in the home market because of the dumping of cheap and inferior products at a price less than that at which they were sold in Great Britain, and were prohibited from exporting to Great Britain.  That is a matter in which the Government should have intervened.  Two courses would appear to be open to the Government, either to prohibit or restrict the importation of these products to this country or, alternatively, to negotiate with the British Government for the removal of the prohibition on the importation of our goods into Great Britain.  I think there was an obligation on our Government to adopt either of these courses, but neither course has been adopted, as far as one can see.  This industry faces great difficulty and perhaps extinction unless the position can be altered.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say that it is open to Solus Teoranta to install <Col N="918" /> machinery for the production of cheap and inferior glassware and thus be in a position to compete successfully in the home market with the imported article.  The question arises as to whether that is sound policy or not. The produce of Solus Teoranta is of high quality and its manufacture requires a relatively large number of employees.  The installation of machinery to produce cheap and inferior glassware would mean the disemployment of a large number of workers in the industry.  There seems to be a sound case for taking either of the steps I have outlined, namely, to protect this particular product in the home market or to secure by negotiation a reasonable share of the British market for it. There is no doubt that it can compete on equal terms with the same type of superior product and that the industry is not what could be described as an inefficient or undesirable industry. That, of course, raises a lot of questions in regard to other industries which might be in a similar position, industries producing a good-class product but unable to compete with a very inferior and perhaps undesirable product. In that case one cannot be guided by the price factor alone.  I think the Minister ought to take this matter into serious consideration and see that something effective is done about it.</P>
    <P>In seeking to expand industry, there is nothing more important, I think, than intensive research, and the making available of the results of such research to those who are prepared to put their capital, their brains and their initiative into production.  I would like to stress very strongly that there are two branches of industrial production in regard to which research is urgently required at the present time.  The first is building&mdash; the manufacture of building materials of every kind, and seeing how far we can substitute home-produced raw materials for those imported; how far we can eliminate, to the greatest possible extent, the use of imported timber as well as other commodities which are difficult to import in sufficient quantities.  That matter is, of course, particularly urgent in view of the shortage <Col N="919" /> of housing accommodation and the need for intensive building.  The second matter in regard to which intensive research should be carried on, is the production of fertilisers for agriculture.  One might almost say that this country has no sources for the supply of the raw materials for fertilisers.  Whatever we have is very limited, but that limited quantity ought to be developed to the fullest possible extent.  We ought to see how far it is possible to produce nitrates which are so urgently needed for the soil.  I believe there is no possibility of producing potassic manures here. At any rate, we can do very little in that direction.  Therefore, great efforts should be made to secure material from the Continent, or wherever it is available, because, I think, there is nothing which is making itself more clearly felt in the growing of crops at the present time than the deficiency of potash.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to know that there are good prospects of industrial expansion here.  It is necessary, at the same time, to point out to the Minister and to impress strongly on him, the desirability of ensuring that industries in the future will be decentralised to the greatest possible extent.  There is a natural tendency to extend and develop new industries in the larger centres of population.  Rail facilities and, perhaps, the availability of labour and shipping facilities, tend to influence development in that direction.  I think, however, that anybody who considers the matter seriously must realise that it is an extremely undesirable thing to go on draining the population of the provinces into the City of Dublin, thereby creating a huge centre of population here which is altogether out of proportion to the size, population and resources of the nation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, or those who are contemplating the development of industry, are looking around for some new centre in which to develop and set up a new industry, I would like to direct their attention to Wicklow town which, I may say, has an industrial tradition. It has one small industry of a seasonal nature, but there have been industries <Col N="920" /> there in the past.  In particular, we have the village of Rathnew, which is outside Wicklow town.  You have at Rathnew a population of workers who were able to find industrial employment there many years ago.  The village was more or less established when there was a brickworks and some other industries there.  Now, the position is that you have a very large working population there who have never been able to find adequate employment.  I think that the town is ideally suited for the development of some new industry.</P>
    <P>So that it may not be thought that I am particularly concerned about Wicklow because it happens to be my own constituency, I would also like to draw the Minister's attention to the desirability of establishing new industries in the congested areas in the West.  There can be no lasting and permanent solution for the problems which arise out of congestion in the western counties except by the development in them of sound productive industries.  I think that whatever disadvantages might arise which would deter industrialists from considering such areas, there is this advantage that should not be lost sight of: that you have in the western counties a large working population, and that a great proportion of those that compose that population have had an industrial experience of some kind or other.  I think, therefore, that where you have such a reservoir of good and efficient workers to draw upon it should act as an inducement for the establishment of an industry in a particular area.</P>
    <P>I gathered from the Minister's statement that it is intended to replace the Standstill Order with machinery to ensure a reasonable solution of the problem of wages and conditions of employment. That, I think, is a step in the right direction.  It is a matter which should be handled with extreme care.  If it is handled properly, it will save the country a great deal of expense and save our industries a great deal of the loss which arises from trade disputes.</P>
    <P>The Minister is still, though no longer Minister for Supplies, in control to a very large extent of the <Col N="921" /> essential supplies of the nation.  He indicated that the position in regard to wheat was precarious and, at the same time, he mentioned that petrol supplies have somewhat improved. There is a sort of connection between those two commodities to which I should like to refer.  In my constituency, there was a considerable agitation to induce the Minister to make more petrol available to merchants to enable them to distribute supplies of seed wheat, artificial manures and fertilisers&mdash;but, particularly, seed wheat&mdash;to farmers.  A city merchant whom I know found that he was unable to dispose of a very large quantity of seed wheat because of the refusal of the Department to give him an allowance of petrol.  The Minister may say that, if farmers wanted seed wheat, they could go to the merchant's yard or store for it.  This merchant was supplying an area with a radius of over 20 miles and we know the condition of the roads.  Most of the main roads are tarred and are not suitable for horse traffic, so that it was physically impossible for farmers to secure the seed.  I know that farmers were compelled to sow a minimum acreage but a number of farmers would have sown more than the minimum if they could have got the wheat delivered to their farms.  Unfortunately, the Minister hardened his heart and refused to make any concessions. If control of petrol supplies continues in the future, this particular branch of activity should be considered.  Allowances of petrol should be made available to merchants not only to deliver the seeds and other requirements of farmers but also to collect farmers' produce.  I had also complaints from merchants who are engaged in the purchase of table potatoes from farmers.  Here, again, the Minister refused to allow a supply of petrol for the use of lorries engaged in the collection of table potatoes.  The Minister should co-operate with the agriculturists, so as to obtain the maximum production from the land.  It is very unsatisfactory that, to save a few gallons of petrol, a considerable amount of wheat, which would otherwise have been sown, was not sown and had to <Col N="922" /> be returned to the mills.  That was false economy.</P>
    <P>I understand that an allowance of kerosene for domestic purposes will be made available after August.  I received some complaints from farmers regarding the refusal of an allowance of kerosene in rural areas for the summer months.  Viewing the matter from the city standpoint, the Minister may think that there is sufficient daylight during the summer for anybody to carry on his ordinary avocation but certain branches of the agricultural industry do not terminate with the setting of the sun.  The Minister may know that calves are frequently born during the night.  Night time in summer can be as dark as in the middle of winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has a chance of hearing it now.  He may not be aware that many good farmers consider it necessary to provide light for a sow when she is rearing her family, particularly during their infancy.  That is impossible at present, as there is no kerosene. That places a restriction on the farmer's industry.  There has been a widespread tendency for farmers to get out of the keeping of brood sows and it is handicaps of this kind which influence the farmer's decision.  I think that there should be a basic allowance of kerosene all the year round.  To meet the emergencies that will arise on farmers' holdings at night time, it is essential that kerosene should be available, and I think that a small allowance is possible.  Animals will get sick in the night; they are not machines.  This may be a small matter but it is very important so far as the agricultural community are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Norton in advocating a forward step regarding the establishment of a merchant fleet. It is not only important but absolutely essential that we should have a larger number of Irish-owned ships for the export of our products and for the import of the goods we require.  The establishment of a merchant fleet will tend to encourage the development of other industries, such as the repair and <Col N="923" /> building of ships, and will help to make our people a little more sea-minded, which, in itself, would be an encouragement to the development of external trade.  As an island country, it is essential we should extend our external trade in every way possible.  Whatever obstacles there may be to the provision of our own merchant fleet should be faced and overcome with vigour and determination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It affords me great pleasure to pay a very well deserved compliment to the Minister for the manner in which he has administered this Department since the emergency started.  The country and the Minister were faced with a very formidable crisis, so far as the supply position was concerned, at the outbreak of war and the full history of that period would not be complete without paying a deserved compliment both to the Minister and the officials of the Department for the efficient manner in which they dealt with the problems confronting them.  They had to deal with matters that were completely outside their purview heretofore.  They were faced with very great difficulties from time to time and I think the country and the Dáil are very grateful to the Minister for the capable manner in which these difficulties were solved.  At one time it was thought that this country would not be able to procure a number of essential commodities at all.  One heard a lot of criticism and people were dissatisfied because certain essential commodities and wares were in short supply but, when we consider the geographical position of this country and its small area, I think it will be generally recognised that we have been very fortunate.  Had it not been for the foresight of the Minister and of the Government in starting and in encouraging the establishment of so many industries in our country prior to the emergency, it is doubtful if we would have survived at all.  That we did so, is to be attributed in a large measure to the wise policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wise and original judgment of the Minister is revealed in various other fields day after day.  I read with <Col N="924" /> pleasure the statement which he made at the Food Conference which he attended recently in London and was glad to observe how well he upheld the interests of this country at that conference. Again, in the field of aviation, the foresight of the Minister and his Department has been responsible for putting this country on the map.  He was largely responsible for securing for this country the recent very successful Aviation Conference which was attended by representatives from various countries in the world interested in the development of aviation.  I think the success of that conference was a great achievement for a country around which hitherto, if I may say so, a paper wall was built.  Only by original steps of this kind, initiated by an energetic Minister like the Tánaiste, can this country go ahead.  I sincerely hope that he will continue along these lines.</P>
    <P>The small factories that were started in this country may be criticised but the large factories and the small factories provided employment for at least 80,000 workers.  Even during that time and in the face of very adverse circumstances, the Minister and his Department were responsible for enacting the Holidays Act which considerably improved workers' conditions.  I should also like to pay a tribute to him for setting up the Wages Tribunal.  Were it not for the establishment of that tribunal, there would have been a number of serious strikes in this country.  The great success of the Wages Tribunal was due to the fact that it was a voluntary system.  A certain code of honour was established as between workers and industrialists and other employers.  They sat round a table under a neutral chairman, they exchanged views and, as a result, a better feeling was established between them.  One employer would agree to the decision of the tribunal and another employer who might have been opposed to any concessions would then say: &ldquo;Since he has agreed, it is as well for me to agree also.&rdquo;  If, at any time, the Minister, in his wisdom, decided to make that compulsory, you would have various interests in the country organising against it.  I am <Col N="925" /> speaking with authority on this matter. I have authority both from employers who have been at the tribunal and from workers' representatives also.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to observe also that the Minister's original mind is working towards the creation of an industrial court.  I think an industrial court which brings about a voluntary exchange of views between employers and employees will be a big benefit to the country.  I think it only right, of course, that workers should have the privilege to go on strike if they feel like it but sometimes we have an irresponsible element amongst the workers who will not be guided by the advice of the trade union leaders and will insist on bringing off a lightning strike.  They will not recognise the authority of the trade union.  The victims of these strikes are generally the unfortunate wives and families of these men.  If an industrial court can eliminate strikes of that kind, then I think it will be generally welcomed by all Parties.</P>
    <P>Turning to the more critical side of the Estimate for a moment, there are a few remarks which I should like to make.  There are a few problems in this country with which I have dealt on previous occasions, sometimes in connection with another Department, the Department responsible for the foreshores of this country.  Hence I do not want to tax the Minister with full responsibility for this matter but I should like him to hold a watching brief so far as possible in regard to the subject of coast erosion, especially as regards a portion of my constituency. This is a problem that is becoming rather serious, but if it were tackled in a comprehensive manner I think something could be done to help unemployment.  I know that in a country like ours, which is completely surrounded by water, if the problem of coast erosion were taken seriously, it would tax the resources of the State to breaking point but, nevertheless, I should like the Minister to give his earnest consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>Another question in which I am interested is the acquisition of boats and ships.  During the recent war we had the experience of trying to buy boats in <Col N="926" /> foreign countries.  We were glad to get boats or ships of any kind to bring supplies to this country.  Now that we have gained experience, as the result of that terrible war, we should by every means in our power encourage the creation of a merchant fleet here.  I know that a country like ours will be up against very severe competition and that when things settle down later on, there will be a cut-price competition for the carriage of supplies from one country to another.  It will be very difficult to compete with that but I think that to have the honour and satisfaction of knowing that our ships were sailing to various countries throughout the world would be a very big compensation for any expense.  It would at least put our country on the map and, politically and economically, it would assist the nation materially.  I know that the Minister is, at the moment, working on a number of post-emergency schemes and I should like if he would give that matter some consideration because we have a problem in the country at the moment that is very difficult to solve.  The Minister should try, in the larger areas where we have a lot of unemployment, to institute some kind of national work to relieve that unemployment.  I know that the decentralisation of factories is a very essential matter and probably would be responsible for keeping our population decentralised.  But, in spite of that, I know places in my own constituency in which there are factories where there is still a number of people unemployed. I know that a number of emergency schemes have been brought in and relief grants given from time to time.  It is a big problem, however, and I should like the Minister and his Department, when planning for post-emergency schemes, to consider that matter.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister's Department to consider the possibility of setting up industries here and there through the country for the manufacture of a number of types of farm machinery.  During the emergency, owing to the increased amount of tillage that had to be done, farmers found themselves handicapped by the <Col N="927" /> lack of certain classes of machinery to reap the crops, etc.  It looks as if we will have to depend on our own efforts for a long time so far as agricultural products are concerned, and, in addition, owing to the present state of Europe, it looks as if this country will be asked to contribute her share of agricultural products.  For that reason, I am sure the Minister will do his best to help the farmers.  In some parts of the country, especially in my constituency, some of the land which has been producing wheat for four or five years is in a very bad way for want of manuring.  Some of that land, of course, has been let in conacre.  The people concerned are crying out for artificial manures.  I know the Minister has done his best in connection with that matter and I merely mention it in passing.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the necessity for a supply of kerosene for farmers.  I should like the Minister and his Department to consider that matter.  Representations have been made to me by a number of farmers about the matter, especially farmers who go in for pig-rearing.  It is necessary for them to have some artificial light at night when attending to sows. These people are deprived of their ordinary allowance of kerosene during the summer.  I must say that whenever I have made representations to the Department on matters of that kind they have given them favourable consideration. I think, however, that this is a matter which should be favourably considered.  Those who are engaged in the dairying business, of course, get an allowance of kerosene.  But in parts of the country where people go in for pig-rearing it is a genuine grievance on their part that they are not given an allowance.  You often hear complaints of a sow lying on the bonhams at night owing to the absence of light.</P>
    <P>There is another matter as to which I have been trying to get an explanation. The Prices Commission have done really fine work during the emergency and I know they were up against very knotty problems.  It is very easy, of course, for Deputies to criticise and find fault with people who are carrying <Col N="928" /> on the administration of State matters. But I cannot understand why the price of clothes, especially men's clothes, has gone up so much.  A great part of the material used is manufactured in our own country.  I know, of course, that certain materials have to be imported. You cannot get a decent man's suit for less that £12 12s. Od. or £14 14s. Od. You can, of course, get a shoddy suit which will shrink in the first shower of rain, but, if you want any class of a decent suit, it will cost £12 12s. Od. or £14 14s. Od.  That is really a very high price for a suit of clothes.  I know that we should be grateful that we can procure suits at all and that I can be told that if I were in France or some other country I would have to pay very much more for a suit.  I should, however, like an explanation of the matter.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear that the Minister is doing his best to import timber into this country.  We cannot go ahead with our building programme until we get the necessary timber.  I know that there is a world shortage of timber owing to the devastation which has been wrought in European countries. There is no use in making nonsensical requests, because I know the Minister and his Department have been doing their best to procure timber supplies for this country.  I saw in the newspapers last week that some houses which were under construction had to be left unfinished owing to a shortage of baths.  That, of course, is due to the emergency and goes to show how essential our factories were during that period and how many other things we would have been short of if it were not for the wise policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to compliment the Minister and his Department on the manner in which they have carried out their work.  Some day this country will appreciate what the Minister did for it in the crisis which we have passed through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking through this group of Estimates, one cannot fail to be struck by one outstanding characteristic, namely, the very substantial sums that the House is being asked to vote, and to vote blindly, to semiautonomous institutions outside the control of the House.  If there is one <Col N="929" /> thing that the British House of Commons is particularly jealous about, it is that, when they vote sums of money, they insist that they are to be accounted for back to the House to the last penny.  In the circumstances in which we live, one cannot refrain from criticising the policy which makes for more and more Governmental control and more and more State intervention, an autocratic, all-powerful State with a growing, powerful bureaucracy.  I think the red mark has been reached long ago as far as this type of institution is concerned.  We calmly vote here very big sums of money and we do not insist that those moneys are properly accounted back to the officer of this House, the Comptroller and Auditor-General. We do not know whether the moneys are being spent properly and efficiently.  On that we cannot satisfy ourselves&mdash;and we have no means of doing so&mdash;even though this institution is the supreme authority, so far as the people are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that there are institutions of this sort the efficiency of which could be questioned.  I am making particular reference to the Turf Board. We are providing, by State subventions in one form or another, approximately £1,750,000 and the price of turf is to be lowered in the non-turf areas. The Minister recently, in introducing a Bill dealing with turf production in the future, informed the House that it was the policy of the board to provide turf eventually at 50 per cent. of the cost of imported fuel.  I think the Turf Board has its job cut out for it, if it hopes to reach that point, judging by present costs.  Recently, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, the Minister stated that, so far as county councils are concerned, the average cost of producing turf and delivering it to the roadside was 36/5. We must take into account that there is a good deal of turf produced privately at 20/- a ton on the roadside. So far as the State is concerned, taking in all subsidies and transport, the average cost to the consumer in Dublin is something like 103/9, that is, over £5 per ton.  I submit that the difference between the cost on the roadside and the cost to the consumer <Col N="930" /> is eaten up in transport, distribution and storage and that the costs there are out of all proportion to the cost of production.</P>
    <P>If we are trying to find out what is wrong, surely it is in those aspects of the board's activities that we must search.  The fact that, after some years of experience and development, no real effort has been made to economise and put the production of turf on a more efficient basis, makes the situation so grave that the time has arrived when the House should demand a special inquiry into the activities of the board. I regret very much that the board's accounts do not come under the control and investigation of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, an efficient and experienced officer who would have an opportunity of deciding, through the machinery at his disposal, whether the accounts presented to him were efficient or otherwise.  This is one example of the danger of pursuing this policy of setting up these semi-autonomous institutions.  Institutions like this and like the Tourist Board are invading the rights of private enterprise.  It is altogether wrong that we should continue to build up and bolster up these institutions and so aim at providing this country with an all-powerful State.  Surely, it can scarcely be disputed that, in the last analysis, the healthiest thing for any country is to encourage private enterprise. It is only in extreme circumstances, as a last resort, where one cannot encourage private enterprise to operate, that the State should intervene. I am sorry to say that in many aspects of our national life we have State intervention here, intervention which is altogether uncalled for and which cannot be justified.  I hope this craving for power is going to end and that the Government will mend its hand in that respect.</P>
    <P>Whatever industrial activities are essential to our national welfare, they should be promoted by encouraging private enterprise.  I was impressed by the Minister's recent speeches and his attitude to industrial development. There is a very substantial change in his outlook, a change that is desirable and must be encouraged.  We often <Col N="931" /> hear expression given to the desirability of having industries here. While that is very desirable, inefficient industry is not desirable in any country and becomes a burden on the community. From that point of view, I certainly welcome the Minister's attitude. He has made it very clear to industrialists and potential industrialists that he intends to insist on efficiency.  Industry is necessary to give opportunities to our people and especially to our surplus population from the rural districts and the population in the towns and cities of engaging in productive employment.</P>
    <P>Looking over the very useful booklet on national income and expenditure, it strikes me that it can scarcely be questioned that the industrial population has lived in this country, as well as in other countries, to a very great extent at the expense of the primary producer. If we are to develop industry and if we are to have fair play and justice as between one section and another, we must ensure that, whenever a measure of protection is afforded to an industry, that industry is efficient and is producing an article of good quality suitable to our requirements.  When we think of industrial development here, we cannot help throwing our minds back to what happened last week and this week again in London at a conference of primary producers from many countries.  Sir John Orr and other economists who have spoken there have pointed out that two out of every three people in the world are engaged in agriculture and that the prosperity of industry in the world depends on the prosperity of the agricultural community.  After all, it is from agriculture that the purchasing power comes for industry.  The Minister, when talking about industrial development, appears to me to ignore one important aspect of our economic life.  I feel that there is no possibility of developing and expanding industrial efficiency until we have our primary industry on an efficient basis, until we have an expanding agriculture.  If we have an expanding agriculture, industrial development will be a natural corollary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> I believe it may be possible, in some lines of industry, to develop an export trade, but it will be limited.  I am quite satisfied, taking the example of Denmark and her development of the industrial arm, that the conditions there are on all-fours with our circumstances. We are aware how development in Denmark was achieved.  The agricultural potential there is substantially greater than what has been achieved here at any time.  I believe that once you are launched on a properly developed and expanding system of agriculture, you will immediately and without any great difficulty have, as a natural corollary, industrial development.  Our primary industry will demand industrial services; it will demand equipment, raw material, a greater degree of transport in and out, bringing raw material into the farm and production out of the farm.  That is what we should aim at.</P>
    <P>With the amount of competition that we must face up to, because it is inevitable that a very high percentage of our agricultural production must be exported, we must have those industries that will service the primary industry running efficiently.  We must ensure that they will produce the right type of article and that they will enjoy a degree of protection sufficient to guard them against keener competition from outside.  The degree of protection is a very important matter.  There ought to be some formula for determining the measure of protection necessary for an industry, or for an applicant who proposes to start a new industry.  It is not right to leave the decision to the Minister; it is not right to let him decide in an arbitrary way.  That is not satisfactory and it may give rise to unjustified suspicions.  In his own interest, the Minister ought to provide some formula that can be applied to every sort of industry in order to determine the measure of protection which should be afforded.</P>
    <P>Another essential thing is some bureau that will fix standards of production. Such a bureau is very necessary, if we are to afford protection to industrialists and eliminate competition to a substantial extent.  Competition <Col N="933" /> ensures that the standard must be of a quality that will encourage trade. When you eliminate that competition and artificially interfere with the normal flow of trade, it is necessary that some machinery should be provided to ensure that a proper standard is reached within the protecting wall. I have in mind machinery and tools for agriculture.  There is some very good machinery produced here but, on the other hand, we have machines that are obsolete in design.  I can appreciate the manufacturer's difficulty because, with a limited market, it is sometimes costly to change the design of a machine.</P>
    <P>Agriculture will, to a very substantial extent, have to face competition in an extern market.  If they have to compete against people better equipped with more up-to-date machinery, our agriculturists can hardly hope to survive.  We should have some bureau that will insist that before an industrialist gets protection he must reach a certain standard, must produce a certain type of article and must keep that article in such a manner that it will compare favourably with similar articles produced elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have listened to a lot of praise about what has been achieved here.  I admit we did succeed in weathering difficulties during the emergency, but there are certain aspects which need to be criticised.  Take, as an example, the tools that are used in agriculture. It was simply outrageous the type of handle that was fitted to some tools. We ought to have enough ash of a fair quality to fit a decent handle to our tools.  My experience of some tools is that it was appalling the type of handle that was fitted.  Beech was used and you could crack it like a carrot.  The farmer's experience was that he had to buy the same type of tool several times where formerly one tool would be sufficient.  There has been a considerable improvement in the design and general appearance, but sufficient attention has not been paid to the quality of the handles of tools. People who enjoyed protection and who had not to face competition here during the emergency seemed to be <Col N="934" /> satisfied that any type of handle would do and the community had to put up with it.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is turning over in his mind the principles that must guide him in connection with industrial development and post-war expansion, he ought to consider the establishment of a bureau that will deal with standards and the type of machinery that we require. The personnel of the bureau will have an opportunity of going abroad and seeing the type of machinery used elsewhere and they can pick a type suitable for this country and insist that the manufacturers who have protection here will produce an article that we need not be ashamed of, an article that in design and quality will compare favourably with those produced in other countries.</P>
    <P>Fertilisers have been mentioned and the Minister indicated that he hopes to increase our supply.  I trust that he succeeds in doing so.  We have a fair amount of phosphate, but we need potash and nitrates in greater quantities. With regard to the kainit quarries in Alsace-Lorraine, the Minister should do his utmost to secure supplies, because that material is very urgently required in this country.  The long period of compulsory tillage, with the likelihood that it must continue for a couple of years, makes it all the more urgent that the Minister should watch every opportunity to secure whatever supplies are offered.  The quality of fertilisers is a very important matter. The quality of our superphosphates is very poor.  The material is very damp and in poor condition and it is rather difficult to use it with a machine.  The machine is the only effective way of getting even distribution over the land, but to do that the fertilisers must be in good condition.  I do not know why there has been a disimprovement in fertilisers to the extent that occurred during the emergency.  The fact is that the condition of fertilisers is particularly poor and soft, and the best results cannot be got from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that our problem, so far as the wheat supply is concerned, was difficult and delicate. We can appreciate that.  We have to depend on a rather thin market, and <Col N="935" /> taking the circumstances of Europe into account, we will barely get to next year's harvest and not have any surplus.  I wonder if, in the long run, the present high extraction is the best.  I think there is a good deal of waste in flour of such high extraction, and that a good deal of it goes sour. Bread is also thrown away because of its poor quality.  I am wondering whether we would not do just as well with an extraction of five per cent. less than the present figure.  I wonder if the Minister has looked into that aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's effort to provide some sort of machinery eliminating, to a great extent, strikes and disputes that are likely to occur, in view of the tremendous waste and loss that result.  Seeing that conferences have to be held after a long period of strikes, such meetings might take place with success at the beginning of disputes.  I think the Minister can and will do very useful work if he can provide legislative machinery to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the cost of living being a very heavy burden on our people, especially on wage earners.  It is 72 per cent. over the pre-war figure.  I agree with Deputies who suggested that the price-fixing machinery in the Department is not doing its job.  I think there are any amount of articles, the price of which is fixed at a level substantially higher than could be justified.  Reference has been made to clothes.  The difference between the cost of raw materials and the finished article is amazing.  I believe the price fixed for socks could not be justified.  These articles could be sold substantially lower than the fixed price.  It is the same with jams, marmalade and other essential articles. There are goods that drapers all over the country could sell at prices considerably lower than the fixed prices. I do not know what is behind that policy.  I often wonder if the policy is to allow exorbitant profits, so that the Minister for Finance can get a rake off.  When it is remembered that the figure given in the White Paper dealing with national income showed that only 190,000 of our people have <Col N="936" /> incomes over £3 a week, and that the vast majority have incomes of less than £3, taking into account also the low purchasing power of the £ in relation to such limited incomes, the Minister cannot justify a situation where his price-fixing machinery allows articles that are essentials of life to be sold at prices above what could be justified.  It is an extraordinary situation.  Whatever policy dictates it I am satisfied that a big number of people are allowed to make incomes that are not justified.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of the Minister for Finance in the Budget, notwithstanding the fact that income-tax is to be reduced by 1/ &mdash;amounting in the aggregate to £1,200,000&mdash;anticipated that income-tax will approximately yield the same amount as last year.  I feel that much of the amount will be accounted for in that way.  The fixed legal prices charged for commodities that are essential to life could not possibly be justified.  I think that is a crime against the community, bearing in mind the low average income of the people.  I hope the Minister will look into that matter and not be dominated by a policy which believes in raking substantial sums of money into the net in order to dole them out again in the form of subsidies of one form or another.  That is altogether wrong and immoral.  We should aim at increasing the income of the community, by making the people independent of Government and of politicians.  I hope we will soon see a change of policy in that respect, first in regard to income and, rather than having individuals looking to the State for assistance, they should be put in a position to earn a fair income, and secondly, that the policy of State interference or State intervention in what primarily belongs to private enterprise will be discontinued.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention. I am quite certain that we have an excellent meteorological service.  I cannot understand why, in an agricultural country like this, with such an exceptionally fine service, because of our aviation activities, we cannot have a good forecast of the weather. <Col N="937" /> We are told what the weather is going to be like to-morrow, but we should have information from the meteorological service giving a forecast of the weather for a week ahead.  If the Minister looks at what they are doing in Sweden for many years, with regard to the type of information available to an agricultural community, we might take a leaf out of their book.  Taking into account the amount of money we are asked to vote for this service I hope the Minister will make some effort to do what I suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's review of the work of his Department was most enlightening and encouraging.  His review of the past and his optimistic outlook for the future give us every reason to hope that he will be able to find remedies for the growing unemployment in the country.  On coming into the House to-day I got a letter, and I am sure that nearly every other Deputy has got similar letters.  The address on the letter is an area not far from here, and it reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I hope when you have read this letter you will pardon the forwardness shown by me in the writing of it.  However, I feel sure that a man in your position will understand and give this, my letter, your kind consideration.  The problem, sir, is not unusual&mdash;unemployment, with, of course, its kindred evils, the main ones being boredom and despair. For the last five years, I have served here in the National Army, and since my discharge last November I have failed to find any employment whatsoever.  Recently my stamps at the Labour Exchange were all paid out, and I applied for the assistance for which I had some weeks previously received a qualification certificate. On making my claim, I was asked many questions&mdash;few of them having anything whatever to do with my claim.  Having signed many imposing looking papers and answering all questions, I was handed a Government pamphlet entitled &lsquo;The Construction Corps&rsquo;, with an invitation to join for two years.  Failing to comply means, I suppose, no relief, although candidly I did not wait to find out.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> I will not continue to read this letter. It is a long letter, setting out this exsoldier's grievance, the grievance of a man who served all during the emergency and now finds himself thrown on the unemployed market with some thousands of others, and who is anxiously waiting for the Government, the local authority or some private person to give him a means of living and keeping his family.</P>
    <P>The Minister's review, as I say, is encouraging because he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe that in the near future we will have an exceptionally favourable opportunity of industrial expansion, and it has been always my conviction that it is through the development of manufacturing industry in the main that this country will be able to end unemployment, to find the resources required to raise the general standard of living, and to achieve what is called social security.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very laudable aim indeed and I will give the Minister this credit, that if there is any Minister who can succeed, it will be the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It will not be for want of trying on his part that success will not come.  I earnestly hope that not alone these soldiers who have been &ldquo;demobbed&rdquo; but all others who served the country in other ways&mdash; those who served in industry who did not get an opportunity, or did not take the opportunity to join the Army, because they were not all wanted in the Army&mdash;will get a fair opportunity of earning a living in their own country.</P>
    <P>While on that subject, I want to mention a matter which possibly is not strictly one for the Minister's Department. It is possibly one for some private individual and perhaps some enterprising journalist might take it up.  I was recently in England where I met a very large number of Irish workers.  They asked me: &ldquo;What are you doing over there for us when we go back?  The people here think and believe that Ireland is doing nothing to help the British people in their present plight.&rdquo;  With the present plight of those people, one must have sympathy.  The British workman's wife has to stand in a queue and pay <Col N="939" /> 1/- for a cauliflower and she gets three loaves where she asks for four, and then has to return the following morning and wait another hour in a queue. These people, as I say, deserve our sympathy, but this country has done a fair share to relieve that situation and to ease the burden they are carrying. If some other country gives a quantity of food supplies to Great Britain, the amounts are set out in terms of millions of pounds weight by the B.B.C. and the British newspapers, while anything from Ireland is either overlooked or set out in terms of tons. Something ought to be done to show these people and to show our countrymen in England who are getting a reasonably good living there that we have not forgotten them and that we are trying to do something to ease the position of the people there.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is worrying them is the fact that an article appeared in one of the British newspapers on 6th May&mdash;a most unfriendly article&mdash;in which it was stated that Irishmen working in Britain were to be sent home.  Because there is no liaison official between the Government here and the British people to give answers when this country is being shown in an incorrect light, such articles result in detriment to Irishmen working in Britain.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has got a copy of the cutting&mdash;I got 23 of them by one post alone.  The Irishmen working at building, at clearing blitzed areas and so on, and giving good value for the wages they receive, have become rather alarmed.  They say that there are all nationalities working at different rates of wages and at different jobs in England and they ask why a newspaper should be allowed to select Irishmen especially as those to be sent home.</P>
    <P>Whether it is wise to draw attention to these matters, I do not know, but if anything could be done through our High Commissioner in London to assure our people over there that they need not be alarmed, I think it would be advisable to do it.  These people are giving good value for the money they receive and they have served the country of their adoption for the past five years well, not alone in industry and <Col N="940" /> so on, but in the Army, the Navy, and the Royal Air Force, and they have nothing to be ashamed of.  I refer to this matter because of the danger that a very large number of men may come home as a result of the alarm created through such newspaper articles.  If a large number of our countrymen, who have worked in England for the last five years, suddenly come home to this country again I want to know from the Minister what immediate steps the Minister can take to provide employment for them.  The Minister has said that he will do everything he can to encourage industry and that he is hopeful that industry will expand and that the day will come when we shall find this country exporting industrial products side by side with our agricultural produce.  If we can achieve that then there is no reason why we cannot provide decent employment for all our workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is full of optimism.  Amongst other things I wish to draw attention to the statement made by him in regard to the building trade.  Is the House aware of the present position in Dublin in this respect?  Is the Minister aware that as a result of the slowing down of building because of failure to get materials, due to circumstances over which we had no control, there is not at the moment in Dublin even a single room for anybody coming from the country; nor is there any place to which to remove families when tenements fall down?  The old tenements in Dublin are falling down. We have not sufficient materials to repair them.  The people who are living in them have no alternative accommodation.  It is said that we require 20,000 houses in Dublin.  If the Minister could wave a wand to-morrow and produce thereby 40,000 cottages, or 40,000 flats, there would be a tenant for every one of them within a month.  There is no accommodation for those unfortunate families who are living in basements; there is no accommodation for those who are getting married and they are going back to live with their parents in single rooms.</P>
    <P>I join with the entire House in paying <Col N="941" /> tribute to the Minister on the work that has already been accomplished.  I appeal to the Minister again, as I pleaded with him some years ago in this House and when I was almost jeered at for doing so, to follow up his recent visit to Great Britain and the Continent.  If the Minister goes to Great Britain and establishes personal contact with those who are concerned I believe we will get boatloads of timber, slates, and bricks; or, at least, we will get a fair proportion of whatever supplies of materials are available to enable our builders to build houses for those people who are urgently in need of them.  I certainly hope that the Minister will continue to go across to the other side and meet there on the spot those people who can best help this country.</P>
    <P>Now, there is another matter to which I would like to draw attention. I think it was Deputy Cosgrave who made some reference to the fact that Dublin at the present time is receiving an unfair proportion of citizens from other areas because of the establishment of so many industries here.  One immediately thinks of Lever Brothers in Port Sunlight.  If our industrialists here wish to expand, either in Dublin or in any other part of the country, I suggest to the Minister that he should encourage those industrialists, particularly by means of substantial subsidies, to provide housing accommodation for their own workers in the same way in which Lever Brothers provided for their workers.</P>
    <P>This morning I saw an advertisement on the front page of one of our daily papers.  The advertisement stated that they had working men's boots available at a price of 55/- per pair.  Five years ago heavy hobnailed working men's boots, such as those worn by dockers or farm labourers, were available at 15/- per pair.  How could a farm labourer earning a couple of pounds a week or a man in casual employment in this country pay 55/- for a pair of boots?  In a country like this, where there should be almost unlimited tanneries and where there should be a plentiful supply of leather, why should a working man be asked to pay such an exorbitant price for a pair of boots? <Col N="942" /> I admit that it is perfectly right that we should export every available ounce of any commodity we have, but always on condition that our own are properly supplied at home first.  I admit that we should export, even to the extent perhaps of doing with a little less ourselves, but still sufficient should be kept at home to enable our people to clothe themselves at reasonable prices.  A boy's suit at the present moment costs from £5 to £6 for a both from ten to 12 years of age.  A man's overcoat costs from £8 to £10; and a suit of clothes costs something the same.  Now, there is something radi cally wrong there.  There is something radically wrong in the clothing industry. One Deputy made some reference here to the retail trade.  I do not know where exactly the difficulty lies, but I do say that the exorbitant prices charged for clothing and boots cast a most unfair burden on the people.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate the difficulties in regard to food supplies.  It is quite common to hear the following comment made: &ldquo;I went into a shop this morning with a £1 note and I came out without any change and I do not know what I got for it.&rdquo;  That is quite a common phrase nowadays.  Money appears to have lost all purchasing power.  I would appeal to the Minister to do everything he possibly can to bring down the cost of living and to obtain adequate supplies of materials for housing.  As I said before, 40,000 houses are urgently required in Dublin at the present moment.  One asks oneself the question, is there something wrong in our building trade? Should it not be possible to find substitutes for those commodities we ourselves lack?</P>
    <P>There was a time when we were told that we could not build houses here unless we had proper Irish slates.  I remember that happening on a local board.  Some time later on tiles were being manufactured and, later on again, concrete tiles were made.  I want to know is it not possible now for the Minister to do something immediately and to make some suggestions to local authorities all over the country which will enable those engaged in the building trade to provide maximum work and proper <Col N="943" /> wages, while at the same time bringing into existence the much needed housing accommodation for those people who are clamouring for it.  Forty thousand houses are urgently needed in the City of Dublin alone and, under present conditions, it looks as if we are not going to get more than 500 houses, or flats, per year.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that we should make every effort to end unemployment and that we should find all the resources required to increase our standard of living.  Lastly, I would ask the Minister to make every effort to ensure that our food supplies will be adequate.  I think the entire House would be glad to have some assurance from the Minister that our wheat supply will be satisfactory; and that the Minister for Agriculture will ensure that there will be no slackening off in his Department and that pressure will be brought to bear so that we shall have adequate supplies of potatoes and other vegetables for our people and, if possible, a surplus to export to those who are in urgent need of it in other parts of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, that it would be only right for me to take this opportunity of extending my most sincere thanks to the Minister for his untiring and unremitting efforts to encourage and promote industries in my constituency where very strong representations have been made to him to do so.  I remember, in 1939 or 1940, the Minister indicated that he would be delighted to do anything he could do, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to bring a suitable industry to the town of Mountmellick to replace the maltings.  He has certainly done his share.  When he was asked by the townspeople of Mountmellick to interest himself in their welfare, he used his good offices, by negotiation with industrialists and others concerned, for the establishment of an industry. While we have succeeded, to a great extent with his services, in securing another industry in the town, we hope the Minister will continue to give us his close co-operation and help in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> While I pay tribute to the Minister on behalf of the people of Mountmellick, I would remind the Minister of resolutions from the town of Mountrath, in Laoighis, and Banagher, in Offaly.  In these towns there are large numbers of unemployed; there is plenty of capital for the establishment of industry; and the local people are doing all they possibly can to contact industrialists with a view to setting up some worth-while industry that would create local employment.  Copies of these resolutions have been forwarded to the Minister.  I am very pleased by the manner in which the Minister has at all times considered the requests from Banagher and Mountrath and I trust that he will keep in communication with the Industrial Development Association of Mountrath and the citizens of Banagher until such time as he secures successful results.  I assure the Minister that that will be very much appreciated by the people of these two towns.</P>
    <P>It is customary for a Minister in introducing the Estimate for his Department to refer to the staff of the Department.  I must say that the staff of the Minister's Department are the one staff in the Service that have done very valuable work, not alone at this stage, but all through the emergency. The Minister has indicated that early this year the staffs of the Department of Supplies and the Department of Industry and Commerce were amalgamated under one Ministry.  Like many other Deputies, I quite realise the difficulties that these officers were faced with, not only during the emergency, but for the past 12 months. I am quite satisfied that they have carried out their duties in a perfectly efficient and capable manner and I feel sure that, were it not for the work of the Department and the able assistance of the very capable and responsible Minister in charge of the Department, things could have been much worse than they were during the critical time that we have passed through.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has referred to matters of very great importance.  I am very sorry that I have to say that, despite the very rigid and strict regulations <Col N="945" /> laid down by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Supplies, people were fleeced by blackmarketeers and others. I am very sorry that those who suffered were the really poor classes of the community. There are industrialists, drapers, big merchants, who have fleeced the poor.  There was not enough war made by the Department on the blackmarket.  It was a most appalling state of affairs.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out in this House within the last fortnight, although tea was rationed so that every citizen was entitled to a small ration, there were unlimited quantities of tea available for any citizen who would purchase it at 30/- or 35/- a lb.  The same applies to petrol, as I pointed out in the House not long ago.  Although petrol was rationed, there were people joyriding all over the country.  I know people who secured upwards of 50 and 60 gallons per month and who were in receipt of an allowance from the Department of eight gallons.  Something must be wrong with the administration somewhere.  I know the Department have done all they possibly can to correct such irregularities and to put them right, but yet everybody is aware that thousands of pounds have been turned over in the black market and that those who were the real sufferers were those who were least able to bear it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne also pointed out the very high cost of clothing.  He has pointed out that at the present time a reasonably good suit of clothes costs 11, 12 or 13 guineas.  It is not six months since I raised the question in this House of the production of juvenile clothing.  I indicated that there were manufacturers who were prepared, and fully equipped, to go into such production and who had endless capital.  They made application to the Department of Industry and Commerce for a manufacturer's licence.  The Minister turned down the application and refused to give the permit.  I submit that the lack of competition is responsible for the high price of clothing.  Competition is an asset to the people and until there is competition prices will not come down. <Col N="946" /> I am very anxious to hear an explanation from the Minister as to why manufacturers' permits were not granted to those citizens who were anxious to go into the production of clothing, and which would have had the effect of reducing prices.  I think that, if the Minister is really sincere in his efforts to reduce the price of clothing, he will encourage competition in the production of clothing.  If he does that, then I feel certain that keen competition will have the effect of bringing down the present high prices.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Hughes who made reference to the bread position. It is not, of course, as serious to-day as it was during the very dark years of the war, but, as Deputy Hughes pointed out, there is very considerable waste, due to the quality of the bread that we are getting.  My experience is that the waste is much greater now than it has ever been, for the reason that the bread turns sour very quickly, and it is impossible to eat it.  I think it would be much better if the Minister were to give directions for an improvement in the quality of the bread.  There would then be much less waste.  I know that in parts of the country even the dogs are refusing to eat it.  It is disgraceful that such a state of affairs should exist, as well as that regulations should be made whereby bread cannot be served during certain meals.  I think it is a disgrace that a year after the ending of the war we should have that position in the country, and at the back of all that to see food being exported.  Deputy Byrne, in the course of his speech, appealed to the Minister to do what he could to further increase agricultural production.  I am of opinion that I am as charitable as any other member of the House and I am prepared to admit that certain members of the Government Party are undoubtedly very charitable.  At the same time I am bitterly opposed&mdash;I do not know whether this is a selfish point of view to take or not&mdash;to the sending of food out of the country while we have one hungry mouth at home.  I hold the same view with regard to the export of other essential commodities.  I believe it would be <Col N="947" /> much better to aim at providing our people with a proper standard of bread.  It was a lovely gesture on our part to decide to send food to countries where it was more needed than it was here.  But whilst I would like to extent our charity to a much greater extent if we could, I still believe that we are going too far with this, especially when we have to ask our own people to exist on a small ration of bread, as suggested at present.</P>
    <P>I also understand that big supplies of sugar are being exported.  I think it is a crying shame that Irish citizens should have to try to exist on the present small ration of sugar in view of the fact that huge quantities of sugar are being exported.  I think it is very foolish to be doing that.  The Government may get great praise and great credit for it.  Its action may be splashed in European papers and great tributes may be paid to the Irish Government for its generosity.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Irish people cannot find any opportunity for paying a tribute to the Government for doing that because, in my opinion, it is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul.  As long as our own people cannot get food, that is a system that I cannot subscribe to.  I recall that in 1942 I was the only member of the House who bitterly opposed the export of any food from this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of food production.  The Minister made appeals over the radio for increased food production, and I submit that he has responsibility for the provision of shipping for these exports. For the reasons I have stated I am strongly opposed to the export of food supplies, while at the same time depriving our own people of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to make reference to the development of our mineral resources. Some time ago a company was formed for the development of coal mines in the County Tipperary.  There are other <Col N="948" /> coal mines besides these in the country that could easily be developed.  I understand that we have very good coal at a place called Killeshin which is convenient to the town of Carlow. Experts from England who examined these coal pits many years ago reported that, not only was the coal found there very good, but that it was equal to that found in any part of Wales.  I think that these coal pits should be developed. We have another coal mine which is convenient to the village of Ballyroan, Laoighis, in respect of which very good reports have also been given.  I think that a board should be set up on the lines of Board na Móna for the development of these coal mines.  The time is opportune for a full development of our coal resources.  It would be wise for the Department to set up such a board or else a commission to make an inquiry as to the areas in which we have suitable coal mines so that a proper estimate might be made of the cost of developing them.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Byrne to the great question of unemployment. The Deputy, in the opening part of his speech, read a letter which he received this morning from a constituent.  The circumstances described in that letter were appalling. I also received a letter this morning from Lismore in the County Waterford, copies of which, I am informed were sent to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who is one of the Deputies for that constituency, and to the Minister for Defence.  The letter states:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Please forgive me for taking the liberty of writing to you.  I am an ex-Army sergeant.  Since my release last November I have been signing on at the local Labour Exchange. On Thursday last, I was handed a card telling me to go to the ganger of the county council on Monday, 27th, for employment with the county council.  I am in possession of primary and inter, leaving certificates, and for five years was a clerk in the Defence Forces.  I ask you, do you think that this is appreciation of my services&mdash;to request me to go out to work on the roads?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is a deplorable state of <Col N="949" /> affairs that we should have educated people put in that position.  I am glad to see that the Minister for Education is in the House while I am referring to this case.  Here is the case of a man from Lismore who has two educational diplomas; he has given five years of good loyal service to the nation in the Defence Forces, and when he presents himself at the Labour Exchange in Lismore he is asked to go out and scrape the roads of the county.  I want to say that this man is not ashamed to work, but I think the Government ought to feel ashamed to ask a citizen with such an education, a man who has given loyal service to the State, to take that type of employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne very wisely made reference to certain statements which are appearing in the British Press at the moment.  These statements, which are causing alarm to every Irishman employed outside the shores of this country, refer to the fact that those men are going to be dismissed from their employment in England, and will have to return to this country.  What I want to know is, what plan has the Minister for Industry and Commerce for providing them with employment when they do return.  I think that the Minister has completely failed to solve the great problem of unemployment here.  In reading over the Dáil debates some time ago, I found that the Minister said on one occasion that if he was not able to solve the unemployment question within the present system he was prepared to go outside of it to do so.  The Minister has done a good deal of good in other directions, but the one question that he has failed to solve is this problem of unemployment.  It is a downright disgrace that the insult of the dole should be offered to any Irishman.  I remember making a speech in my constituency in which I very bitterly opposed the dole.  The Government Party thought fit to misrepresent my statement and to say that, if Deputy Flanagan had his way, the unemployed man would be allowed to starve.  I say that it is a disgraceful thing that we should have any citizen living on the charity of the State.  The vast majority of our people <Col N="950" />&mdash;in rural Ireland, at any rate&mdash;are living on the charity of the State or on the charity bestowed by an organisation such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society or, if not, they are living on their own friends or relatives.  The dole was the greatest curse that befell this country.  The Government responsible for the introduction of the dole was responsible for the introduction of a horrid system of laziness.  Within the past fortnight, a case has been brought to my attention in which a man will receive 32/- unemployment benefit, whereas, if he works, he will receive only 36/-.  Would he not be fit for a lunatic asylum if he were to work six days of the week to receive only 4/- more than he is obtaining by not working at all?  Work should be provided for every citizen at a decent wage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne pleaded with the Minister to wave a wand and provide him with 40,000 house.  Is there not sufficient work in doing that?  We have, as I have pointed out, undeveloped coal mines, huge tracts of undeveloped bog, hundreds of acres suitable for forestry and the whole country loudly clamouring for drainage. These schemes would afford plenty of employment.  There is any amount of work but I believe there is something wrong with the administrative side, which is not putting the people to work and giving them a decent wage. Agriculturists are unable to secure labour simply because a large section of the community have become so used to the dole that they believe they should still go on and obtain something from the State for nothing.  I am bitterly opposed to any man getting anything for nothing.  What men produce or manufacture is what counts.  The man who is paid for doing nothing is no asset; he is a liability. The Government have encouraged too much of this class of thing and the result is that the greater part of the community is either in receipt of pensions or doles.  They are producing nothing and the producers are getting the worst crack of the whip.  The dole should be completely abolished and work should be provided.  It would be a very good idea to encourage some <Col N="951" /> of those in receipt of the dole to do some work by making a grant to farmers or other employers who would supplement it by as much more so that these people would be employed and their minds kept occupied.  As Deputy McMenamin pointed out, our country is only half developed, while many of our people are being paid for walking around the streets doing nothing. I hope the Minister will make a drastic change at an early date by solving this unemployment problem. My sympathies must lie with those who are in receipt of the dole against their own wishes and against their pride. I know people who are completely ashamed to be seen approaching the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>There were cases in which poor people signing on at different exchanges were kept as long as three months out of benefit by the Department. Complaints are frequently reaching Deputies of the long delay in determining whether persons are entitled to unemployment benefit or not. If a certificate can be produced that no work is available, there should be no more investigation by courts, or referees or anybody else.  Is it not an insane system under which persons in my constituency who, the Department of Industry and Commerce claim, are not entitled to unemployment benefit, have to go before a court of referees in Athlone or Kilkenny?</P>
    <P>How can a poor man on the dole be expected to go to Athlone or Kilkenny at his own expense?  No provision is made for an allowance in such cases. There is room for very great improvement so far as that section of the Department is concerned.  It is very slow in dealing with the claims placed before it and it might be no harm if the Minister would inquire as to the cause of the long delay in such cases.</P>
    <P>I might go further and say that the managers at some of the employment exchanges are getting very deeply into polities.  It is a disgraceful state of affairs that managers of employment exchanges, kept by the State, should be head, neck and heels in political parties and that they should, in connection with various schemes, be sending up only the names of those <Col N="952" /> citizens who are sympathetic with the political party of which they are either secretaries or treasurers.  It would be well if the Minister would circularise his paid officials who are dabbling in politics.  There are enough of us paid for that sort of thing without having State servants interfering.  It is most unfair and it is keeping certain people from having recourse to the offices.  I do not desire to give names.  It would serve no useful purpose but, if the Minister wants them, I can give them. I know the manager of a certain labour exchange who informed a constituent that if he did not vote a certain way he would be cut off the dole. That is a matter that should be investigated. Then the names of these gentlemen are appearing publicly in the Press as secretaries and treasurers of Fianna Fáil cumainn.  To protect the good name of the Minister's Department, if it has that good name, the Minister should, at least, request his officers to keep out of politics.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke made reference to flour.  I thought that, when flour was reduced appreciably in quality, we should have a reduction in price.  I hope that, as a result of the remarks made by Deputies, something will be done to improve the position in regard to flour and bread.  Congratulations were extended from all parts of the House to the Minister for the efficiency of the machinery established in connection with the granting of bonuses. I must say that the machinery has done good work but I should like to see it doing better work.  The tribunal had a very good way of determining whether an increase by way of bonus should be granted or not.  I disagree with Deputy Burke when he states that, if it had been compulsory on the employer to pay the bonus, organisations would have been springing up to protest against it all over the country. I cannot say that for my constituency. I know cases in which bonuses were granted and the employers have not paid them.</P>
    <P>I can give the Minister's Department, if the Minister wishes, a list of groups of employees, even employees of Córas Iompair Eireann, to whom bonuses have been granted in the Portlaoighise area and to whom the <Col N="953" /> employers have refused to pay these bonuses because they maintain it is not the local rate.  Córas Iompair Eireann are not paying the rates of bonuses in this area that have been approved by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I think it would be well if the Minister would go a step further and compel employers to pay such bonuses because my experience is that if employers can get anything out of a worker for nothing they will do so. They will take all the sweat and work they can get for nothing.</P>
    <P>There is one section of the community of which the Department has completely lost sight and that is shop assistants.  The Department has given the blind eye to any communications addressed to them on their behalf. Does the Minister realise that young fellows have to serve three or four years' apprenticeship to a bar or grocery before they are fully qualified and that big employers in the city of Dublin and throughout the country pay these young men no more than about 5/- per week although frequently they are doing the very same work as charge hands?  It is a downright disgrace that young people should have to slave under such conditions.  Shop assistants are one section of the community with whom I have great sympathy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has power to make regulations with regard to their conditions of employment.  I think he should certainly see that their conditions of employment are improved, at least to the extent that they will get some suitable return for their labour.  Their employers do not seem to have any great sympathy for them. I see shop assistants in my part of the country working as long as 12 hours per day.  I know shop assistants who are unable to get away for a bit of lunch.  They must remain behind the counter the whole time.  I think that some steps should be taken to see that conditions of employment for shop assistants and those who are anxious to serve an apprenticeship to the bar, grocery or provisions business, are <Col N="954" /> completely reorganised and improved in order that some encouragement may be given to young men to enter on a business career.</P>
      <P>Very strong representations have been made to the Department by solicitors representing a group of my constituents living in the neighbourhood of the Shannon.  I have made numerous attempts to get the Minister to improve conditions for these people but very little has been done.  I understand that as a result of the activities of the Electricity Supply Board along the Shannon, near Banagher, Shannonbridge and in Shannon Harbour, in holding up the water by way of huge dams, a great amount of damage has been done to lands adjoining the Shannon.  The solicitors representing these people have made renewed representations to the Department to take some steps to ensure that the handicaps imposed on these people will be rectified.  I ask the Minister for Education, in the temporary absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to take some note of this matter and to bring it to the attention of his colleague. This is the second time I have had to raise it in this House.  It is a matter of very great importance to small holders and cottage tenants who have very small areas of bogland on the banks of the Shannon.  These people suffer a very severe financial loss each year and the Department should make some arrangement with the Electricity Supply Board to ensure that there will be some improvement in conditions there in the future so as to relieve these hard-working people and repair the damage inflicted on them as a result of activities of the Electricity Supply Board in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A burning question in all parts of the country is blacksmiths' coal.  There is not a blacksmith who is not up in arms against the Department in connection with this matter.  I believe that some improvement could be brought about by giving these people a better type of coal than they are getting at present.  The Minister must realise that blacksmiths are a very important section of the community.  They are responsible for the repair and maintenance of agricultural machinery and for keeping the horse on the road.  They <Col N="955" /> are deserving of more consideration than has been given to them by the present Government.  They are at present receiving a type of dirty old slack which is incapable of producing any heat.</P>
    <P>A superior type of coal or slack should be released to genuine registered blacksmiths.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter again to see what can be done in order to enable blacksmiths to carry on their all-important work in assisting farmers by way of repairing agricultural machinery and keeping their horses in a fit condition to work.  Blacksmiths are taking an important part, in an indirect way, in the nation's drive for food production and I would strongly urge the Minister to take some steps to see that an improved quality of coal is allocated to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran some time about last March raised a question which I think might again be ventilated on the Minister's Estimate.  He pointed out that there was a number of lorries belonging to licensed carriers which had fallen into a deplorable state of repair during the emergency.  When the emergency came to an end, the owners of these vehicles desired to replace them with new lorries but the new lorries that were on the market did not comply with the regulations as regards weight laid down under the Transport Act.  I think the Minister should at least consider the question of increasing the tonnage of the lorries which these licensed carriers can operate.  It is a disgraceful state of affairs that the tonnage cannot be increased even if only by a few cwt.  They are unable to purchase new lorries because the Road Transport Act debars them from having any increase in their tonnage.</P>

      <P>I was merely pointing out the inconvenience under which these citizens are suffering at the present moment and asking the Minister's sympathetic consideration for their case.  The licensed carriers are a <Col N="956" /> section of the community without which we cannot carry on.  They have given valuable service, and with much greater efficiency than Córas Iompair Éireann, in the transport of goods from the capital to rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Throughout the country there are people working in mines and in quarries under very dangerous conditions. I am not advocating that more inspectors should be appointed, because there have been hordes of them going around the country for the past four or five years.  But I think the Minister should consider switching some of these inspectors, now that the emergency is winding up, on to the important work of inspecting quarries and sandpits and seeing if they are in a dangerous condition so far as the workers are concerned.  I know stone quarries in which, even in the opinion of the county surveyor, men are working under very dangerous conditions. As a safeguard for these workers, the Minister should put some system into operation whereby inspectors of his Department would visit these quarries to see if they are in a safe condition for the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that certain funds voted for this Department go to certain citizens to assist them in the development of quarries.  I wonder what machinery the Minister has at his disposal for seeing that these funds, which are given by way of a grant to these people, are properly spent.  The Minister is aware of a case in County Kildare where very serious accusations have been made against the owner of a certain quarry who, it is alleged, is putting the money which he secured for the development of his quarry to other purposes.  I am not saying that that person did that, but there is a very strong rumour to that effect.  I was wondering what machinery the Minister had at his disposal for seeing that such funds, which are provided by the Department for the development of stone quarries and for the assistance of sculptors and others directly concerned, are actually spent for the purpose for which they were intended.  I remember raising a question in this House, but I could not get any information.  Deputy Hughes <Col N="957" /> stated that we were voting money here blindly.  I think that any Deputy who desires information of this nature concerning public expenditure should get it from the Minister on making application, even if such information is to be regarded as confidential.  I think public representatives ought to know how the public money is being spent and whether it is being spent for the purpose for which it was intended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke appealed to the Minister to give consideration to the question of establishing a merchant fleet of our own.  I support that suggestion very strongly.  If we had ships of our own flying the Irish flag and going to every port in the world it would be a very great asset to this country.  I do not know very much about Irish Shipping, Ltd., I do not know who these people are, but what I know is not to their credit.  I would be very glad if the Minister would indicate who is responsible for allocating shipping space.  Is it the Minister or is it some of these people who call themselves Irish Shipping, Ltd.?  I think the Minister should have some say so far as the provision of shipping space for merchants and others for the transport of their goods is concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to export licences, the Department have been very exacting as to what can be exported.  Numerous applications have been made by citizens to the Department for permits to export such articles as wedding presents, etc., and the Department have refused these permits.  Surely the time has come when such a regulation ought not to be enforced.  If a citizen is presented by colleagues or friends with a number of gifts, and if he is going to reside in England or the Six Counties, he should not be prevented from taking these gifts with him.  On one occasion a citizen approached me to ascertain if it would be possible to obtain a permit for a small piece of wedding-cake to be sent to a priest in America.  An application was made in the ordinary way on that occasion, but a permit was refused.  I think that is a silly procedure on the part of the Department.  What difference does it make whether a piece of wedding-cake is kept in this country or <Col N="958" /> exported?  I think there is no need for such red tape so far as small articles are concerned, such as a slice of wedding-cake which could have been posted in a box for 6d.  I am sure there are numerous files in the Minister's Department showing that people have met with very great difficulties in taking articles with them out of this country that were actually their own property.  I know of a lady who was presented with a number of sets of china on the occasion of her marriage by a friend in County Fermanagh and these presents had to be left in the Twenty-Six Counties, so that she was actually deprived of their use.  I think the Minister ought to relax these restrictions so as to permit citizens to take their own belongings with them when they are leaving the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech, on the whole, was I consider a favourable one.  He has conducted his Department fairly well, although there is room for plenty of improvement, as I have indicated. I believe that if any other member of the Government had been shouldering the very heavy responsibilities of the Department the work would not have been carried out in such a capable and efficient manner.  I only hope that the Minister will be able to carry out the work which he has indicated.  I am glad to see that he is prepared to continue to give protection to industries here.  That will be an encouragement to further production here and a very good safeguard for the citizens.  I hope the Minister will continue on that line. Furthermore, I was very pleased to hear the Minister state that he is determined to see that what is produced here will be up to standard.  Certainly, he will have the support and goodwill of all citizens in that respect.  It is only right that, when industrialists are being protected, steps should be taken to see they produce and put on the market the very best commodities.  I am glad to see that the Minister has given consideration to that very important matter and is prepared to ensure that the very best articles will be produced by those manufacturers. That is a step in the correct direction.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I appeal to him to keep on the protection for small <Col N="959" /> industries, especially those which are just coming back to themselves after the very hard four or five years that we have had.  We are just commencing now to get the wheels of industry turning again and producing as they were prior to the war.  Even in the case of new industries, I am glad, as I pointed out in the opening of my address, that the Minister has guaranteed protection.  He has done a good day's work in giving that guarantee, and I am sure he will have the co-operation and support of all concerned.  The results of giving such protection will be to provide employment at home in producing such commodities.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce has been carried out well and efficiently.  The officers and staff of the Department are the officers and staff responsible for steering the country through the war period.  I must say it could have been done better, but if it were not for their efficiency and the amount of energy they put into their work, things would have been very bad.  In the course of representations to the Department, I have found the staff there very helpful and very obliging, and at all times they were willing to assist&mdash;I can say it for myself, at any rate&mdash;Deputies who went to them.  As far as the Minister himself is concerned, I am sure that any matters which were placed before him received his immediate and personal attention.  I hope the good work which he has planned for the future will, please God, be of great benefit to our country in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us on Friday that he was personally convinced that this year and next will be critical years in our economic life.  He also declared that it was not so much what the Government would do that would count, but that it depended on the enterprise and realism with which the occasion was faced by the leaders of industry and the leaders of labour, whether we would make the progress necessary to maintain our people.  He made that statement on Friday and <Col N="960" /> cannot but have had in his mind the difficulties regarding employment that are facing so many thousands of young men and women throughout the country. In the face of that, I find the Minister's statement a very alarming one.  Whatever favourable points Deputy Flanagan found in the Minister's statement, in the light of the situation appreciated by the Minister and seen by ourselves, I see no information at all given to this House as to the way in which the Government are approaching the problems.  I see no outline of what the Government is doing to help either the leaders of industry or the leaders of labour to face those problems which the Minister says, and which we all must agree, are theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also tells us that we are in new circumstances, and have to face the future with fresh and unprejudiced minds, I think we all agree with that. It is a pity he should wipe his mind so clean of all those things he can say with such great energy from time to time, in presenting his statement here. It is an alarming attitude on his part. When we realise what a good skin the Minister can put over any statement he wants to make here, we must be alarmed at the thinness of his statement to us on Friday.  He told us nothing. He told us that the cost of the Department has gone up a little, that the subsidy on flour is reduced, that we are in a critical period, that leaders of industry and labour have to help, that all the various organisations concerned in our economic life must help, that he is going to introduce new legislation regarding the Prices Commission, that there will be a delay in installing new machinery for new industries about which he has information, that he thinks we could assume that our present industrial employment could be increased by 50 per cent, that employment has been increasing, that emigration is not as bad recently as we might have thought it would be, that we are in an inflationary period, that we have a tremendous organisation of committees dealing with the building side of things&mdash;though we get no information as to why we cannot get houses or as to what a house is going to cost&mdash;and then he gives some <Col N="961" /> information in regard to tea and butter and then with regard to air.  It is an astonishing thing that we can get so much information and see so much energy used in regard to aviation and in holding our position in regard to the air services that might touch our country, but that we can get no information and see no energy thrown into the discussion on things of really urgent importance to our people.</P>
    <P>One thing the Department should be praised for is the way in which they are publishing statistics and reports and facing facts.  If we cannot get very much information from the Minister in his statement as to what is being done to help industrialists to bring about the systematic beginning of full employment here, it is something to get the information we have here now regarding our national income.  However, the very fact that we have got that and the Minister has had it before him for perhaps 12 months, should have stimulated him&mdash;if nothing else could do it&mdash;to face the Dáil with an outline of the manner in which that national income is going to be increased. It is there we get any information at all, and it is there we would expect the Minister for Industry and Commerce to speak in a very broad and penetrating way to-day.</P>
    <P>The report on national income and expenditure tells us that more than 50 per cent. of our manufacturing industry is dependent upon the import of materials of one kind or another and that for all the other materials used a considerable part of the material that goes to make them up has to be imported. That means that, for the development of our manufacturing industry, we are dependent to a very large extent on imports.  We all realise that agriculture is the foundation of our economic life, and we agree with the Minister when he says that, in the main, for the expansion of employment here we must depend on the manufacturing industry.  To agree with him there is not in any way to minimise the importance of the agricultural industry or the urgent need to increase our agricultural production.  It is to the extension of our manufacturing industry we must look for the employment of the increasing number of <Col N="962" /> young people and adults who are looking for employment to-day and will be looking for employment to-morrow.  We have not had any information from the Minister as to which one of our industries is getting best on its feet since the emergency.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that there has been a certain increase in industry, as indicated by National Health Insurance registrations.  I do not know that he has given us figures relating to National Health Insurance payments.  In any case, we have not had any inform ation as to which of our industries is getting on its feet, which industry is absorbing an increased number of employees and what is likely to happen during the next 12 months which will enable industrialists to improve their situation.  We are dependent in our manufacturing industry on imports of materials and for the payment of these we are dependent on exports.</P>
    <P>We are concerned with bringing about a state of full employment here, and the extent to which we will be self-sufficient from the point of view of the normal well-being of our people is not so important as the extent of our production.  If we have sufficient production and sufficient trade, whether we are self-sufficient or not does not matter very much.</P>
    <P>No country to-day declares that it will be self-sufficient.  Every country is reaching out in order to see into what kind of conference its representatives can get, so that mutually they may increase their trade.  It is only by mutual trading and profitable exchange that countries can build up their standards of living, and it is only when various countries build up their standards of living in the best possible way that they can be of any assistance to one another.  I asked recently whether we had got invitations to any of the conferences to be held by the various members of the British Commonwealth and I was told &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  We cannot shut our eyes to what is going on, nor can we shut our eyes to the way in which our interests are involved in the discussions that are proceeding.</P>
    <P>The London <i>Times</i> of 24th May reports <Col N="963" /> that, at a meeting of the Dominion Premiers on the day before, the broad principles of commercial and financial policy were decided which were to guide meetings that would take place between the Ministers of Commerce and the Ministers of Finance of the various Commonwealth countries later on during the summer; that is, they had, in conference, come to conclusions as to the broad principles of commercial and financial policy that would guide them at their meetings to be held during the summer. It went on to say that they &ldquo;will be thinking ahead towards the international trade and employment conference which will be held sometime next year,&rdquo; and it stated further: &ldquo;It was agreed that there should not be any rigid Commonwealth policy, but that changes in the system of Imperial preference would be made only as part of an international effort to reduce trade barriers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he still stands for protection, that new industries will be protected here in their early days and that, generally, the policy of giving protection to industry will be continued.  The Minister in other places, and in a very downright way, has made statements with regard to his industrial policy that have induced detached writers on the subject of industrial development here to write that the industrial policy of the Government is now, after a rather expensive experience, returning to the policy of 20 years ago.  I do not know that any policy, even the Minister's policy, will return to the policy of 20 years ago, because we are, as he says, in absolutely new and different circumstances.  But the circumstances in which we are, are circumstances in which very big forces are planning to wipe out trade barriers in all directions and there is a danger that there will be very little sympathy for smaller countries which will wish to develop their industries.</P>
    <P>It has been rather fashionable in Party polities to say that the Fine Gael and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party had no industrial policy.  The very fact that the employment position <Col N="964" /> in the past, when studied in retrospect and compared with the developing employment position up to the war, showed very substantial increases, will give the lie to that kind of argument. I do not think that anybody who will study the work that was done pre- 1932 for the establishment of industry here, and the principles upon which that work was thought out, will want to sustain the charge.  The principles that were discussed and that were used to decide the question of giving tariffs at that particular time are principles that in actual working out apply themselves and test the work that is being done.  These principles will have to be observed in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave stated that tariffs connected with industries that are developed here in such a way as to injure the agricultural industry are no good to the country and, in a general way, that can be accepted; but we cannot simply expose ourselves to the world at large in this matter and expect to be able to carry on our industrial development here, and I do not think there is any Party that will consider we should.</P>
    <P>The very fact that there is a very big reversal of policy being adopted in the world in relation to tariffs and quotas should mean that if we have anything to protect here for the development of new industries or the extension of existing ones we should be in the thick of these discussions in every possible way.  It is a lamentable thing that we can read that South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Great Britain sat down in conference to decide broad principles of financial and commercial policy, that they are directing their thoughts to continuing conferences during the summer and other conferences later and that we had not been there.</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to ask whether the Government have been informed in any way what the broad principles of commercial and financial policy were.  It is particularly important that we should know what plans are developing in the mind of people with whom we have such close connections. Not only are we dependent on a substantial export trade with Great <Col N="965" /> Britain, but we also depend on a substantial import trade with a number of other countries.  We are concerned at present to increase our export trade to Great Britain, and to continue the system whereby they paid during the emergency, and that we were able to buy so much with dollars that we did not earn by dollar trade ourselves.  If we are going to find ourselves isolated from the trading world, simply because we are behind in understanding what policy they are going to work on, we are going to be in a very bad way.  We cannot raise the standard of living of our people, except by increasing very substantially our international trade. It is quite clear that we find ourselves at the beginning of the new period with no increase in our national income, with a considerable amount of unemployment, and a considerable amount of money required to be spent in making up for the lack of capital expenditure in the last six or seven years.</P>
    <P>There are problems arising out of the fact that our neighbour, with whom we must trade, particularly in exports, is impoverished after six years of war.  It is in these circumstances, and with these problems in front of us, that the Minister made up his Estimate this year, and told us really nothing about where, in any sense, our manufacturing industries could see ahead, in order to get into greater production than took place during the war, or where, throughout the world, we have contacts that would secure for us a place in international trade.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can place the information in the Report on the National Income or the information with regard to unemployment or&mdash; though he may not be responsible&mdash;the Report of the Post-war Emergency Committee on Agriculture in front of him and then content himself merely with what he said in the Dáil on Friday last.</P>
    <P>We want to know what is being done to increase and to stabilise agricultural markets abroad, what we are doing, particularly in respect to industries that are here, to re-equip them with the necessary machinery to extend <Col N="966" /> them, and to express in some way the hope for increased employment. The Minister indicated that he could not hope to do that, but he suggested that we could increase industrial employment by 50 per cent.  That sounds to me too much like the same Minister's statement in 1944, when he collected information from industries as to how they were going to extend.  I think that was in respect of 54 or 56 industries or firms; that he had information that they were going to extend, or that they would employ twice as many people.  It is very hard to believe that the Minister has really anything in mind when he does not come down to individual industries. It is no use to tell us that we can increase our industrial employment by 50 per cent.  Deputies are responsible people and they know that there are many people in the city and in the country unemployed.  We have also parents with families who are worried about the future and about getting employment for their children.  We ought to be able to run over the gamut of industry, to see if within 12 months there was a hope of increasing employment for people who are looking for it.  When dealing with manufacturing industries we are dealing perhaps with the most important one.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that the Government have very big plans for the employment of people on drainage, rural electrification, and schemes like that but, to a very large extent, these are what I might call unemployment schemes, and are not reproductive in themselves.  If we do not keep in proper perspective the amount of money we are spending on such schemes, in relation to the development of enterprises that are reproductive, and that will increase employment and grow, we are going to get into serious difficulty in a few years.</P>
    <P>We might get into serious difficulty rapidly.  Anything in the way of inflation suggests that.  If Britain went into an inflationary condition we are going to be worse off here.  If we can increase our manufacturing industries we lessen the danger of inflation.  One of the things that manufacturers here want to know is what the future is likely to be <Col N="967" /> in relation to opportunities to get raw materials and machinery, so that they can with a certain amount of confidence go into additional enterprises that they have in mind.  One of the things that can help to bring about inflation is lack of production.  If we can get a substantial advance in manufacturing production within 12 months, then we would be securing ourselves, to a great extent, against inflation.  If our manufacturers are not encouraged with some kind of clear ideas with regard to the policy to be adopted towards them, and as to the results that are to come from international discussions with regard to trade policy generally, then we are going to have hesitancy on the part of manufacturers, and going to have conditions here which will induce inflation.  The best way to combat inflation at present is to do everything possible to increase our production, and the Minister has not given us any indication in his statement that there is even clear or vigorous thinking on the part of the Government with regard to the way in which they think they are helping the industrialists or the leaders of labour to do their job. The Minister should face up to that in a frank way.  He may not be able to tell us everything he would like to be able to tell us about it, but he ought to treat the House in such a way that we could feel that he was doing his best to tell us everything he knew.  He has left some of us in the position that we feel that he does not know what to think.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The field has been pretty well covered in this debate, but there are a few matters which have been mentioned by other speakers to which I should like to refer.  First, I would like to see the Minister bringing about a comprehensive trade agreement with England.  I think he would very much like to do that himself, and would have liked to have done it for a number of years, but, unfortunately, across the activities of the really very efficient Department of Industry and Commerce lies the dead hand of higher politics.  If the Minister had been free to go to London or to Washington and to have trade talks with <Col N="968" /> the people there, he would have been able to put the situation in a businesslike manner, leaving out entirely any political differences we may have, or may have had with other nations.  It seems to many people in this country that we in Ireland have certain exports to offer, and to offer to countries which are very short of food.  Some of these countries have exports of which we stand in need, and there is between England and Ireland a good flow of trade, but I think we could put up a businesslike case to the British Government and thereby make the wheels of industry in this country turn at least somewhat faster than they are turning at the moment.  In that respect, it is a great pity we have not had discussions and I hope the Minister will have these discussions as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>One matter has been referred to already and I have been thinking about it very much in the last few weeks, that is, the standard and quality of Irish manufactured goods. I happen to have been in a country recently where I was struck by the amazingly high standard of everything produced there.  I looked hard in shop windows and other places for shoddy articles, but I did not see any. It struck me that if we here could introduce the same high quality and high standard of manufactured goods and the same high degree of taste amongst the public, we could go a long way towards solving our industrial problems.  It has given me very great pleasure to see that the Minister is doing his part to bring that about and I would say that I think the Irish industrialists are themselves very anxious and very keen to improve the quality of Irish goods, because, in the long run, our whole industrial policy will stand or fall on its own quality and its own standard.  No amount of Government help can bolster up in efficient industries and the country is learning and has learned that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister and his Department intend to do their bit to bring about that happy state of affairs.  I trust, in that connection, that if and when new industries are encouraged to come to this country, <Col N="969" /> quality and standard will be amongst the subjects for discussion in the Department and that industries will not be afforded the protection they would like to get if their goods are not of the standard and quality which we think we ought to get.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the size of Dublin and suggested that more industries should not be started here. We know that one-sixth of the population of the country is in Dublin, which, from many points of view, is undesirable. From a strategic point of view, in time of war and so on, it is not at all desirable to have all our industrial eggs in one basket, but there is this difficulty that, by virtue of its having one-sixth of the total population, it has far and away the largest group of people in the country, and the industrialist will do more business within ten miles of his factory or workshop, if it is situated in Dublin, than he will do in any other part of Ireland.  I remind Deputies who are anxious to see a dispersal of industry that it does not necessarily follow that, if you start a new industry in Dublin, you will thereby increase the population.  I would remind them that Dublin has a considerable number of unemployed of its own.</P>
    <P>I think I know just a little about the matter of housing supplies, and in that connection I am glad to see that the Department is giving a considerable amount of assistance to firms engaged in that trade who are endeavouring to import goods. Timber is one bottle-neck.  Baths are another bottle-neck, but to a lesser extent.  I am afraid none of us in this country can wave a wand and acquire the quantities of timber we would like, or get the numbers of baths we would like.  I would join with the other Deputies in saying to the Minister that I hope he will continue the good work because I know that he has given the most sympathetic consideration to the needs of the housing industry.</P>
    <P>A Deputy in this House made particular reference to the food which was sent out of this country and, in making that reference, he made a very obvious mistake.  He referred to the fact that people were hungry in this <Col N="970" /> country and at the same time we were sending food out.  Whatever hunger we have in this country it is not due to shortage of food.  It is due to the poverty of the individuals concerned. Our hunger, where it exists, is not due to shortage of food or starvation, and I would be long sorry to see this country adopting a selfish attitude and not exporting all the food it can.  I would, however, like to support the Deputies who referred to the very high cost of living and, in particular, to the high cost of clothing.  Clothing prices seem to have advanced more than have the prices of any other goods.  The increase in clothing prices seems to be greater than in most other goods over the 1939 level, especially the price of children's clothing.  Anybody who has to buy children's clothes at the present moment is hard put to it to find the money to do so and I would join with the other Deputies in pointing that out to the Minister.  I would ask him to look into that situation in particular and to do everything in his power to alleviate those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will go back again to what I said at the beginning, namely, that I would appeal to the Minister to make a comprehensive trade agreement as soon as possible with England.  I do not think it is at all necessary, or desirable, that this country should go with its hat in its hand.  We have things to sell and they have things to sell and it should be possible to bring about an agreement which would be equally acceptable to both sides.  In that connection I can assure the Minister that the business community of this country would welcome such an agreement.  It would show them where they stood and it would enable them to have some idea as to what they could do in the future for the advancement of business and thereby relieve them of a good deal of uncertainty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in this debate but I shall take a different line from that taken by Deputy Dockrell. Dublin no doubt is the home of industry. In every industry which is established Dublin gets priority.  The country outside Dublin is forgotten with the exception of a few small industries which have been established <Col N="971" /> during the Minister's period in office. To my mind, many of those industries survive mainly on child labour and foreign employers.  Take, for instance, the case of the blade factory.  What do you find there?  You find young girls manufacturing these Ever-Ready blades, and other blades, and receiving for their work very small wages. Prior to the emergency these blades could be purchased for 1d. each.</P>
      <P>To-day the same blades cost 2d. but I doubt if that increase is reflected in the wages.  In some of these industries the employers have adopted the attitude that they will not allow their employees to become members of a trade union, and they have threatened to close down their factories if the employees join a union.  That happened in my own home town of Enniscorthy. We have a blade factory there.  The employees in it are completely unorganised and they are afraid to organise.  They have been told that the factory will be closed if they join a union.  You have young girls working there who have to travel three and four miles to the factory for a miserable pittance of 10/- to 15/- a week. There are other employees in the factory in receipt of a higher scale of wages, but that is brought about because they are engaged in piece work. They have to work from the time they arrive in the morning until night, with their noses to the grinding stone. Those are the conditions of employment in some of our new factories.  The Minister may say it is a matter for the trade union.  But these people are given a monopoly and they are given a licence to start a factory in this country&mdash;a licence to make money out of sweated labour.  I think that the Minister ought to take drastic action in cases such as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another problem and that is unemployment.  In the Minister's opening speech here he said that the number of insurable persons in employment was 11,600 higher than in 1944.  I wonder where these 11,000 people have gone into employment?  I know he can account for some of it because of the rotation system.  Under that system you have, perhaps, four men <Col N="972" /> working for four days this week; next week you take on a different four men for another four days.  None of those eight men has got a full week's work. But that is how this increase in employment can be shown.  Under the rotation system men are not allowed to work for six days in the week.  They work for four days.  The result is that you have a certain amount of stamps bought which goes to show that there are more people in employment; in reality, of course, there are not more people in employment.  The increase in stamps comes about because of the rotation system.  In 1943 I advocated in this House that we should abolish that system of rotation.  It is no good to the people themselves.  It is no good to the people who want to get the work done, such as the county councils or urban councils.  If you cannot do better than the present system then I think in fairness you should abolish it altogether and let the people remain on the dole.  You are only adding extra hardships to those people least able to carry the burden by putting them out in winter time on these relief schemes for a paltry four days a week.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is a certain amount of revenue from the stamps and that is how the figure here is accounted for. Take men leaving the Army and those returning from Britain.  What position are they going to be in?  What action has the Minister taken with the British authorities with regard to stamp money?  Many of them over 50 years of age are coming back because the subsistence allowance, which is 24/- a week, is being stopped.  That allowance is paid to any Irishman in Britain on war work, even if he has £10 a week. Here we expect people to live on 14/- a week if they are married and on 6/- a week if they are single.  The Government said they were a poor man's Government when they were clamouring to get into power, yet that is all they can grant to the working-class people.  It was the working-class people, in general, who effected the change of Government.  When the Cumann na nGaedheal Government cut the old age pensions, it finished them in this country.  If this scheme is continued whereby 6/- is given to an unemployed <Col N="973" /> single man and 14/- and a few food vouchers to a married man, these people will finish the Fianna Fáil Government.  There is no doubt about that.  It appears that there are people looking for sites on which to start new industries.  There are towns and villages in the Twenty-Six Counties in which the people have no means of existence except agriculture, which is the mainstay of this country.  Consider the bacon industry.  There is a bacon factory in Wexford that was opened by the Minister for Agriculture.  For the past five years the workers in that factory have not got a full week's work. How is that position to be remedied? There was some hope before the 100 per cent. extraction was brought in. People were getting pollard and bran from the mills.  To-day it is the human beings that are eating the pollard and bran, the pig feeding, and there is no pig production.  In these circumstances there is no hope for the industry.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party promised the people of Wexford that the Drinagh Cement Works would be opened, if they were returned to power.  Instead of that, when Fianna Fáil got into power, the machinery there was sold. A new factory was opened in Drogheda while the factory that had been in existence for years, the Drinagh Cement Works, where the best material is obtainable, was closed down.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to supplies of petrol for private cars as from 1st June.  I am sure many Deputies, like myself, have occasion to go to the Department of Supplies seeking extra allowances of petrol for people in industry, people who have lorries and who transport goods to the mountainside, to the small shops and to the merchants all over the country.  I have a letter here saying that extra allowances cannot be granted.  If anyone should get preference, it is those who are keeping the people in rural Ireland, the small shops throughout rural Ireland, and not the people with private cars.  A great deal is heard, about airports.  Who is going to fly in all these airships?  It is only certain people with money, those who can pay £10, £15 or £25 to go to Paris or somewhere else.  We are spending plenty <Col N="974" /> of money on airports for foreign aeroplanes to come in.  It would be better to spend that money on industry which would provide work for the unemployed in this country.  The majority of our people are not able to travel in the buses: they have not the fares.  The railways are too dear.  When are they going to travel by air?  We will have the big people coming over all right, just as we had Sir John Maffey flying to the Grand National, with some members of the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that that is what the airports and airfields are for&mdash;not to facilitate the citizens of Eire.  All the money that is being spent in that way could be put into new factories throughout the country for the relief of unemployment.  The country is discussing the money that is being spent on air transport.  The Government are taking over hotels at great cost.  People point to hotels and say the Minister owns that hotel. Private people are going to be cut out altogether.  While that is being done, where do the working classes, the poor, come in?  They must live on a miserable allowance of unemployment assistance.  According to the number of children, the allowance is so much, and if you are a single man it is 6/-. These things must be faced up to.  In Wexford the unemployment queues are growing.  How long is it to continue? We had them marching on Leinster House before the war and marching on the county councils.  That will happen again if the Minister and the Government do not wake up because the day has come when the people will not stand in queues waiting for a miserable few shillings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Would not it be far better if we were buying ships instead of aeroplanes? Have not we learnt the lesson of the emergency, when our Irishmen went out on shacks of boats never to come into port and never to be heard of again?  Why should we not have a good fleet of ships instead of talking about giant aeroplanes and luxury liners?  The Minister referred to the Prices Commission.  Another sham. Go through the country and look in the shop windows and see the price of the smallest boy's suit or little girl's frock for First Communion or Confirmation.  The prices are outrageous. Therefore, there is no such thing as a Prices Commission or price control.  The people have been fleeced. What could the working man get? The Minister tied down his wages. Fifteen shillings bonus is all he could receive, which would not at all compensate for the increase in prices. The price of inferior flour, to-day, is 4/- a stone.  A few weeks ago we had white flour at 4/- a stone.  Who is reaping the benefit there?  Is it not the monopoly of the flour millers who are subsidised by this Government, I understand, to the extent of £2,000,000? They are reaping the benefit&mdash;the richest people in the country&mdash;the flour millers controlled by Rank &amp; Co. The people of the country are buying pig feeding.  Why does not the Minister reduce the price when he has reduced the quality?</P>
    <P>Why should people be asked to pay for inferior flour when, a few weeks ago, they could get first grade flour? Who is getting the benefit of the change?  It is not the man in the street anyhow.  These are things that should be faced up to.  I know what it is to work in a flour mill.  I worked in one for 24 years.  During working hours one is inhaling dust and dirt all the time, and yet all that a worker in a mill can get to-day is 15/- to meet the increased cost of living. Is that enough for men who are risking their lives in industries?</P>
    <P>The Minister is now going to set up industrial courts.  In other words, he is going to keep on the Standstill Order for ever.  I know well that if <Col N="976" /> the people had the purchasing power to enable them to buy the necessaries of life, the producers would have a good market at home.  The only other market they have is the British market. In the case of eggs, the big ones go to Great Britain and the small ones, which are stamped, are left to the people of Eire.  How can people buy beef at 2/- and 1/11 per lb.?  As I say, if they had the purchasing power the working class people, who are in the majority, would buy more beef, more eggs and more bacon.  They cannot do so because the Minister will not allow them.  The employers are not allowed to give workers more than 15/- a week.  I know there are some employers who would give it, but there are others who will give it only when they are compelled or threatened with strike action.  The teachers are on strike to-day.  So far as the working class people are concerned, the wonder is that the whole country is not closed down, with men in one town getting 50/- a week, men in another town getting 45/- and the agricultural workers £2 a week.  How can men keep their families on that?  They are told that they have the children's allowance, but there is another snag in that.  The unemployed man with four children, two under age and two over age, gets no children's allowance.  He has to keep his family on £1 19s 6d. a week. There is no means test for the children's allowance.  The richest men in the country, members of the Seanad and Dáil and Ministers can get £1 a week if their families are big enough. But the poor man with four children gets nothing.</P>
    <P>That is not fair, and the Minister should remedy it.  There is money for everything, but for that.  We were told that it would cost £2,000,000 to give every child an additional half-crown. I suppose there will be promises at the next election to give that.  The people were told at the last election that there would be allowances for all children if the Government were returned.</P>
    <P>I think that I have made some points that were not made by some of the other speakers to-day.  I am speaking as a working man, as one with experience <Col N="977" /> of signing up at an employment exchange during a period of depression in the flour-milling industry.  When I was sick I had to wait for my 15/- a week from the National Health Insurance. I know what it is, and I am not talking through my hat.  Probably no other Deputy knows as much about all this as I do, because I have had the practical experience.  In the case of National Health Insurance, if an insured person is out for a couple of weeks he has to appear before a referee in some hotel where the Minister is represented.  If he is a few weeks in arrears with his stamps, permission must be got from the Minister for Local Government before the few stamps that will bring him into benefit can be put on.  Surely, that is not right. If a person is a couple of shillings in arrears with his National Health Insurance payments, he is cut off.  That is going on day in and day out, and I am sure that the Minister has received many representations from Deputies about it.</P>
    <P>To-day I heard Deputies on the opposite side of the House praising this and praising that.  It is all right for some Deputies to do that.  They are not living amongst the people, and do not know their needs.  They know nothing at all.  I am talking from experience. So far as unemployment is concerned the position is very bad, and is getting worse every day.  We are bamboozled with figures.  We are told that the number of unemployed is 11,600 less than it was in 1944.</P>
    <P>Who believes that?  I know that the exchanges are getting packed out.  It may be that a lot of young girls on leaving school are getting into sweat shops and factories around the City of Dublin at the miserable wages given them by employers who are brought here from foreign countries and who are getting a preference over Irish employers.  That is happening, and the Minister knows it.  If one puts down a question and asks for the names of those in control of these factories one will find it hard to understand the names of foreigners which are given.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is going to be the biggest problem in this country.  It was not sound during the war because <Col N="978" /> thousands of our workers had to go out of the country.  Thousands more will go to-morrow only they are staked here.  Turf workers and agricultural workers, even though they cannot find work, are not allowed to go under the regulations.  I want to say to the Minister that he should do away with unemployment altogether and provide work for these men.  There is plenty of work to be done here.  Thousands of men could be employed in every county making roads and should be given decent wages.  While men were in the Army their wives and families had a separation allowance.  At the end of six months, following their discharge from the Army, they now find themselves worse off than ever.  All that a man gets is 15/- a week, and there is no separation allowance.  These men are not going to stand that next winter.  They have responsibilities to their wives and families and are not going to queue at the labour exchanges as they did in the past.  If the Government cannot provide them with work it should get out.  If not, then probably what happened in England will happen here.  The Government in England that won the war got its walking papers, and there is now a new Government in power there.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about post-war planning.  Since 1943, we have had talk about post-war planning.  Where are the plans to-day?  Why are the schemes not put into operation?  The war has been over now for many months and not one additional man has been put into employment.  The people who were unemployed before the war and the men who have been demobilised from the Army are queueing up at the labour exchanges.  There is no post-war plan.  It is not the first time that the Fianna Fáil Party said: &ldquo;We will have work for every man and we will have to bring back the exiles from America&rdquo;.  That went with the wind.  Unemployment is still the big problem and it will continue to be the big problem until it is properly tackled.  Never mind the talk about big aeroplanes, big aerodromes and big seaports.  I should prefer that money to go towards buying some of the good vessels lying in foreign <Col N="979" /> countries on which we could put our Irish sailors, if the necessity arose again, and not, as in the past, when the best of Irishmen went down&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene for a very short time to draw the Minister's attention to a matter in my constituency in which I am very much interested.  That is, the question of providing a new pier at Killybegs.  The history of this matter is fairly well known to the Minister.  He will recollect that, some few years ago, a deputation of which I was a member called at his Department and we were informed then that, when materials became available, a grant would be given towards the cost of erection of the new structure.  In furtherance of that promise, the Department of Industry and Commerce made arrangements with the Board of Works to have plans and specifications prepared for the erection of a new pier.  These plans and specifications have, I understand, been submitted to the Minister's Department and have been under consideration there for some time.  We feel that, due to the condition of the existing structure, this is a very necessary and very urgent work.  The harbour commissioners <Col N="981" /> of Killybegs, over 12 months ago, prohibited the use of the pier by vehicular traffic.  The pier has, to all intents and purposes, been closed to traffic of every kind but, due to the war and the non-importation of coal, that has not affected us very seriously, so far.  However, a good deal of fishing goes on there.  The Sea Fisheries Association contemplate further development there and we feel that steps should be taken as soon as possible to commence the work in connection with the pier.  I should be glad if the Minister could give any indication of when it is proposed to commence work in connection with Killybegs pier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Estimate were stripped of its glamour girl makeup&mdash;the lipstick and rouge with which the Minister decorated it&mdash;there would be practically nothing in it.  On the constructive side, there are only two items.  Two Bills are to come before us, one dealing with the Prices Commission and the other with the settlement of strikes.  These are the two concrete proposals in the Estimate.  The Minister told the House that the new Prices Commission would examine production costs with a view to getting efficiency. That would be all to the good if the Prices Commission were to proceed on the basis of the cost of the most efficient production in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to allege that of which I am not certain but I have been hearing, time and time again in recent years, that what happened before the Prices Commission was: the least efficient producer went before the Prices Commission with an accountant. The price fixed by the Prices Commission was based on the cost of the less efficient producer, so that the highly efficient producer reaped high profits. If that is so&mdash;I am not alleging it is but I have never heard it denied&mdash;let us have a change, because the change will be for the better.  The Prices Commission should proceed on the basis of the costs of the most efficient producer. If the inefficient man does not come up to the standard of the efficient man, the sooner he gets out the better.  The next question is that of tariffs and that is linked up with the Prices Commission, because the tariffs were based on <Col N="982" /> the prices fixed for producers by the Prices Commission.  If a figure is taken to represent the cost of an article produced by a highly efficient manufacturer, then we can easily arrive at a figure that will protect the highly efficient producer against dumping.  If we get that, we shall have done something for industry, but unless we do that, we are doing nothing for the country and certainly we shall not establish conditions under which it will be possible to produce commodities for export and we are only &ldquo;codding&rdquo; ourselves that we are opening avenues for production.</P>
    <P>The Minister very wisely told the House that, of course, future industrial production in this country depends, not on what the Government can do, but on what industrialists themselves can do.  That is absolutely true.  The Minister has never said anything truer and he never will.  Unless our industrialists have vision, ability and efficiency, nothing the Government can ever do will supply these qualities and put industrialists in a position to produce goods that can compete on the export market with the various products of other countries.</P>
    <P>I was greatly disappointed by the timber position as outlined by the Minister.  We have just gone through seven years of abnormal depreciation. The Minister told us that we used 75,000 standards of timber in a normal pre-war year.  We have had seven years of wastage without any replacements whatever, practically speaking, yet this year we are only going to get some 15,000 standards of timber.  That is a grave disappointment.  The Minister proceeded to say that, of course, other materials will have to be used in lieu of timber.  That can be done up to a point in the building trade.  I am not an expert in building, but I know enough from ordinary observation to realise that can be done up to a point.  You can, for instance, put in a concrete floor in some cases where timber was formerly used, but it is a very poor substitute, particularly in small houses occupied by poor people who cannot buy carpets or other forms of floor covering. Concrete is a very poor makeshift and <Col N="983" /> it is not a very pleasant duty to have to put children into a room with a concrete floor without any covering. Of course any floor with a decent roof on it is better than no floor, but concrete, as I say, is a poor substitute for timber.  I understood that there was a rumour recently that Sweden was about to take £16,000,000 of currency from Britain and I was looking forward with hope to some statement that the Minister would get a cut of that £16,000,000 which would give us an opportunity of getting some additional timber from the Baltic States.  I think that no opportunity should be missed to try to get a considerably increased allocation of timber and to get it immediately.</P>
    <P>The last matter with which I should like to deal is the question of transport in this country.  No reference at all was made to that by the Minister. I look upon the question of transport generally as one of vital importance to our existence as a producing nation, as a producer both of agricultural and manufactured goods.  In my opinion, transport costs in this country have been, and are, far too high and these costs are going to be a serious handicap to the marketing both of agricultural and factory produced goods.  There is no use in having prices fixed by the Prices Commission under this new legislation unless the Government proceed to make the transport companies come into line with a highly efficient and cheap system of transport.</P>
    <P>Cheap transport is absolutely essential to production, either on the land or in the factories.  I do not want to labour that point.  Deputies will fully appreciate that, whether they belong to the land or are associated with manufacturing enterprises.  Goods manufactured inland have to be carried to the ports and it is of vital importance that they should be carried cheaply, very cheaply.  They cannot be too cheaply carried because that is an item that will substantially affect the cost of the article on the export market.  The same remarks apply to agricultural commodities.  Every effort should be made to ensure cheaper <Col N="984" /> transport, particularly internal transport, so as to ensure that a larger margin will be left to the producer of live stock and agricultural goods generally.</P>
    <P>In this connection two other matters arise.  I should like to know from the Minister what are his proposals for the future of railways in this country. Has he made up his mind that they are going to be scrapped?  If he has not made up his mind on that question, would he give the House his long-term view and the reasons for his long-term view on that matter?  To take the position in isolated parts of Ireland, along the whole West from Donegal to Kerry, one can fully appreciate that in a future war, utilising the desperate weapons which are being mentioned nowadays, no fuel at all will arrive in this country.  That is what is uppermost in the minds of people living in these districts and in the last analysis, it would be a good thing to retain these light railways.  The lines are laid and rail buses could be run as well as running buses on the roads.  The permanent way is there all the time.</P>
    <P>I am rather at a loss to know what were the exact terms on which light railways, constructed by the British Government some 50 years ago, were handed over to the companies who now operate them.  Were any guarantees given by the companies to the Government when they took them over?  Are these guarantees still binding on the present companies, the successors of the original companies?  If so, I think these companies should be compelled to fulfil their guarantees and to maintain these light railways.</P>
    <P>I think if there was an obligation on these companies to maintain them when they took them over&mdash;and I rather think there was, because so far as my memory goes back, prior to the Treaty, the Office of Public Works, representing the British Board of Trade, compelled the companies to maintain these light railways for the transport of passengers and goods&mdash;the companies should be made to carry out their obligations.  I should like to have that matter cleared up.  It would be highly unfortunate if the companies, because of the fact that these light railways were allowed to run into a state of disrepair <Col N="985" /> owing to the absence of inspection for the last 25 years, could now come along and say: &ldquo;It is useless to try to work these railways; they are in such a state of disrepair that it would not be safe to carry goods on them, much less human beings.&rdquo;  I think they should not be allowed away on that pretext.</P>
    <P>The Government are going to put a general scheme of rural electrification into operation and the Minister mentioned the development of some future industries which he hoped would, of their own merits, be capable of carrying on an export trade.  I should like to make an appeal for what are called in another country the distressed areas, namely, the areas I have been referring to on the west coast of Ireland.  They are the distressed areas of this country. We have had the make-believe that we were doing something for the people in those areas, that they are a national asset.  We set up a doll factory and a few petty industries of that kind.  Now, when we are at the crossroads so far as the future of this country is concerned, would it not be a good thing if we made a bold attempt to do something for these distressed areas, in other words, for the Gaeltacht? There is an ample supply of workers there living under rural conditions.  The establishment of industries in these districts would keep these people from coming to the City of Dublin.  In my opinion, it is a blot on the economic life of this country that there should be half a million people in Dublin.  It is a grave mistake that in a small country of less than three million people there should be half a million people in the capital city.  That is unfortunate and it is bad policy nationally.</P>
    <P>Now that we are approaching a new era, the steps that we take within the next five years will affect this country for a very long time and, unless we buckle to and do things boldly, we will lose the race and this country will have to take up a position far down in the queue.  The future of these people I refer to under these new conditions should be taken into immediate and urgent review.  With future electrical development&mdash;I hope it will be brought into immediate operation&mdash;we will have the power necessary to establish factories <Col N="986" /> in any part of the country.  I notice that in England they are proposing to place factories in the country and build towns around the factories for the workers.  Why cannot we do that when we are going to distribute electric power all over the country?  It would be a great blessing in more ways than one.  We would be doing something real for those people whom we prate about as a great national asset because they are preserving the national language.  Let us do something to preserve them, if they are preserving this great national heritage for us.  We should do more than pay lip-service to them and leave them in the position they have been in in the past, except in so far as they can improve their position by their own endeavours.  At present they have to go on a Tuesday to a labour exchange to sign their names and on some other day of the week to draw a few shillings which would not be sufficient to keep them in cigarettes.  The opportunity now presents itself to do something for them and, in God's name, let us buckle to and do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to allude first to the question of the petrol allowance and transport generally. Before the Minister extends any further facilities to private users of petrol he should consider, in the first instance, the position as regards transport and transport companies, and, secondly, the petrol supply for lorries working in rural areas.  There seems to be a general drive to put all the rural traffic on to the railways which, for several months of the year, are not able to cater for ordinary traffic.  During the past fortnight I have had a letter from a creamery company about their petrol supply.  They had five or six lorries collecting milk all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are even to keep up the present butter ration, then the milk will have to be taken from these areas into the creameries.  It cannot be taken if the petrol supply is cut short and the result will be a further shortage of butter. From my own place I can see every Sunday thousands of private cars flying down to Youghal and Garryvoe, while at the same time the general public <Col N="987" /> from Youghal to Cork and from Cobh to Cork, the people who cannot afford motor cars, are left without any means of transport.  Before any further facilities are given to the users of private cars, facilities for public transport in those areas should be considered.  I was rather amused by Deputy O'Leary, because I could not make out what he was driving at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We know very well why. Deputy O'Leary can have a strike any day in the week, just as Deputy Alfred Byrne can fix a teachers' strike.  I would like to deal with things as I see them, give praise where praise is due and blame where blame is due and let us see how we work out in regard to <Col N="988" /> industry and employment generally.  I happen to be a Deputy for a constituency for the past 20 years and know the condition of affairs in that constituency in 1932 and even in 1939. I have seen a gradual increase in employment right through.  In the town of Cobh, where there was nothing once, to-day there is a dockyard giving employment to 200 or 300 men at constant work.  In fact, there is not room there for the ships waiting for repairs.  I would like to say a word of commendation to the Minister for the manner in which he has struggled on in regard to the steel works there. Where previous Ministers would have thrown the matter overboard, he has stuck it out year after year, until now it looks like being a success.  When it comes to a successful issue, it will give employment to 600 or 700 people. Those are things which were done previously by the foreigner for us, but now are being done at home by our own people.</P>
      <P>We can go on to the next town, Midleton, which was practically closed down but is now working overtime. There you have a former Deputy of this House, who was not by any means a supporter of the Fianna Fáil policy, who has faith enough in the policy of our Minister for Industry and Commerce to put in thousands of pounds there, starting to give further employment to a town that was practically derelict.  We go on to Youghal, where the same man has put in another factory, which will give employment to 200 or 300 more.  I take these as I see them and make a fair comparison between what I see happening at the present day and what I saw carried on previously.  If our policy were a policy of unemployment, such people would not be prepared to invest thousands of pounds in building factories.  If we travel on to the Blarney mills, we find there are three times as many employed there as there were some years ago.  If we go to Douglas, we find two factories going all out, with three times the number previously employed.  Only last week the Harbour Board had an application for five or six acres from Ideal Weatherproofs to build a factory there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were knocked out at the start <Col N="989" /> of the war, owing to the impossibility of getting stuff they used in waterproofs, but they were Cork men and that meant they were not going to be kept knocked out.  They turned their hands to tweeds and other things, with the result they have a full staff employed now in the old factory and want a new factory to carry on what they were doing pre-war in the old one, making two factories instead of one. That is rather a big change in a small three-seat constituency, but those are facts which cannot be contradicted. I invite Deputy O'Leary or any other Deputy interested to come down there and I will show him around the whole lot.  It would be worth anyone's while, if he is not a believer in the ability of Cork men to do it, or if he is not a believer in the success of our industrial policy.  Let them come down and walk around my constituency and see it for themselves.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with one point which I think the Minister should take in hand and straighten up.  I would like to know how the Minister arrived at the fixed price of beet during the past two or three years.  A few years ago, it was fixed at 80/- a ton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has not responsibility, I do not wish to do so. I only want to fix the responsibility somewhere and I have to keep on trying until I do.  I have read a paper called <i>Irish Industry</i>, which is publish every month and which tells about all the industries that are so successful and paying six per cent. dividends and have so much turnover and so much money they hardly know what to do with it.  Then I come back and look at our principal industry.  If the Minister can fix a Prices Board, before which other industries can appear to have the cost of production examined and their prices increased if the cost goes up, why is he not prepared to do the same thing for the biggest industry of the lot, the agricultural industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some few years ago, a Bill was passed here giving a fortnight's holidays to industrial workers.  All the boys came to the Department a few weeks afterwards, showing the cost to them and that was quietly passed on to the fellow who cannot pass it to anyone else, the individual farmer. At present, when you buy a half ton of artificial manure, you have to pay for the bonus and the holidays for Goulding's workers, and for the railway workers as well.  As I have said, the price of beet was fixed some three years ago.  Since then, by Ministerial Order, agricultural wages have been increased, but I do not think they have been increased enough.  The position in agriculture to-day is such that, unless some radical change is made within the next 12 months, there will not be a farmer's man or a farmer's son on the land&mdash;and they would be great fools if they stayed there under the present circumstances.  Every other industry can give at least 50 per cent. more wages than the agricultural industry, and every other industry can ask fewer hours of employment per week.  When those conditions are weighed up by any individual who has nothing to depend on but his labour, it is only just that he will look for the most remunerative place to take that <Col N="991" /> labour to.  He sees the factories stopping work at 12 o'clock on Saturday and the workers resuming their employment there on the following Monday morning.  He has to continue working beyond 6 o'clock on Saturday evening in the harvest field, maybe until 9 o'clock.  Then he has to go in on a Sunday morning or a Sunday evening to milk the cows so that the lads in the factories can have the milk supplied to their doors.</P>

      <P>Who fixes the price of milk for the people in the cities?  I was on a deputation last week to the Minister for Agriculture and when that matter was mentioned I was told it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I should like to know how the Minister arrived at the price of milk in Cork City during the winter months.  I should like to know what costings he examined before he arrived at that price.  It would be interesting to hear what greater cost there is in producing milk in the middle of the County Meath as compared with the vicinity of Cork.  How is it that the price of milk to the farmer who supplies Cork City is 4d. a gallon less than the price paid to the farmer in County Meath?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Minister should look over the costings handed to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, last week on that subject. Unless he can seriously question those costings, he should give the cost of production, plus a little profit, to the producers of milk for the inhabitants of the towns and cities, just the same as he gives the cost of production, plus profits, to industrialists.  There is no justification for having one law for the agricultural community and a different law for the industrial community. That is unfair and unjust.</P>
      <P>I have studied the problem closely and I have come to the conclusion that if the Minister will give it serious attention he will make a success of it, the same as he has made of everything else on which he has laid his hands. I praise every bridge as I pass it.  I would like to pay a tribute to the manner in which the officials in the Department have handled any complaints I made to them during the past 12 months.  It is very seldom I have any word of praise for a Department or for a civil servant.  I must say quite frankly that I have met with every courtesy in the Department and with absolute success in practically 99 per cent. of the matters that I have laid before the officials.  The system working in the Department leaves nothing to chance.  They are practically 100 per cent. right there, and that is more than I can say for most of the other Departments that I have to visit in my pilgrimage from week to week.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to devote some of his attention to the agricultural industry.  Unless we succeed in bringing agriculture into line with our other industries we will have not a mere flight from the land, but absolute desertion of the land; you will find it practically impossible to get labour to sow or save the harvest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief, although I must admit it is tempting to ramble for quite a long time when one sees so many Votes under discussion in the one debate.  My points will be purely local ones.  Deputy Corry painted a rosy picture of Cork County and Cork towns.  I do not think one could paint the same type of picture, or anything <Col N="993" /> even approaching it, as regards Wexford County.  I almost think the Minister has forgotten that there is such a place as Wexford.  I have tried on many occasions to remind him of its existence.</P>
      <P>My main reason in rising this evening is to mention Wexford Harbour.  I am interested in Wexford Harbour because it has for a long time meant Wexford town and I may assure the Minister that the citizens of Wexford town and, for that matter, the county, are very upset that nothing has been done about the harbour since 1932.  At that time the present Government promised to do something to improve the harbour.  In 1934 there was a move and the harbour commissioners were induced to spend some thousands of pounds on a survey of the harbour with the object of improving it.</P>
      <P>There was an intimation that a certain amount would be spent on it. After the hubbub died down there was a lull for a year or two and the whole project was forgotten, not alone by the Minister, but by the Wexford Harbour Commissioners.  At the present time there is the sorry sight of Wexford Harbour growing worse and worse, and it looks as if eventually there will be nothing across the bar but a fine silvery strand.  I do not propose to tell the Minister what should be done about Wexford Harbour, but I ask him to give the harbour commissioners and the people of Wexford an idea as to whether improvements could be made, or must they resign themselves to the fact that nothing can be done and that they must forget all about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not pretend to have any engineering knowledge, but for the benefit of Wexford and the commissioners, let the Minister make some statement as to whether the harbour can be improved or be developed as a strand, as it will eventually become in a few years if money is not spent on it. If it is possible, I urge the Minister to have something done there as soon as possible, because the harbour is of importance not only to Wexford town but to the south-east of Ireland. Speaking on behalf of the people of Wexford, I consider that there is no reason why it should not compare as <Col N="994" /> an industrial town with Belfast. Wexford is nearer to Great Britain and is an ideal town with a fine country around it.  Wexford is undoubtedly the best agricultural county in Ireland, while the town has industries, including foundries.  The hinterland is an agricultural area, but the town is fairly well placed as a busy industrial centre.  I should like the Minister at some stage in the near future to say something about Wexford Harbour, so that the people may know whether it can or cannot be improved.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to have missed the opportunity on the Tourist Bill of asking the Minister why he did not make some grant towards the improvement of Rosslare Strand.  It is one of the oldest seaside resorts in Ireland.  I wish the Minister at some time would ramble down to County Wexford as, if he has not been in Rosslare recently, he will find that it has deteriorated. Many distinguished people who visited Rosslare praised it as one of the best seaside resorts on the east coast.  If the Minister went there now he would be amazed to see how much it has deteriorated, owing to the income of the population having suffered in recent years.  The residents are dependent mainly on the tourist trade. Rosslare is ideally situated for travel to Britain, being well served by rail and shipping routes.</P>
    <P>Wexford Commissioners expended thousands of pounds on a survey of the harbour, but as there were only a half dozen ships calling during the war years, their income suffered.  I had occasion to make representations to the Department about an annual grant to the commissioners, and I was told that it would be given only in relation to the actual money that had been expended.  I was not conversant with the position at the time, and when I went back to Wexford the answer I got was that the commissioners could not possibly expend any money on dredging, or on any other type of work now, and, consequently, would have no expenditure to show in order to get a grant.  The grant would not amount to much.  It was also suggested that the harbour commissioners could borrow, but in that respect I was told that everything they <Col N="995" /> had in the way of property was mortgaged, and that, for the present, as they had no means of raising money for carrying on dredging work, it was imperative that they should get a Government grant.  I do not know what the legal position is, or if it is possible to give a grant.  Something, however, should be done to enable the harbour commissioners to carry on until they get other moneys from Wexford County Council and from Wexford Corporation.  I do not expect the Minister to make any reference to the points I have raised now, but I should like him, or the officials of the Department, to have the position regarding Rosslare Strand investigated, to see if something can be done that would benefit the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey stated that he tabled the motion to refer back the Estimate, mainly on the ground that he considered the Department of Industry and Commerce too large to be properly supervised by one Minister. It would, I think, be a serious ground of criticism if it were proposed to concentrate in one Department, as a permanent arrangement, a wider range of functions than one Minister could possibly keep track of.  That is not the case so far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, the House will remember that the Taoiseach announced his intention at some stage to constitute a new Ministry, which would have responsibility for the administration of income-maintenance services.  To that new Ministry, when established, will be transferred the administration of employment exchanges, and services that are associated therewith, the employment insurance services, and the employment assistance services, together with the minor services which are also carried on through the exchanges, such as the recruitment of labour for harvest work, and the special register of turf workers.  On the establishment of that new Ministry, the Department of Industry and Commerce will also lose responsibility for the children's allowances scheme and <Col N="996" /> food allowances, so that quite a substantial block of work, at present carried on through the Department of Industry and Commerce, will be transferred from it when the changes foreshadowed by the Taoiseach are carried into effect.  Secondly, a large part of the work of the Department is concerned with emergency conditions, which will end when emergency conditions end.</P>
    <P>The House will remember that there were two Departments, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the permanent organisation, and the Department of Supplies, the temporary organisation set up for the duration of the war to handle the supply problems which arose during the war. Originally, both Departments were under separate Ministers, but, after some experience of that arrangement, the Taoiseach decided that the two Departments should be administered by the same Minister.  Instead of giving that Minister more work to do by making him responsible for both Departments, a great deal of unnecessary work was avoided, because, during the period when they were two separate Departments in the charge of two separate Ministers, a large part of the time of each Minister was occupied in keeping his administration in step with the administration of the other, and uniformity of administration was immensely facilitated when one Minister was placed in charge of both Departments.</P>
    <P>With the termination of the war and the gradual termination of emergency difficulties, the device of amalgamating the two Departments was adopted, and, although it is true that many of the functions which were formerly discharged by the Department of Supplies have still to be carried on under the Department of Industry and Commerce, these functions will tend to diminish, and it would be clearly undesirable and impracticable at present to make any arrangement of a purely temporary character, because it would have to be such, merely to relieve the pressure upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the senior officers of his Department.  I think, therefore, that, while Deputy <Col N="997" /> Morrissey might legitimately complain if there was a proposal to have as a permanent arrangement too many functions charged to one Minister, there is not the same room for criticism when it is a purely temporary arrangement and is in fact the most practicable arrangement in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Estimate, I referred to the matters with which I thought the Dáil would be most immediately concerned.  I avoided references to matters which were before the House in connection with legislation in the recent past, or which were likely to come before the House in the near future on Bills to be introduced. Some Deputies, however, have complained that I did not make special reference to some matters. One of these was the development of a merchant marine service.  Many of the Deputies who spoke of the development of a merchant marine service indicated, however, that they have no conception whatever of the problems that are involved in that connection.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to talk of an Irish merchant marine, but the first fact we must get accepted generally in the Dáil, if we are going to do anything at all along that line, is that we cannot run a merchant marine on sentiment. A merchant marine service is in competition with every country in the world which is operating ships on the high seas.  We cannot protect it; we cannot get it trade by means of customs duties or quota arrangements. It has to go out and get its trade in competition with the rest of the world, and no amount of sentiment will get it trade, not even from Irish shippers, if its performance is less efficient or its charges higher than those of any competing service.</P>
    <P>After the last war, some years after, there was a shipping slump.  Deputy Corry, who spoke recently of Cobh, will remember, as any other Deputy who visited Cobh during that period will remember, the hundreds of ships which were tied up in Cobh Harbour, which were rusting there and which could have been bought for their scrap value.  Many a country which had attempted to organise a merchant <Col N="998" /> marine service on a basis of sentiment or on a basis of wishful thinking had its ships and its flag prominent in Cobh Harbour during that period and in other harbours throughout the world, where similar lines of ships were anchored permanently, until the ship-breakers got hold of them and broke them up for scrap.  If we are to go into the merchant shipping business now, we must face the prospect that we will meet severe competition at some stage and that we cannot hope to win through against that competition, unless we start on right lines. We hope to start on right lines.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited was organised during the war.  It did a good job during the war.  It is still carrying the bulk of the commerce of this country. At the present time, it is operating approximately 10 ships and it is operating them at competitive freights on deep-sea voyages and making considerable profit out of its business.  During last year it made a profit of £638,000 on its shipping business and £232,000 on its marine under-writing business. It is therefore in a strong position to face the task of getting its service on to a peacetime footing and equipped to meet the competition which will arise in peace time.  It can only do that by getting ships as good as those which anybody else is operating, managing these ships as well as anybody else is managing them and at a cost which will enable it to quote the same freight charges as other people can quote.</P>
    <P>We cannot buy ships easily now.  So far as getting ships built is concerned, Irish Shipping Limited have been endeavouring to get orders accepted in various dockyards throughout the world for the construction of ships of the kind they want.  Quite rightly, they decided that they will not be rushed into buying ships of a kind they do not want.  There is some possibility of acquiring ships already built in the United States and inquiries are being pursued in that quarter.  I think, however, that the management of Irish Shipping Limited are quite right in their view that it is unwise to be stampeded now into expending money upon ships which are not suitable for the type of trade in which they propose to engage and which will not be as <Col N="999" /> economical of operation and as satisfactory in performance as ships they may acquire subsequently.  It does not matter if we lose a year or two in adding to our fleet, provided that, when the fleet has been built up, it will be able to maintain itself in normal conditions, and in normal conditions it will have to meet very severe competition.</P>
    <P>The ships of the Irish merchant marine will not necessarily be engaged in the Irish trade.  One of the reasons why Irish private enterprise was never able successfully to maintain itself in shipping to Irish ports was the abnormal nature of the trade of this country. The bulk of our exports went to Great Britain, whereas a large part of our imports came from overseas countries. The ships, therefore, engaged on regular services to Irish ports from overseas countries could not be certain of getting return cargoes from our harbours and therefore had to seek the return cargoes elsewhere, or travel light, which was an unprofitable business. If, therefore, we are to build up a merchant marine service, it must be prepared to engage in trade wherever it can get trade.  At present, Irish Shipping Limited is operating regular services, that is to say, services which are announced in advance and on the reliability of which shippers can depend, between Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and New York, Norfolk, Montreal, St. John's, Gothenburg and Oslo.  It is also engaged in the tramp business and ordinarily it is in the tramp business that Irish merchant ships will be able to find occupation and profit.</P>
    <P>I assume that Deputies understand what I mean by that term.  It is, perhaps, best illustrated by the present occupation of the <i>Irish Beech</i>, one of the ships of Irish Shipping, Limited, which is now taking a cargo of Irish gypsum to Denmark.  When it has unloaded the cargo of gypsum in Denmark it will proceed to Gdynia for a cargo of coal.  Having loaded the cargo of coal at Gdynia, it will proceed with that cargo of coal to Finland.  At Finland, having discharged its cargo of coal, it will load a cargo of pit props for Great Britain.  On arrival in Great Britain it will unload its cargo of pit <Col N="1000" /> props and it will there take on a cargo of coal for delivery here.</P>
    <P>That is the type of tramp trade which ensures that the ship is occupied at every stage of the journey and is earning money at every stage of the journey; and if, by good management, ships can be kept fully occupied then profits will be earned.  It they have to travel light, or in ballast, then losses will be incurred.  We cannot at the present time enable our ships to engage freely in any trade that may be available to them.  We have abolished many of the controls that were necessary during war-time and, in the case of the Atlantic route, the only controls remaining are very nominal controls indeed; but for the present, at any rate until shipping conditions become easier, we have to make sure that the services of Irish ships, which are essential to the requirements of the Irish people, will be available, but subject to that overriding consideration the company has been allowed to get business in competition, and to carry on as an ordinary commercial enterprise would.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that, although Irish Shipping, Ltd., is a Government company, in the sense that it was promoted by Government and the capital originally provided by the Government, it is not intended that it should have any monopoly in shipping, and there are other privately owned Irish shipping companies on the development of which we are also relying for the expansion of the Irish merchant marine.  It may be that other private interests will come into shipping business here and we shall welcome them into it; and the development of a merchant marine must not be regarded solely as a Government concern.  It is not intended that it should be solely a Government concern.  If it is to be developed successfully, not merely must the enterprise of the Government be backed by the enterprise of individuals but there must be, of course, the fullest co-operation from Irish traders, Irish merchants, Irish importers, and of Irish seamen and officers upon whose efficiency and capacity to work the success of the whole enterprise will ultimately depend.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> Many Deputies referred to the trade agreement which was made in 1938 between this country and Great Britain.  Deputy Dockrell assumed that we would be glad to make another agreement with the British Government now.  I do not think he is quite right in that assumption.  The trade agreement of 1938 is largely inoperative and it is inoperative because its provisions do not apply to present trading conditions.  Any Deputy who procures a copy of the agreement and reads it to refresh his memory will understand what I mean.  That agreement was made at a time when the British Government and ourselves were each afraid that the other would want to sell them too much goods. We were afraid the British would want to sell us too many of their products and the British were afraid that we would sell them too many of ours. Trading circumstances have now entirely changed.  Our difficulty in trade negotiations with Britain now is to secure, in our interest, undertakings to supply specified quantities of the goods we need and the British interest, on the other hand, is to increase the outflow of foodstuffs from this country to supply their needs.  I do not think it is desirable to negotiate on a permanent basis a new trade agreement with Great Britain, or any other country, until it is possible to foresee with greater certainty what future trading conditions will be like.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the fact that Great Britain and some of the Dominion Governments were consulting on trade matters and inquired if we had any information as to what these Governments were discussing. Without getting any official intimation it is easy enough to guess what they are discussing.  There is a proposal, which originated from the British and American negotiations over the recent loan agreement, to hold an international trade conference next year&mdash; an international trade conference which, according to those who are promoting it, will have for one of its primary purposes the abolition of trade preferences.  A large part of the trade between Great Britain and the Dominion countries is based upon Imperial preference; and it requires <Col N="1002" /> no great wisdom to deduce that what these Commonwealth Governments are discussing at the present time is the attitude they are going to take when faced with a demand for the abolition of Imperial preference.</P>
    <P>The 1938 Agreement between ourselves and Great Britain also provides for preferences.  We undertook to give British products admitted here, subject to duty, preferential treatment. When a duty is in operation the rate applicable to British goods is lower than the rate applicable to similar goods of other origin.  Similarly, the British undertook to give our products certain preferences in Great Britain. It was not so much that our agricultural goods were entitled to get entry into Britain free of duty&mdash;that was a considerable advantage in 1938 &mdash;but the British also undertook to give them certain preferences there. All these provisions relating to the circumstances of 1938 do not relate to present circumstances.  When the British Government set up central buying organisations and decided that &ldquo;the sole buyer of eggs, the sole buyer of butter, and the sole buyer of bacon and other agricultural produce would be one or other of organisations which were established and which pay whatever prices are decided upon after negotiating or bargaining&rdquo; then, of course, all treaty provisions for preferences and entry free of customs duty became meaningless.  There is no point in having a right of free entry for our products into Great Britain, or a preference over the products of other countries, when a central buying organisation there decides how much they will buy and what they will pay for it.  It is no longer a free market and clearly it would be undesirable to negotiate now a new trade agreement with Great Britain as a permanent arrangement until the nature of the circumstances in which trade can be carried on in Great Britain permanently is known.  What we require to get at the present time, and what we have been discussing with the British in relation to that trade agreement, is such modification of its existing terms as will remove any difficulties that will arise in present circumstances and particularly permit <Col N="1003" /> us to facilitate the development of production here in order to meet deficiencies in our supply which cannot be met by imports from Great Britain or elsewhere.  There are some of the provisions of the agreement which are temporarily inconvenient.  I have no doubt whatever that it will be possible under the terms of the agreement itself to get those provisions modified to an extent necessary to meet our position. I doubt if it is wise for us to attempt to negotiate a permanent agreement and I doubt if the British Government would be willing to negotiate such an agreement until the general position in relation to world trade is clarified and until the outcome of this international conference, with particular reference to preferential tariffs, is known.</P>
    <P>In connection with trade negotiations, Deputy Cogan suggested that we should have consultation with manufacturing interests, before concluding agreements.  I think it is just as well that this matter has been raised because many statements have been made in relation to it which do not appear to me to be commonsense.  It is obviously desirable that manufacturing interests, or agricultural interests, or other interests that are concerned with the provisions in trade agreements with other countries, should have opportunity of putting forward their views and getting their views examined. The manufacturing interests of this country have that opportunity now; but there would appear to be amongst the manufacturers' organisation some members who seem to think that, not merely are they entitled to have an opportunity of submitting their views but that no treaty should be made which they do not like or of which they do not approve.  That is a different issue altogether.  We cannot make trade agreements with Great Britain, or any other country, entirely in the form we want them to be.  Every trade agreement is the result of negotiation. Every provision of the agreement is the result of bargaining.</P>
    <P>While the object of any delegations sent over from this country to negotiate a new agreement must be to make <Col N="1004" /> the best possible bargain, clearly, they cannot just dictate the terms of every section of the agreement and get those sections accepted without question by the other side.  In the negotiation of the Agreement of 1938 there were some provisions that the negotiators on behalf of this country accepted reluctantly. Some manufacturers here did not like them.</P>
    <P>But, that treaty should not be considered solely in relation to these provisions. The other provisions of the agreement must also be taken into account.  The purpose of the negotiators is to make an agreement which on the whole serves the national interest.  The agreement we made in 1938 got us back the ports, ended the land annuities dispute, secured the abolition of all the discriminatory duties upon Irish goods exported to Great Britain, gave the prospect of a revival of prosperity to agriculture, ensured the stability of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>These advantages secured by us must be put against the provisions of the agreement which the British Government desired and which were inserted therein during the course of the negotiations.  I have no doubt that when we come down to negotiate new trade agreements with Great Britain or with other countries with which we have mutual trading interests, we will very frequently find ourselves up against a point at which we will have to decide whether a particular provision which the other party wants is so deterimental to our interests that we should make no agreement at all, or have to accept provisions that we would prefer to have deleted from the draft in consideration of the fact that the treaty, or proposed treaty, as a whole was to our advantage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan also referred to the case of Solus Teoranta, a company in County Dublin, which began the manufacture of domestic glassware during the war.  I am referring to this case, not because I want to bring in reference to an individual company but because there is an issue which arises out of the case made on behalf of that company on which the Dáil must make up its mind.  This company began the manufacture of domestic glassware by what is known as the hand-blowing <Col N="1005" /> process.  In other words, the manufacture was undertaken by people who blow glasses individually in the same manner as glasses were made hundreds and thousands of years ago.  The glasses that were produced were reasonably good, but they were dear. Domestic glasses which sell very cheap can be produced by mechanical methods and these glasses were imported in large numbers before the war and are becoming available again. Their prices are well below the prices of the glasses produced by this Irish concern and they are the type that is normally used in the worker's house or in refreshment places, where breakages are very frequent and the costs of replacement are heavy.  As I understand, the suggestion put forward on behalf of this company is that such a tariff should be imposed upon imported glasses, or such other prohibition on their import brought into effect, that the people here would be denied the opportunity of getting cheap glasses and compelled to buy the dearer glasses produced at Bray.</P>
    <P>First of all, let me say that no tariff, except some tariff of a fantastic height, would achieve the result.  The tariff would have to be 200 or 300 per cent. and, clearly, what the proprietors of this concern have in mind is quantitative restriction of imports.  I do not believe in it.  I think it would be bad business.  I think it would be bad business because it would be unfair to the public to compel them to buy a much dearer commodity, even though it may be of better quality, when they prefer to have the lower grade at a cheaper cost.  Furthermore, I think it is a complete fallacy for the proprietors of that concern to assume, having examined our trade statistics and learning that so many thousands of dozens of glasses were imported annually&mdash;glasses at this low price&mdash;that the same number of glasses will be purchased annually if the price is two or three times as high.  I think that is completely fallacious. The third reason why I would not be prepared to go upon the representations I have received in this case is that I am not convinced that the mechanical process cannot be successfully established here and glasses produced, for consumption here or for <Col N="1006" /> export, as cheap as they are being imported and as good as they are being imported.</P>
    <P>If there is another reason why I view this application rather doubtfully it is that it has been put forward for my consideration, not on its merits as a business proposition, but by means of political pressure of one kind and another.  The case is made in the Dáil, the case is made in the local authorities and by various political organisations, that I am in some way prejudiced against this concern.  I have always found that when a case for a protective duty was turned down on its merits or when somebody wanted to get some industrial advantage which he did not believe he could support by arguments relating to its business merits, first of all.  I got resolutions from the local Fianna Fáil club; if that did not work I got resolutions from the local Fine Gael club and, if that did not work, from the local Labour club.  I always had reason to believe that when political pressure was turned on there was something wrong with the proposition as a business proposition and, in cases of this kind, it is only the business merits of the proposition with which we should be concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is true to say that the statement I made here in introducing the Estimate represents any change in the policy of the Government in relation to industrial development. I certainly did not intend to convey that there was any change. We recognise that circumstances are now different from what they were before the war.  Deputy Mulcahy quoted some writer in a trade journal who stated that my declaration meant that the tariff policy of this State was now back to where it was 20 years ago. He himself did not agree that that was an accurate description of it.  I tried to make it quite clear that we do not intend to adopt, and do not agree with any proposal that we should adopt, the device of prior examination of tariff applications by a tariff commission or any similar body whatsoever. I explained in my introductory speech the procedure which the Government consider most suited to our circumstances. <Col N="1007" /> We recognise, however, that the circumstances that existed before the war no longer exist.  Before the war, other countries were fighting for export markets by every device they could apply.  Goods were dumped here.  Goods were consistently and regularly sold for export at prices lower than they were sold in the home markets of the countries of their origin.  Currencies were juggled around to get advantage in export trade and for many years before the war foreign goods were reaching this country at prices which were well below the cost of their economic production here or even the cost of their economic production in the countries from which they came.  Japanese goods in those years were delivered here at prices, at our ports, which were less than the freight charges involved in shipping them here.  These circumstances required abnormal protective measures to develop Irish industry and abnormal protective measures were in fact applied.  Such circumstances will not exist again for many years.  They certainly do not exist now and the degree of protection which was required to stimulate industrial development before the war is no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>As I told the Dáil, many of the new industrial propositions which have reached my Department in the past few months have been put forward by firms that do not contemplate that they will require any protection of that kind whatever, except at some future stage, if the international trade conference to be held does not succeed in regularising international trading practices and dumping should again be resorted to.  I indicated the circumstances, however, in which the Government would be prepared to afford protection for new industries and in such circumstances the level of protection would be that which in the individual case was regarded as necessary, subject to subsequent review when the industry has become established, when its initial difficulties have been overcome, when its workers have been trained and its machinery run in and when it should be capable of working <Col N="1008" /> to a higher degree of efficiency than might be possible in its earlier years.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies talked about the growth of State intervention in business.  If they are basing their argument on the experience of war years, they are, obviously, upon fallacious ground.  During the war and because of the war, the Government had necessarily to take control over the distribution and supply of commodities that normally it would not have interfered with at all.  Its controls were occasioned by scarcity, and were designed to protect the public interest in circumstances of scarcity. These controls will disappear as soon as the scarcity ends.  I noticed, however, that many Deputies who deplored the growth of what they described as State intervention in business were at the same time the very Deputies who wanted to put upon the Government responsibility for the manner in which industry would develop, and to hold it to account if things were not happening on the lines that they regarded as desirable.  Deputy Cosgrave, for example, who referred to this growth of State intervention in business, spoke strongly, logically and sensibly about the desirability of distributing new industrial concerns around the country rather than allowing them to be concentrated at Dublin or in the other larger cities.  But, again, Deputies cannot have it both ways.  If the Government is to have power to require a manufacturer to put his factory in one place rather than in another, it can only be through some device which, undoubtedly, Deputies would describe as State interference with business.</P>
    <P>At the present time the Government can attach a location condition to a new industrial project only if it is financed, in the main, by foreign capital&mdash;in other words, is a concern that requires a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act&mdash;or if the concern requires some concession from the Government in the form of a protective duty, a trade loan guarantee or some other assistance of that kind. Any Irish citizen, or any Irish company in which the majority of the capital is owned by Irish citizens, <Col N="1009" /> undertaking a new enterprise in an industry which is already protected by a tariff, or for which no tariff is required, can put that factory where it likes, and the Government cannot stop it. If, therefore, there is a case to be made for intervention by the Government in regard to industry to ensure its suitable location in different parts of the country, additional powers will have to be obtained.  I do not think that we should get these additional powers.  I am in favour of keeping additional powers to interfere with industry at the minimum.  We have endeavoured to secure the industrial pattern that we have, by advocacy and by persuasion.  I raise the matter here at this stage so that Deputies will not themselves follow illogically two parallel lines, for two parallel lines, as we are told by the experts, will never meet.  Deputies cannot possibly reconcile their dislike of the Government interfering with business with their desire to put upon the Government responsibility for securing industrial conditions that they think most suitable.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary also referred to the wages paid in certain industrial occupations. The Deputy has some association with the trade union movement. Deputies must make up their minds as to whether or not they want the Government to take on the regulation of the level of wages in industry.  If Deputies say that industrial wages are to be left to negotiation between employers in industry and the trade union movement, then they should not blame the Government for the level of wages that operates.  On the other hand, if they want to put on the Government the responsibility for regulating the level of wages in industrial occupations then, clearly, the Government must have the job alone and cannot have other people coming in at the same time to discharge the same function.</P>
    <P>I think there is a lot to be said for both courses, but up to the present the Government has taken the line that except in the case of certain occupations which have been made subject to the supervision of trade boards, it has no concern to fix minimum rates in any occupation, and prefers to leave the determination of rates to be settled <Col N="1010" /> by free negotiation between organised workers and organised employers. Questions of policy in that regard will, no doubt, be considered again in connection with new legislation in the near future.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies were critical of the system of price control.  I think, however, that their criticism was based on a misunderstanding of the functions of price control.  Price control during the war was designed to ensure that prices did not rise unnecessarily.  It was not the purpose of price control to prevent prices rising at all.  It was merely to ensure that in the circumstances in which prices were bound inevitably to rise no unnecessary addition to prices became operative because of the desire of traders to make unduly high profits.  Clothing prices went up during the war, and went up considerably.  I would not agree that there is, in the manufacture or distribution of clothing, any undue profit-taking.  Let me say that here and there retail traders in drapery goods have been showing that they earned substantial profits during the course of a trading year.  They are working, however, under restricted margins.  The price at which goods are to be sold is marked by the manufacturer whose gross or nett profit is limited by an arrangement with my Department, and that price contains only fixed margins of profit for the wholesaler and retailer.  These margins have been progressively reduced as and when it appeared justifiable to reduce them.  Whereas, normally, the wholesaler and retailer could work profitably only upon certain margins, in the abnormal circumstances of the present time a smaller margin can be justified because all goods are now saleable, and saleable quickly.  The trader is no longer running the risk of carrying unsaleable stock which might lie on his shelves for years before being disposed of at a loss.  With the present scarcity, stock can be turned over quickly, as fast indeed as it can be procured from the manufacturers, so that the risk of loss from bad stocks is considerably reduced.  Consequently, a lower margin of profit is justified, and a lower margin of profit has been enforced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> Clothing prices are high because the cost of making the goods is high.  We produce wool in this country.  Deputy Cogan and his colleagues in the Farmers' Party want me to keep up the price of wool.  The price of wool tended to fall from the highest level reached during the war, and there is already an agitation on behalf of wool producers that the price of wool should be kept up.  It is already double what it was pre-war, and during recent years has been substantially above the world price.  We have got to buy cloth, and the materials for making cloth, from other countries at abnormally high prices.  I have, in fact, frequently considered whether it was altogether desirable that we should permit the import of clothing and the materials for making clothes at the high prices that we have to pay for them.  Let me give the case of boots.  Boots had come in from America at appallingly high prices&mdash; at practically double the price at which home-produced boots are being sold, quality for quality.  There are not enough home-produced boots to-day, and the question is, should we, or should we not, allow these American boots or shoes to come in.  Even though they are dear, they will be sold. There is a scarcity of boots.  They helped to make good the deficiency in our supply but they also stepped up the cost-of-living index figure.  Their importation meant that the all-over average cost of footwear was higher than it would have been if they had not come in.  If there were no boots coming in from America, the average price would be lower but the supply would be less.  The same applies to other articles.</P>
    <P>In the case of cotton, we purchased substantial quantities of cotton piecegoods in South America.  The price was fantastic compared with the pre-war price, but no other source of supply of cotton goods was open to us. The supply of cotton goods from Great Britain is negligible.  The supply of cotton yarn for the manufacture of goods here is insignificant.  It was only by going across the Atlantic and taking up cotton goods wherever we could find them and at any price at <Col N="1012" /> which they could be obtained that we kept up the supply, but the result was to raise the index number of clothing prices.  We could have kept the index figure down by excluding these imported products, but the total supply available would have been very much less than it has been.</P>
    <P>Deliberately, during the war, we decided that we would so manage our supply of raw materials that we would keep every factory open.  I came to the Dáil and asked if Deputies agreed with that policy.  Nobody disagreed with it.  We could have adopted another policy.  We could have taken the available supplies of raw materials and concentrated them in the smallest number of factories, working these full time.  It would have been cheaper to do that.  The ultimate cost would have been much less.  But a number of workers would have been disemployed. A number of firms would have been put out of business.  But that policy would have resulted in cheaper goods. We decided that it was more important to keep the maximum number of people in employment and the maximum number of concerns in business than to keep down prices.  I came to the Dáil on more than one occasion and informed Deputies of the alternative policies.  I told them the policy which the Government proposed to adopt and nobody disagreed.  We appealed to employers to keep in their service, during the war, workers whose services they did not really require&mdash;a number of workers greater than the number required for the economic working of their factories.  Many employers did that.  Again, the policy behind those appeals was not, so far as I know, criticised or disapproved by any organised party in the country. The net result of that policy was that prices were higher than they otherwise would have been.  We can still change our policy.  In the case of boots and shoes, for example, we can take the available supply of leather and work some boot factories on the basis of maximum output, closing down others and keeping the prices down.  We could do that with cotton piece goods or other cloth-making materials.  Does any Deputy think that that would be good policy?  It would put a large <Col N="1013" /> number of workers out of employment. It would put some firms, who are trying to get into their stride for post-war operation, out of commission for the time being.  I do not think that it would be good policy.  It is unsatisfactory to have prices higher than they would otherwise be but I think that the balance of advantage is in favour of pursuing the line we have adopted.</P>
    <P>Deputies have said that our clothing prices are high compared with those of other countries.  Complaints were made about the cost of a suit of clothes.  But a suit which may cost 12, 13 or 14 guineas here will cost much more elsewhere.  In Great Britain, they had utility clothes&mdash;standard garments produced in the cheapest possible way&mdash;and, in that way, they kept their index figure down.  We could not proceed to the production of utility goods here because we had not the basic materials and we had not that regularity of supply which would enable utility goods to be turned out.  We could not have standardised any type of production and been certain of maintaining that standard output for any period.  Britain could do that and Britain has kept the average cost of her clothing supplies down by means of these utility products.  But, quality for quality, a garment will cost more in Great Britain than it will cost here. That does not apply to all classes of goods.  It does not apply to cotton. Great Britain has a great cotton industry, which we have not.  Britain's cotton industry is producing goods to the maximum level at the present time.  Our cotton industry is practically dependent upon spasmodic supplies of high-priced yarns from any place from which they can be procured &mdash;in the future, probably from Belgium.  Our import of cotton yarn from Great Britain is two per cent. of our pre-war imports from that country. That position applies to other classes of products and it is attributable to a wide variety of circumstances.  I was referring to production costs.  The incidence of purchase tax tends still further to adjust the position in our favour.  There is no reason why that should be left out of account.  The fact that taxation is lower here than <Col N="1014" /> it is in Great Britain is also an advantage to us.</P>
    <P>Deputies spoke about the price of oranges.  We tried to ensure that oranges would be sold at a maximum price.  The only people who succeeded in defying that Order for a time were street traders.  Deputies spoke as if whatever black market existed in oranges was due to the machinations of relatively well-off people who concered supplies which poorer people would have got.  That is nonsense. There were fixed prices in the shops and the only people who defied the Order were street traders, who were not selling to the wealthy people to whom Deputies referred.  Many of these traders were prosecuted and others are to be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Out of consideration for them, I deliberately took measures to divert to the street traders a larger proportion of the total supply than they might otherwise have obtained.  The result was that they had supplies when the supplies of the ordinary traders were exhausted and they took advantage of that to charge excessive prices.  Apart from the prosecution of offenders, the situation can be adjusted in relation to future supplies by restricting the supply to those traders to the same proportion as traders of any other class.  There are no other matters to which I desire to make special reference except a few matters of detail. Some Deputies referred to general questions which will be under discussion here when one or other of the new Bills to which I referred comes before the House.  Therefore, I shall not refer to them.</P>
    <P>As regards the meteorological services, I was asked why it was not possible to give more adequate general weather forecasts to the farmers.  We do not give weather forecasts at present. I am in favour of instituting such a service but it will take some time before the highly-skilled staff required for a general weather forecasting service will be available.  At present, our general weather forecasts are supplied by the British forecasting service.  We have got to build up this highly-skilled service gradually and <Col N="1015" /> one of the most difficult parts of it, I understand, is the forecasting of general weather conditions.  We shall undertake that service at some stage but we are not yet in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady spoke about the new pier at Killybegs.  I am anxious that the pier should be constructed.  The works involved there include something more than the dismantling of the present old jetty and its replacement by a reinforced jetty.  There is also the provision of a transit shed and the dredging of the berthage at each side of the jetty.  The matter has been under consideration by an inter-Departmental Committee, and I can promise the Deputy that a decision on their recommendation will be taken in the very near future.  I think, subject to agreement with the harbour commissioners as to the amount the harbour commissioners will contribute to the cost of the works, it should be possible to authorise the Board of Works to proceed with this scheme at a fairly early date.</P>
    <P>Wexford Harbour is a different proposition altogether.  The issue that arises in connection with Wexford is not so much the question of a contribution. It is to decide what type of harbour works will prevent the silting up of the harbour which has been taking place.  That is an engineering task of very considerable difficulty.  The only thing I can say to the commissioners is that if they produce a scheme for the development of the harbour which will bring new trade to the harbour, and which is sound from an engineering point of view, and if they can get the local authorities to make some contribution to the cost of the scheme, a Government grant for a substantial portion of the cost will also be forthcoming.  In the case of maintenance grants which are available for small harbours at present, there are some conditions attached.  Maintenance grants can be given only for essential maintenance where the revenue of the harbour, through emergency circumstances, has fallen so low that essential maintenance cannot be undertaken.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There may also be a question of a contribution from the local authority.  The Deputy will find a very precise statement which I made on the matter in my speech introducing the Harbours Bill where I detailed the circumstances in which State aid would be available for harbour authorities both for permanent development and for maintenance where there have been temporary financial difficulties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that it would be a waste of time.  The prohibition which the British imposed on the importation of glassware is of general application.  It does not apply merely to this country.  The circumstances under which it was brought into operation are such that it will be maintained until the British themselves decide on its removal.  There is not the slightest likelihood that it would be removed in respect of imports from this country as a result of representations from here.  I think also that the suggestion that we should impose a tax on imports of British glassware as a reprisal has no justification at all.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell us if there has been any improvement in the relations between Northern Ireland, Great Britain and ourselves regarding reciprocity for men who have stamps to their credit in Great Britain and Northern Ireland?  I had a letter which I read out to-day in which a soldier complains that he is entitled neither to unemployment insurance nor to unemployment assistance when he becomes unemployed in this country.  I want to know what is to be done in a case like that. I also had a number of letters from Great Britain following an article which appeared in one of the English newspapers on the 6th May.  A number of men who may be coming home are anxious to know what is their position in regard to the stamps which they have to their credit for the last five years in Great Britain.  Can anything be done in the way of getting some contribution from Great Britain in respect of the five years' stamps which these men have to their credit in Great Britain and Northern Ireland?</P>

    <P>The amount of the fee is fixed by the Attorney-General in each case and while the above scale is usually followed the Attorney-General may depart from it where the amount of work involved and the difficulties of law so warrant.  The maximum fee on a senior brief is 25 guineas except where, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, a special fee is sanctioned exceptionally.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of each of the years 1944 and 1945 (1) the amount of the fees paid to (a) junior, and (b) senior counsel in original trials where the conviction was quashed on appeal; (2) the amount of the fees paid to (a) junior, and (b) senior counsel in appeal cases which resulted in the quashing of convictions; (3) the amount of the fees paid to (a) junior, and (b) senior counsel in retrials following such appeals; (4) the total sum paid by way of costs in each of those years in respect of proceedings where a conviction was set aside on appeal; and (5) the number of such appeals.</P>

      <P>The information asked for by the Deputy is contained in the tabular statement which follows.</P>
      <P>It may be mentioned that a statistical approach does not provide a good basis for considering this matter.  The function of the Attorney-General, where a <i>prima facie</i> case is made out, is not to decide it himself but to send it before the court.  No case is ever sent for trial unless there is evidence available to support the charge.</P>

    <P>NOTES:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Fees paid in 1945 to Counsel in original trials where convictions were quashed on appeal do not include one trial in the Special Criminal Court in which an individual (in whose case only the conviction was quashed) was charged jointly with six other persons.  The fees paid on that trial to Senior and Junior Counsel were £145 10s. 0d. and £106 1s. 0d. respectively, and it is not possible to apportion them as referable to that defendant's case alone; the same fees would have been payable if he had not been charged.</P>
    <P>(2)  Fees paid to Counsel for retrials following appeals include sums of £333 18s. 0d., £117 12s. 0d., and £119 14s. 0d. paid to two Senior Counsel and a Junior Counsel in respect of retrials held in 1945 following convictions quashed in 1944.</P>
    <P>(3)  The figure for 1945 in column (8) includes the sum of £1,459 2s. 5d., being the costs (referred to in the note to the statement in cols. 325/26 of the Dáil Debates of 21st February, 1945) in cases in which retrials were held in the year 1945 following convictions quashed in the year 1944.  It does not include the costs payable in three cases in which payment has not been claimed following taxation.</P>
