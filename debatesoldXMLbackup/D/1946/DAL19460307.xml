    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will establish a commission of scholars to hear evidence from interested persons as to the unsatisfactory character of the standard spelling used in the Bunreacht, and to make recommendations for revision of this publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to the new standard spelling used in the edition of the Bunreacht published last year.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that the standard spelling is unsatisfactory and I do not think any good purpose would be served by setting up the commission suggested.  This standard spelling was the result of several years' examination of the question.  In 1941, I set up a committee to examine the whole problem of Irish spelling and to make recommendations for a system as simple as possible and suitable for adoption as a standard for general use.  This committee found itself unable to make progress.  I then entrusted the task to the chief translator on the Oireachtas Staff and, after his death, to his successor who, with the assistance of the whole translation section, reexamined the question in the greatest detail and, after some years of study, finally submitted the recommendations now incorporated in the booklet published under the title <i>Litriú na Gaeilge: An Caighdeán Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that the translation section is staffed by competent scholars&mdash;native speakers and others &mdash;whose daily work for very many <Col N="2086" /> years has been the solution of Irish language problems and who are familiar with the vocabulary and the pronunciation of native speakers in the Gaeltacht areas.  They consulted a number of native speakers of the different dialects and had before them also the opinions of eminent scholars of the Irish language&mdash;university professors and others&mdash;on the relevant problems of spelling and phonetics.</P>
    <P>The task set them was an extremely difficult one.  In making a choice of a standard form of spelling for any word they had to bear in mind the historical aspect, current usage, the various dialectal pronunciations, and the desirability of uniformity and of omitting letters which had ceased to be pronounced or were not pronounced in any of the main or subordinate dialects.  Their final decisions had to be based on an impartial and well-balanced judgment as to the weight to be given to the several, often conflicting, considerations.  From all the opinions I have heard or seen expressed on their work, I am satisfied that it has been exceptionally well done and it has secured a far more widespread approval than I had thought possible, in view of all the difficulties.  Where there has been adverse criticism, the critics have in no case faced up to the problems to be solved.  It is obvious that no one standard spelling can adequately represent phonetically a word pronounced differently in the different dialects. While it is desirable that a system of spelling should be phonetic where that is possible, it is clearly not possible in the case of words with wide dialectal difference of pronunciation.</P>
    <P>The principles acted upon by the chief translator and his staff in arriving at the standard adopted are clearly set out in the introduction and the notes in the booklet to which I have referred.  I think the chief translator and his staff proceeded in an eminently reasonable manner.  I do not think that any commission would so improve upon their work as to win any wider measure of acceptance for it or make it more satisfactory.  Time is of importance in the matter.  Books are being published, children are being <Col N="2087" /> taught every day.  Grammars, dictionaries and text books are needed.  A uniform standard of spelling is urgent as well as vital.  The translation staff will examine with care any criticisms they may receive with a view to improving their work.  If I get any such criticisms, I will pass them on but we want criticisms that will be constructive and not merely destructive. Purely destructive criticism is easy, particularly in this case, for, as I have said, a spelling that will phonetically represent a word in one dialect will not do so in others, and those who speak those dialects will have cause for complaint.</P>
    <P>I might perhaps add that in the edition of the Bunreacht to which I have referred, the -aibh form of the dative-plural, although not in accordance with the new standard, has been retained solely because of certain legal considerations.  I am now inclined to the view that we were too meticulous in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach agrees with me that his approach to the science of linguistics and etymology in setting up a body of civil servants to prepare the <i>litriú</i> is, to say the least, revolutionary, will he not think it desirable to establish a standing commission, analogous to that established by the Academie Francaise, to supervise the spelling and etymology of our own language before whom representations may be laid by interested parties, from time to time, with a view to having its work reviewed and improved if opportunity offers?  Surely no valid objection could be made to that course and it would meet the views of persons, who are scarce enough in this country, God knows, who love the language for the language's sake and not for what they hope to get out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That may come in the future, but I have had some experience of the efforts made to get a standard system of spelling and I despaired of anything being done in that particular way.  It was because I despaired of it being done in that way that I decided to give the task to a staff who are, I think, quite competent&mdash;as <Col N="2088" /> competent as any other group you will get.  Day in and day out, they are wrestling with these problems.  Time is the essence of the matter and it is necessary to get ahead.  The establishment of an academy such as the Deputy suggests may come later on.  We must get going at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has got what he wants&mdash;the <i>litriú.</i>  Is it not reasonable to ask on behalf of those others who love the language&mdash;the Taoiseach is not the only person who loves it&mdash;that some body of scholars, as distinguished from zealous and public-spirited servants, should be set up to whom those persons can make their submissions with a view to preserving the integrity of the language they love rather than subserving the general policy of the Government in respect of the language of the country. There is surely an academic, a linguistic and an etymological side to this which appeals deeply to scholars who have devoted their whole lives to the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Attention has been given to that side in the work of the translation staff.  If we want to have an academy we can have it later.  I do not think the time is quite ripe for it yet.  At the moment the most important consideration is that books are being published and that every day we allow to pass sets up new vested interests in the existing forms and makes change much more difficult later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach said that the matter is in the hands of the translation staff, are we to understand that persons interested in the matter who wish to make formal representations to the translation staff on any aspect of Irish spelling can do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, that is the position.  I have already indicated that any criticism sent on to me will be <Col N="2089" /> passed on to them and will be given full consideration.  I know that the desire of those who are engaged in the work is to try to get a solution for the conflicting views and the conflicting interests of those who have written books and of the different dialects. The staff will be quite ready to consider any suggestions but, as I have said, dictionaries and grammars have to be prepared and there must be a time limit, beyond which we cannot go, for suggestions, for the work is urgent. Once you have published dictionaries it is quite clear that it becomes more difficult to make changes.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the matter is now left to the translation staff&mdash;and there may be something to be said for that in the present circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest against it most vigorously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Something is being attempted from the Taoiseach's point of view through the translation staff.  In view of the fact that the staff are not generally accessible, and with a view to inviting people to make representations to the translation staff in this matter, would the Taoiseach consider whether copies of any suggestions made to the translation staff might not be filed for reference in the National Library so that people interested in the development of the language would have access in the National Library to such suggestions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly consider that, but suggestions may have been furnished confidentially up to the present.  Many persons who send letters may not wish to see them put on record where everybody would see them but I shall see what can be done in the matter.  Perhaps extracts may be given from them.  The position is that if criticisms are sent along to me or to the translation staff&mdash;and I have already urged very strongly that such criticism should be constructive&mdash;they <Col N="2090" /> will be considered.  I shall see whether the other suggestion made by Deputy Mulcahy can be adopted.  There are difficulties which I see at once in the publication of criticisms that have been forwarded.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the reasons why Córas Iompair Éireann have been given a monopoly of the transport, withing a radius of 30 or 40 miles from Cork, of manures manufactured by Messrs.  Gouldings, when some seed and manure merchants, who deliver grain to Cork, can take loads of manure from Cork on the return journeys, but are not permitted to do so, thereby causing an increase in the price of manures to farmers; further, if he is aware that Córas Iompair Éireann state that they are not in a position to provide sufficient railway wagons to meet the demand for transport of manures, and that they will deliver manures by road to railheads only, thus by-passing seed and manure merchants' premises, and that they expect the merchants to take delivery from the railhead or else pay an extra charge for delivery to their stores; and if he will take steps to have the position examined, with a view to obviating the waste of transport and additional expenditure involved in the procedure at present followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Messrs.  Gouldings have made arrangements with Córas Iompair Éireann for the delivery of artificial manures to merchants in the Cork area.  Where sufficient wagons cannot be provided <Col N="2092" /> to effect prompt delivery Córas Iompair Éireann have transported manures by their road services.  This has not involved any increased cost to the merchants.  Messrs.  Gouldings consign their products carriage paid to the railhead nearest to the merchant. I am informed that a merchant may take delivery direct from the Cork factory but the manufacturers do not make any reduction in the price charged to the merchant where this is done.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Under Emergency Powers Orders relating to textiles, no person may engage in the production of garments by machinery without a licence. Because of the great shortage of textile raw materials, it was decided, in fairness to established producers, to refuse licences for new businesses.  The total number of licences issued was 1,165. No record was kept of applications which were refused and it is, therefore, not possible to say how many were refused.  The licences issued to garment manufacturers do not specify whether children's or adults' garments are to be produced.</P>

      <P>There is no increase in the retail prices of artificial manures and in the case of 30 per cent. superphosphate the price has been reduced by 30/- per ton as compared with last year.  The manufacturers' prices have, however, been increased by 5/- per ton so as to reduce the distributors' margin from £1 to 15/- per ton, in view of the increased tonnage which will be handled by them this season.  The manufacturers will not benefit by the increased price, as their profits are strictly controlled and the amounts thus saved will be utilised as a relief in the amount of subsidy payable by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £29,650 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1946, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Unemployment Exchanges (including Contributions to the Unemployment Fund), Unemployment Assistance, the Special Register of Agricultural and Turf Workers, and Insurance Against Intermittent Unemployment, for certain services in connection with Food Allowances and for Expenses in connection with the provision of Labour for Harvest Work (9 Edw. 7, c. 7; 10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5, c. 30; 11 Geo. 5, c. 1; 11 &amp; 12 Geo. 5, c. 15; 12 Geo. 5, c. 7; No. 17 of 1923; Nos. 26 and 59 of 1924; No. 21 of 1926; No. 33 of 1930; Nos. 44 and 46 of 1933; No. 38 of 1935; No. 2 of 1938; No. 28 of 1939; No. 4 of 1940; No. 3 of 1941; No. 7 of 1942; and No. 20 of 1943).</P>
      <P>The House is, I think, aware that the Estimate of the expenditure on unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance is prepared upon the basis of the previous year's experience and that it is not unusual to require supplementary provision when the actual accounts for the year are known.  The increased expenditure under sub-head G is consequent on the increased revenue of the fund.  The Government is obliged by the law to contribute two-ninths of the amount credited in respect of each insured person and, because the contributions paid during the year were higher than estimated, an increased provision has to be made under this sub-head. Similarly, the amount provided for unemployment assistance was £26,000 less than has actually been expended or may be expended before the end of the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Appropriations-in-Aid are also more or less consequential upon the exchanges.  Because the revenue of <Col N="2101" /> the fund from the sale of stamps was increased during the year, the contribution which the fund is required to make to the cost of administration is similarly increased.  The additional amount received under sub-head J (1) is due entirely to the fact that some of the local authorities made their contributions earlier than they might have made them.  The other alteration in the Appropriations-in-Aid is due solely to a staff change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be, although labour is scarce generally and jobs abundant, individual men with heavy family responsibilities who cannot leave their own particular areas, and work which must suit them must be within reach of their own homes.  I sympathise with those people, but there are large number of young men &mdash;there must be if we want £26,000 more&mdash;who can find work if they went <Col N="2105" /> and looked for it, without any undue hardship, who are attending at the local Gárda barracks getting qualification certificates under the Unemployment Assistance Acts and drawing this benefit to which they are not, in fact, entitled.</P>
      <P>What I am asking is this: Is due regard being had by those who administer this Act and disburse this money to the obligation on young, unmarried men without family responsibilities to look far afield in this country if needs be to find employment rather than to content themselves with looking around the half parish in which they live and who, if they do not find an employer out in the street looking for them, walk into the Gárda barracks and say: &ldquo;I cannot get work and I want unemployment assistance&rdquo;? There are Deputies, coming as they do from all parts of the country, who must know that there is scarcely a small town in Ireland in which there are not people seeking work and not able to get it, yet there is a notice hanging in a window in Ballaghaderreen asking for 100 men and the man who has that notice up cannot get even one. Nevertheless, I venture to say a part of this £26,000 will be disbursed at Ballaghaderreen Gárda Station to young lads who claim they are entitled to unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>In my submission, that kind of business is bringing the whole unemployment insurance system of administration into discredit.  I believe there is not a Deputy here who does not know that, but it is considered to be a dangerous thing to get up and talk that way about the boys on the &ldquo;dole&rdquo;, because there are too many of them and you might vex them and they would not come out to work for you on the next election day.  A great many Deputies know that to be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that sooner or later we ought to face that and insist that only those who genuinely cannot get work will get unemployment assistance.  Will the Minister say to the House that he is satisfied that all the persons who will receive benefit under that sub-head J (1) are persons whom he honestly believes to be genuinely unemployed within the meaning <Col N="2106" /> and the letter and the spirit of the Unemployment Assistance Act?  I do not believe they are and I believe it is a great scandal and a source of great demoralisation throughout rural Ireland that young fellows are permitted to draw unemployment assistance which they do not require but which enables them to fool about at home without going out and doing an honest day's work for the money they draw.</P>
    <P>So grave and serious do I consider that aspect of the unemployment situation at present that I elect to refer to no other matter on this Estimate. I wish, however, that some of the Deputies who know these facts as well as I would, at least in private, if they are afraid to tell the Minister in public, urge upon the Minister the necessity for putting an end to this abuse, not primarily for the purpose of protecting the Exchequer but primarily for the purpose of protecting the morale of these young fellows who are being demoralised by the habit into which they have got of refusing to work because they prefer to live on their parents and to avail of the dole for pocket money wherewith to buy cigarettes and pay their entrance fees to cinemas and dances.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that I am excluding deliberately from my censure married men with heavy responsibilities who should not be required to fare forth, to break up their families and leave their children without paternal care. It is right that they should hang on to their homes and expect to get reasonable employment within a distance which will enable them to get home at night and maintain the family on the proper basis.  I am dealing only with the young men without family responsibilities of any kind and in respect of that class I emphasise all I have just said.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a question relating to men who leave the Army and who had unemployment insurance stamps before entering the Army.  These men, when leaving the Army and reporting to the labour exchange, would prefer to go on unemployment assistance for a good reason &mdash;that when they are on unemployment assistance they will get relief work.  I <Col N="2108" /> am thinking of the Dublin Corporation area, and I want to ask whether it is a rule in the Minister's Department that the demobilised soldier who had stamps to his credit before entering the Army must draw these stamps before going on to unemployment assistance. In normal times, if a man had a few stamps, he would have got a few weeks' relief work and could, when finished with that relief work, go back on unemployment assistance, because he would then be qualified for relief work or for work under the Board of Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly interested in Deputy Dillon's contribution because it is in such marked contrast with our experience in Dublin in relation to the administration of unemployment assistance.  A great deal of our time in the trade union movement is taken up with trying to advise the applicant for unemployment assistance and to steer him through the rigid regulations, one of which is the insistence of the employment exchange and courts of referees on unemployed persons trudging day after day, and perhaps week after week, from one job to another to prove that there is no work available for them when everybody is quite well aware that no work is available.  More shoe leather is wasted in that fruitless effort to prove to the employment exchange what the employment exchange knows&mdash;that no jobs are available while these people are willing and able to work&mdash;than probably anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly the administration of the Act in Dublin and other urban centres is different from its administration in centres like Ballaghaderreen, and, if so, it seems to me that we in the urban centres have a legitimate objection.  If it is true, as Deputy Dillon says, that there is a notice in a window in Ballaghaderreen for 100 able-bodied young men to take up employment under what are in the opinion of the labour exchange reasonable conditions of employment and rates of wages and if these young men will not take up that employment, I suggest that the Minister has a very serious charge to answer, because it is quite clear on <Col N="2109" /> Deputy Dillon's suggestion that public money is being handed out in an entirely different manner in Ballaghaderreen.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that situation does exist, and it seems to me that, before we can proceed on the basis to which Deputy Dillon referred, there are one or two questions to which we should apply ourselves.  We have in Dublin City employment offered to men and women through the employment exchanges which apply a very rigid interpretation of reasonable rates of wages and hours of work, but even with that rigid interpretation and their desire to save public moneys, in nine cases out of ten, they are often led to say that the employment is not suitable and that, in all fairness, they cannot expect any reasonable person to take up employment under those conditions.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aspect mentioned by Deputy Dillon of hundreds of able-bodied young men in these more or less rural areas unwilling to take up work, we have the other side of the problem, that through the Minister's Department, and finally another Department, many of these young people are allowed to go out of the country.  They are not supposed to be allowed to leave if they have voluntarily left employment, or if employment is offered to them and they refuse it.  It seems to me that, in the light of the statement made by Deputy Dillon, the Minister has not only to face a charge of the loose paying out of public money in certain areas, but of deliberately allowing out of this country men and women who could be provided with employment.</P>
    <P>My experience is totally different from that of Deputy Dillon.  I remember certain occasions in the past when employment was offered to Dublin men outside Dublin, but the conditions of which were such that even the State had to admit that they could not expect men to remain. Whether Deputy Dillon has in mind that in cases of employment being offered 50 or 100 miles from Dublin, men or women should be required to take that employment, without having <Col N="2110" /> regard to their family commitments, I do not know; but even taking it that they have no family commitments whatever in Dublin, it seems to me to be clear that the rates of wages, and very often the conditions of employment, offered to men and women going from Dublin into a strange town&mdash; having to live in &ldquo;digs&rdquo; and without any family on whom they can fall back to help them to eke out their small wages&mdash;are entirely different from those which may be offered to local men and women.  It is because of the disparity between the normal charges that fall on a man going from Dublin to take up employment in a provincial centre, and the normal charges that a person living in the locality has to meet, that there is difficulty in getting a more easy transference of labour from one part of the country to another.  We have cases in Dublin of men who are expected to work for 25/- or 30/- a week.  We have also cases of that kind outside Dublin.  Even taking the case of a single man in Dublin, nobody would expect him to be able to live in present conditions on a wage of from 30/- to 40/- a week.</P>

      <P>I was at a meeting of my union last night at which we were dealing with cases of that kind.  I can give the Deputy the names afterwards. In one case the man was married. So far as the administration of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance is concerned, speaking from what knowledge I have of the city, I think there can be no suggestion that there is any looseness in connection with the payment of benefit under either Act.  In regard to seeking to prove that work is available, the employment exchange goes to considerable lengths, and places a considerable burden on the ordinary artisan, especially on shoe leather, in making him prove that he sought work and that none was available.  In certain cases hardship is imposed on men and women by asking them to tramp to ten or 20 places seeking work, although they know that it is not available.  They do that in order to build up a case when applicants go before the referees. <Col N="2111" /> There is also the final drag net of the means test and if they escape that they are very lucky.  In regard to the payment of unemployment assistance, my experience is different from that of Deputy Dillon.  If there is something in Deputy Dillon's case, it seems to me the Minister has something to answer.</P>

      <P>I do not know where the fault lies in connection with the payment of unemployment assistance, whether it is that the officials do not inquire into cases to see if the applicants qualified for the assistance, or whether the qualification ceased at a certain date.  Cases have been brought to my notice where unemployment assistance was paid during the whole period of summer, when these people were supposed not to have qualified for it, and after a lapse of some months claims for a refund of amounts that it was alleged had been overdrawn were made.  I wish to draw the Minister's attention to that.  That should not occur.  In the cases brought to my notice there were claims for £19 and £32 from persons who drew unemployment assistance during the summer months.  The persons concerned had made reasonable efforts to find work. As they had no other means of livelihood, when asked to refund the amounts, they could not do so unless they sold their furniture.  I suggest that the request for refunds in such cases was a hardship.  They spent the money they received at the time, and could not possibly refund it.  That happened in a few cases.  I do not know if it is widespread, but it should not have occurred.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dillon's attack on single men. These men must sign the register before they qualify for benefit, I am surprised at Deputy Dillon's statement. I wonder would he make such a statement during an election campaign, or suggest that single men should get no benefit.  They only get 6/- a week and to get that they must have attained a certain age.  Take a case where there are three young men over 21 years of age in a family.  Does the Deputy suggest that they should <Col N="2112" /> get no benefit but should remain living at home on the farm?  Deputy Dillon is out of touch on this matter with the position of working-class people.  I think he was out of order.  In my opinion more money is wanted for the labour exchanges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Men are being demobilised from the Army and there is no work available for them.  They have to be provided for and given something to live on.  Deputy Dillon mentioned that in Ballaghaderreen there was work for 100 men.  If men sign at the labour exchange and refuse to go to a job their unemployment assistance is cut off.  Consequently, I cannot understand why men would not go to a job if they were signing at the labour exchange, seeing that otherwise they would lose the unemployment benefit.  Many of those who are signing are single men.  Does Deputy Dillon suggest that these men should be thrown on the scrap-heap? They cannot get a job unless they sign at the exchange, and if they sign they qualify for relief work.  That is the position in my constituency.  In the rural districts, these men sign at the Gárda barracks.  They are notified when certain work offers and if they do not turn up to take it they are disqualified. I was surprised at Deputy Dillon's attack, in view of the fact that young men have to walk one or two miles to the labour exchange to qualify for 1/- a day.  Would any man continue to do that in order to get 6/- a week if he could get work?  In the area from which I come the amount paid to married men is 14/- with vouchers.  No man wants to continue doing that if he could get another job. The standard wage in the district is 45/- and bonus.  As a trade unionist I could not listen to Deputy Dillon without explaining my position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Deputy Dillon's statement is concerned, the law provides that no person, married or single, is entitled to receive unemployment assistance if there is work available for him which is regarded as suitable within the definition of the <Col N="2113" /> Act.  The question is decided by the unemployment assistance officer, and the claimant for unemployment assistance has the right of appeal to the Court of Referees.  If there is work available, and it is held by the unemployment assistance officer to be suitable, having regard to the physique of the person, together with the location of the work and certain other factors, unemployment assistance is not paid. Deputy Dillon asked me if I could say if there was anyone drawing unemployment assistance for whom there is work available.  There should not be. It is a widespread organisation, and it may be that men occasionally receive unemployment assistance who are not entitled to receive it.  The whole purport of the legislation, and the system of administration, is to ensure that unemployment assistance is payable only to those genuinely seeking work and unable to obtain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not there force in what Deputy O'Leary says, that a lot of people are drawn on to claiming, not because they require the assistance, but because they want to qualify for employment on public work schemes and would not get work if they were not drawing the dole and if that urge was not on them they would not seek it at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so but when the Deputy says that people may claim unemployment assistance without requiring it, he is forgetting one other provision of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Before a person becomes entitled to claim he must qualify under the Act and get a qualification certificate.  That qualification certificate contains a statement of his means. Maintenance in the house of a parent who is an owner of land or in permanent employment is calculated as means and in many cases persons have had their means assessed at a level which makes them ineligible to draw unemployment assistance, even when they are unemployed.  The aim of the Unemployment Assistance Act is to provide the standard rate of unemployment assistance for those who have no means, a lesser rate for those who <Col N="2114" /> have some means, and no assistance for people who have means, as determined in accordance with the requirements of the Act and stated in the applicant's qualification certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked whether the increased provision required under sub-head G is an indication that there was increased employment during the year and whether the increased provision required under sub-head J (1) is an indication that there was increased unemployment.  Neither is correct. What the increased figure reveals is that the amount required under each sub-head was greater than was estimated at the beginning of the year and involves no comparison between the position this year and in previous years or at one part of the year as against another.  In fact, the number of persons drawing unemployment assistance in each week from the determination of the first Employment Period Order, 1945, until the end of January was less this year than in the previous year.  That, in itself, was no clear indication of what the unemployment position was because the full dimensions of our unemployment problem can be ascertained only by examining these statistics, the statistics relating to payment of unemployment insurance benefit and the statistics relating to unemployment relief work confined to unemployed persons. The law does not require anybody to draw unemployment insurance benefit and a claimant may, in fact, elect not to draw benefit due to him on stamps but to receive unemployment assistance. Very few do because, ordinarily, the amount of unemployment insurance benefit receivable by an unemployed man is greater than the amount of unemployment assistance he can draw, but it is open to an unemployed person entitled to draw unemployment insurance to leave his stamps to his credit and to draw unemployment assistance instead.  In the case of the demobilised soldiers to which Deputy McCann referred, that would be the position except where the demobilised soldier had failed to take out his qualification certificate or had not completed the process of getting it.  Before a person becomes entitled to unemployment <Col N="2115" /> assistance he must first have received a qualification certificate under the Act.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with Deputy Larkin that the employment exchanges go too far in requiring applicants for unemployment assistance to produce evidence that they are genuinely seeking work.  It may be that they have to adopt stereotyped tests which are not always perfect but it is well known that there are in parts of the country people who do occasional short periods of work without reporting the fact to the employment exchange and draw unemployment assistance for these periods.  The purpose of the employment exchange officials is to ensure that that does not happen and it is in the interests of these beneficiaries under these Acts that it should not happen because if this system of public health and unemployment insurance is to have public support it must be, as far as it can be made, free from abuse. Where a person has been found to have drawn unemployment assistance when not entitled to it because employed or not available for work, there is, apart from any legal penalties that may be imposed, an obligation upon the employment exchange authorities to recover the amount overpaid.  The cases to which Deputy Blowick referred were probably of that character. Persons had received unemployment assistance in certain instances when they were not entitled to get it.  Once in a very large number of cases a person may not have known that he was not entitled to unemployment assistance and might therefore be surprised to get the demand for a refund, but in the great majority of cases anybody who gets unemployment assistance without being entitled to it knows quite well what he is doing and is taking a chance that he will not be detected.  If he is detected, however, the obligation is on the employment exchange authorities to recover the amount overpaid.</P>
    <P>The alteration in the amount of the Appropriation-in-Aid in respect of contributions from county boroughs and urban area councils arose, as I have said, out of the fact that payments <Col N="2116" /> were credited to the previous financial year that it was assumed would not be received until this financial year.  Consequently, the amount of the Appropriation-in-Aid under that sub-head was less than was anticipated.</P>

      <P>The point mentioned by Deputy Dockrell is one of those to which I wish to refer.  With perfect propriety and commendable foresight, during the emergency the officers of the Army responsible for equipping the Army, under the instructions of the Department of Defence, made repeated specifications of their ideal requirements and the Government, as I understand it, undertook contracts with suppliers for the delivery of warlike stores.  As might be readily expected, the great bulk of these stores had to be ordered on the basis of delivery when available, and, of course, it transpired that much of the stores did not become available so long as warlike operations were being carried on by the suppliers themselves on foreign battlefields.  On more than one occasion I directed the attention of the Minister for Defence to this and asked him had he opened negotiations with the other parties to the contracts to arrange that these contracts should, in respect of the balances still outstanding, be cancelled on terms acceptable to both parties.  I would hope that the other parties to the contracts would be prepared to waive them without compensation of any kind; but that is a matter as to which we can only assume the Minister will do his best.  But the sooner it is done the less burdensome the residual <Col N="2117" /> liability is likely to be.  I think it is right to say that the Minister need not expect carping criticism in regard to this matter, provided he will act energetically in liquidating the liability, whatever it is, as quickly and as effectively as he know how.</P>
      <P>In regard to sub-head Z, I return to a topic which I have mentioned on more than one occasion in this House. The old Army practice was that when surplus stores came to be disposed of, particularly in regard to clothing, they were reduced to waste or some such word as that.  In fact, they were put into suitable machines and cut up into rags.  In normal times, when supplies are abandoned, on balance, I believe, that is the right course to pursue, because the danger of promoting a &ldquo;fence's&rdquo; market in which stolen Army property can be readily negotiated is so great if you dispose by sale of surplus Army clothing that it is better to destroy them and sell them as rags.  In the times in which we are living, however, clothing is so scarce that that course could not be possibly justified.  But there ought to be on all clothing disposed of some distinctive mark placed so that subsequently the military police, when seeking to establish that stolen goods are improperly held by the person in whose possession they are found, will be able to turn up some part of the garments and, unless the mark is upon them of goods legitimately sold by the Department of Defence, will be entitled to assume that the goods are stolen, and when they prosecute the holder of the clothes in court, will be entitled to expect that the court will accept the absence of that special mark as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the military article was stolen and that the person in possession of it must accept the onus of proving that he came by it legitimately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head A (4) provision is made for emergency gratuities re-enlistment bounties.  This is a Supplementary Estimate the scope of which is restricted.  I should like, however, to say that I feel that the House has made, and desires to make, not only fair but generous provision for all those who served in the Army during the emergency.  Wisely or unwisely, <Col N="2118" /> and I think on balance wisely, in order to strengthen morale and to allow natural enthusiasm to develop, during the emergency there were received into the ranks of the Army a considerable number of enthusiasts who were really older than the Army would have ordinarily considered suitable as recruits.  That applies to commissioned and non-commissioned ranks. In the various pensions schemes and employment schemes which have been devised to accommodate the men who are being demobilised I observe a recurring age limit of 28½ or 30 years. I would urge on the Minister for Defence that the number of persons who are going out of the Army, after having served through the emergency, as distinguished from the regular men, who will be over age for pension schemes and things of that kind, is very small.  But it would be a disaster if these men, who, prudently or imprudently, rushed into the gap and who now find themselves turned out at the age of 35, 40 or 45, should ever feel that we in this House had consented to their being thrown on the scrap heap because they were too old. We should have thought of that before we let them in, but, once we let them in.  I think we undertook an absolute moral responsibility to see that, when the time came for them to go out, they would not be placed at any disadvantage as compared with the younger men who joined simply by reason of their age.  I will not develop that further.</P>

      <P>I am referring to all sorts of regulations made in regard to examinations and other things stipulating that a man must be under a certain age to enter.  I understand the difficulty is that if you inject a man of 45 into a pensionable service you upset the whole actuarial balance of the service.  I think it would be a thousand pities if the House did not say: &ldquo;Very well, if we do upset the actuarial balance of the pension scheme by injecting a man of that age into it, we are prepared to appropriate a sum of <Col N="2119" /> money sufficient to make a Grant-in-Aid to the fund to restore the actuarial balance created by the man's excessive age&rdquo;.  I believe there will be very few cases, but I think it would be a humiliating thing for us all if there was a single individual in this country who had the right to say to us: &ldquo;I was not too old when you wanted me; but now that it is a matter of making full provision for me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

Where a man of 40 or 45 passes an examination for a service into which he can be fitted but for this actuarial difficulty, I suggest that the Minister for Defence should have the right to say: &ldquo;If you can fit him in on every other ground, then we will appropriate £100, £200 or £400 and pay it into the fund as compensation for the number of years by which this man exceeds the maximum at which a person ought nominally to be admitted to the fund&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2120" /> I will not go further than to invite the Minister to consider that and to make representations to the Minister for Finance.  I think he would find in this House a pretty unanimous view that, if he had any difficulties with the Minister for Finance in getting that view accepted and had to have further recourse to this House, the Minister for Finance would find a unanimity of feeling which would compel him to make the concession which in this case, I think, fair justice demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to assume that this sum of £707,000 odd represents the transition cost from emergency conditions to a peace-time basis?  I do not believe that it does.  Therefore, I think the Minister should tell the House what further sum he is likely to require to cover the transition period.  Undoubtedly, further sums will be required for emergency gratuities, enlistment bounties, warlike stores, engineering stores, fuel, light, water, etc.  I suggest to the Minister that he should tell the Dáil what further sum he anticipates he will require to put an end to the conditions brought about by the emergency.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell asked a question about warlike stores.  The provision for them in the Estimate is £169,729.  I assume that sum is required to cover purchases already made.  Will the Minister say if the Department is definitely committed to the making of further such purchases, and, if so, what amount of money he will require?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister fulfilling definitely and absolutely all his undertakings for the purchase of war material during the war years?  It seems to me that he would be well advised to adopt Deputy Dillon's suggestion, namely, to try to get out of some of those undertakings or contracts that he entered into during the emergency.  It is quite conceivable that, by the time a lot of this material is supplied, it will be regarded as obsolete for modern warlike purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an item of £59,537 for fuel, light and water in kind and fuel oils. In regard to fuel, it was rather difficult to understand the explanation which the Minister offered to the Dáil yesterday. He said that, on account of the <Col N="2121" /> reduction in the personnel of the Army, men could not be set aside to produce hand-won turf for the Army.  The Minister still has an Army of 23,000 men, and surely enough men could be set aside for this work, thereby reducing to a considerable extent this sum of £59,000 odd.  Part of it is required to pay the contract price of the turf required by the Army.  I think the Minister would find it very difficult to convince the Dáil that, with an Army of 23,000 men, it was still necessary for him to spend a large sum of money on contract turf.  He could have saved the unfortunate taxpayers a good deal of money if he had followed the practice pursued in the last three or four years of getting the men in the Army to produce the hand-won turf.</P>
    <P>There is the sum of £39,000 for the purchase of military lands.  I presume that the intention is to purchase land for the erection of aerodromes.  I would imagine that we have sufficient accommodation for aerodromes at the present time and that the Minister could very well afford to defer this until conditions had become more normal: until he had an opportunity of adjusting his policy to normal peace-time conditions.  The Minister has made no attempt to justify the expenditure of that money.  In conclusion, I would like the Minister to give the Dáil an indication of what further sums of money he will require for the purpose of meeting the expenditure under the different sub-heads in the Estimate. Will he require another £707,000, or another £1,000,000 or £2,000,000?  Does he expect to have to approach the Dáil with further Supplementary Estimates, or is it his intention to make provision for all his expenditure in his main Estimate and to set out the details in the Book of Estimates?</P>

      <P>In the statement which the Minister made last night, in presenting this Estimate to the House, it was quite erroneous for him to suggest that the Estimate presented at the beginning of the year was based on a plan to reduce the Army during the year.  There was, at any rate, the suggestion in his statement that an Estimate was presented which contemplated that the Army would be reduced by certain numbers as from July last, and that this Estimate is being presented because, for one reason or another, the Army was not reduced in the way contemplated.  The Estimate that was presented to the House in the beginning of last year was based upon the fact that the Minister and the Army authorities considered that the emergency, so far as the Army was concerned, would last for the whole of the 12 months that the Estimate was to run.  The Minister, when presenting his Estimate to the House on 21st June, 1945&mdash;the reference is column 1437&mdash;said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When last November the Estimate for the Army Vote for the financial year 1945-46 was being prepared, it did not seem unlikely that the emergency, so far as the Army was concerned, would last another year and, accordingly, the Estimate was compiled and printed in the form with which Deputies have become familiar for the past four years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also printed for the amount that it was estimated would be required to continue the Army in circumstances in which the emergency lasted over the 12 months.  According to the statement made by the Minister, <Col N="2123" /> as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of to-day, his words were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Moving a Supplementary Estimate of £707,141 for the Army and Army Reserve, in the Dáil yesterday, Mr. Oscar Traynor, Minister for Defence, said that in the annual Estimate it had been pre-supposed that demobilisation would begin in July, but that, in fact, it did not begin until November, with the result that 23,616 soldiers were now being maintained instead of 22,249, as anticipated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no suggestion at all in the Estimate, as prepared, that a reduction would take place like that, but when the Minister was introducing the Estimate, he indicated that a certain reduction would take place, and we now find ourselves presented with a Supplementary Estimate, the effect of which is that in respect of sub-head A &mdash;pay of officers, cadets, N.C.O.'s and men&mdash;the Estimate presented to the House in June last, and prepared at the beginning of the year, was short by three months' pay for the whole of an emergency Army.  One would have imagined that an Estimate prepared for an emergency year for the Army would have something left to spare out of the Estimate for the payment of officers, men, and so on, who have not yet been demobilised; but we are now being asked to vote three months' pay: that is, we are being asked to vote one-fourth of the amount that we have already voted for that purpose; we are being asked to vote one-sixth of the amount, that has been already voted, for marriage allowances, and one-sixth of the amount already voted for the pay of civilians attached to military units.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not want to go into a general discussion on this Supplementary Estimate, although there are things in it that would warrant a general discussion.  However, I do not want to have a general discussion on the matter now, in view of the fact that we will have a Defence Forces Bill coming in shortly, in which we will have the whole question of the Army under dission, but I do ask for some statement from the Minister that would be more in relation to the actual facts than has <Col N="2124" /> been given so far, particularly with regard to the under-estimation that has occurred here, and the additional expense that took place during the year.  Again, I would ask the Minister why, when it was clear that the Army could be reduced after the 31st July last, the reduction did not take place, and I would also ask why, in a year in which the world war was just over, we should, without any discussion of defence policy of any kind, be buying lands for additional military barracks or additional aerodromes that we were able to get on without during the years of war.  In that connection, I would also ask the Minister whether the moneys that are estimated for here for additional military lands&mdash;£29,605&mdash; have been already paid, or has he any explanation to give to the House as to why he paid that amount, involving commitments in the buying of lands for the Army, or why, in our present circumstances, he did that without referring the matter to the House here?  If these sums are not already paid, then I oppose their payment.  The question of the provision of warlike stores has already been raised, but I submit to the Minister, in connection with any application he made to other countries for arms during the emergency, that if these arms were not supplied during the emergency, there is no contract binding on us to take them now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, that the best way in which I can approach the subject of the discussion here to-day is to take the Deputies in the order in which they spoke, because a number of Deputies more or less repeated the same type of argument or made the same type of complaint.  I feel that I am not expected to speak on Army policy on a Supplementary Estimate. That can be more appropriately and more effectively done on the annual Estimate, and therefore I shall deal with the questions as they arose. Deputy Cosgrave appeared to have some difficulty in respect of the use of the Grant-in-Aid.  He appeared to think that the Grant-in-Aid was also some form of gratuity.  The Grant-in-Aid is that sum of money which was allotted to the L.D.F. when it was initiated, and it is divided into two sums: one, I think, of 15/-, used for the provision of boots, and the other of 5/-, used for administrative purposes. There is no question of a gratuity in respect of the L.D.F., which is a purely voluntary defence force and which, I sincerely hope, will continue to remain a purely voluntary defence force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also raised the question of the apparent falling down in the matter of the demobilisation of the Army.  In my opening statement I explained that we did hope to have begun demobilisation in July last, but <Col N="2126" /> we were unable to do that by reason of the fact that the Army authorities were endeavouring to make plans whereby they would be enabled to recruit a large number of men who were already serving in the emergency forces.  They were unable to complete these plans before November and from November, when the demobilisation of the Army began, the average number of men demobilised exceeded the figure which we estimated: that is, the figure of 2,000 per month.  It exceeded that figure; in some months it almost reached a total of 3,000, but, on an average, I think it can be safely assumed that 2,000 per month was exceeded.  My statement that we would endeavour to demobilise at the rate of 2,000 per month was, more or less, adhered to, with the exception of a couple of months which were lost while the Army were making their plans to deal with the enlistment in the regular forces of men who served during the emergency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and some other Deputies referred to the Soldiers' Club. That club is not run for profit.  It has, of course, to ensure that its running expenses will be secured.  Generally speaking, the goods, which are of the type which could be purchased outside, are sold at a lower price than would have to be paid in outside establishments, so that there is no question of the Soldiers' Club being run for profit. It is run in the interest of the comfort of men who have either to spend a short time in town or who are passing through town to some other centre.  It is also of service in securing that men will not get into wrong hands during the period of their stay in town and it has done very valuable work in that respect.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the question of warlike stores.  It seemed to me that Deputies assumed that all the intelligence of the country was in this House and that there was none in the Army.  When it became fairly clear that the war was coming to a conclusion, the Army cancelled all the orders they had placed.  They did not wait to be told to do that.  They used their intelligence and common-sense and they cancelled large orders, placed <Col N="2127" /> during the war years, which they would have been very glad to have had executed during those years.  Certain stores were still urgently required and those are the stores mentioned in the Supplementary Estimate.  I mentioned, in the course of my statement, that they consisted largely of armoured vehicles, guns and carriages, generator sets, parts for universal carriers, parts for rifles and machine guns, motor cycle parts, and miscellaneous small items. There was no question of purchasing obsolescent or obsolete material.  The material we purchased was badly needed and we were glad to secure it.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House, whatever they may feel regarding the purchase of warlike stores in the future, that the Army is at present under-equipped. If we are to have an Army and a Local Defence Force, we shall have to equip them.  The alternative is for this House to tell the Government that it does not want an Army or that it wants the Army to be greatly reduced.  If we are to equip the Army, we must equip it with the most up-to-date weapons we can secure.  That is why we cancelled the orders which we had placed.  We knew that, while the equipment we were seeking was the best available at the time, with the cessation of war, minds would be turned to the manufacture of more up-to-date equipment.  That is why we held our hand.  The Army is sadly under-equipped and we shall have to see to it that it is properly equipped if we are to continue to maintain an Army.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey spoke of the building of new barracks at Limerick. Deputy Cosgrave referred to the purchase of land at Baldonnel and Fermoy.  In that connection, I should state that it was not correct for me to say that the land obtained at Fermoy was for the purpose of an aerodrome runway.  It was for the purpose of extending the present encampment at Fermoy, which is the training centre for the units in the South.  It is correct to say that the land at Baldonnel was purchased for the extension of the runways.  That has become vitally necessary by reason of the fact that <Col N="2128" /> we have machines now which require a greater extent of ground when they are landing and when they are taking off.  That is because of the size of the machines.  Deputy Cosgrave asked what the cost per acre was.  At Baldonnel, the average cost was £63.  At Fermoy it was, I think, £104.  As regards the building of barracks outside Limerick, the position is that we have a small barracks in Limerick which is very antiquated.  It needs a number of modern improvements. During the emergency, we had about 20 different establishments in the Limerick area.  These were private property which we had to take over. A number of these houses were ill-fitted to house human beings at all.</P>
    <P>I felt rather ashamed of the fact that we had to house men in such establishments but, in the course of time, the men converted these establishments into something which was reasonably comfortable and reasonably habitable. Yet they were far from the type of establishment that any Deputy here would suggest as good enough for men who had offered their services&mdash;and many of the men who had offered their services came from decent comfortable homes.  I feel that, while there might be some good reason for men having to suffer in such circumstances when we were passing through a severe emergency period, there is no reason in the future why we should continue to ask them to live under conditions in which none of us here would be prepared to live.  That is why we purchased the land in Limerick for the purpose of erecting a barracks in the near future.  Unfortunately it cannot be done for some years, I understand, but the money which is being expended and which is referred to in this Estimate, has been and is being used, for the purpose of introducing sewerage and water on the site.  At present we have erected quite a number of huts for the purpose of housing the men whom we have taken in from these outlying buildings.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is a small barracks and it is generally understood to be small.  It is generally understood not to be equipped in the way we would like it to be equipped.  I am not saying that it is ill-equipped because, even in the case of the houses to which I have referred, before the military left them we had installed in some cases not only water and a sewerage system but even a lighting system. The same applies to Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick.  I think Deputy Morrissey will agree with me&mdash;I do not want to misrepresent him&mdash;that while we all have our own views in respect to ordinary civilians whom we are anxious to rescue from slum conditions, we are just as anxious to see that our soldiers are not compelled to live in slum conditions. Unfortunately&mdash;I say unfortunately because the circumstances were there and we could not overcome them at the time&mdash;a very large number of those who had been living in decent comfortable homes had to exist in conditions which must certainly have shocked them.  I am suggesting that we must ensure that that will not happen again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Partly, yes, because we shall have an Army that will be almost twice as large as the pre-war Army and we shall have to ensure that there will be living accommodation, suitably to house these men.  In Limerick I understand the military authorities were foolish enough in the past to hand over barrack sites to the civil authorities.  I know that the same thing has happened in several other provincial towns.  The military authorities regretted that very much during the war but they could do nothing about it.  When I say that it is partly part of the post-war policy, I mean that we believe we must maintain an Army of 12,500 men.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the Minister, may I say that I did not intend to oppose the Supplementary Estimate but if this Estimate is based on a post-war policy of an Army of 12,500 men, then I oppose this Supplementary Estimate?  The Minister should understand that.  I mention that now so that the Minister may address himself to any aspects of the Estimate that he may consider important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say on that matter is that the actual building of the barracks has nothing to do with post-war policy but it is to ensure, as I said a moment ago, that the larger Army which we intend to have and which we hope to have, will be properly accommodated and housed. Deputy Norton referred to rumours which he had heard about recruitment. Unfortunately, recruitment is not as satisfactory as I, or the Army authorities, would like it to be.  I think the Deputy referred to the fact that a very large number of young men were leaving the country, going up to the North or across to England to join the army there, the suggestion being that conditions were more attractive or something of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my personal opinion that these young men are going abroad in a spirit of adventure.  It is not that they do not want to serve Ireland or anything like that.  Some of the rumours&mdash;I hear rumours like the Deputy&mdash;are to the effect that numbers of these young men are men who had given service to this country throughout the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And the adventure they want is work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are not looking for work.  They want to join the army.  The allegation is that they are joining the British Army.  It may be that they will get more work in that army than they get in ours.  The allegation is not that they are looking for work but that they are going away up north and joining the British Army.  The British Army can provide that type of adventure, which we cannot&mdash;they can send these young men abroad, so far afield that it probably has some appeal to them.  I do not know if the conditions to which I was referring a few minutes ago may have had anything to do with the failure of our own Army to recruit them.  I do not think so, because the conditions improved considerably as the years passed during the emergency. I do say that conditions in the Army in the future will have to be improved still further.  I do not want to forecast anything, but while I am acting as Minister for Defence, for whatever period that may be, however long or however short, I will do everything possible to impress on the Government the necessity to make a soldier's career at least as attractive as that of an ordinary working man.</P>

      <P>If we can make it as attractive as that, we will be getting somewhere, but I can still feel that there may be strong objections raised in this House to the added expenditure which will be incurred as a result. We have to be realists in this and the <Col N="2133" /> fact remains that, if we want to attract the right type of intelligent young man to the Army, we will have to ensure that his conditions will be as good as the conditions existing outside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton raised the question of the marriage establishment. We made a very great advance during the emergency on the conditions that existed formerly.  The Deputy knows that himself, as he was a member of the Defence Conference at the time, and was one of those advocating that particular policy.  We advanced to the stage where we reduced the age from 26 to 22 and we asked that the man would have at least two years' service before he would be given permission to marry.  I do not think there was anything wrong in that.  It was a rather generous gesture, but I know what Deputy Byrne has in mind.  The type of people who go to Deputy Byrne are those who cannot come within the regulations.  They appeal then to his sentiments, and he brings the matter up here.  If a man takes the risk of marrying outside the regulations, he will have to take the risk&mdash;that is all there is about it.  We have made it very clear that any young man, from the age of 22, who has two years' service, is entitled to go on to the marriage establishment.  That is an emergency measure, which I hope to incorporate in the post-war regulations, though I have not got sanction to do it yet.  I believe it is as far as we will be able to go.  We will have the matter examined, to see if we can go even further than that, but I cannot make any statement on that question at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a talk with Deputy Dillon on the subject matter which he discussed here to-day.  I promised him then, and I promise him now, that we will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Finance, in the hope that the Minister may accede to his request. However, as I informed the Deputy on that occasion, the decision was a <Col N="2134" /> Government decision, and one which neither I nor the Minister for Finance could overrule without the sanction of the Government being sought and granted.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure as to what was in Deputy Roddy's mind when he was talking about these sums being repeated. The sums we are asking for in this Supplementary Estimate are the sums we deem to be sufficient to carry us through this present financial year.  Some of those sums will have to be repeated; for instance, the question of gratuities will have to be carried on probably into the next Estimate.  The sum we are asking for here will not have to be repeated, but if additional sums are required before the end of the financial year&mdash;and I cannot see any possibility of that happening&mdash;I will just have to come here again and ask for another supplementary sum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy spoke about the large sums of money here.  I have to admit frankly that there was failure to estimate accurately; in other words, there was an underestimation in a large number of items.  When you are dealing with matters of this kind, with very large sums involved, it is very easy to overestimate or underestimate. Very often, it is largely just a guess, getting as near as you can go to what you require.  In this case, undoubtedly, there was a number of items underestimated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I presume that the person the Deputy has in mind failed on the first occasion to produce sufficient medical evidence to induce the board to believe that the wound, injury or disease was caused through military service.  If he failed on that occasion and can produce now additional <Col N="2135" /> medical testimony to say that, in the opinion of whoever is writing the medical testimony, this illness was brought about as a result of service, it will be reconsidered and examined on appeal.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1946, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941 and No. 14 of 1943); Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, No. 33 of 1938, No. 5 of 1944, and Nos. 11 and 34 of 1945); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Force and the Voluntary. <Col N="2136" /> Aid Divisions of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 28 of 1939); and for sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
    <P>This Estimate for the token sum of £10 is necessary to regularise (1) the financial provisions of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1945; and (2) a payment which has been made for personal injuries to a member of the Voluntary Aid Division of the Irish Red Cross under an Emergency Powers Order which was not included in the ambit of the annual Army Estimate.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that by the Military Service Pensions Act of 1945, the Oireachtas authorised either the abolition or the relaxation of abatement hitherto made in respect of remuneration and allowances paid to military service pensioners from central or local funds.  That change in the scales of abatement will cost the Exchequer during the present year about £25,000.  Within the sub-head, however, there are technical savings of about £9,000, because although the number of pensions granted has been forecast with accuracy, the rate of pensions has been over-estimated. Hence under sub-head I, there is required an additional sum of £16,000.</P>
    <P>The other payment which it is necessary to regularise is that made during the year to a member of the Voluntary Aid Division of the Irish Red Cross. The compensation paid was not included in the annual Estimate and it is, therefore, necessary to vote the amount of the payment (£17) under sub-head P.</P>
    <P>But for the two payments just outlined, this Estimate would not have been necessary, because there is sufficient money available in the Vote to meet all commitments up to the end of March.  In accordance, however, with the usual rules and practice, it is necessary in an Estimate of this nature to show large excesses of expenditure where they occur on other sub-heads of the Vote.</P>
    <P>The first excess (£5,095) is on sub-head C, which provides for the salaries, wages and allowances of the Referee and Advisory Committee.  The original Estimate for £822 provided for the employment of the Referee for six <Col N="2137" /> weeks, with a small staff for three months, but actually both the Referee and his staff have been fully employed throughout the whole of the year.</P>
    <P>Another excess anticipated is £18,000 under sub-head J for claims under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes which deal with the pensions, allowances and gratuities of officers and other ranks serving in the Army.  The excess is entirely due to the demobilisation of the Army.  Here I must point out that an emergency gratuity out of the Army Vote under Defence Force Regulations is payable to all men with a minimum of 360 days' service and that, in addition, a statutory gratuity under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme is also payable to every N.C.O. or man who has rendered three years' service.  When the Estimate for 1945-46 was being framed there was no sign that hostilities in Europe would cease, and consequently sufficient money was not provided for those statutory short service gratuities.</P>
    <P>The £3,000 excess in sub-head K for the expenses of applicants and witnesses attending for examination is due partly to the activities of the Referee with the Advisory Committee and partly to the large number of applicants under examination for wound and disability pensions before the Army Pensions Board at St. Bricin's Hospital.</P>
    <P>The total of the excesses on the five sub-heads is £42,112, but as there is sufficient savings on the other sub-heads to meet that sum, I am only asking the Dáil to vote the token sum of £10.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1946, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister <Col N="2138" /> for Local Government and Public Health, and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing Grants to Local Authorities, sundry Miscellaneous Grants and Grants-in-Aid, and certain Charges connected with Hospitals.</P>
    <P>The scope of this Supplementary Estimate is indicated on Part III of the Estimate, under sub-heads J (6) and S (2).  Under sub-head J (6) the sum of £10 is required purely as a token Vote in order that we may settle a certain inconsistency which appeared in the sub-head as originally drafted.  The real reason why it becomes necessary to take this token Estimate is in order to insert the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; in the last line after the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; and before the word &ldquo;in&rdquo; because, in fact, persons who are receiving footwear at reduced prices could be held to be in receipt of home assistance in so far as this scheme was administered by the public assistance authorities.</P>
    <P>A large number of people have been given footwear for their children at considerably reduced prices, prices which are heavily subsidised by the State, and they are to that extent receiving home assistance, but they are not regarded as continuously or for more than a momentary period in receipt of that form of help.  It is in order to make it quite clear that a contribution will be required from these people&mdash;a contribution will also be made by the State&mdash;and that they come within the original intention of the sub-head that the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; is being included.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head S (2), a sum of £6,000 will be required to give effect to the provisions of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1946.  The House will remember that the purpose of that Act was to extend the time within which houses provided by private persons and public utility societies could be built as grant-aided dwellings, and, in addition, there was, of course, a proposal to subsidise, and in fact, to defray the cost of additional accommodation which might be provided in the case of dwellings inhabited by <Col N="2139" /> families, at least one member of which may be suffering from tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill provides for the continued operation of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts until 31st March, 1947.  A number of additional provisions have also been found necessary or desirable.  Some of these, however, are merely by way of consolidation or amplification of existing Defence Forces legislation and others are already contained in Emergency Powers Orders.  The latter are now being incorporated in the Defence Forces Acts because they will still be necessary on the expiration of the Emergency Powers Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contents of the Bill are explained in the memorandum which has already been circulated and as the memorandum sets out the purpose of each section, it is only necessary for me in this statement to refer to the provisions briefly.  Sections 3, 9 and 14 are being introduced in the interests of the members of the Defence Forces to whom they relate.  Sections 4, 5 and 15 are rendered necessary by the establishment of the new Second Line Reserve (An Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil) and by the conditions of service in that force which will include voluntary local training and retention by the members of their uniforms and equipment at home.  The principles underlying Section 13, which relates to desertion during a period of emergency and is based on the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order, 1945, have already been fully discussed by the Dáil.  Sections 16, 17, 18 and 19 repeat existing provisions of the Defence Forces Acts, with an additional provision, already contained in an Emergency Powers Order, regarding the dyeing or conversion of service textile articles and with a new provision prohibiting the wearing of the uniform of <Col N="2140" /> the Defence Forces in circumstances likely to bring contempt on the uniform.  Section 21 incorporates the provisions of the Emergency Powers (No. 17) Order, 1939, relating to the wearing of foreign uniforms, with an exemption in respect of theatrical performances. It is the international practice for States to restrict the wearing of foreign uniforms within their territories.</P>
    <P>The other sections of the Bill are mainly of an administrative nature.  It will, I think, be agreed that, on the whole, the provisions of the Bill are in no way contentious.</P>

      <P>In view of the remarks made by the Minister in discussing the Estimate which came before this Bill as to his desire, willingness and anxiety on any occasion to give us a full account of Army policy, the statement we have just listened to is nothing short of amazing.  Here we have an Army Bill introduced, with a view to putting it through the House&mdash;an Army Bill at the end of a war which lays down the conditions for the times of peace following that war.  On the occasion of the Estimate last summer, the Minister, quite casually, and so far as this House was concerned, without any previous notice or discussion, announced that his post-war Army would be at least two and a half times as great as the Army required before the war. He was pressed then to give any reason or reasons for that decision, and I rise now to issue the same invitation.</P>

    <P>The reason for a bigger Army is not just asking for the money; the reason for a bigger Army is not just the Minister coming in and saying: &ldquo;We have decided to have a bigger Army; the general staff has decided to have a bigger Army.&rdquo;  Any Minister coming here to look for a much larger Army, an Army 250 per cent. greater than sufficed this country at a time when the Minister, the Taoiseach and his colleagues were denouncing the then Government for having an Army twice too large and twice too expensive, must be prepared to detail the reasons for seeking that bigger Army.  Now we are to have an Army two and a half <Col N="2141" /> times as great, and four times as expensive, and we are to vote for that Army without any reason whatever being given beyond the fact that the Minister asks for it.  Surely we do not have an Army merely for the sake of having an Army.  Surely we do not have an Army for the sake of giving employment.  It is the most expensive, the most unproductive, the most parasitic type that could possibly be devised for giving employment.  A country has an army because it requires it, and knows the reason why it requires it.  Either the army is the strength of X or XX or XXX, but if the strength of X goes up three times, then it is because there is some new, some real and more imminent danger.</P>
    <P>No country trebles the strength of its army merely because a Minister comes in and casually says: &ldquo;In our reorganisation we require an Army two and a half times as great as it was before.&rdquo;  The most docile Parliament in the world, a Parliament made up of regimented followers, would always get a reason for a departure from what existed previously, and for the placing of new burdens on the backs of taxpayers.  In the past, when the Minister's Party were over on these benches, the military policy of this country&mdash;and it was stated not once but many times&mdash;was that if there was any occasion for an Army Estimate, or for the reintroduction of the Army Bill, there was no side-stepping by the Minister in clearly laying down the Army plan, the policy which the Army was built to uphold.  Deputy de Valera, as he then was, Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee, one by one, challenged the Minister's statement on Army policy; why the strength of that Army was 5,000 men, and the cost about £1,500,000.  I read these speeches.  A number of them were very sound, very helpful, gave evidence of careful consideration and very close study.  The gist of every one of these speeches, particularly those delivered from these benches by Deputy de Valera, was that this country could not, and should not, be asked to support an Army that would cost any more than £1,000,000. Deputy MacEntee went much further. His figure was that the maximum <Col N="2142" /> expenditure which this country should be asked to put up for an Army was £500,000, while the Tánaiste, as he is now, in his most recent speech on the subject, held that our military requirements and our military establishments could, and should, be met for well under the figure of £1,000,000.  These debates went on year after year from 1927 to 1932.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence in the previous Government stated clearly on every occasion the purpose for which that Army was kept.  It was the considered opinion of the Executive Council that that Army should be maintained for a figure of about £1,000,000 a year.  The purpose of the Army, they stated, was to meet any general attack on these isles, and if there was a general attack on both of these isles, to have a trained, effective, highly-skilled nucleus, that could act in co-operation with the two other services of Great Britain, if they were attacked, and in addition to reinforce, as every army does, the authority of the civil power.  The aim at that time was to have a very small, highly-trained, specialised Army, mainly composed of technical men, whose training would be slow and arduous; an Army so highly efficient and so highly trained that a private in that tiny Army would be capable of becoming a non-commissioned officer if the occasion arose, when it had suddenly to expand. Beyond that tiny Army of 5,000 men so highly trained and so highly efficient that they would be fit for two or three other ranks, there were 1, 2 or 3 lines of reserve, so as to make an Army that could very rapidly expand.  There you had a hard core of highly-trained and efficient officers and soldiers.  That was the plan before Dáil Eireann at that time.  That was the policy clearly and frankly announced to Dáil Eireann.  It was sneered at by some, jeered at by others but, in fact, supported by the most thoughtful members of what then constituted the Opposition.</P>
    <P>There was general agreement with regard to the scheme, with regard to policy, and with regard to the plan, but there was an acute difference of opinion on two points, the cost and the size.  Deputy de Valera held then that <Col N="2143" /> the cost, in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000 per annum, was entirely beyond the capacity of this country. Deputy MacEntee held that £500,000 was sufficient.  Both of them, as well as every one of their colleagues then on these front benches, denounced the idea of keeping an army as great in numbers as 6,000.  Except with regard to numbers and cost, there was general agreement with regard to the outlook, the plan and the policy.  The only difference between the Parties at that time was that those who are now the Government considered £1,000,000 too high, and those, apparently, gave most consideration to the matter.  I suggest that the speeches that appear to have given it most consideration and study were those delivered by Deputy Lemass.  He asked this Dáil bluntly: Why do we keep a standing Army? For what?  We are an isle and a tiny isle.  We are not going to be invaded by Great Britain.  Where is there any power that is going to invade us?  If any power does invade us, remember that power has to be mighty enough to burst its way through the British Navy to land on the shores of this country. If such a situation arose, that would mean that it is a really mighty power, a really great power and that, if it is a really great power which has invaded our shores, then it is nonsense to have the greater part of our strength in uniform, modelled on a European army, and attempting to give battle. Our only hope, our only chance of carrying on the struggle, is to have trained soldiers away in the background, not in barracks, not in an Army, so as to make it unprofitable for the invader, after he invades, to remain on the island.  But, he argued, if you put all your strength into a big Army against a power that has burst through the British Navy, that can land troops all round your coast, your Army is a besieged Army from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, and all your equipment, all your material and all your fighting men are like rats in a trap.  He said, doubtless they will fight bravely; they might fight bravely for three days, I will even say they might fight for three weeks, but then they are broken and the spirit of the country is broken, and <Col N="2144" /> that is an end of the country.  That was his argument.</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister the quotation.  As a matter of fact, I was summarising in order to save the Minister the time it takes to read out but I will give it to the Minister.  If he has any reason to doubt it, I will give it to him word for word, and I will also give him the Taoiseach word for word.  Deputy Lemass said, column 1177, Dáil Debates, 1st May, 1929&mdash;Vol. 29:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are weak in man power.  Our population is only 2,900,000, our man power is very low.  We have got to take these facts into account, and taking these facts into account certain things are obvious, leaving for a moment out of consideration all questions of the possibility of war or strained relations between ourselves and Great Britain, and considering that the present political relationship between the two countries will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first obvious fact that faces us is this, that any nation that invades this country will be one strong enough to defeat the British Navy, on the seas, because it is quite obvious that while present relations continue, at any rate Britain will not tolerate any other power establishing herself militarily here without resistance.  I hope Deputies from all parts of the House will agree with that proposition.  It indicates at any rate that such military opposition as we would have to face is likely to be very formidable.  Any nation or power strong enough to beat the British on the seas and likely to invade this country in such strength is one that we could not hope to beat.  The policy of the Executive Council, according to the Minister for Defence, is to maintain here an Army sufficiently strong and sufficiently effective to make an invader think twice before he decides to invade this country.  Deputy Wolfe has just enunciated the same principle in other words&mdash;an Army <Col N="2145" /> sufficiently strong that if attacked we could keep the enemy at bay for some time until assistance came to us from our allies no matter where our allies might be.</P>
    <P>The consequence of that policy must be fairly fully considered by the Dáil if it is going to express its satisfaction with it.  We have, I think, to admit that if we are going to be invaded by an overwhelming force, by some power or combination of powers, the strength of it will be such that we cannot hope for military victory.  In fact there is no nation within striking distance of us with whom we could engage in war, with any hope of military victory.  I think that is agreed.  What would be the effect, therefore, of our offering resistance to the invaders who will come in the strength indicated? Merely to hold them at bay sufficiently long until assistance comes to us from some place.  What will be the effect of keeping here an Army strong enough to make the invader think twice before he invades when the invasion has actually occurred?  I think it is quite obvious that any damage that we could possibly inflict upon such an invader would be certainly not greater than the damage which the invader could inflict on us.</P>
    <P>It is an old maxim of military science, first enunciated by Napoleon, that God fights with the big battalions and God would be with the big battalions against us.  Also the war would be fought upon territory of this State and, consequently, the civilian population would suffer just as much as the Army would suffer. The Army would probably disappear altogether after a few battles.  We would undoubtedly delay the enemy for a few days, perhaps for a few weeks.  We would inflict a certain amount of damage upon him, but on the other hand, we would have so affected the fighting resources, the manpower of this country, that any idea of continued resistance to that enemy's presence in the country would be out of the question for another generation.  If we attempted to offer effective military resistance <Col N="2146" /> to any invader of the type that we are ever likely to encounter other than Britain, we would be only dissipating our strength by a futile demonstration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think that it is necessary that we should spend £1,500,000 yearly in order to ensure that that resistance will take place.  If the spirit of the people is right, if they want to resist aggression and to maintain their independence, resistance will come...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From that he goes on to point out what a crushing and unjust burden on the backs of the taxpayers it is to ask for a sum of £1,000,000 a year, and he points out that that is equivalent to a tax of 11/9 per head of the population of this country.  He winds up by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Personally, I would say that £1,000,000 is the most we are able to spend upon defence.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Column 1453, 16th November, 1927, Volume 21.  He was speaking to an amendment to the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1927.  The amendment which he proposed, and which was supported by every member of his Party in the division lobby, was to this effect:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all the words after &lsquo;That&rsquo;, and add the words: &lsquo;The Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to a Bill having for its purpose the continuance of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, 1923 to 1927, but is of opinion that the Defence Forces should be organised before March 31st, 1928, on a volunteer territorial basis, with a small permanent training and maintenance establishments.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the view of Deputy de Valera. That was the view of Deputy Lemass. That was the view expressed by every member of the then Fianna Fáil front bench who is a member of the Government or of the Government Party at the present moment.  The view was that £1,000,000 extracted from the pockets of the people of this country, was unjustifiable, that the retention of an Army of a strength of 5,000 or 6,000 men was fantastic and suicidal, that a volunteer force, with a tiny maintenance corps as the centre, costing between £500,000 and £1,000,000 was the only reasonable defence policy for this State.  Those speeches were made at a time when they were denouncing a Government that presumed to ask the Dáil for authority to maintain an Army of 6,000 men at a cost of £1,000,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I want to ask the Minister: is there any sincerity in the game; is there any honesty in the game?  Or is it that you were all so many stupid nonentities a few years ago and that you have come to the use of reason since?  Or was this some cheap political play-acting in order to <Col N="2148" /> embarrass the Government responsible for the safety of this State at that time?  When denouncing an Army of 5,000 men as being the height of extravagance, as being suicidal nonsense, did you deliberately mean to strip this country and leave it naked in defence?  Or is it that you come of a race that would only reach the use of reason in the 40's or 50's and that you had not reached the use of reason at the time when these were given as considered statements and when Deputy Lemass, as he was then, went so far as to say: &ldquo;Remember, we are not talking without giving this very full and very careful and very anxious consideration.  When we are talking here we are talking from the book; we are talking as a result of study&rdquo;?  As I say, at that time their view was that a cost of £1,000,000 for an Army was too heavy to call on the taxpayers to pay, that the maintenance of an Army of 5,000 or 6,000 men was only inviting swift defeat and that the cost should be less and the strength less.</P>
    <P>Now we are asked for a standing Army of 12,500 men or two and a half times the strength that was denounced. We are asked to grant the money and approve of that Army without getting any reason whatsoever, without its being stated that the Army which had been denounced as too large and too costly would be insufficient for the postwar years ahead; without giving any reason why it is necessary to increase the strength by two and a half times and, presumably, the cost by three or four times.  We have the Minister introducing this Bill for the 23rd time, a Minister belonging to a Government which denounced the previous Government for having the audacity to introduce a Bill year after year, and which asked in the noisiest way for an assurance each time that it would be the last time they would be asked to re-enact that Bill.  We had the Bill introduced in the speech you have just listened to, without any reference to policy, without any reference to cost, without any reference to plans; but just telling us the few extra things that are in the Bill, such as making provision for solicitors' apprentices to get some period off their apprenticeship and for county managers to do the <Col N="2149" /> work of the Army in dealing with offenders; making provision that in peace times this extensive Army of two and a half times the strength of the pre-war Army will not even face up to the soldier's task of dealing with deserters, but will call on the various county managers to ensure discipline in the Irish Army.</P>
    <P>We are providing for the handling of deserters for the next seven years and providing for solicitors' apprentices for an unknown number of years ahead under an Army Act that has only a life of one year, according to the terms of the Act itself.  We are making provision for longer terms of enlistment. My lay mind would prompt me to the belief that the legality is doubtful of attesting people for ten or 12 years under an Army Act that itself has only a life of one year.  What contract can you make with any one of these men that you attest for 12 years?  The Act under which you attest them has only a life of one year.  You are attesting them for 12 years.  You are proposing to build barracks that will take years to build, and you are proposing to spend money by the million as if the rivers of this country were running with gold.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister in this debate follow up his expressed desire to give the House a full statement of Army policy?  Was there not some common-sense in some of the speeches that were made from those benches many years ago?  Was it all nonsense?  Was there one grain of common-sense in what was enunciated as the considered judgment of Deputy de Valera; was there any common-sense at all uttered by Deputy Lemass; was Deputy MacEntee uttering cheap nonsense when they all expressed their considered views as to what we could afford to spend on defence and what type of defence we should have?</P>
    <P>Let us go back with positions reversed. Let us start by trying whether we can find agreement, not whether we can find disagreement.  We have had the experience of the last five years when Britain went through the greatest war that the world ever saw with all kinds of difficulties and embarrassments; when her greatest danger was <Col N="2150" /> her Atlantic lifeline; when at times she was hopelessly trudging along, and when the greatest optimist could not see the slightest sign of light or any hope of success; when the temptation to invade us, so as to protect her lifeline and have greater control of her surplus stores and her great production, must have been very great.  However, all these years of strife and difficulty passed and we were left alone. There was no suggestion of invasion from there.  As a result of that new experience gained since these speeches were made then, I would agree absolutely with Deputy Lemass, as he then was, that we are a tiny island with a small population, unfortunately even smaller than at the time when he made these speeches; that the likelihood of invasion from that quarter is most unlikely, and that anybody else that attempts to invade us has to be strong enough to burst its way through the British Navy, and, consequently, has to be a great power.  Any power strong enough to carry out with success the operation of bursting through the British Navy would unquestionably be a strong, formidable power, one of such dimensions and of such equipment that even the greatest Army we could throw up, could not meet it and defeat it in pitched battles; that our Army policy should be a policy of a very tiny Army costing in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000 a year, very highly trained and very specialised, with the youngest soldier sufficiently trained to be a senior N.C.O., with reserves of one kind and another outside, so that the Army could be rapidly expanded if the necessity arose.</P>
    <P>So far, we have agreement, at least between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and the rest of us over here on the assumption that those speeches were not merely roguish bits of political dishonesty, but were sincere and honest speeches made, as was stated, as the result of close study. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Local Government, the Tánaiste and ourselves over here are in agreement, but the present Minister for Defence disagrees totally with the whole lot of <Col N="2151" /> us.  He comes along asking for four times the sum that was required pre-war, four times the sum that was denounced as an unfair and unjust burden of taxation on the backs of the people.  He asks for two and a half times the strength of an Army that was denounced as twice too great.  He does that without giving any reason for the change of front, without pointing out any real danger and without giving us any plan.  Surely, every Minister for War in the whole world in coming along with his Army Act, and in outlining the strength of his permanent force, has some idea as to why it has so many divisions.  It is because the army across the border has twice that number, and he is prepared to point out, if the situation arose, where the army is likely to be called upon to operate, who it is likely to be called upon to operate against, and who it is likely to co-operate with.</P>
    <P>Military policy, as well as foreign and external policy in every country, are so closely related that they cannot be divorced.  Is it because the Minister and his executives have not made up their minds with regard to external policy; is it because they do not, in fact, know what their foreign policy is, that there is such a marked reluctance to outline the military policy? The Minister can take this assurance in advance&mdash;the last five years should have taught it to him if he had any doubts about it&mdash;that whenever a sound military policy is put forward with the intention of safeguarding this State, its independence and safety, and the security of the homes and lives of the people living in it, it will get wholehearted support from the Opposition Parties in this House, and from the particular Party that I am now speaking for.  The Minister need not have any hesitation in announcing his policy, if he has one, through fear that it will be opposed over here.  He has got every assurance and pledge that that has never been our attitude since we went into Opposition.  We have never approved of spending money merely for the sake of spending money, of taxing the people merely for the sake of doing so, or having at any <Col N="2152" /> time, in peace or war, an unrequired large Army.  That is bad for young men.  They could be more usefully employed outside learning a trade.  It is bad for them to have them clicking heels and forming fours around a barrack square.  That sort of thing eats into the lives of many young men, and expenditure of that sort is entirely unproductive.  In nine cases out of ten it is a type of employment that leads nowhere.</P>
    <P>We are not going to support an Army two and a half times the strength of the pre-war Army, merely for the sake of having an Army two and a half times as great.  We are not going to support such an Army merely to spend four times as much money as we spent heretofore.  We are not going to approve of an Army of these alarming dimensions, purely for the sake of increasing taxation on the people, at a time when you have crying destitution and absolute want.  You have people, faced with black despair in their hearts and tears in their eyes, border jumping and boat crossing every time a boat leaves Dun Laoghaire.  You have them going among strangers, many of whom regard them as their traditional enemies.  That is not the type of emigration that we had 20 years ago when our people went out to a greater Ireland beyond the seas, out to join their own people, their own friends, their own county men, and people of their own religion.  One could say that almost every time they went out they met a relative, a friend or a Catholic priest.  The emigration in recent years has been such that the people have not gone away with hope and joy in their hearts.  They did not go out to join friends or relatives or old-time neighbours. Our emigrants went out with black despair in their hearts because economic circumstances drove them from the homes they loved.  They crossed over to mix with black strangers so that they might be able to send home 10/- or £1 a week to keep the roof over the heads of their parents.</P>
    <P>You have that kind of black destitution and that economic drive from the country.  Perhaps a lot of it <Col N="2153" /> could have been avoided by the expenditure of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 a year to improve wages, stimulate industry and increase production, thereby uplifting the low maintenance rates in many homes.  When those cases are brought before Parliament, when there is a demand for £3,000,000 or even £1,000,000 a year, we have crocodile tears from the Government Front Bench&mdash;they have all the sympathy in the world with those poor people, living in those houses, half starved, inadequately clothed, and with every form of disease running like a rampant cancer through their families as a result of malnutrition and want.  As I say, we have those crocodile tears from the Government Front Bench, but every one of the statements they make wind up with the remark: &ldquo;We should like to do this, but we have not the money, and if we were to meet your claim, it would mean that we would have to put an extra tax on the butter, the bread, the sugar and the tea of the people&rdquo;&mdash;the same old litany every time.  When, however, it comes to expanding the Army to two and a half times the force that was considered by the military intellectuals to be aping Imperial power, when it comes to expanding the Army to over twice what was required in this little island in pre-war days, then there is no talk about taxing tea, bread, sugar and butter.</P>
    <P>I remember, in the early days of Fianna Fáil, before they reached the age of the use of reason, a Ministerial colleague of the present Minister boasting from the Front Bench over there that certain other countries were buying guns instead of butter, but that we in this country were going to give our people butter instead of guns.  Is it too severe to remind the Minister of the considered views expressed by his own colleagues?  Is it too severe to remind him of the considered views expressed by his own Leader; and is it in any way unorthodox or unusual when we find the Minister departing completely from the views that were then expressed, trampling on the past of his own Party, trampling on the policies preached by his own Leader, and doing a sudden somersault that is <Col N="2154" /> going to send the hand of the tax-gatherer into the pockets of even the poorest people in the land?  Is it anything unusual to ask the Minister, in those circumstances, what is the reason for this?  Would he be kind enough to give the Dáil the reason for this, or to tell the Dáil what is the new danger that was not there all the time, or what is the new menace to our liberty? Will he tell us why the barracks that housed our soldiers cleanly and decently, six, seven and ten years ago, are not adequate to provide housing for our soldiers in the future?  Are we to build barracks for phantom armies, or to build playthings for ceremonial armies&mdash;particularly at a time when another Minister tells us that we cannot build a cottage for people who are living in lean-to shacks up and down the country?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that we have to be realists, and Deputy Lemass opened that speech, to which I have referred, with the very same words: &ldquo;We have to be realists&rdquo;.  I am afraid that the time has come when every one of us will have to be realists.  The time is coming when the false kind of diseased prosperity that reaches some countries as a result of a world blood-bath&mdash;that kind of temporary prosperity that reaches some countries because of the misfortunes of others&mdash;will cease.  That kind of false prosperity will not last for ever, and I prophesy this&mdash;and it is not safe, generally, in politics, to be a prophet&mdash;that we may be reckless with regard to millions of pounds to-day, that we may just think of a barracks and build it, that we may think of a sum and double it, that we may walk blithely through those Lobbies here and vote glibly on whether an extra £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 of the people's money should be spent, but before this Parliament has reached the end of its legal existence, a sum of £100,000, or even £50,000, is going to cause as much heart-burning both inside and outside this Parliament as £2,000,000, £3,000,000, or £4,000,000 does to-day. If we commit ourselves to expenditure on the magnificent scale now demanded by the Minister then it will not be even rational to face up to a debate in this <Col N="2155" /> House as to whether old age pensioners are or are not getting a livelihood out of 10/- a week: it will be nonsense to attempt to discuss such a subject in two or three years' time, if we fire away money in this way&mdash;lashings of it&mdash;without any reasons being given, without any increase in our population being demonstrated, without any increased strength in our area being shown or any increase in our territory, and without its being shown that there is any new danger to be faced, and when it seems to be evident that this new expenditure is merely for the sake of pomp and ceremonial.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this is the considered opinion of the General Staff.  Now, the General Staff is doing its duty; it always did its duty; but does the Minister, who, it seems, is breaking down on this matter, realise what is the function of the General Staff?  The General Staff in this country, as is the case with the General Staff in every country in the world, and as is the case with every officer in any army, wants more and more men and more and more supplies of stores and equipment.  There was a time when I resisted conscientiously, in doing my job, any reduction in the corps for which I was responsible, but the Minister above me who was not the representative of the taxpayers, had to go to his colleague, who was responsible for taxation, and ask for money for that service&mdash;money which had to be got out of the pockets of the people &mdash;and he laid down for me and for others the sum to which we would have to cut our cloth.  Now, supposing that that Minister came to the House and said that it was the considered opinion of the General Staff that that money should be provided, what would be the reaction of the House in normal times? The General Staff of any army of any country in the world always wants to increase the strength of the army, but that kind of mumbo-jumbo, that kind of talk about invisible phantom armies, that kind of cheap talk about defending our country against all comers, will not carry weight with the people in a time of peace.</P>
    <P>The Minister hesitated to mention <Col N="2156" /> any &ldquo;comer&rdquo; that we might have to face, and even if he had named that &ldquo;comer&rdquo; he refused to lay down what we would require in order to defend ourselves.  Now, that kind of thing is out of date.  The Minister cannot do as he did in the past when, under the shadow of an emergency, the Dáil patriotically agreed, whether they believed in it or not, to allow expenditure on the Army to go on unchecked, but depending all the time on the Minister, as head of the Army, to safeguard, in time, the interests of the ordinary people and to endeavour to work back to pre-war conditions. Certainly, if there is to be an increase in the Army and in Army expenditure, we want to be given the reasons, and very full reasons, for that, and we want a free and frank discussion on the matter, and not this kind of penny-book that we can read for ourselves but which tells us nothing as to what is in the Minister's mind or in the minds of the Government.</P>

      <P>I thought it better to ask for a house.  The Minister is introducing the Second Reading of the Defence Forces Bill.  In November last, I put a question to the Minister for Defence.  The answer gave the Defence Acts as the excuse for, I might say, not giving me information.  The question was put on the 14th November, 1945.  I asked the Minister for Defence &ldquo;if he will state whether steps have been taken to appoint a large number of new officers to the permanent Defence Forces; and, if so, if he will say how many such appointments it is proposed to make, and the intended date of appointments.&rdquo;  The then Minister for Defence replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As indicated in the White Paper on Demobilisation and Resettlement of Members of the Defence Forces, it is proposed to appoint approximately 600 officers to the permanent force.  At this stage, however, I am not in a position to give specific information about the date or dates of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2157" /> General Mulcahy: When is it proposed to ask for Parliamentary sanction for the expenditure involved?</P>
    <P>Mr. Aiken: Estimates come up every year.</P>
    <P>General Mulcahy: Is not the Minister aware that he is now offering, as it were, a career to an additional 600 men by inviting them to join the Army and does he not consider it would be advisable and necessary to get Parliamentary authority for such a plan before these young men are actually given their commissions in the Army?</P>
    <P>Mr. Aiken: The legal authority to do it is provided in the Defence Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has dealt with certain aspects of the proposal to have an Army two and a half times greater than it was pre-war.  I think it is time that we came to discuss, as from to-day, our defence policy.  The Army, as we have it, has grown up in a way which was dictated by events.  The officers who have had, at any time, the responsibility for organising, maintaining and directing the Army have had a very difficult job.  The Minister, by his attitude on Army policy to the House, is making their position absolutely impossible.  He is degrading and demeaning the Army and putting it in a position in which, in the eyes of the House and of the people, it cannot but be prejudiced.  We want whatever Army we have to be regarded as an indispensable institution of the State, serving a definite purpose and indicating a definite plan.  At this hour of the world's history, we are told that we want an Army two and a half times greater than the Army we had before the war.  The Minister gives us no information with regard to the arms, organisation or equipment of the Army or in regard to defensive policy in pursuance of which the Army would be used.</P>
    <P>The Dáil, which regards itself as the custodian of the interests of the country, ought to take a serious interest in this question.  What is the position to-day and what are likely to be our defence requirements in the coming five, eight or ten years?  These <Col N="2158" /> are considerations that call immediately for consideration by the House and by the people of the country, directed in whatever way the Government, on one side, and the discussions in this House, on the other side, direct them.  We have seen the world pass through a war in which it was made perfectly clear that not only the arms but the whole economic strength of a country are required if it is to defend itself.  We have seen ourselves unable to support our normal population during that war because of the weakness of our economic resources. Thousands of our people went abroad to earn a living.  They could have been fed here, but they could not procure occupation because of lack of resources or lack of an organised economic structure. Our man-power had to clear away.  We found ourselves completely unable to equip our Army for anything but almost primitive defence purposes because we had not the resources to make the arms; we were dependent upon people outside for them.  Thanks to Providence and to the strength of the two great Powers which were allies in their military operations and which flanked us, we were kept entirely free from the impact of war, except when it came from the air.  In the development of that war we saw ourselves pass into a completely new world in which the whole outlook of even the biggest military Powers on army organisation, defensive measures and equipment was changed.  None of them knows to-day what force they would require to have organised, or what equipment, offensive or defensive, they would require if the world got immersed in a war as widespread as was the last war.</P>
    <P>We are not likely to be threatened by military invasion or attack of any kind for five, six or eight years.  Put it at three years.  Surely we ought to regard this as a period of pause when we can sit down and examine our defence problem without committing ourselves to any military organisation save the Army at present in being and the equipment we have.  We could examine the problems of a defensive nature that are likely to come our way in future and see what kind of organisation we require to meet them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2159" /> It is, as I say, simply degrading the Army for the Minister to tell the Dáil that he wants an Army twice as big as that which we had before the war and that that is all he is going to tell us about it.  We cannot afford to have the Army degraded in this country and in the light of the various points of view of which Deputy O'Higgins spoke, we cannot afford to have the Army regarded simply as an expensive ornament.  Surely the Minister knows that, if we are attacked by a warlike enemy in future, we could not resist that enemy by the very small arms about which the Taoiseach spoke so lovingly some time ago at the Curragh.  The Minister has only to consider the developments that have taken place in aerial warfare, both in bombers and fighters, apart from the developments that have taken place as a result of the discovery of the atomic bomb, to realise that the Army we have to-day would not be the slightest use in preventing our country being destroyed by the warring forces that another country might let loose on us.  At such a period of our history, what is the Minister doing?  He is clearing the older officers out of the Army, the men who have been there for years, and he is taking in young men who, just like many of the young men who left this country to get work, were not able to get work in this country in present circumstances.  He is inveigling them into accepting commissions in the Army, mortgaging their whole future for some years in the Army without any hope of an economic future for many of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins gave figures with regard to the Army of the past.  If Deputies would look at the figures given, say in the 1931-32 Estimates, they will see that we had then an Army of 477 officers, 5,700 men and 750 short-time recruits, a total Army of 6,927. The Minister has stated now that he is taking in 600 young men as officers to the Army.  Surely the Minister is acting terribly unjustly to many of these men?  Surely he is acting terribly unjustly to many of the older men he is putting out of the Army under the regulations framed in 1938?  An officer <Col N="2160" /> came to me a day or two ago.  He had been in the quartermaster-general's service for many years as a quarter-master-sergeant. Having been in the Volunteers before, he joined the National Army in 1922.  He served as a non-commissioned officer up to 1940. As he was in the quartermaster-general's service he was always anxious to be an officer and he became a lieutenant about 1941 or 1942.  He was induced to do that because he felt that he would, as an officer engaged in quartermaster's work, have the extra ten years that the regulations then allowed him to have.  He has been put out of the Army now at 45 or 46 years of age to maintain himself and his family on a pension of something like £2 a week.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has lost complete control over his judgment, and has lost any balanced outlook that he had on the Army.  He told us here to-day that the reason why an Estimate was put before us for such an increased amount was that there was a delay in drafting forms to enable the emergency men to be enlisted in the Regular Army and that the difficulty in drafting forms and settling some technical matter in connection with them lasted for four months.  The administrative control of the Army seems to have absolutely broken down.  If there was any scrap of administrative control left, the Minister would not be asking the House to-day to consider a Defence Forces Bill without any statement of Army policy except the mere statement that the Government had come to the conclusion that they wanted an Army two and a half times as big after this war as they needed before it.</P>
    <P>It would be a very disastrous thing if the Army or any matter connected with the defence of this country were drawn into the maelstrom of Party politics.  There is absolutely no reason why it should.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, anything that in a considered way may be required for the defence of this country, this Party, as well as every other Party in the House, will support.  That has been absolutely and completely demonstrated during the emergency, more completely demonstrated than many people realise, and if there is any person or any Party who <Col N="2161" /> wants to suggest that Party considerations are going to be brought into defence matters by any Party in this House, now is the time to say it so that we can, in the calmness of the present moment, fully discuss it, but I suggest that for the next five years, no expenditure on Army organisation or Army equipment should be required or should be entered on except expenditure actually ensuing from the Army commitments we have for ourselves at the present moment.</P>
    <P>A war has been fought which has exhausted the whole world.  Great Britain and the United States have come militarily victorious out of that war.  There is no possibility of their power being challenged in arms by any country in the world, within the next five or six years at any rate.  There is no possibility of our being called upon to defend ourselves in any way during that time.  The biggest countries in the world are endeavouring to make plans to provide an international force, subscribed to by the greatest countries, to maintain peace in the world.  I do not think there is anybody who need despair at the present moment about that.  Even if we tend to be isolationist in spirit, surely we should thank Providence that we are in our present position, when we see the political circumstances in the countries immediately around us and likely to affect us? Surely we should concentrate on our real needs and see where our country's real strength lies?</P>
    <P>We have got into the habit of considering that our national strength lies in the military strength of our people.  After the first World War we had to defend ourselves in arms against aggression from outside and at that time we had, through arms and through sacrifice in arms, to declare our determination to be free.  That fact has become emphasised in the minds of people who are not associated with arms, who had not the chance to realise how much any real man hates to have to resort to arms to defend himself, or to attack anyone else.  Our people generally have allowed themselves to be persuaded, very often in a masquerading kind of way, to believe in arms and in our martial spirit.  In <Col N="2162" /> our gratitude to Providence for bringing our country safely through our difficulties during the shocking clash of arms in the world in the last six years, we ought to decide, in a systematic and in a contemplative and prayerful kind of way, where our country's strength lies and what purpose our arms are to serve.</P>
    <P>Even if we have to bear arms to protect our country, are there not other things on which it is more necessary we should spend money at present?  Our whole economic position has been shown to be weak during this war.  We have shown that we can feed ourselves but, outside our agricultural community and the small number of our industries, we are very dependent on the outside world.  We have shown how much we are dependent on education and skill and how much education and skill in many directions is lacking. We see the countries most deeply involved in the war realising that in education their strength will reside primarily in the future.  We have problems to deal with both in industry and in education and in the aspects of our social life that are much more urgent than the building up of an Army two and a half times greater than it was pre-war.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that his treatment of the matter here is very unfortunate, certainly unfair to the Army and, being unfair to the Army, is unfair to the country.  I ask him to realise that this is an occasion upon which he should have indicated our general defence problem in a very broad way.  No matter what view we may take of the Government, he should have told us what the Government thought our present Army should be, why they thought it should be as big as he now suggests and why in the form he now suggests&mdash;although he has not given us details about it. These are matters which are his responsibility and this is the time to do it.  He will be presenting to us soon the Estimates for the Army for the coming year.  The matter should not be left until those Estimates are presented, to outline to us the Government's outlook on Army organisation and equipment and on our defence policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost every year there has been introduced into this House what is called a Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill and it has often been requested that, at some time or other, something in the nature of a permanent Defence Forces Bill should be put through the House and made part of the Acts of the Parliament of this country.  We have just listened to the Leader of the Opposition approaching this particular Bill to-day from a rather extraordinary point of view and I find it very difficult to follow his approach.  On the one hand, he takes the responsibility for assuring us that, so far as he knows, this country never will be confronted with any form of aggression from outside and that, consequently, we do not require an Army or Army equipment.  He relates that view to the fact that we escaped being drawn into the recent war through Providence looking over us&mdash;neglecting to say, however, that there was a certain direction by those in power which helped us also to stay out of this particular war.  He says we do not need to take any consideration at all of the future as far as an Army of this State is concerned.  Any person taking the most elementary view of government in any country must recognise that an army is required based on what the nation can provide and maintain and on what is reasonable in all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy further confused the issue by stating that the introduction of a certain number of new officers is related to getting rid of some other officers in an unfair manner.  Surely he knows that individuals get on in years, get older, even if new scientific developments do not make those people less effective than they were before such developments came into being.  If the Deputy had said that the method of pensioning officers or men who have served this State is, in his opinion, a niggardly approach to what they deserve, I would say he would find general consent in all parts of the House.  However, it is entirely wrong to say that the putting of those men on pension is unfair.  I suggest that, when the Estimates come before us, we can discuss many other items and some of us on this side of the House will <Col N="2164" /> have a variety of criticism to offer.  If we could induce the Minister for Defence to be a little bit more defensive towards the Minister for Finance and try to secure for his Army and for the pensioners of his Army, both men and officers, a better standard of recognition, we would be doing something that would be found agreeable to all people, including the members of the Army.</P>
    <P>I do not know where Deputy Mulcahy gets the idea that, because certain equipment is now antiquated and outdated and there is such a rapid development in the creation of new forms of war materials, we should not equip ourselves with any kind of material at all.  In our lifetime, this country has had the experience of men fighting for this nation's freedom almost with their bare hands and with small arms only, against what was then the most up-to-date and most scientific material that a big nation could bring into play.  The spirit of the people, as exemplified by the men who struggled for this country's freedom, showed that it is not only implements of war that count.  You have the men, the material; you have the spiritual approach to a thing.  Deputy Mulcahy talks as if this country should wait until the atom bomb has been perfected and we will get our share of the atom bombs for our defence from the big nations that will be producing them.</P>
    <P>My approach in this matter is that I welcome this new development on the part of the Minister for Defence. I would like to see the cream of our manhood given an opportunity of being brought into the nation's Army and that it will have a place to play in warfare and also in peace time.  You need an Army in a country not only to defend the country against an outside force, but to defend the people against any body that might rise up without the authority of the people to try to take over control of the country.  You would then see how quickly an Army could be formed, as it were, from nowhere if there was not already an Army serving the nation, irrespective of whatever Party might be in office. But they must be trained.  We have <Col N="2165" /> an opportunity now of getting young men in peace time into an Army where they can make a career for themselves. I would like to see, in connection with that matter, that they would be given a reasonable standard of living through whatever payment would be made to them, that they would have a reasonable prospect of not having to worry when the age for retiring would come round.</P>
    <P>I have heard talk of equipment and I would suggest to the Minister that, besides equipment, he should consider accommodation for the men.  I think the time has come when we should try to get rid of the barracks that we have inherited from another power.  These are situated all over the country and we should get rid of them.  We should build for our officers and soldiers accommodation more suitable to their better well-being.  That could be called an expenditure and it could be regarded as not quite equipment.</P>
    <P>As regards the defence of this country and our defence forces, I think we are now reaching the stage when the matter should be examined from the point of view of creating something&mdash;it could be designed by the experts who have had experience of the past and have knowledge of what is happening in other places&mdash;so that this nation can be given an opportunity of placing its Army on a permanent basis and so that those who will go into it will know to what end their careers will bring them and what safety they will have in their later years.  If that is done, we shall not have to discuss this thing year after year on the basis that we cannot do this and we cannot do that because we have only a temporary measure.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House very much longer, because there will be an opportunity of discussing the Army generally on the Estimate.  We can then discuss administration.  There is, however, one suggestion I would like to make to the Minister.  I think the difference which is developing between the officers and the men, from a social point of view, is due to the great difference in the uniforms they wear.  When he is considering equipment, both for warfare and for drilling, he ought to remember <Col N="2166" /> that the men who join our Army should not be paraded along the streets as if they were second-rate citizens, when compared from the point of view of dress with the officers.  While it is necessary to have discipline and some distinction on parade in the barracks or outside, this difference of social caste which is now developing should be stopped for all time.</P>
    <P>I welcome this new departure.  I think the House will appreciate that it is not a case of getting rid of servants of the State, men who have served it loyally and well.  While many of us might disagree with the things they do or the ideas they may hold, from the point of view of loyalty to the State there can be no question attaching to these people.  This Bill should not be approached from the aspect that this is inducting 600 new officers purely for the purpose of getting rid of older officers who have served the State well.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if he could not, in bringing about the retirement of older officers, see that something better might be done for them in the shape of pensions and that this niggardly business of cutting down pennies and halfpennies from men prepared to give a life-time in the service of the State, and even to give their lives if necessary when the State is in danger, should be stopped once and for all. Let us see that these people are properly taken care of financially while serving and when they have finished serving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House approaches the consideration of this Bill under a very great disadvantage, inasmuch as the Minister did not consider it wise to give the House any information as to the future policy of the Government in regard to defence.  This House is a deliberative Assembly.  We are all anxious to co-operate in formulating the best possible laws for the State and putting forward the most constructive suggestions of which we may be capable for the assistance of the Government and to ensure that our legislation shall be of the best possible kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are presented with a Bill <Col N="2167" /> which purports to continue our defence regulations for another year and we are not informed why we should pass this measure or what is the nature of the defensive proposals which will be submitted to us during the coming year.  We have been informed that it is the intention of the Government to increase the Army from 5,000 or 6,000, as the numbers were in pre-war days, to 12,000.  We are entitled to have from the Minister a clear statement of the reasons that influenced him in coming to the decision that an Army of 12,000 is desirable.  We are entitled to have an explanation of the line of thought which led him to the conclusion that an Army of that strength is essential or desirable.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies might consider that a bigger Army is desirable and other Deputies might think that a smaller Army would be sufficient.  The Minister has not given the House any guidance as to how we are to decide the question.  He has associated with him the experts of our Defence Forces and I have no doubt he has discussed with them proposals for the future defence of our country.  I think that Deputies, regardless of Party, will approach this question with due humility, having regard to the extraordinary changes which have taken place in defensive and offensive equipment during the past few years.</P>
    <P>It is very hard for anyone to lay down a definite law as to what is best for our defence requirements and we are entitled to some guidance and assistance from the Minister who has been appointed to look after the country's defence.  If, as somebody suggested, the consideration that influenced the Minister to increase the Army to such a degree above its pre-war strength was to relieve unemployment, I think that might be ruled out right away as being absurd, because there is definitely no more expensive method by which one can seek to relieve unemployment than by drafting men into an army.  It is expensive particularly when we consider how much useful work could be done by these men, if directed into industrial, agricultural <Col N="2168" /> or other employment.  It is worthy of note that one of the ablest officers in the Army was recently appointed to the control of one of our biggest industrial concerns.  That would seem to indicate that he at least believed he could serve his country better by strengthening our economic fabric, by making the country more productive, and I am inclined to think that unless the Minister can advance stronger arguments than he advanced when introducing the Bill, it is by strengthening the economic position of the country that we can put ourselves in a better position to defend this nation from outside aggression.  A small efficient Army will be necessary as a basis on which to build and expand our Defence Forces, if any emergency arises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe controverted the assertion of Deputy Mulcahy that this country is in no danger from outside aggression at the moment.  I do not propose to decide as between these able military strategists, but I think it was unfair on the part of Deputy Briscoe to assert that our safety during the period of emergency was due to a certain extent to the direction of our military forces, without pointing out at the same time that that direction was afforded not by the Government Party alone, but by all Parties, and that all Parties co-operated during the emergency in the defence of this country. He possibly overlooked that particular aspect.  Since all Parties co-operated so well during the emergency, it would be desirable, in view of the very uncertain present and the perhaps more uncertain future, if there were co-operation between all Parties with regard to the defence of the country, and if our Army were not made the plaything of Party politics.  We are too small a nation to indulge in the pastime of making the defence of this country a Party matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but I think that the Deputy should not have <Col N="2169" /> omitted the fact that the Government had the co-operation of all Parties, in making that reference.  If the Government wish to secure the co-operation of all Parties, they ought now in this House, because this is the place in which the matter should be dealt with, to take all Parties into their confidence and the Minister should say how he arrived at the figure of 12,000 men as being the number required for our Army in the future.  If he has strong reasons for fixing the strength of the Army at that figure, it is most desirable, in the interests not only of the country but of the Army, that he should give these reasons, because if he has arrived at the decision in a haphazard way, the future of every young man joining the Army to-day is very precarious.</P>
      <P>If we can all agree that an Army of the strength he has outlined is desirable and necessary, and if there are strong reasons for maintaining the Army at that strength, we can build on that basis a permanent Army in which every young man can look forward to a fairly secure future; but if we are simply to have a position in which the Minister says: &ldquo;I have decided on an Army of 12,000 men.  I do not intend to justify that decision. I have 77 Deputies behind me to support me and I do not propose to go any further,&rdquo; there will be very great uncertainty and that will not make for the efficiency or general welfare of the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think everyone will agree that it will be a rather difficult matter to secure the number of men, 12,000, he seeks to secure for our Defence Forces. This is due to a variety of causes, one of which is that there are opportunities to emigrate and to join the armies of other nations, and young men of adventurous spirit who are the best types for any army are inclined to seek wider fields than are available here.  If we propose to build an Army of the strength outlined, it would be very expensive, because, as it is to be on a voluntary basis, it will be necessary to raise the standard of remuneration, of living conditions and of other circumstances connected with the Army to even a higher level than prevails in <Col N="2170" /> other countries, because other armies, offer a wider field for adventure and for seeing the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe advanced one very extraordinary reason for our maintaining a large standing Army.  He said it might not be necessary for defence against external enemies but it might be necessary for internal defence against any force which might rise up here to overthrow the Government of the State.  I cannot tell, or attempt to forecast, what section of the community Deputy Briscoe fears may rise up against the Government of the Irish Republic here.</P>

      <P>It is rather a poor future to offer to the young men of this country to suggest that they are going to be drawn into the Army to serve political purposes.  There is at present no section of the community in Ireland disloyal to this State.  There is no political Party which does not recognise and accept the Constitution under which we live.  There is not the slightest danger that any section is going to rise up to overthrow the constitutionally-elected Government of this State as long as it governs according to the Constitution.  The idea of building up a huge Army should be abandoned, as well as the idea of having an auxiliary police force.  That would be distasteful, not only to Deputies but to the young men being asked to join the Army.  We should appeal to the best of our manhood to come into the Army.  We should offer them good prospects in the Army and security of employment in the Defence Forces.  But we should be absolutely sure, before we invite men into the Army, that we are not going in one or two years' time to cut it down drastically again, and to throw them out into other occupations for which they would not be altogether fitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one section in the Bill to which I wish to refer briefly, the section which enables the Minister to impose penalties on men who left the Army during the emergency.  These penalties are not of a military kind. They are not imposed by the military authorities, but are to be enforced by local authorities, and by ordinary business concerns which are under the control of the Government.  It is undesirable that brave men&mdash;because men of this type were brave&mdash;owing to the fact that they violated the military code by joining other military forces in a time of war, and even faced death, should be treated in that way.  They should be treated as brave men, and in a dignified way, and the penalties should be imposed by the Army with which they were associated.  They should be tried, if trial is necessary, by the Army and under the military code. That is all brave men would ask.  Instead <Col N="2172" /> of that, we have these men being victimised in every way, not for one or for two years, but for a period of seven years.  In this connection, the Minister dwelt on the fact that the section might not affect very many men.  He made the point that it might not affect any of the men on the ground that many of them, on the transfer of their services to another Army, would be rewarded by those who sympathised with the nations which they served.</P>
    <P>Even if we take that view, is it desirable that men should be sent out of this country with a sense of grievance, of whom it could be stated that their own Government, as far as it was in their power, refused to give them any employment and was prepared to starve them?  That would not be a desirable situation, and was not one that would make for better relations between this country and other countries.  It is not justice. There is another aspect of the question to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  It is possible that a man affected by this section might come back to this country and find suitable employment in an industrial or commercial concern which would not be financed by the State.  It could happen, however, that after two or three years that firm might be taken over by some larger firm which was controlled by the State.  Such a man would then find himself in the position of being thrown out and would lose secure employment because of the operation of this unjust section.  That is a petty and rather spiteful way of dealing with the matter.  I think it unworthy of any Minister for Defence, unworthy of this House, and unworthy of any army.  We want our Army to be looked up to as a dignified Army, as an Army of brave men, as an Army that treats its soldiers with respect, and as one that treats them severely if they deserve it, but not as an Army of old women, spiteful and mean.  We want it to be an Army of soldiers worthy of our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This annual Bill provides an occasion for reviewing Army policy as distinct from the type of debate appropriate to the main Estimate. When we hear that we are supposed to <Col N="2173" /> maintain a larger standing Army postwar, than we had pre-war, it seems to be contrary to common-sense.  Before the discovery of atomic energy and its application as an instrument of war, the old classical theory of war, propounded by Von Clauswitz remained true, that the conclusive element in war was not the capture of territory, not the winning of battles, but the destruction of the enemy's army. Therefore, every State, large and small, was tempted in time of danger to draft as large a section of the population as it could afford into the armed forces, so that it would have the largest possible reserves of armed men to resist the attempt of any foreign enemy to destroy its army. But can anyone, student of military affairs or layman, doubt that the development of atomic energy as an instrument of war has completely destroyed that conception?  If it be true, and it now seems to be substantially true, that a small atomic missile hurled on a considerable city can completely destroy it, can we doubt that, with the passage of very few years, larger and larger atomic bombs of that character will be evolved and the devastation of which they will be capable baffles human imagination? In that situation, were we unhappily to become involved in war, who can contemplate a Government of this country maintaining a belligerent position while area after area of the country was reduced to complete desolation by the impact of atomic bombs, when we had nothing whatever at our disposal which would enable us to prevent the national enemy from dropping these upon our territory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody in this House imagines that the resources of this country will permit of building up an air fleet sufficiently formidable to repel the attack of any Power whom we can think of as a potential aggressor against this country because, to build up an air fleet, we must not only build it up in the first instance, but we must keep it up to date, and it is common knowledge that the aeroplanes purchased to-day are obsolete before their date of delivery.  Does anyone suggest here that the finances of this country will extend to equipping and maintaining <Col N="2174" /> an air force which will effectively resist a determined attempt by any potential aggressor to devastate the territory of this country with atomic energy?  Does any responsible Deputy imagine that were an aggressor so to assail us, a Government truly representative of our people and conscious of the responsibility of trusteeship could or should maintain such a position of belligerency as would justify the retention in the field of an army while the whole country and the population were being extinguished by the use of atomic energy against them?  If that plain fact is faced&mdash;and we have a duty in this House to face facts&mdash;I think it becomes abundantly clear that the proposal greatly to enlarge the standing Army which, in the nature of our resources must be primarily an infantry Army, with whatever artillery resources we can afford to place at its disposal, is the merest self-delusion and foolish extravagance.  If it were only that, it would be bad enough, but it is more than that: It is the creation of a situation in which those who serve in our Army must for ever be underpaid because we cannot afford to pay a large Army wages which are comparable with the wages that might be carned in other callings in life if those who join the Army engaged in other activities.  Far then from ambitioning the maintenance of a larger Army than this Bill envisages, I should like to see our Army very substantially reduced and the conditions under which the men serve revoluted.</P>
    <P>When we come to ask ourselves if sustained participation in international war is excluded virtually from the functions our Army would be called upon to discharge, what then is it meant to do?  I feel bound in passing to say that matters of this kind could be and should be discussed without acrimony.  If any Deputy now or hereafter, by implication or interjection, suggests that the late General O'Duffy or any of the distinguished public servants with whom I had the honour to be associated for so long, ever contemplated the overthrow of the legitimate Government of this country by force, he will receive from me such an answer as will shut his mouth effectively <Col N="2175" /> and I will have little respect for his more delicate feelings.</P>

      <P>If anyone wants to re-open it, and I am present, I will be very glad to re-open it, on any terms they desire to re-open it.  Now let us examine what function an Army of our country may properly be designed to discharge.  The legitimate Government of this country is entitled to the obedience of all its citizens.  There will on occasions be individuals or groups of individuals who for one reason or another conceive themselves justified in eschewing constitutional methods for the redress of their grievances and resorting to violence.  The first sanction that would ordinarily be invoked by a democratic Government such as ours is are the police forces of the State, and I believe in this country in 100 per cent. of cases, in the times that lie ahead, that force will be more than competent to deal with any crucial situation that may arise.  But the very essence of <Col N="2176" /> effective government is that all parties in the State should have fixed notice that in the last analysis, if they choose to evoke it, the Government commands a greater force than any other combination in the State, and that in the last analysis they will use it, and that to resist it is hopeless from the beginning because, if such a position does not exist, and if there is not standing notice to all elements in the community that that is so, and irresistible and constant evidence that that is so, there is a standing temptation to irresponsible people, very often young, ardent and enthusiastic people, to launch themselves into movements which bring them into conflict with the central authority, in the vague kind of hope that there is an off-chance that they may pull it off and that what would be called treason, had it failed, will be known to posterity as revolution in its success.  Thus, for the protection sometimes of the very best elements in the community&mdash;those most ardent, those most easily moved by specious appeal&mdash; the Government must maintain a force which by its character is standing warning to all reasonable men that they have nothing to hope from a challenge to the legitimate Government, freely elected by the people in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that be the prime function of our Army, it is the duty of this Legislature to realise that it is not a function that can be discharged by everybody because it may involve tedium, it may involve a standing temptation to allow standards of conduct and discipline, without which no army can survive, to deteriorate.  Therefore, you have to realise that you are asking of men the discharge of an extremely exacting duty, the maintenance of morale and discipline over protracted periods when intervention or positive action by them is not called for, and when the ideal you aim at is that their very bearing and reputation will be sufficiently <i>in terrorem</i> to prevent the very event which might evoke their action.  The more efficient they are, the more impressive they are, and the more effectively they do their job, the better guarantee it is that positive action by them will never be called for.  Anyone who has had any experience of foreign countries will know how readily that <Col N="2177" /> condition tends either to a rapid disintegration of the army itself or to the fostering of unhealthy cabals within the army concerned for matters with which they were never intended to deal.  I therefore suggest that, far from increasing our Army, we ought to make up our minds that we are going to have a skeleton Army, every individual in which would, in the time of emergency, if it became necessary to expand the Army, be capable of stepping up several ranks and accepting the responsibilities of a much higher rank than that which he normally holds, and constitute in himself part of a framework on which the larger force which an emergency might render desirable could be built around.</P>
    <P>I think that in the early stages of our Army we had what was called the first battalion, and it was the pride of our Army that that first battalion accepted as part of its duty a somewhat higher standard of discipline, morale and conduct generally than were considered indispensable for the Army as a whole.  Not without justice, we were able to think of our first battalion as something which, with the passage of time, could be compared with the Guards' Brigade of the British Army, or with the crack regiment of any army in the world.  That was a high ambition for a young country with a new Army which had its own traditions to build.  For various reasons, into which it is unnecessary to go, at a certain point our Army policy turned away from that, and the first battalion was scattered over the rest of the Army, and that <i>esprit de corps</i> and cohesion were squandered for the purpose of some consideration which then appeared to the authorities to be adequate value for that with which we were parting.</P>
    <P>I should like to see an Irish Army which was small and inspired with exactly the same spirit and amibition that the First Battalion had during its halcyon years.  I should like to see men joining the Army feeling that they were not entering employment analogous to that of a common labourer, but that those who joined the ranks were entering an honourable trade in which, in the course of time, they might expect to graduate to a standard of decent <Col N="2178" /> comfort such as might be enjoyed by a skilled artisan in any craft in the country.  I cannot see how we can hope to maintain the kind of Army we should have in this country unless, by offering the men who join it in peace times conditions of that character, we can draw into its ranks persons of the type who would, but for the fact that they joined the Army, have become the skilled craftsmen of our trades.  Until we can create for the Army an atmosphere in which those who wear the ranker's uniform will be recognised by the community as having a social standing equal to that of any highly skilled craftsman, we cannot hope to get the class of men into the Army in peace time and on a permanent basis who would be suitable material for the creation of the morale and character which I feel should be the hallmark of an Irish soldier.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if we are to achieve these things, we must have officers who will be capable of appreciating the kind of thing we want, and competent to give effect to the ideal which the Minister will set before them.  Whereupon, you are merely brought up against this problem.  If a young man enters our Army now his prospects of a future are virtually nil.  We have had that problem up before.  When the Army was established here in the early days, large numbers of the officers were young men-generals were men in their forties, colonels were men in their thirties&mdash;with the result that, for the ensuing 30 years, you had men who graduated to the rank of captain and who recognised that, for the remainder of their service in the Army, there was no prospect whatever of their ever securing substantive rank materially higher than that.  How can you hope to get into the service of the forces of the State the kind of men we must have if the Army is to be the sort of Army this country can be proud of, if we fix them with notice on the day they enter the service that they can never hope to get from that service anything like adequate remuneration for the talents that they are expected to employ; that the highest aspiration they can have is to get out on pension in time to enable them to acquire from some commercial <Col N="2179" /> enterprise the reward and preferment that it should have been the privilege of the Army and the State to give them?  Therefore, I would bespeak for the officers of our Army a prospect equal to that which they would enjoy had they entered any of the professions in the State.  Unless we do provide it, the professions will get the cream of the men and the Army will get the lees, because, if my thesis be true that the prospect of the normal possibility of active engagement in war is virtually removed by the development of modern science, we have withdrawn from the attraction of the Army career that appeal of excitement and valour which in past centuries drew into the ranks of every army a certain body of men, indifferent in greater or lesser degree to the material reward that their labours would command, but irresistibly drawn to the adventure and to the dangers that military life might be expected to connote.</P>
    <P>If, then, we can get by reasonable treatment the right men we ought to face this fact that, in the event of war, the only basis upon which such an enterprise could be contemplated by a responsible Government in this country would be by means of an alliance with some Power that would be in a position to furnish our forces throughout the duration of war with the materials wherewith to fight.  We have not got them, we cannot make them and we must be for ever depending on external sources of supply.  No army, however valiant, can fight without weapons, and no war can be long prosecuted without a virtually complete replacement of the equipment with which the battle was begun.  If, then, it is true that participation in warlike activity can only be contemplated in alliance with a State from which warlike stores would be available for the duration of the encounter, I think we are bound to face the obligation that is imposed upon us of ensuring that the officers of our Army will be capable of co-ordinating their efforts with those of whatever the inevitable ally must be.  That involves having in contemplation the establishment of a staff college in this country.  Otherwise we are simply not facing what the responsibilities <Col N="2180" /> of creating a real army are.  You cannot create a staff college out of nothing; you must have men competent to run it and teachers competent to give instruction in it.  The only way that these men can acquire that competence is by experience of strategy and tactics in battle, or by contact with those who have had that experience and who are in a position to impart it to those who come after them.</P>
    <P>It is manifest that our Army has not had any experience in the practice of modern war.  The mechanisation of armies, I should imagine, has completely changed the whole staff picture of armies and, therefore, the sooner we make up our minds to avail of the services of the staff college of some other country where our officers may go to acquire the highly specialised knowledge requisite effectively to officer our Army the better it will be. We can choose the British Staff College or we can choose the Staff College of the United States of America.  I am not sufficient of an expert on these matters to know whether it would be practicable to avail of the hospitality of both, or whether that would merely create confusion.  I am not at all sure that it might not be a good thing if it were practicable, from the technical point of view, that half the officers should be officer trained in the Staff College of Great Britain, and that half should be trained in the Staff College of the United States of America.  Ultimately, our aim should be to establish a staff college of our own.  I cannot doubt, however, that even if we had arrived at the stage when it would be useful and practicable to do that, that it would be a good thing to maintain contact with the staff colleges of each or both of the countries I have mentioned, so that in the event of our being engaged in belligerent activities our efforts could be effectively co-ordinated with whatever ally stood at our side: so that we would have at our side modern information and experience on which to draw for the instruction and training of our own troops.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a very much more rational policy than the policy of building up a far larger Army than we <Col N="2181" /> have at present and burdening the community with the expenses thereof&mdash;and that is not all&mdash;but of drawing a large body of unskilled men into the extremely difficult life of a peace-time Army.  It is only a man of considerable character, it is only a man who has intelligence to appreciate that those who stand by can also serve, and who realises that his everyday exertions are making him a better public servant than he was, who can, without serious moral danger to himself, remain a rank and file soldier in a peace-time Army over a protracted period when there are no moral duties of policing the world such as would accrue to the Army of an Imperial Power like England, or a great Continental Power such as the United States of America, or the great Powers, if you like, of France, or Germany that was.  I think we have got to face the fact that the real effective belligerent instrument of the future will be the aeroplane.  This country can never provide them, and, therefore, what is the use of blinding ourselves to that fact?  Were we to marshal the whole of the revenues of the State we could not maintain an effective Air Force in perpetuity in this country, and if we cannot maintain a good one then we should not mantain any one at all.  It might be necessary to have some token force, but it should be recognised as a token force.  There should be no pretence made to our own people, and no foolish posturings to foreign countries, that we looked upon it as anything other than a token force intended for no purpose other than the flying of the Flag.  There is, however, a real service, an honourable service, and an indispensable work awaiting the right kind of Army.  It will largely depend on what we will do here: as to whether we get the kind of Army which will be a credit to us and into which every parent in the country will see his son go in confidence: that his son will be leading a useful life in surroundings which will not be a standing menace not only to his morals but to his morale as well.</P>
    <P>I might be charged with daydreaming in aspiring to so high a standard for the Irish Army of the future if I were not in a position to look back on the reputation that the <Col N="2182" /> First Battalion built up for this country and, indeed, abroad, in the first years of the existence of this State, because it is something to be proud of that a non-commissioned officer of that First Battalion could walk into any regiment of the British Army and they would be glad to have him; and it must be remembered that the British Army have had a long experience of armies, and that they do not lightly grab at non-commissioned ranks, who might prove to be bad soldiers.  That was a tribute to the old First Battalion.  Now, I should like to see our Army built up on those lines, but built up under conditions in which the British Army would not be in a position to out-bid us for the services of our men.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points of a Committee character that might be raised now or on the Committee Stage, but I think that Deputy Cogan, with great moderation and reasonableness, has put forward a view that the Minister ought carefully to consider.  I do not think that anybody, anywhere, at any time, suffers seriously through showing magnanimity.  Now, a number of young men in this country entered the Army in the first flush of enthusiasm, when they were warned that this country was in danger.  We all know that the country was then in danger.  We all know that in those days we did believe that there was very real danger of this country being invaded by forces armed with armaments which we could not dream of commanding, and we knew that it would be the hateful duty of the leaders of our Army to sent into battle men whom they knew to be inadequately equipped and who would have to stand, comparatively unarmed, against a formidable continental army. Yet these young men came and joined our Army.  They came into the Army at that time, not for pay, not for a job, but, firstly, because they thought it was a kind of a national duty&mdash;and in that they were right&mdash;and, secondly, because, being young and ardent, they longed for adventure and for participation in something that was almost cosmic; the battles that were proceeding in the world at the time.  Things so transpired in this country that we were never called upon to fight, and there is no doubt that a great many of <Col N="2183" /> these young men, who wanted to take part in these cosmic battles, felt that they would be more at home fighting on the side of a system of government that was more analogous to our own system of government than with the system of government with which the others were embroiled.  It was not to avoid any of the obligations that they had undertaken here that they left our Army and joined another army.  I venture to swear that the vast bulk of them, if they thought of these things at all, felt that in going to fight where they were going to fight, they were doing a man's part, not only in the defence of this country, but in preventing the tide of war from flowing to this country.  In that, they may have been right or they may have been wrong; I shall not enter into that.  I do not deny that in a time of danger you have got to mark down mutiny or anarchy; that it does not matter under what circumstances a soldier allows himself to be led into a mutinous act, before extending the quality of mercy his act must be marked, recognised and arraigned as mutiny, because, if it is not, no army could maintain its discipline. Similarly, I agree that if a man, acquainted with military law, knows what desertion means, and knows that it must be put upon the record that what he did was desertion in a time of danger, he must suffer the appropriate penalty.  Having established that fact, however, surely our Army and this State are now in a position which enables them to display magnanimity to those who have been convicted of what might be called technical desertion.  There is no more tragic sign of weakness in authority than the authority which is afraid to reprieve.  Woe betide the Government which finds itself in the position that they must say: &ldquo;We would like to mitigate that penalty, but we dare not do so, because to do so would let loose the flood.&rdquo;  Far better would it be for a Government to impose the ultimate penalty than that the day should come when they are no longer strong enough or secure enough to do justice without regard to how it may look to those who wish the Government ill. When that occurs, it means that the <Col N="2184" /> Government has become so weak that it can no longer survive, and the Government that we have here now is in that position.</P>
    <P>We are faced with no danger at the moment that there will be such widespread desertion as would shake the foundations of the State or of the Army itself.  Why, then, should such men be found guilty of desertion in the sense which the ordinary soldier understands? Who ever heard of desertion in order to fight?  Who ever heard of desertion in order to get into the battlefield?  When the penalties and sanctions for that crime were devised; when those who wrote the Military Code drafted the section to deal with deserters, they thought of men who had promised to hold the fort; they thought of men upon whom their comrades were depending for their lives&mdash;men who had left their posts and who had thrown into jeopardy the lives of their faithful comrades.  Are men of that character to be compared with these so-called Irish deserters whose reason for desertion was to leave neutrality in order to engage in war?  Looking at it purely from the military or from the soldier's point of view, is there anything shameful or dishonourable, or anything that involves discredit to the Army which they have left or the uniform which they formerly wore, in that they deserted because they were too avid, too anxious, to engage in conflict, too imprudently impetuous, if you like, to be about the business for which they originally joined the Army?  Is it unduly generous thus to interpret the action of men who left our Army in order to enrol in the forces of the British Crown?  There may be mean, narrow-minded little men who, because they chose that service, will desire to asperse their motives, but honourable men, broadminded men, reasonable men will know what sent them on their way.  Is it becoming, now that the captains and the kings are gone, now that the shouting and the tumult has died down, to follow them vindictively with Section 13 of this Bill?  Look at the number of the section.  Thirteen. It is unlucky.  There are many public buildings in which there are no rooms number 13; it is thought to be unlucky. <Col N="2185" /> Let superstition, for once, affect the mind of legislators in this House.  Let them frame a Bill with no Section 13. Nobody will miss it.  No vital interest of this community will be injured by its omission.  It will be a monument to magnanimity and an instrument, I dare to forecast, in healing past injuries and removing many misunderstandings. The omission of this clause might make it a very lucky Bill.</P>

      <P>The keynote of the speeches this evening from the Opposition Benches is, to my mind, a spirit of undisguised fatalism.  Keep, if you like, a skeleton or a token Army, and throw yourselves, in case of sudden emergency, on the tender mercies of a merciless world.  Evidently, the advent of the atomic bomb is to terrorise and stupefy us, to make us unconscious and unmindful of our duty to defend the State and support its institutions should the call come to that service.  The development of atomic energy and the desperate weapons of to-day are held up to us as a reason why we should not keep an Army of a certain reasonable strength, but those who so advise should remember that weapons just as mighty and as terrifying were devised through the hundreds of years that have passed.  Yet, mighty nations and military despots and avaricious empires have not crushed the small nations of this earth. That was because they stood on their own legs, had men who were willing to fight and women who were prepared to stand behind them.  Their spirit was indestructible.  That is the spirit that will make this nation survive through the years to come, under Providence, just as it did in the past. We were told in the past that, before we could be invaded, those who wished to attack us would have to pass through the navies of two great nations.  On the one hand, they tell us of the development of present-day armament and equipment.  On the other hand, they tell us of the mighty navies on the sea, but they did not point out how those armies might come in hundreds or thousands from the skies.  If we had sufficient force available, we could deal with them, and <Col N="2186" /> deal with them pretty rapidly, as was done in the lifetime of all of us after another great war in the past, when not only the regular armies, but Black and Tans and Auxiliaries, and all the rest, were let loose to bomb our cities, to pull people from their beds and try to destroy and brow-beat the spirit of this nation.</P>
      <P>What is the use of talking about leaving it to other nations of the world to defend us?  Such military alliances will not be for our defence but will bring us into their wars and disputes for the purpose of their aggrandisement.  We are told to be merciful to those who leave our Army and join the Army of another nation.  What return did those who did so get from the nation for which they risked their lives?  When they were finished with them, they threw them back to us.  These people have to take the risks of their own deeds and put up with them.  Surely those who stood by us should have first consideration.  Let the others take the risks which they foresaw when they were joining.  Let them depend on the nation for which they were prepared to make sacrifices.  Nobody is going to be vindictive towards them.  Let them take their chance here.</P>
      <P>The Minister and those advising him in this matter have the best interests of the country at heart.  It would be well for some of the amateur tacticians of this House to leave the question of tactics to the Army and the question of the need of military defences to those who are in charge of the Government of the country.  I, for one, have confidence in them.  I have confidence in this little nation.  I hope to see it survive through all the world's troubles, just as many other small nations have survived.  Having a certain vital strength, behind which the forces of the nation may rally, we shall pass through the future, with God's help, with the same spirit and the same unfailing courage as our people did through all the generations that have passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies who have spoken, I am staggered at the prospect of an Army of approximately 12,000 men, and not only by the size of the Army but by the cost of its <Col N="2187" /> maintenance, having regard to our present high rate of expenditure.  No one in this House would suggest for one moment that we should reduce our Army to a mere token, but it is an entirely different matter when we propose to keep an Army in this country two and a half times larger than that which we had pre-war.  Without attempting in any way to prophesy or even give an opinion as to what may be the future condition of the world, it would be reasonable to expect that the Army in this country might be reduced at the end of five years of an emergency period.  During that period, efforts were made to increase and to keep at peak point the strength of that Army. It is reasonable, now, I think, when with one possible exception, all the armies of the world are being drastically reduced, to expect some reduction in this Army of ours.</P>
      <P>Leaving that angle entirely out of consideration, I wonder do Deputies realise that during the five years' emergency over seven thousand men deserted this Army&mdash;that very nearly a quarter of the total strength deserted. Again leaving out of consideration the attraction which a fighting force offered to young men who found themselves in an Army that over a number of years had not been in action, I think it reasonable to assume that most of them left the Army because they looked for and got better conditions elsewhere. I do not think that we can blame ourselves because we were not in a position to give them similar conditions here.  This is a small country with slender resources, but I entirely agree with the view that whatever may be the size of the Army maintained in this country, it should be maintained in a good condition and that the conditions of service should be such as would warrant young men of spirit remaining in it.  If in future we are to expect a rate of desertion comparable to that which took place during the emergency, we can assume that after four or five years the Army of twelve thousand will be reduced by two thousand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this matter, I think we should consider seriously the burden <Col N="2188" /> placed on this country under the stress of an emergency in which everyone was resolved to bear his share as patiently as possible so that as strong a defence force could be maintained here as our resources would allow.  But when we realise that last year the total Army Estimate presented to this House was £8,900,000 odd, I think Deputies will have seriously to consider, if we are to go on talking in terms of millions to support an Army in peace time, how we are going to get the revenue to deal with the various productive works which I need not enumerate but which everybody realises must be undertaken and at the same time reduce taxation.  I think that whatever the defence policy in this country is, we should have had a better statement than that merely outlined in the White Paper and in the Minister's remarks.</P>
    <P>Coming to the end of the emergency period, we find ourselves with an Army far in excess of that which we had before the emergency, and we find further that demobilisation is slower than was anticipated.  When one finds that the vast bulk of those who are being demobilised are migrating, because no work is available for them here, when one finds that the Government want to expand our Army to two and a half times its pre-war strength and to fit into that Army a vast number of recruits, officers and men, I think it is pertinent to inquire as to the future policy in regard to recruitment and the type of training which it is proposed to give the Army personnel.</P>
    <P>Without in any way wishing to interfere with the normal training which soldiers get, and which it is to be expected they will get in the future, I think the Army authorities will have to consider the question of providing courses of technical instruction for Army personnel over and above that required for military purposes, so as to ensure that when men leave the Army they will be equipped with knowledge and experience which will enable them to secure employment elsewhere.  At the moment men who leave our Army and join the British Army are highly skilled, so far as military training goes.  In fact they are <Col N="2189" /> so well trained that the vast majority of them become N.C.O.s certainly within six months.  I think that is a tribute not alone to the men themselves but to their instructors.  I think, however, something further than Army training must be provided if employment is to be available to these men when they leave the Army.  That is one aspect of Army policy regarding the training of personnel with which the Army authorities might concern themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on the many aspects of Army policy which have been already dealt with, but I should like for a moment to refer to the terms of Section 13.  I think that Section 13 is too drastic.  I do not suggest that these people should receive the same consideration as Army personnel who served for the entire period of the emergency.  It is regrettable that many of them deserted, and it is regrettable, from whatever cause, that we should have to enact punitive measures here, but I think the measures are too stringent and too severe on these people.  It would be unfair, I think, to attribute ulterior motives to men who left.</P>
    <P>I think that the majority left because of economic circumstances, but from whatever cause they left, it is unfair, I suggest, that they should be penalised so severely as Section 13 proposes. I understand that no such punitive measures are contained in legislation elsewhere.  Although I understand it is proposed in the near future to enact legislation to deal with deserters, I think that very few of these deserters will return here, but even if the entire number did return a less severe form of punishment would be ample.  One obvious way to deal with them is to give preference exclusively to men who have full service or who would have completed their service, if they had not been demobilised for health reasons.</P>
    <P>In regard to the board set up to recruit officers, it is significant that the re-enlistment has not come up to expectations.  I would like the Minister to outline the qualifications required of officers applying before that board and the qualifications deemed necessary <Col N="2190" /> before they were regarded as suitable for recruitment to the permanent force.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with one aspect of Section 9, amending Section 57 of the No. 2 Act of 1940, the section which governs resettlement, or the right of a man to get his employment on leaving military service.  There have been no complaints to me as, in the main, employers are taking back those employees who were in the forces during the emergency.  While that obtains, however, there is something else keeping men out of employment, and I would like the trade union leaders in this House to take a note of it.  Men have gone back to their employers and the employers have told them they would be given back their jobs.  The trade unions, however, have refused cards and the men have been penalised.  I have cited one case to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, where a man left his employment to join the Army and had actually paid a sum of money in excess of his ordinary contributions.  When he came back, after five and a half years' service, the union refused to give him a card to go back to his old job.</P>

      <P>I know another case of a particular union in which Deputy Everett is interested.  That is why I would like the trade union leaders in the House to take note of it.  I was informed by the general secretary that the branches had autonomy in these questions; in other words, they could decide these questions on their own. I think the trade unions should review the whole position of giving men who served throughout the emergency the right to go back to their work.  There are some aspects I cannot touch upon now.  I know there is the right of permanent employment and also what may be called quasi-permanent employment, and that is where the real crux arises.  While the employer is prepared to take the man back, the union will not give him his cards, though it gives cards to men who have been working in England during the emergency and <Col N="2191" /> who probably have kept their cards clear while they were in England or possibly were members of an amalgamated union with a branch here.  That is a very serious aspect of the resettlement of our demobilised men and I would ask the Minister seriously to consider bringing in, on the Committee Stage, an amendment to cover it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has served in the Army for a number of years, I think it is only fair to pay tribute to the regular Army for its loyalty during the years 1921 to 1940. It has obeyed loyally the commands given to it by two successive Irish Governments and that is something worthy of our Irish soldiers.  I also want to pay tribute to the Minister in charge of the Army during the last eight or ten years.  I believe he looked after the soldiers faithfully and well and that most of them gave a very good account of the careful way in which he looked after their needs and did everything he could within the regulations to make them comfortable and happy.  It is only fair that this tribute should be paid, especially from the Opposition.  It is not always that a Minister in charge of an army can be decent to the army, as generally there are not enough funds at his disposal to look after their welfare.  The present Minister has done everything possible to give us a peaceful and happy Army, which can look back on happy days and which, I hope, can look forward to a future of happiness also.  I also pay tribute to the L.D.F. for its loyalty during the years of the emergency, for giving faithful service and being prepared to make sacrifices.  They spared no end of time to equip themselves to give a good account of themselves, if necessary.  Therefore, the Army, the L.D.F. and the Minister deserve a tribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied that we can afford at this stage to keep an Army of 12,000 men.  I believe 6,000 or 7,000 well-equipped men in a compact Army would be of more service to our nation.  Everyone knows that, for the last ten or 15 years, we have trained a vast number of young men, rough-trained them and broken them in, to <Col N="2192" /> find they become recruits in foreign armies, so that this is nothing more than a training ground for those other armies to which our men are lured. They give proper and efficient service there, and get ranks, and we know that some of the most bloody fighting on the battlefields of Europe was led by valiant young Irishmen who were trained here.  It is hard on us that we have to do all that training at great expense to the taxpayer and find it is for foreign armies.  That is one aspect of the matter I would like the Minister to look into.  I would rather see a small and compact Army, as I know that at all times we will give a good account of ourselves&mdash;not alone our soldiers, but the wives and children, who will stand loyally to fight and die for faith and fatherland.  That is a tradition handed down, and I hope it will always be so.  At the same time, we need to pay more attention to a compact Air Force, as an Army is useless without an umbrella over it.  I would rather see more money spent on that than on a ground Army.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy spoke in a more militant strain, like one of those who has the memories of the past in his mind still.  We should let the past bury itself.  I went through the past and had bitterness in my heart, but there is no use in having it, there is no use in trailing our coats.  We should remember that we are in 1946.</P>

      <P>Our geographical position is fairly good.  We know where the pot always boils over, and that is in the centre of Europe or in the Balkan countries.  Even if it boils over there in the future, our geographical position is ideal.  We will always be far away from the battlefields of Europe.  We were invaded at one time, but the conqueror failed later and they never tried again.  I do not see much likelihood of this country being brought into any war.  In these circumstances, I do not think there is any need for a strong military force to meet any emergency.  I cannot foresee any great emergency.  Possibly an atomic bomb might alight on us, but we cannot help that.  I cannot see armies landing all over our country over-night.</P>
      <P>The Minister should reconsider this matter and give the farmers, and the people generally, half a chance.  They have carried a huge burden for some years past.  It was really too big a burden; not alone were they carrying the upkeep of the Army, but the farmers had to feed the people as well. If the Minister knew how hard it is on the farmers to till, plough, sow, and mow in all types of weather and carry the huge burden they have had to carry, he would realise that it is not fair to ask them to continue doing so. They are a loyal people, but they should not be asked to carry this huge Army in the future and at the same time feed the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider the establishment of a compact, foundation Army.  I would rather see a better police force, a more mobile, better-trained police force.  The police force <Col N="2194" /> at the present time is getting rather slack and flabby.  I do not think they are doing their duties as well as the R.I.C. did them in the past.  I would rather see more money spent paying a proper police force that would be engaged in more vigorous duties and that would take over more of the type of duty we now expect from the Army. I do not think there is much need for a big Army.  I could understand a few thousand extra police, better equipped, better paid and more mobile.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Dillon and others who spoke here, I think the Minister should cut out Section 13 altogether.  We cannot say that in the real sense of the word these men were deserters.  If I were a young man, I believe I would find myself anxious to go to the battlefields of Europe, not for the love of Britain or America, but purely for the love of adventure.  I always liked the life of a soldier.  I found it a nice life. Adventure is the spice of life to every young man.  I believe most of these men went away purely for adventure, not through hatred of this country, and I do not think they can be accused of cowardice.  We can see the account they have rendered of themselves on different battlefields.  They fought bravely, and many of them died.  Some of them are maimed for life.  We cannot say that they would be guilty of cowardice.</P>
    <P>Let the past bury itself and let us look to the future.  As time goes by, people here will begin to realise that they have a country and a flag.  It takes a long time for people who have had the experience of a revolution to become patriotic and loyal.  I do not believe they will be really loyal to our flag and our Government for at least 50 years.  We are in the transition stage.  We are coming out of a revolutionary period when everything was topsy-turvy.  Half the people do not properly know where they stand.  With the reading of history, the history of comparatively recent times, our people, in my opinion, will be more banded together and more loyal.  Fifteen or 20 years from now I believe you will have no such thing as men deserting and going into other armies, because loyalty to this country will be ingrained in their hearts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2195" /> When you come to think of it, up to recent years nothing was taught to the people but disloyalty.  First of all, they were taught to be disloyal to the British in order to get them out by hook or by crook.  We had to do many things in those days in order to hide our comrades.  That type of feeling is ingrained even in our children and it will take time to get shut of it.  Even in the period after we got the British out, we had to do some conjuring among ourselves, trying to get loyalties to the old Republican Army on one side or the other.  These things were bad for the nation, but now all that has passed.  There is very little prospect of any civil strife in this country.  I think that has gone for ever.  We may have our political tussles here and there, but generally we will all be loyal to our country and our Army, no matter what side we take.  In that respect one side of this House will be as good as the other.</P>
    <P>Times have changed.  Now we must cut our clothes according to our measure.  Our people are not able to afford a big Army and they cannot carry taxation as they have done in recent years.  It is unfair for the Minister to ask this generation to carry 12,000 soldiers on their backs.  Peace in the world will come and it is not fair to ask our people to carry what I consider is an unnecessary burden.  A small foundation Army, well trained and equipped and well paid, will be able to rally in a very short time all the young manhood of Ireland behind it in proper fighting trim.</P>
    <P>This is not a vast country and, from the point of view of military equipment, we are not very advanced.  We are not able to produce a .22 bullet or even a shot-gun cartridge.  It is terrible to think that all the equipment that our soldiers used in past years came from across the water.  All the leather and web equipment, the boots, shot-guns, rifles and everything else, came across.  It shows you how dependent we are on the other side.  You could have 50,000 men, fully trained to the highest pitch, and we could not put a shot-gun cartridge into their hands, <Col N="2196" /> not to mind a shot-gun, were it not for our neighbour across the water.</P>
    <P>That is one of the aspects we should consider.  We are wholly dependent on our nearest neighbour for the equipment of our Army.  Even if they were sour and sulky, they made sure to equip our Army fairly well, because they knew that if &ldquo;Jerry&rdquo; came here we would fight him and, in fighting him, we would be fighting Britain's battle as well, whether we liked it or not.  That is why our men were equipped.  They sent us everything for that purpose&mdash;petrol, rifles and big guns.  With that phase passed, and a chance of our people getting back to a normal, healthy and quiet life, the Minister should cut the Army down by 50 per cent., down at least to 6,000 or 8,000 men.  That would be quite enough for our needs.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister on all that he has done during the period in which he has been in charge of the Army.  I believe he treated the soldiers well.  They like him and I like him for it.  I think he gave them more consideration than some of the men who were over me in the old days here gave their soldiers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of discussion which was initiated by Deputy O'Higgins was, I am afraid, rather slavishly followed by many of the Deputies who followed him.  He rather seemed to suggest, and I think Deputy Mulcahy supported him later on in the suggestion, that there was something mysterious or something extraordinary in respect to Army policy.  There is nothing very extraordinary about Army policy.  I am afraid that Deputy O'Higgins, and perhaps Deputy Mulcahy as well, are mixing up external policy with Army policy.  They want me to dilate on one as against the other.  Well, I do not propose to do that.  All I propose to do is to deal with Army policy in a very simple manner, by saying that the Army policy of to-day is practically the same policy as that which has existed since the Army was established; in other words&mdash;in fact, in the words which Deputy O'Higgins himself used&mdash;to have a small Army, highly trained, a hard core around which other organisations <Col N="2197" /> could be built up and made efficient.</P>
      <P>That is the policy which operates to-day and there is nothing extraordinary about it.  There is nothing to elaborate on.  I cannot elaborate on it anyhow, because the policy is too simple.  If they disagree with me, as they do, in respect of the strength of the Army, that is another matter.  It is a matter upon which we can agree to disagree, if I may be paradoxical. The position in respect of our desire to have an Army of 12,500 men is based on the fact that the pre-war Army, which was a little over the 6,000 mark, was doing 24 hours' guard duty out of 48.  In other words, when we talked about these men being highly trained, highly efficient and highly skilled soldiers, we were not talking facts, for the simple reason that the only skill these men had, with the exception of the skill derived from a short period during the summer when they were brought out for a week's or a fortnight's manoeuvres, was in respect of doing sentry duty on the various posts around the country.</P>
      <P>If we want to get what I presume the former Government were aiming at and what, in my opinion, they failed to secure, but what we are now aiming at and what we hope to secure, we must, so to speak, double the strength of the Army, in order that we may not have that abominable practice of men doing guard duty for the whole period of their army careers.  The only solution is to increase the strength of the Army.  We are doing that, and it is not based on any haphazard methods, as was suggested by Deputy Cogan.  It was done in conference with the Army authorities after careful examination and approved by the Government, also after serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made remarks in respect to the speeches made by members of the present Government when they were in Opposition and he went out of his way to compliment the particular Deputies&mdash;they were then Deputies&mdash;who made those speeches.  He pointed out that they had talked sound commonsense.  Of course, I know that he was using these phrases to suit his own purpose, but what Deputy <Col N="2198" /> O'Higgins fails to realise is that he appears to be living in the past.  The speeches to which he referred were made from 15 to 20 years ago and the country at that time was well out of the period of the Great War.  There was at that time throughout the world a belief that there would not be another world war in that generation, and it may or may not have been reasonable to have made the statements which were then made; but surely Deputy O'Higgins or any other member of the Opposition will not suggest that speeches made 20 years ago are strictly applicable to the situation which exists to-day.  I do not believe for a second that any Deputy opposite will insist on that.</P>
    <P>We are living to-day, unfortunately, in the aftermath of a world war, an aftermath completely and entirely different from that of the previous world war, and we know that every nation in the world is deeply concerned about the possibilities of the future peace of the world.  I think it will be understood, and generally agreed, that the peace which we are enjoying to-day is a very uneasy peace, and I feel that as a Government we are justified in taking the necessary precautions, the precautions which we deem to be necessary, to safeguard, so far as a small nation like ours can, the rights and liberties of our people.  That, in fact, is all we are doing.  That is my answer to the case made by Deputy O'Higgins in respect to the speeches made from 15 to almost 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon in his speech, which savoured much more of a lecture than of a Second Reading speech on this Bill, suggested that if we thought that this Army would be of any use, we were suffering from self-delusion.  I am prepared to back our opinions against Deputy Dillon's.  If we had accepted Deputy Dillon's opinions ten years ago, we would not be growing our own foodstuffs to-day.  We would be trying to depend on foodstuffs brought into this country, as was suggested by a Front Bench member of the Opposition during the emergency, in American bottoms.  Everybody in the House knows as well as I do how frivolous that statement was, and how hopeless <Col N="2199" /> it would have been for this nation to have relied on any foodstuffs which could have been brought into this country during the period of the emergency.</P>
    <P>He also seemed to me to be slipping because when I hear a man talking of the halcyon days of the past and of the glories of the First Battalion, a battalion which existed, I presume, about 20 years ago, and suggesting that the Army of to-day should be built up on the First Battalion, all I can say is that I am afraid he is behind the times.  I imagine that the soldiers of to-day would be rather amused by that suggestion.</P>
    <P>With, I suppose, practically only one exception there has been no criticism of the Bill itself.  It is quite possible that it may come on the Committee Stage, but the only section which has been referred to in a critical way is Section 13.  I regret very much that it was necessary to take the action we had to take in respect of these men who deserted this nation in a period of crisis.  There is no use in saying, as Deputy Dillon suggested, that these men went out to fight and to die, if necessary.  The Deputy pointed to the bravery and courage that that called forth.  Deputy Dillon does not know, any more than I do, whether these men went to join a foreign army or went to England to secure employment.</P>
    <P>The fact is that they deserted this nation, and deserted their comrades in a moment of crisis.  I do not think&mdash; and I say this in all seriousness&mdash;that we did anything that could be regarded as vindictive in bringing in the Emergency Powers Order which was brought in.  Indeed, if these men had been tried by court-martial and dealt with through the medium of courts-martial many of them would have received very severe sentences.  It was not deemed feasible to hold courts-martial on the large number, even if they could be apprehended.  A question would arise as to whether they could be apprehended, or be apprehended for a long period of years.  Pressure was being put on me by Deputies to remove the existing restriction which prevented these men entering this country.  In <Col N="2200" /> deference to the demands which were made that was the only alternative.  We operated that alternative rather than prevent these men returning to this country.  They are not being prevented from earning a living.  That should be clearly understood.  What they are being prevented securing is employment, either under the State or any of the organisations subsidised by the State.  Whatever number of vacancies exist will be held for the men who served this nation loyally.  The others are perfectly entitled to secure work if they can get it on their merits.  I do not think there is anything very drastic in respect to the section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, I am sure unintentionally, made a gross misstatement when he said that a quarter of the Army had deserted.  I do not know on what ground he based that statement. It is certainly an error or a misquotation, because it could not possibly be true.  At his request I gave the Deputy the figures some time ago, and I think they were between 3,000 and 4,000.  I am not quite sure what the figures were, but the strength of the Army was 35,000, so that when the Deputy stated that quarter of the Army had deserted he said something that was not correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on this Bill last week Deputy Ua Donnchadha, gave it his enthusiastic support in the belief that it was going to do something for forestry that had never been attempted before; that, in fact, it was going to give us what we all wished for, a really genuine and determined attempt to bring this country, from the afforestation point of view, somewhat into line with most other European countries.  When the debate adjourned I was trying to find out where Deputy Ua Donnchadha found in this Bill any ground for that belief. I want to say quite frankly that the only feeling one can have is a feeling of deep disappointment.  The Bill is going to do very little for afforestation. It is purely a machinery Bill, and deals mainly with restrictions.  In so far as it is going to have any effect on forestry, I am afraid it is going to have a bad effect, because a considerable portion of the Bill is taken up in giving the Minister power over trees, woods, groves and land which we had hoped would be planted by private individuals. A man who is considering putting a portion of his land under timber&mdash;we know that he is doing something that is not going to bring him any financial reward in his time&mdash;knows before he starts to plant that when those trees come to maturity, he will have no control over them, that wheather he can cut one, ten, 100, or 500, will be determined by the Minister, whoever he may be at the time, or by some official in the Department. I want to remind Deputy Ua Donnchadha and any others who may think that this Bill is going to do something for us, of what the Minister said in his introductory speech.  I think that is the guide to the whole Bill and the guide to the whole policy of the Forestry Department. This is what the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I wish to make it quite clear that it is my view and the view of <Col N="2202" /> the experts who are responsible for the technical control of forestry work that the present scheme of expansion is adequate and is best suited to meet the country's needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister, or from somebody, what is meant by &ldquo;the present scheme of expansion&rdquo;. At what rate are we expanding in afforestation or re-afforestation?  We are told that it is adequate to meet the country's needs.  Have the country's needs from the timber point of view been assessed?  If so, when and how, and what are the needs?  I must say that that statement in the Minister's speech conveys to me that there is going to be no real attempt made to put this country in the position that i should be put into with regard to re-afforestation.</P>
    <P>For a long number of years most people in this country looked upon the planting of this country as one of the biggest problems we should be facing. It was regarded as one of the most important things that we would tackle when we got our liberty and our government.  That was stressed not only by all Parties but by individuals and citizens outside who take a deep interest in the matter.  The necessity for it was so well known that there was hardly any need to stress it but it was stressed from the point of view of its effect upon our climate, from the point of view of the valuable employment it would create and from the point of view of scenic value.  After 25 years of native government, we have a Forestry Bill introduced that, undoubtedly, has been prepared after a lot of consideration, a good deal of work and a good deal of thought but, so far as I can see, the effect it will have on planting in this country will certainly not be appreciable.</P>
    <P>I again stress that the policy of the Forestry Department and of the Minister in relation to this matter is summed up in these two sentences, that they are satisfied that the present rate of expansion is adequate and is best suited to meet the country's needs. This happens to be a matter of which I have some practical knowledge and practical experience.  I say that the present rate of expansion as it is called, <Col N="2203" /> so far as we know it, so far as we can get proof of it, would not, in the next 30 years, compensate for the effect of the two wars, would not replace the timber that was removed during the 1914-18 war and the timber that was removed during the last six or seven years, much less make any advance on that position.</P>
    <P>If this House is going to be satisfied with a forestry programme such as is before us&mdash;if I may describe it as a forestry programme at all&mdash;then we will not see any impression made on the position in regard to that matter during our time.  I am rather surprised at the present Minister that he is not showing that imagination in dealing with this problem that I had expected from him.  I do not mean imagination in the ordinary sense of the word.  I do know that the Minister is interested in this matter.  I do know that the Minister probably realises our needs in regard to timber as well as, if not better than, most members of this House, and I do know that, if he makes up his mind to face a problem, he can face it.</P>
    <P>With regard to our needs, we have at the moment in this country, I might say, no commercial timber at all, good, bad or indifferent, or the commercial timber that is left is not worth talking about.  The soft timber that is left in this country is merely warped, knotty, scrubby, fir and spruce, and so on, that was not worth the cost of cutting it down and has no commercial value whatever.  A great deal, if not the vast bulk, of the hard-woods left in this country has no commercial value and is fit merely for firing.  Does not that show a tremendous need?  Does not that show a great urgency about this problem?  We know to-day that not only have we no commercial timber of our own, not only have we no timber for housing, furniture, farm work or anything else, but we have very little hope or prospect of getting in commercial timber from outside.  Bad as the position was during the emergency, bad as it is now and is likely to remain for some considerable time, can anyone visualise what it will be in 30 or 40 years' time, if we should have to go through another period such as <Col N="2204" /> we have experienced during the last six or seven years?  We have to face the fact that at the moment we are not able to build a house because we have not the timber to do it.  Within the last week I was talking to a building contractor in this city, a man who was certainly not losing very much time.  He has 12 houses built; he has them roofed, but he cannot get sufficient timber to finish them&mdash;and we know the famine there is in regard to houses.  I do not want to labour this thing too much.  I do not want to take up the time of the House unduly.  I do not want to be repeating myself.  There is hardly a person in this country who has given any thought to the matter, there is certainly not a farmer in this House, who will say that we can overrate the value of afforestation so far as our climate is concerned, so far as our land is concerned. We cannot.  I am continually met by people who say that trees will not grow in certain places.  We used to be told by the Department of Forestry that it was not economic to plant less than 200 acres, that that was the absolute minimum.  That is all bosh.  You cannot regard a national reafforestation scheme on a purely economic basis, on a purely cash basis.  Its value cannot be measured in cash.  Whatever the cost of it may be, in my opinion it is essential for this country that we should go in for planting on the biggest scale which is within our means.</P>
    <P>With regard to getting suitable land on which to plant trees, I know that in my own county there are huge areas, huge in the sense of such woods as we had in this country, that were cleared of trees.  I was at the clearing of some of them myself.  They grew some of the finest commercial timber ever grown in this country.  In addition to these, there is right along these hillsides land fit to grow trees of similar commercial value which is practically of no value for any purpose except for planting.  That land is lying there, and nothing is contemplated with regard to it.  It may be a sort of hobby of mine, but I think most people who have given any thought to this matter, or who are as much interested in it as I am, appreciate the value to the <Col N="2205" /> country from every point of view of afforestation.  For that reason, I am not only disappointed, but surprised, that the Minister has not given us a Bill which would show us that there is at least a desire and a will to improve greatly on anything done up to date with regard to forestry.  What disappoints me completely is to be told that the Minister and the experts are quite satisfied that the present rate of expansion is adequate and suited to the needs of the country.  I cannot accept that.  I think the Minister will find it very hard to convince the House or the country that the present rate of expansion, as it is called, will in any way meet the problem or solve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can claim to be as great an expert with regard to timber as Deputy Morrissey, but I represent a constituency in which afforestation has been pressed forward perhaps more than in any other constituency in this State.  Notwithstanding the fact that the planting of timber has been carried on so extensively in County Wicklow, I think there is room for very much further expansion, particularly in the western parts of the county where only comparatively little has been done.  When we consider that there are many other counties with a great deal of land just as suitable for plantation as County Wicklow, which has hardly been touched at all, we must be disappointed with the Minister's statement and with his outline of the very modest programme which he has in view for the future.</P>
      <P>There is hardly need to stress the advantages which would be conferred on this country by the expansion of the area under timber to something in relation to our national needs.  We are embarking on a big building programme for which we have very little timber available.  So far as any ordinary layman can foresee, timber is likely to be an essential requirement in building for many years to come.  It is also likely to be the basic raw material for many important industries which are now only in their infancy.  It should be the policy of the Government and this House to step up production as rapidly as possible so as to meet our national needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2206" /> In introducing the Bill, the Minister gave a fairly comprehensive survey of his policy and of the provisions of the Bill.  I have often wondered, however, why it is that the Minister has never submitted to this House a clear-cut statement of the costs of production of timber and of the value per acre of the land put under plantation.  I think that is absolutely essential if we are to embark on an expansionist programme. We must know the actual expense of planting and producing every acre of timber, when that timber will be ready for use, and what its value is likely to be then.  Such a calculation is absolutely necessary, because we are always faced with the comparative value of land for agricultural purposes as against plantation.  We have always to consider in regard to our hillsides the value of the land for sheep grazing and such purposes in comparison with its value for afforestation.  We must know exactly what the value of the land is for afforestation in order to make a comparison, because it is in that way we must be guided in regard to our programme.  We know that timber is very essential, but we also know that mutton and wool are very important national needs.</P>
    <P>We should also have from the Minister some information as to the extent to which research is being carried on in order to see how far waste land, which is perhaps at present considered unsuitable for planting, might be brought into production.  The higher altitudes on some of our mountains are not considered suitable for planting. There is also an area of waterlogged land which, up to the present, has been found unsuitable.  We should find out by intensive research if there are varieties of timber adaptable to land of that kind.  We should find out also if it is possible by a system of drainage to drain some of our boglands for afforestation purposes.  Not only should we be guided by what has become the orthodox policy of the Forestry Department, but I think the Minister, as a new Minister in this Department, should consider the adoption of new lines.  Up to the present, it has been the policy of the Department to concentrate upon large areas <Col N="2207" /> for planting.  It is considered, of course, more economic to plant a large area than a smaller area, but I think that eventually we will be forced to adopt an entirely different policy, that we will be forced to adopt a policy of planting what would be considered at the present time very small areas. Anyone who travels through the country must be aware of the fact that you frequently come across areas of comparatively waste land, which may not exceed five, 10 or 15 acres; that you will have steep inclines which are not suitable for grazing, or not very productive, at any rate, as grazing lands, but which, if put under plantation, would not only give a good return but would add to the scenic beauty of the countryside.  Those areas are to be found scattered here and there throughout every county, and I think that the Forestry Department must face up to the task of putting such smaller areas under plantation.</P>
    <P>I know that there is a provision under which farmers are given grants to encourage them to put small areas of their land under trees, but when we consider the matter from a realistic point of view, I think we will find that those grants are not being availed of to a very great extent.  I should like to have some information from the Minister as to the extent to which those grants are being availed of, and the area that has been planted as a result of the grants.  It seems to me that very little use has been made of those grants in relation to the areas involved, but I can see very good reasons why the grants have not been availed of. First of all, planting is a very long-term proposition.  The man who plants a tree to-day can hardly expect to see the harvest reaped in his own lifetime. We must also realise that the spirit of the age has changed very much from what it was three or four hundred years ago ago.  Three or four hundred years ago we had very big land-owners in this country, and we had the feudal system in full course at that time.  Those men looked forward to seeing their lands continuing in the possession of their families and their descendants for hundreds of years to come.  That outlook, I think, has changed completely. We are living, perhaps, in a different <Col N="2208" /> age: an age of mass production and mass consumption.  If some manufacturer were to put on the market to-day pre-fabricated trees, I suppose he would be able to sell them like hot cakes, but if it is a question of trying to induce even well-to-do people to put down trees to any great extent, I think you are up against a very difficult proposition. At the present time, we are faced with the problem, not of providing for generations to come, but of providing for our immediate needs.  That may be a deplorable spirit, but it is the spirit of the age, and it is not confined to this country, but is a worldwide tendency.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the destruction of the feudal system may have had something to do with that, or perhaps it is due to other causes; but apart from those considerations we must also remember that the man who plants trees is not embarking on a very remunerative business proposition, even taking the long view, or even taking the view of providing for his family and his descendants, because recent history has shown us that in a time of emergency the State takes almost complete control of all existing resources in the country, and, as I think Deputy Morrissey suggested, the man with imagination enough to see himself enjoying the shade of a tree which he has planted, or to see himself, in the person of his grandson or great-grandson, enjoying the shade of that tree, must realise that when his grandson or great-grandson comes to manhood, it may be found that that tree has been ruthlessly cut down by the State, confiscated in the national interest, because the State, perhaps necessarily, may have had to take such complete control over our timber resources, as the State had to do during the recent emergency.</P>
    <P>That being so, I think it is idle to expect any wide extension of afforestation from private enterprise, even though assisted by such grants as are being provided.  Therefore, I think we have to fall back on the alternative that the Forestry Department must be prepared to consider the planting of smaller areas than they have considered up to the present.  I think that the main problem in regard to the <Col N="2209" /> planting of smaller areas is the problem of fancing.  I admit that that is a difficult problem, but it is a problem that is capable of being solved, provided that we get down to it in a businesslike way.</P>
    <P>In addition to what the Forestry Department may be able to do directly itself, it might be possible to make provision for the expansion of small-sized woodlands by encouraging local bodies to go in for planting such areas.  A local body&mdash;whether a parish council, a county council, an urban council, or any local association of any kind: even a voluntary association&mdash;can take a longer view than a businessman might be inclined to take, and I suggest that such a local council or body might be tempted to embark on a policy of planting small-sized woodlands in the local areas, provided that assistance was given by the Forestry Department; and that assistance would require to be, not only financial assistance, but assistance in regard to the matter of the acquisition and development of the land for which the Forestry Department has sought fairly wide and extensive powers.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to the powers which the Minister demands for his Department, I think, first of all, that it is a matter for satisfaction that the Minister has departed from the ceiling which was fixed for the value of land to be acquired.  I think it is a matter of satisfaction that lands are to be acquired at their market value, and I hope that in that connection justice will be done to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another very important issue which is raised in one section of this Bill, and that is in regard to rights of way.  That, of course, is a very thorny question in all rural areas, and I suppose that the Minister has found it to be a thorny question so far as the administration of afforestation is concerned.  We know that a good deal of lands which have been acquired in the past, or that will be acquired in the future, for planting, are cut off from the public road by farms and agricultural holdings.  That is only natural.  Since the Forestry Department will be acquiring hills or hillsides, or pieces of land of that kind, <Col N="2210" /> it will be found that farms or agricultural lands will in most cases lie between those hills or hillsides and the public road.  For that reason, I am sure that the Minister has found difficulty in gaining access to the lands which he acquires, but in seeking very far-reaching compulsory powers, I think it is necessary that the interests of landholders should be adequately safeguarded because, while I believe that justice will, in all likelihood, be done in regard to the acquisition of land, it is not equally as certain that justice will be done in regard to the acquisition of rights of way.</P>
    <P>There may be a tendency on the part of any tribunal which has to assess compensation for rights of way to underestimate the damage or loss caused by those rights being acquired.  This problem would arise to a considerable extent in Wicklow, because, in Wicklow, we have quite a number of woods which are reaching maturity and which may be harvested&mdash;if that is the correct word &mdash;in the near future.  It will be necessary to haul the timber across the agricultural lands.  The Bill provides for temporary rights of way over those lands.  Owing to the nature of the loads which will have to be carried and owing to the nature of the land, which will be hilly, it may be necessary to cross the fields rather than keep close to the fences, so as to avoid steep inclines.  Considerable damage may be done to those lands from the time that haulage gets under way. The full implications of such damage should be taken into consideration by any tribunal which may be set up.</P>
    <P>Again, I expect that the laneways to farmers' houses will be used by the Forestry Department in order to get to their lands.  The rights of way may extend to the farmers' yardway and haggards, which will constitute a serious infringement of the private rights of humble and poor people in many cases.  The people concerned may have had to struggle to live in some of those backward areas and to carry on their little industry.  They may be living a mile or two miles from the public roadway.  Their one advantage <Col N="2211" /> up to the present was that they were, to a great extent, free from molestation and interference.  There was little damage to their stock from road traffic.  They were not even visited by the travelling fraternity&mdash; tinkers and tramps.  Now, their privacy is to be seriously disturbed. Their laneways and, perhaps, their yardways will become thoroughfares for this national concern.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate fully the amount of injury that will be caused to those people.  It is a matter which will have to be considered very sympathetically. I am not taking up an obstructionist attitude with regard to this Bill.  We all realise the necessity for putting lands which are suitable under plantation.  Having put those lands under plantation, we all realise that it is necessary the Department should have access to them.  But the interests of the small landholders adjoining will have to be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill gives the Minister power to go in upon agricultural holdings to destroy rabbits and vermin.  This section is in some respects comparable with a certain section of the Public Health Bill, which will be under consideration shortly.  It takes very wide powers in regard to private property.  That may be necessary but it could constitute a very grave injustice.  I should like the Minister to tell us if there is a corresponding provision in the Bill which would enable farmers on lands adjoining plantations to go in on those lands of the Forestry Department and destroy vermin which are injurious to their farms.  If the Forestry Department claim the right to trespass upon the lands of the farmers so as to protect their plantations, the farmers should have an equal right to go in upon forestry lands so as to protect their property.  In many areas in Wicklow we have an absolute plague of foxes which are nourished and protected on the lands of the Forestry Department. They are sheltered and protected there and, so far as I know&mdash;I have made inquiries&mdash;the Forestry Department does not accept any responsibility for the <Col N="2212" /> damage done to the poultry of the farmers by those animals.  The poultry industry is a very important one.  In matters of this kind, the State should regard itself as being on an equal footing with the ordinary private individual and should not claim rights which it is not prepared to give to the ordinary individual.</P>
    <P>There is another section of this Bill which is, I think, appropriate to this particular month.  That is the section which empowers the Minister to authorise the owner or occupier of land to destroy during a period not exceeding six months hares, the presence of which on the land is a source of potential damage to trees or plants. That seems to be a rather peculiar section in one way, inasmuch as it empowers the Minister &ldquo;to authorise the owner&rdquo;.  I do not know what that really means.  Does it empower the Minister to compel the owner to destroy these hares, and if it does, how does the Minister propose that the farmer should set about that task?  The section further provides that if the farmer fails to carry out this rather difficult operation, the Minister will send his agents in on the farmer's lands to catch the hares.  This, I think, raises a rather important question, because farmers generally have always regarded hares as probably the least harmful of wild animals.  We have also to bear in mind the fact that they may be of considerable value.  I can foresee very serious implications and difficulties arising if the Minister's agents go in upon private lands and proceed to round up and destroy hares which are being preserved perhaps for a coursing match the following week.  I think that, in a matter of that kind, the Bill should contain certain provisions in regard to sporting rights and amenities in the countryside.  As pointed out, the Minister has been sheltering in his plantations animals which are very destructive to the farming industry, and I do not think he should claim such drastic powers to exterminate game which are certainly very useful and desirable as far as the sporting community are concerned.</P>

      <P>There is one other section with which I should like to deal briefly.  In this Bill, as in practically every other Bill which has been introduced recently, provision is made for the setting up of a consultative committee. I have no objection to that except to say that these consultative committees or councils seem to be very popular with Ministers recently and it strikes me that Ministers, while they may derive a certain value from such bodies, also appreciate the fact that such bodies provide a certain amount of cover for Ministers.  The consultative council is a kind of barrier behind which the Minister can retire when opposition to his actions becomes vocal. I, however, have no objection to a consultative council on that ground.  I think the main objection to the Bill is that we have got no indication from the Minister of definite advances of or a real desire to advance in regard to afforestation.  We want a much bigger expansion of the area under timber than the Minister appeared to be able to contemplate at the present time. When we compare the wooded vales of Wicklow with the bare barren landscapes in some of the western counties, we realise what an improvement, not only in the economic resources of the country but also in its scenic beauty, would be brought about if we could get other counties even up to the standard which has been reached in Wicklow.  I think that we should not put this matter on the long finger.  We should aim at a policy of making our country self-supporting in regard to timber supplies within a reasonable period. We should aim at a policy which will ensure that when our woodlands come to maturity, there will never again arise a position in which we shall be so deficient in timber supplies as we have been during the recent emergency.</P>

      <P>I do not look upon this as a Forestry Bill at all.  To my mind, it is just a Bill for clearing the road and I cannot look at it in any other way.  There are no proposals in it in regard to the go-ahead policy which we expected to hear from the Department. Neither can I see in it all the pit-falls of which we heard for the last half-hour from Deputy Cogan.  The <Col N="2214" /> Deputy's speech reminded me of the prophecy of Jeremiah&mdash;wail after wail and moan after moan.  I do not think that the Bill is really as bad as all that.  I should like in the first place to remind the House that trees which are going to be planted this year will not be put into a house next year. Everyone knows that we shall have to wait 40 years for the trees to mature and in 40 years' time we may not require any timber at all for housing. I think that what we have to discuss on this Bill is not what is in the Bill but what we think should be in it.  The Bill is only a clearing of the road, which is rather necessary, as you cannot start to build a house until you prepare the foundations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many enthusiasts about timber in this country and if I had some of them on a farm I happened to buy some years ago and had to plough, I would give them a nice job.  We had to carry an axe around on the plough, to cut the roots as we came to them.  That was on good land, which should never have seen a tree at all.  I would like to see some proposals in this Bill to induce farmers to plant at least an acre per farm as a shelter belt or as trees around houses. That would get us somewhere, if done as an inducement and not by compulsion, and would improve the landscape immensely.  There is no use in talking about planting big areas at present.  All over the country there are glens which would grow better trees than one could grow anywhere else.  Let them be planted first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Cogan's statement about local authorities, does he not think they have to do enough? Does he want a rate of 4d. or 5d. in the £ clamped down on them by the Department of Local Government and have them put to planting trees?  Does he not think the Government Departments have put enough on to the ratepayers, without making them woodsmen as well?  If we are to go ahead in this matter, let us have a definite settled policy in regard to the area of State land to be taken over and how <Col N="2215" /> many thousand acres per year of those lands will be planted and in regard to proposals for planting by private individuals. I must admit Deputy Cogan is right, that the private individual has very little interest in this.  The ordinary farmer is not going to plant trees so that his son can sit down under them.  I would like also to see a definite proposal&mdash;a £10 Vote would cover it&mdash;to give some definite inducement to the farmer to plant trees, as he has very little interest in it at present. If he has trees to-day fit for cutting, he will not be let cut them to keep the fire lighting or to repair his own house.  There are many rules and regulations governing timber to-day which will, perhaps, be necessary in the future and, under all the circumstances the private planter is faced with, I think it is purely a State job to induce him to plant sufficient timber, in shelter belts and otherwise.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Forestry Department on their work.  One thing they have done completely knocks the bottom out of Deputy Morrissey's argument about the cutting of timber during the war.  I do not think any timber was cut during the past six years except under a re-planting clause, which compelled the man who cut timber to put in at least four or five or a dozen trees for the one he cut.  So I cannot see Deputy Morrissey's argument about the number of years it will take the Forestry Department to make up for the timber cut during the late war&mdash;whatever about the war before that.  That was a very wise provision by the Department.  It is a provision that has to be used with commonsense.  In some cases, it is imposed on land that should never have been planted&mdash;good tillage land.  If we are to go ahead with forestry as it should be done, we must plant small areas or induce people to plant them. That will give them some interest in the safety of the plantations.  One cannot expect the Forestry Department to take ten acres here and 20 acres there, as that will call for fencing and care and protection afterwards, and it will not pay them.  The only man it will pay to protect such woods is the farmer on whose lands they are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2216" /> When planting small areas, we must work on that basis and that basis only.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have to be followed with some definite proposals in regard to future plantations.  Anyone travelling around the country at present can see hundreds of acres, good for nothing else but plantation, spots that were once beauty spots, now cleared out and left barren.  I would be anxious to see definite proposals in this Bill, which are not in it at present, regarding, first of all, planting by the Forestry Department and, secondly, by the private individual.  Unless there is some inducement to the private landowner, we cannot go ahead with forestry as we wish to do in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very hard to disguise, among people who have any interest in this subject, a feeling of more than usual disappointment at the emptiness, the complete barrenness, of this measure, which is just little more than a measure to tidy up the legislation dealing with forestry in this country.  Deputy Corry has, in that agile way that he is a master of, described it as a Bill to clear the way for forestry.  That certainly is a very optimistic view to take of a measure of this kind.  The bald fact is that there has been a paralysis officially over the whole question of forestry for a great many years and that even people who have been most enthusiastic in denouncing the policy have become infected in the same way and stand now for continuing it.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the whole position now becomes much more urgent than it was before, in, view of what has happened during the emergency.  It is an unfortunate thing, it is a national desecration, that trees had to be cut down to the extent that they were cut, but obviously that was quite necessary.  In connection with the provision for re-planting, I hope that will not be just a vague sort of thing extended over a number of years, but at least will be given effect to within a reasonably short time after the trees have been removed.  I think long delay in this matter, and the possibility of the long delay being utilised for the purpose of enabling a colder view to be taken of it, would be dangerous generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2217" /> I think the position can be quite easily understood when one considers the total aim of the Department in regard to forestry, which is ultimately to have planted 700,000 acres of land. As far back as 1908 a British commission in this country, which was presided over by the late Mr. T.P. Gill, recommended the planting of 1,000,000 acres of land.  Going into the progress made in the years since a Forestry Department was set up in the country, it would seem to me that it will take considerably over 100 years to have this policy of securing 700,000 acres of land under trees realised, so that the Minister and all of us here will have long passed from any active consideration of this question, and many of the trees that will be put down during the next 15 or 20 years will have long disappeared before this aim of tree planting is achieved.  Surely, it is a tragic waste of a great national opportunity?</P>
    <P>The Minister's constituency in North Cork, and my own constituency in West Cork, provide two of the finest examples of complete failure in this matter that it would be possible to find in any part of the country.  There were two or three plantations in North Cork and two or three in West Cork, and some others that were, in fact, established&mdash;there was at least one&mdash;before an Irish Government was put into office, and they represented 25 years' work and development.  In every town and village in North and West Cork we have people signing day after day at the labour exchanges in order to get some public assistance, public charity&mdash; because that is really what it comes to &mdash;and we have not the courage, because of official obstacles, because of pettifogging delays, to take these people and put them to valuable work of this kind.  The people who have been enthusiastic in his matter, who have been pioneers in it, when they got close to officialdom became as silent as their predecessors, and the whole policy of forestry has been a frozen policy from 1922 onwards.</P>
    <P>I suggest this measure will be of no value in regard to early development in forestry.  It is not tidy legislation we want, or a consolidation of Acts of Parliament.  We want a forward and <Col N="2218" /> vigorous policy in forestry, one that will enable our people to earn wages, that will enable the country to be beautified, that will enable the ravages of the emergency years and years of official neglect to be repaired, and that will be some asset in giving dignity to workmen who are now the recipients of State charity.  That is my plea for forestry, and, during the life of the present Government and of their predecessors, I never had the least patience with the innumerable obstacles that have been put in the way of a policy of this kind.  Perhaps it may all be attributed to my own ignorance, my lack of knowledge of the difficulties, but there is nothing easier than to find difficulties when there is no enthusiasm about a policy of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister has anticipated, in his explanatory statement, a number of the objections that would be raised on this Bill.  His explanatory memorandum goes to show that there is at least some misgiving as to whether the viewpoint expressed in the Bill and the viewpoint held by the Forestry Department are at all popular in the country. I suggest they are not, and if the target set by the Department of 700,000 acres under trees is going to take 135 years to realise, then we are not serious in talking about this matter, and any question of clearing the road, as Deputy Corry suggested, does not arise, because there is no road to be cleared, no road on which we will be travelling in this Bill or in any of the efforts made up to the present.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope some change will be effected in this policy and that we will find some alternative to the arguments I have heard so often, that certain types of trees are not suitable in certain areas.  May I suggest that it would be good business for the State to plant any kind of timber and enable people to get employment and wages out of it than to permit the present conditions to continue?  Probably these may be described as the remarks of an ignorant amateur, a man who knows nothing about this subject, but at least I can congratulate myself on one thing, and that is, that I have preserved over 21 years some fragment of the enthusiasm that I had on the subject, and I <Col N="2219" /> regret that there are many people who have lost whatever enthusiasm or interest they had in the subject.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a sad indictment of the present lack of forestry policy and, in my opinion, it represents no advance such as we should have at the present time.  I hope this policy will be changed and, before this Bill finally leaves the House, I hope the members of all Parties will express what I believe is really in the minds of many of them, that no progress has been made in this matter and that a great national opportunity for employment and for beautifying the country and doing many other things is being lost, as it has been lost during the years gone by.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not go quite so far as Deputy Murphy when he says that there has been no progress in the reafforestation of this country.  Some progress has been made, however tardy it may have been.  I am, like other Deputies, disappointed with the Bill.  I thought it would indicate some more thoroughgoing policy than has been pursued by the Minister and his Department for years past and, after the lessons of the past six years, I thought surely that the Minister would have taken his courage in his hands and would have made provision for a more forward move in the future.  I think we will have to depend more and more on our own timber resources for the future.  That is one lesson we have learned from the war and, judging by the present condition of affairs in the world, it looks as if supplies from outside sources will be closed to us to a certain extent.</P>
      <P>We never know when we may find ourselves in the throes of another war. I sincerely hope it will not take place, but certainly anybody studying conditions in the world to-day cannot but come to the conclusion that war is quite likely some time in the future. I hope it is a long way off, but in any event the Minister should have envisaged the circumstances that will arise if we do find ourselves confronted with another emergency, and when framing this Bill, should have made provision for our future requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2220" /> The Minister candidly and frankly admitted in his introductory speech that this is the worst wooded country in the world.  As a matter of fact, I saw it stated somewhere some years ago that the percentage of our woodland to other land is only about 1.7&mdash;the lowest of any country in Europe. Despite this, the Minister said that the policy he is pursuing at the moment is the only policy which is suited to the needs and requirements of this country. I think the Minister said that the rate of progress on reafforestation here is about 6,000 acres per year in recent years&mdash;in the earlier years, the acreage was much lower.  I do not know at the moment how many acres have been dealt with since the Forestry Commission started.  I have a hazy recollection of reading somewhere that about 100,000 odd acres have been planted, but in 1920 an estimate was made by a foreign expert that there were about 791,000 acres of waste land suitable for planting, with a chance of direct monetary profit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry or some other Deputy mentioned that the total forestry requirements of the country are about 700,000 acres, that we want to get 700,000 acres planted to be reasonably secure in the matter of timber supplies. I do not know whether the Minister has made an estimate of the area of waste land available for planting, but I do not imagine such an estimate has been made, at least from the forestry point of view.  He probably would be able to find from the records of the Land Commission the actual acreage of waste land, but he would not be in a position to say what proportion of it was suitable for planting.  That, however, is the estimate made by a foreign expert who travelled all over the country and went to great pains to ensure that his estimate was accurate in every detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The forestry service has expanded its activities in extent and were it not for the recent war the service would by now probably have come close to attaining the rate of annual growth which is believed by the experts to be the desirable aim for this country's needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2221" /> One can only read into that statement that his experts have standardised the rate of planting for each year; in other words, they aim at getting a certain number of acres planted each year, and, if they get that number, they are quite satisfied.  But it seems to me that the aim of the Minister and the Department should be to continue expanding each year and to ensure that each year a greater number of acres are planted than the year before.</P>
    <P>The Minister then proceeded to have a tilt at the enthusiasts, as he calls them, &ldquo;whose zeal for more rapid restoration of Irish woodlands refuses to be trammelled by practical considerations&rdquo;, but the enthusiasts at whom the Minister goes out of his way to have a tilt were responsible in the first instance for the establishment of the Forestry Commission and responsible, to some extent at all events, for the progress made in the reafforestation of this country.  It may be that, in their enthusiasm, they did not always take into consideration the practical considerations involved in reafforestation, but they at all events kept up their propaganda and it is largely due to their propaganda that we are in the position in which we are to-day, however backward it may be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to the Minister's statement that the present scheme of afforestation is adequate for the needs of the country.  Like Deputy Morrissey, I do not know exactly what the Minister means by that statement.  If the Minister means that the present scheme of reafforestation, if carried to its full development, will be capable of supplying the entire commercial needs of the country, I doubt it very much.  As a matter of fact, I do not see that it would be capable of supplying all the commercial needs of the country because the Minister has limited himself to £4 per acre in the purchase of land for reafforestation purposes.  That is the maximum he will pay for land for reafforestation purposes. Surely the Minister, if he is to get land suitable for the production of the best class of timber, will have to pay much more than that for land.</P>
    <P>I understand that the average price paid by the Forestry Department for <Col N="2222" /> land is somewhere between 30/- and 50/- per acre, and the Minister said that if a greater sum than £4 were paid for land, it would upset the economics of these forestry schemes. In any event, I want to emphasise again that if reafforestation is to be carried out successfully, we should aim at producing all classes and kinds of commercial timber, and the Minister should not allow himself to be hampered, too much at all events, by financial restrictions.  He should take his courage in his hands, and, if necessary, pay a higher price for land for the purpose of producing the best quality of commercial timber.  I do not believe the Dáil would have any hesitation in giving him sanction to spend money, and to spend a great deal of money, for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill for the setting up of a consultative committee. I approve of that step.  I think a consultative committee can do an enormous lot of good, and, provided it is composed of the right class of people, will be of considerable help and assistance to the Minister.  I suggest to the Minister, however, that he should appoint a foreign forestry expert as a member of that committee, if he can get such an expert at present, and I imagine that, if he is anxious to secure such a person, he will have no difficulty in getting him.  It will cost money, but I imagine it would be money very well spent.  I do not believe for a moment that we have all the expert knowledge we require so far as forestry development is concerned in this country. I believe it is necessary to increase that knowledge, or, if you like, to reinforce it, by the knowledge of experts from other countries, and the Minister would be very well advised in the interests of the country to appoint some foreign experts as members of the consultative committee.  Their experience in other countries would be invaluable, as I am sure they would be able to give the Minister's experts assistance which would redound to the advantage of this country.</P>
    <P>I realise very well that, as far as the acquisition of land is concerned, the Minister will be confronted with many difficulties, as he will have to take into consideration our agricultural <Col N="2223" /> needs.  There are certain sections in the Bill which, to a certain extent, prohibit him taking land if it is suitable for agricultural purposes, as well as land belonging to local authorities and holdings in the neighbourhood of mines.  In that way the Minister is limited in his selection.  Even within these limitations there is a good deal of land that could be acquired.  If it is to be acquired the Minister will certainly have to pay higher compensation than that mentioned in his statement, a maximum sum of £4 an acre. I make no apology for returning to that question, as it is very important that at this stage, and in present circumstances, the Minister should not allow £4 to be the maximum.  He should be prepared to pay higher compensation where it is necessary to secure better class land for the production of timber of higher quality and value.  After all, if the aim in our forestry policy is to produce timber for the requirements of this country, the Minister must not limit himself as to the class or quality of land that he must secure, or the price that he is to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister must be facilitated in regard to haulage facilities, if mature timber is to be taken from existing plantations.  The arrangement in such cases should be mutual.  I had experience in recent years of trouble with the forestry section, inasmuch as the Minister was reluctant to allow people to bring turbary to their homes through a plantation. I know perfectly well that the Minister has had rather sad experience, and that plantations were damaged through the carelessness, in many instances, of people working on bogs.  In all cases where the Minister gets a guarantee that proper care will be exercised, and that plantations will not be damaged, I think he should see that people who have to pass through them are facilitated.  In the case I was interested in, the people were facilitated on the distinct understanding that they would not again approach the Department for similar facilities. That bog was at the far end of the plantation, and while people have to go to it for turf, they will have to <Col N="2224" /> continue asking the Department for permission to pass through it.</P>
    <P>The Minister in that case got a guarantee from the senior men engaged in turf cutting that they would exercise special care, so that the plantation would not be damaged.  There are instances where the Minister will have to take into consideration special circumstances of that kind.  I am not worried by Deputy Cogan's statement that these people would not be compensated for the trouble and inconvenience they are likely to suffer.  I am sure the Land Commission will give them fair compensation. I know instances where the Minister had to get certain facilities, and those who gave them were adequately compensated.</P>

      <P>It is not often that I find myself in agreement with Deputy Corry, but if we are to expand the forestry area with a reasonable degree of rapidity we should concentrate more on the work of private individuals. More encouragement should be held out to private landowners to plant trees, even though it means increasing the amount of compensation at present being paid.  The Minister will have to take steps to encourage planting by private individuals if any worthwhile impression is to be made on forestry. I suggest to him that, perhaps by propaganda and through the efforts of officials of the Land Commission, more people could be induced to embark on the planting of trees and to devote some land to that purpose.  Certain small portions of many farms could very properly be devoted to the planting of trees.  That is one way in which we could hasten a solution of the forestry problem and, for that reason, I suggest to the Minister that it is worth while to give that aspect consideration. I believe he will find that if there is the right class of propaganda, and if the right class of people are approached, good results will be obtained.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies who spoke in this debate do not appear to <Col N="2225" /> be satisfied that the Minister indicated the progress he intends to make with forestry in the future.  Deputy Corry stated that the Bill was one to clear the way for such work.  I agree with that.  While the Minister may not have stated the exact amount of work that he intends to have done in the future, I maintain that he has put no limit on the amount of work that the Department can do.  I stress this point, that it is of the greatest importance that the Minister should keep in mind the type of timber to be planted, particularly timber with a commercial value. There is no doubt that for the past six years there has been a very heavy demand for timber of a commercial type.  I think that from the commercial point of view, Irish timber has <Col N="2226" /> stood up to that demand very well. Deputy Morrissey quoted the case of a contractor in the City of Dublin who had erected and roofed 12 houses and then could not proceed any further with the work.  Speaking from practical experience, I think that contractor got on very well, because the amount of timber he would require to finish the houses is of such a nature that it may take time to secure it.  It depends on the particular timber merchant he was dealing with in Dublin. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
